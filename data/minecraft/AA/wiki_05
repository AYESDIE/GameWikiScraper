Upon death or return from &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; dimension, the player respawns within this area unless the player's &lt;a href=\"%23Individual%20spawn\"&gt;individual spawn point&lt;/a&gt; changed (by using a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;, or the command).\nThis area is 21\u00d721 blocks by default or 5\u00d75 , but can be changed by the gamerule in both single and multiplayer.\nWhen set to 0, the player spawns in the crosshair of four blocks. When set to 1, the player always spawns on the northwest of those four blocks. The maximum spawn radius is 99999999 but when rejoining the world, it resets to 128. However, on the discontinued \"&lt;a href=\"Old\"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt;\" world type, the maximum spawn radius is 256 instead.\nWhen the player first loads into the world or respawns, the game searches within the world spawn area and tries to place the player on a random &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;. Upon spawning, the player is placed on the highest valid spawn point block of the X and Z spawn coordinates, even if this would set the player above the maximum build height. However, if there are no valid spawn points but a grass block that was determined to be an invalid spawn point due to being blocked by a block above it (though the grass block would decay soon after), the game checks the closest two free spaces from below and the player spawns there. If there are absolutely no grass blocks, the player spawns directly at the world spawn point, which can even result in players spawning above &lt;a href=\"the%20Void\"&gt;the Void&lt;/a&gt; if there are no blocks at that location. \nThe world spawn point also determines the center of the permanently loaded &lt;a href=\"spawn%20chunk\"&gt;spawn chunk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe world spawn point itself can be changed using the command.\nBedrock world spawn search.\n, when a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; creates a new world, the world spawn point is restricted to specific biomes. The algorithm starts searching from coordinate 0,0, continuing outward until an acceptable biome is found for the world spawn point. Using add-ons, a rare biome can be designated to cause the player to spawn at a distant location, but the game crashes if the biome does not exist or cannot generate.\nThe algorithm searches for these biomes:\nThe player spawns within a 5-block radius of the point selected in the chosen biome, sometimes resulting in the player spawning outside the intended spawn biome, ending up in a beach, river, or swamp biome. It is also possible (but rare) for a player to spawn initially underwater and start drowning.\nA search for a valid world spawn biome is \"not\" performed for &lt;a href=\"Flat\"&gt;Flat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old\"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt; world-types.\nAdventure mode.\nWhen the server's settings specify the default game mode as Adventure (using the server.properties), then the normal spawning mechanic is ignored, and players are spawned directly on the world spawn point. This includes the X, Y, and Z coordinates, even if there is no block there, and even if there are blocks above it.\nIf the Y coordinate is not within a valid spawning area, then the server looks up until it finds one, up to a maximum of Y=256. If there is space to spawn, but it is in mid-air, the player spawns in mid-air, even falling into the Void if there is a hole.\nLocation.\nThere are several ways to determine the world spawn point:\nIndividual spawn.\nThe individual spawn point of the player can be changed by sleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, using a &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;, or using the or command. If the individual spawning area of the player is obstructed upon death, the player respawns at the world spawn.\nSleeping in a bed allows for leniency in obstruction, in that the player respawns on other blocks near the bed if the original point becomes blocked. The same is true for the respawn anchor. If the spawn point set via or becomes obstructed, the player is not given this leniency in respawning.\nNatural generation.\nAnimals.\n many animals generate upon initial chunk creation. These spawns occur only once per chunk. They are not affected by the command.\nOne in ten newly-generated &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s attempts to generate animal &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, usually in packs of up to 4 of the same species. The spawn attempt always starts on top of the highest available block in a randomly chosen column within the chunk. The chosen position must not be a solid block for the animals to generate. Once the starting position is chosen for a chunk, a second position is chosen in a 9\u00d79 block area around the starting position. Blocks toward the center of the 9x9 area are more likely to be chosen than blocks toward the edge. The block does not need to be a &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; nor does it need to be illuminated as it does with &lt;a href=\"mob%20spawning\"&gt;mob spawning&lt;/a&gt;. If an animal can spawn at the second position, it does so. The second position becomes the first position, and a new second position is chosen like before in a 9x9 area. This process can repeat until each chunk has attempted to spawn 1\u20134 mobs.\n animals do not spawn during chunk generation, but they continually attempt to spawn everywhere as part of the environmental spawning algorithm, according to their spawn weights, biome tags, and block requirements (see Bedrock Edition under Spawn Cycle, below).\nThere are 2 types of animals: common animals and biome-specific animals.\nCommon animal mobs do not spawn in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. \nSome animal mobs spawn only in specific biomes.\nRandomness for animal spawning is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;world seed&lt;/a&gt;, which means that \"worlds with the same seed\" always generate chunks with \"the same animals in the same places\".\nMonsters.\nMonsters cannot spawn when the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is set to Peaceful (except piglin and hoglin). At any higher setting they spawn when block light level is 0. The player cannot sleep when a monster (other than hoglin; and in \"Java Edition\", also include slime, magma cube and non-hostile zombified piglin) is nearby, even if the monster has no path to the player.\nCommon monster mobs can spawn in almost any biome in the Overworld (except for &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt;). They can spawn on the surface \"and\" underground. The weight determines the spawn rate in the \"Bedrock Codebase\". \nSome monsters spawn only in specific biomes.\nOther mobs.\n these mobs still spawn if the command is set to codice_1, because they spawn as part of structure generation. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; nothing spawns if the command is set to codice_2\nSpawn cycle.\nJava Edition.\nMobs are broadly divided into seven categories: hostile, passive, water creature (&lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s), underground water creature (&lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;s), axolotls, water ambient (all 4 types of &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;), and ambient (&lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;). Most mobs have a spawning cycle once every game &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; ( of a second), but passive mobs have only one spawning cycle every . Because of this, where conditions permit, hostile mobs spawn frequently, but passive mobs (animals) spawn rarely. Most animals spawn within chunks when they are &lt;a href=\"%23Natural%20generation\"&gt;generated&lt;/a&gt;.\nMobs spawn naturally within chunks that have a player horizontally within 128 blocks of the chunk center. When there are multiple players, mobs can spawn within the given distance of \"any\" of them. However, hostile mobs (and some others) that move farther than 128 blocks from the nearest player despawn instantly, so the mob spawning area for such mobs is more-or-less limited to spheres with a radius of 128 blocks, centered at each player.\nJava Edition mob cap.\nThere are two caps, a global cap and a per-player cap. Note the &lt;a href=\"%23Spawn%20costs\"&gt;spawn density&lt;/a&gt; mechanism may also be considered a \"cap\" of sorts, but takes effect later in the spawning process.\nThe mob caps are checked once for each spawn-eligible chunk. Spawn for the chunk may take the total number of mobs over the cap.\nThe caps for each mob category are as follows:\nThe \"misc\" category is used only by entities that are not mobs, do not spawn naturally, and/or following different spawning rules than other mobs. As such the mob cap has no bearing on mobs of this category.\nAll non-&lt;a href=\"%23Java%20persistent%20mobs\"&gt;persistent&lt;/a&gt; loaded mobs are counted against the global cap, including those in chunks not in range of a player or eligible for spawns.\nThe cap is scaled by the total number of chunks within a 17\u00d717 chunk square around any player. The cap is then scaled as codice_3.\nBecause chunks that are in the range of multiple players are counted once, more chunks and higher mob caps result from the players spreading out.\nEach non-&lt;a href=\"%23Java%20persistent%20mobs\"&gt;persistent&lt;/a&gt; mob in a chunk that has its center within 128 blocks horizontally of a player is counted toward that player's per-player mob cap.\nFor each chunk, spawns are only allowed if at least one player has that chunk in range and has not reached their per-player mob cap.\nPack spawning.\nFor each spawning cycle, attempts are made to spawn \"packs\" of mobs per \"each\" eligible chunk. An eligible chunk is determined by the same check for which chunks are &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;ed. A random location in the chunk is chosen to be the center point of the pack. If the block in which a pack spawn occurs is an opaque full cube, further pack spawn attempts are canceled. There are a maximum of 3 pack spawn attempts per mob category.\nBefore the attempt to spawn each mob in the pack, the position is offset by \u00b15 (triangular distribution) on the X and Z axes. Thus, while the pack can be spread out up to 40 blocks from the initial position for a pack size of 4, it's much more likely they'll be closer to the center. Approximately 85% of spawns are within 5 blocks of the pack center, and 99% within 10 blocks of the center. Mobs spawn with the lowest part of their body \"inside\" this area.\nAll mobs within a pack are the same species. The species for the entire pack is chosen randomly, but based on a weight system from those eligible to spawn at the location of the first spawn attempt in the pack. For later mob spawn attempts in the pack, if the selected species cannot spawn at the location (e.g. due to being in a different biome or structure) then that attempt fails.\nThe game checks on each spawn if the number of mobs that have been spawned for the pack is equal to the max spawn attempts, as well as the location's spawn potential.\nPack spawn attempts max out at:\nWhen the max pack size is less than the number of possible spawn attempts, some spawns attempts fail, but are seen more commonly in practice. Based on the number of mobs that have been successfully spawned. If the max pack size is greater than the number of spawn attempts, one gets only the number of spawns from the spawn attempts. Some mobs have a minimum and max pack size, meaning there is an even chance for any number of spawn attempts between them occurring.\nFor all dimensions, structure-based spawns take priority over biome for hostile spawns. This means that in a &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; (outer bounding box only when there is &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; below it), and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;, one sees only the corresponding hostile mobs for that structure within that structure.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, this depends on the location:\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;:\nSpawn conditions.\nWhether a spawn condition fails differs from the above determination if the game tries to spawn them in that biome. For example, dolphins can have pack spawns that occur inside of frozen ocean and deep frozen ocean biomes, but no other biomes. These rules apply to variants of the same mob, such as baby zombies and spider jockeys.\nEach individual spawn attempt succeeds only if \"all\" of the following conditions are met:\nThe basic rules for spawning are as follows:\nWhen doing the light check in the Overworld and End, the spawn chances are randomized and a spawn only occurs if the light level is less than or equal to a random number between 0 and 7. In the Nether, as long as the light level is below 11, the spawn is allowed.\nSome mobs have some additional rules in addition to the ones above.\nIf all of these conditions are met then the mob is spawned.\nThe &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt; biomes introduced a new mechanic to limit the amount of mobs that naturally spawn in them. The spawn cost (also called spawn potential or spawn density) takes on a value for each block in the biome. Certain mobs increase that value by some number (\"charge\") divided by their distance to the block. If a new spawn attempt would bring the \"potential\" of the spawning block above a certain threshold, the spawn attempt is canceled. This results in mobs not spawning too close to one another in these biomes, and new spawns in the area are completely blocked long before the full mobcap of 70 hostile mobs is ever reached.\nMore specifically, a mob may be spawned at a location if codice_4. While the code allows for different mobs to have different charges and maximum potential, all checked mobs have the same charge and maximum potential within both the &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhich mobs contribute to the charge, how much they add, and what the maximum potential is are all biome-specific. Mobs carry charge according to their current biome, and affect spawning in an adjacent biome even if they would not contribute a charge if in that biome. For example, striders in a soul sand valley will affect enderman spawns in an adjacent warped forest, even though striders in the warped forest itself do not.\nDue to the limited total number of mobs in soul sand valleys and warped forests, a larger-than-usual amount of mobs spawn in any space outside of these biomes, including in Nether fortresses.\nBedrock Edition.\nEnvironmental spawning shares broad similarities to natural spawning in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\": mobs spawn in a radius around the player subject to block conditions, lighting conditions, biome conditions, naturally generated structure conditions, and caps. Many mobs spawn in groups (called \"packs\" in Java and \"herds\" in Bedrock). One notable difference from \"Java Edition\" is that most animals can spawn at light level 7 or higher rather than 9 or higher. \nThere are two types of environmental spawns: cluster spawns and structure spawns. Structure spawns reproduce specific types of mobs at specific locations within certain naturally generated structures, such as nether fortresses, swamp huts, etc. Cluster spawns account for all other types of environmental spawns, including mobs that spawn individually (i.e. not in a herd of 2 or more). Both types of environmental spawns follow the same rules for spawn conditions and mob caps, except that structure spawns can exceed the monster population cap by 1 (see below). \nMob spawning in bedrock edition happens within a spherical shell 24-44 blocks away from the player on &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt; 4. It happens a quasi-spherical shell 24-128 blocks away from the player, restricted by a simulation distance and/or to roughly 96 blocks horizontally, on simulation distances 6 and higher. This means that mobs can spawn directly above or below the player (for example, phantoms in the sky or zombies underground). Mobs can spawn only in chunks that are being ticked. There is a chance of the mob spawning algorithm attempting to run per chunk, per tick. \nBedrock Edition mob cap.\nThere are three mob caps that affect environmental spawning: a global mob cap, population control caps for general mob types, and density caps for specific mob types. The global mob cap is set at 200 regardless of difficulty. The global mob cap affects only environmental mob spawning, and does not affect mobs spawned through &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s, the command, &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, or any other type of mob spawning. Chickens created by thrown or dispensed eggs are counted in the global mob cap. Only mobs that have spawn rules count toward the global cap (i.e. armor stands and minecarts do not take up cap space). In addition, mobs that are within ticking areas (both those around players and those set manually using the command) count toward the global mob cap; mobs not ticked do not count toward the global mob cap.\nThe population control caps limit how many mobs of each type and category can spawn within a 9 chunk by 9 chunk square region surrounding the chunk in which the spawn attempt is made. Mobs in chunks outside a ticking area still count toward population control counts as long as they were previously loaded (i.e. within &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt; at some time) after relogging. The population control caps are split up into two distinct categories: a cap for surface mobs, and a cap for cave mobs. Cave mobs do not count toward the surface mob cap, and surface mobs do not count toward the cave mob cap. Whether a mob counts as a surface mob or a cave mob is determined by where or how it spawned, not where it happens to be at the moment. For cluster spawns, those that spawn on the highest spawnable block at a given coordinate count toward the surface cap, and any that spawn below the highest solid \"or\" non-solid but spawnable (e.g. ice or upper slab with air above) block count toward the cave cap. Structure-spawned mobs and converted mobs (i.e. drowned converted from zombies, witches from villagers, zombified piglins from pigs, and medium and small slimes from killed larger slimes) always count toward the cave cap, and monster-spawner-spawned mobs always count toward the surface cap.\nThere are five categories of mobs: ambient, animal, monster, pillager, and water_animal. The population control cap for each category and location of mob in each dimension is as follows (* denotes values that are coded in the game but not actually used by any mobs):\nSome specific mobs types also have their own density caps. The density caps limit the number of those mobs to some amount below the applicable population control cap. Density caps are checked in the same manner as the population control caps. Caps are below (n/a indicates that the mob does not spawn in that environment at all).\nBedrock spawn conditions.\nThe following rules apply to most mobs:\nCluster spawning.\nCluster spawning happens in two stages: first attempt to spawn surface mobs, then attempt to spawn cave mobs. Before spawning, the population control cap is calculated based on the 9 chunk x 9 chunk square area surrounding the current chunk. Spawning begins by picking a random X and Z location within the chunk currently being evaluated. The Y coordinate is determined by starting at the world height and searching downward for a solid-top-surface block with a non-spawn-blocking block above it. The first such block that is found is considered to be the surface, and the algorithm attempts to spawn a surface mob herd. However, if the algorithm finds a solid block before finding a spawnable solid-top-block (e.g. if it finds a tree trunk directly under leaves), it does not make any surface spawn attempt. The algorithm then continues to search downward for the next suitable block with a non-spawn-blocking block above it. When a block meeting the criteria is found, the algorithm attempts to spawn a cave mob herd at that block location. Cave spawn attempts continue until the Y coordinate reaches the world bottom, and do not stop even if a cave herd was spawned.\nSurface and cave cluster spawn attempts then go through the following steps to figure out what mob to spawn and how many:\nStructure spawning.\nStructure spawn attempts occur at specific relative X and Z coordinates in naturally generated structures, known as \"hard-coded spawn spots\". The structures that have hard-coded spawn spots include swamp huts, ocean monuments, pillager outposts, and nether fortresses. Whenever a successful cluster spawn attempt occurs within a chunk that contains a hard-coded spawn spot, the environmental spawning algorithm also attempts a structure spawn. (Note that a \"successful attempt\" here means that a spawnable block was found, even if the spawn was then blocked by light level check or mob cap check.) The structure spawn attempt follows the same rules and steps described above for cluster spawning, with the following changes:\nDespawning.\nJava Edition.\nAll monster, ambient, and aquatic mobs excluding &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s despawn unless they have been marked persistent. Other mobs that are not monster, ambient, or aquatic that do despawn include &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s, stray &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMobs are persistent, meaning they do not despawn and do not count toward the mob cap, when they:\nFollowing mobs also have another way to prevent despawning and do not count toward mob cap:\nBedrock Edition.\n, like Java, despawning occurs based on distance and chance.\nMobs with persistence do not despawn. Mobs gain persistence in the following ways:\nThe following entities always have persistence: "}

This point is stored in the &lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt; file's codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 attributes (although codice_2 seems to be ignored). If the spawn point is deemed unacceptable, a new, temporary spawn point will be selected (although the criterion for \"acceptable\" is unknown).\nA player with no spawn point set (such as by a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;) will be placed randomly at the highest point in a 20x/20z square centered on the x-/z- corner of the spawn point; that is, the 20x/20z spawn square's edges are at SpawnX -10/+9, SpawnZ -10/+9. The 10 block radius can be changed using though. Changing the spawn radius also affects the radius of spawn protection. The spawn protection will be removed if the spawnRadius is set to 0.\nOn multiplayer servers, a 33x/33z slice of the world centered at SpawnX, SpawnZ can, at the server owner's or operator's option, be set as \"protected\", and can then (almost; see below) only be modified by &lt;a href=\"Operator\"&gt;Operator&lt;/a&gt;s; that is, the 33x/33z protection square's edges are at SpawnX +16/-16, SpawnZ +16/-16.\n&lt;a href=\"op\"&gt;Non-operator players&lt;/a&gt; cannot place or destroy blocks in the protected area, nor can they use doors or &lt;a href=\"Switch\"&gt;Redstone devices&lt;/a&gt; other than &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plate\"&gt;Pressure Plate&lt;/a&gt;s. Creepers can still destroy terrain in the protected area and &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; placed outside of the protected area will destroy surrounding blocks as usual. Along with this, portals from the nether can connect to the protected area, water/lava/fire can spread from outside into the protected area, and pistons can push items inside as well. Players can place blocks on the edge of the protected area if placed against the side of a block on the outside of the area. However, if the edges of the protected area are avoided, small, indestructible structures can be built. Paintings that are put up can be removed by players in the safe zone.\nSleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; will reset your spawn point to that bed, even if you click \"Leave Bed\".\nIf the bed at which you have set your spawn point last is missing or blocked when you respawn, your spawn point reverts to the world spawn.\nDerivation.\nThe spawn point was forced to 100x,100z and the player data was cleared. The purple square outlines the column at 100x,100z, which holds an obsidian tower.\nTo determine the spawn area, a flat, open area large enough for the (presumed) 20x20 spawn area was created. The player (an op) repeatedly respawned and immediately dug a hole if one was not already present. The red square, above, is drawn from the midpoints of the outermost holes in each direction.\nTo determine the protection area, the player (a non-op) attempted to place blocks until successful while moving away from the spawn, and then traced around the edges of the protected area until all four corners were found. The lapis corners marked above were the extent of the minimum placeable area by the player. The blue square, above, is drawn from the midpoints of the outermost protected blocks in each direction.\nThe dimensions of each square are given by codice_5 to include the extra half-block on either end of the measurement (In the example below, width should be [7 - 3 + 1 = 5]):\n XXXXX &lt;- width=5\n 123456789\n ^min=3\n ^max=7\nConstantly loaded chunks.\nThere is a 23x23 &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; area around the world's \"spawn point\" that is constantly loaded, even when the player is not in range. This can be verified by moving a player far away from the world's spawn point and deleting the original spawn chunks in MCEdit and then reloading the world.\nThat being said, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; clocks only work within a 21x21 chunk area of the world's \"spawn point\", and entities will only stay loaded within a 19x19 chunk area.\n&lt;a href=\"Clock%20circuit\"&gt;Clocks&lt;/a&gt; will continue to run even when the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is not in the area, making this a useful tool for map makers who need to have constantly running clocks for the world.\nThe loaded chunks are decided by the natural spawn point in the world, and may be changed or edited by map makers using the \"Move Spawn Point\" feature in &lt;a href=\"MCEdit\"&gt;MCEdit&lt;/a&gt;, or the command."}

In Creative mode, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can press on an existing mob to obtain their respective egg. Spawn eggs are also available in the Creative inventory. There are 77 spawn eggs and 75 spawn eggs .\nUsage.\nA spawn egg is used by pressing on any surface (top, bottom, or side) with the egg. When used on a top surface, the egg's &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; appears with its feet immediately adjacent to the surface, and its ambient sound is played.\nSpawn eggs are not thrown (unlike normal &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;s); the player must be within normal range of the block to use the spawn egg. Ocelot and all monster mobs (except &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s; and in Bedrock Edition, also include &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s) spawned while on Peaceful difficulty get created and immediately deleted from the world.\nThe surfaces of blocks are prioritized for spawning; if none are within reach, mobs can also be spawned in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\nDispensers.\nA spawn egg fired from a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; spawns the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; directly in front of the dispenser. The spawn egg is consumed when fired.\nBaby mobs.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; a spawn egg on the type of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; it spawns, and that mob has a baby form, the egg spawns a baby version of the mob. In mobs that can breed, the baby is created by breeding the clicked mob to itself. For instance, using a sheep spawn egg on a &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; makes a baby sheep with the same wool color.\nOther mobs such as &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s do not have a baby variant, so the egg still spawns an adult.\nMonster spawners.\nAll spawn eggs can also be on a &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; to change the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; the monster spawner spawns. , spawn eggs for any of the fish mobs spawn them only if the monster spawner is waterlogged.\nRenaming.\nA spawn egg can be renamed on an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, and when used it spawns a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; with that name appearing over its head. The name can be seen only by aiming at the mob from four or fewer blocks away. This name also appears in &lt;a href=\"death%20messages\"&gt;death messages&lt;/a&gt; from the mob killing a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. If the player renames a spawn egg by the names described below, the mob appears described below. If the player renames a &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; spawn egg \"Toast\", the secret skin of the rabbit appears when the egg is used. Naming a spawn egg \"Dinnerbone\" or \"Grumm\" causes the mob to appear upside down and show the given name above it. Renaming a &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; \"Johnny\" causes it to act hostile to all mobs except for other illagers. Renaming a &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; \"jeb_\" makes the sheep's wool color cycle in a rainbow loop. This doesn't change the color of the wool the sheep drops. Renaming a spawn egg of a &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; and then spawning the hostile mob with the renamed spawn egg does not prevent the hostile mob from despawning, unlike using a &lt;a href=\"Name%20Tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; on the mob.\nSurvival mode.\nMobs can be spawned with spawn eggs in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, but spawn eggs are &lt;a href=\"Content%20inaccessible%20in%20Survival\"&gt;not obtainable in Survival&lt;/a&gt; without cheats; they can be obtained only using the Creative menu or commands. Unlike in creative, spawn eggs are consumed when used in survival.\nList of spawn eggs.\nThere is a spawn egg for almost every mob in the game; exceptions are listed below this table.\nMobs without spawn eggs.\nThe following mobs do not have explicitly defined spawn eggs. Custom spawn eggs can be created with a custom NBT tag that changes the spawned entity, however no spawn egg explicitly associated with any of the mobs exist.\nEducation Edition spawn eggs.\nThese spawn eggs exist and :\nThe NPC and agent can both be spawned , however, the agent is not visible or interactable in any way, though it still prevents the placing of blocks and entities.\nMinecraft Earth spawn eggs.\nThese unused spawn egg textures existed :\nSounds.\nWhen a mob is spawned, it immediately makes its ambient sound."}

Several of these use textures visually identical to the outcome of tinting in Java Edition, and as such the input colors can be reverse-engineered.\nHistory.\nSpawn eggs which do not use colors.\n, not all spawn eggs utilize the color system, and instead use predefined sprites which are themselves colored. These may appear identical to their Java Edition counterparts, or entirely different. Such cases are listed here for the sake of completion, and to distinguish them from color-using spawn eggs via highlighting what eggs do not.\nBefore 12w01a.\nPrior to Java Edition 12w01a, spawn eggs used a single texture which was colored with a single color. This color was generated by the game via an equation, rather than specific colors picked for each egg; as such, even the unused spawn eggs had colors associated with them. The following formula was used to calculate each color component:\n red = (64 + (n * 2423535 &amp; 0xC0)) % 256;\n green = (64 + (n * 223535 &amp; 0xC0)) % 256;\n blue = (64 + (n * 242535 &amp; 0xC0)) % 256;\nThere are a total of 64 distinct spawn egg colors which can be generated, and the pattern of colors repeats every 256 metadata values (such that a spawn egg with metadata value 0 will look identical to that of one of value 256, and that to one of 512, and so on).\nThe following is a table of each individual spawn egg color, what data values it applies to in the 0-to-255 range (with the first being bold), and entities that this color is associated with:"}

For instance, &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt; is at layer 62, while &lt;a href=\"cloud\"&gt;cloud&lt;/a&gt;s appear at layer 191).\nThis is not to be confused with altitude when otherwise expressed as the top face of a block layer, where the lowest block that can be placed is at layer -63 and has a \"Y\"-coordinate of -63. For example, sea level is at layer 63, while clouds appear at layer 192. This is akin to calling the ground level story the \"first floor\" (top face of a block layer), rather than the \"ground floor\" (bottom face of a block layer). The &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can press to see the \"Y\"-coordinate of the top face of a block they are on top of.\nAltitude expressed as the bottom face of a block layer is most useful for identifying the position of blocks, such as when using to replace block(s). Expressing altitude as the top face of a block layer is more useful for identifying the position of entities, such as when using to teleport or to spawn an entity/entities. For instance, the topmost block of water in an &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; biome has a \"Y\"-coordinate of 62; in a frozen ocean biome, ice replaces water at sea level, and the lowest height where terrestrial mobs will spawn is at layer 63.\nNatural resources and altitude.\nFeatures in the landscape of the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; are found at different altitudes, as shown in the graph below for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.20.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.20.2&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note that these charts utilize the , which means a slight difference in the Y-coordinate represents a large change in the relative frequency of a block type.

Currently, there are 167 different ambience sounds.\nAmbience is divided into groups of ambience sounds that play under same condition/s. Currently, there are \"cave\", \"underwater\" and \"nether\" ambiences.\nThe volume of ambient sounds can be changed individually through \"Music &amp; Sounds\" in the &lt;a href=\"Options\"&gt;Options&lt;/a&gt; menu by changing the \"Ambient/Environment\" bar. However, this also affects the sounds of firework rockets and such.\nAll ambience can be played using the command. All ambiences' code names start with ambient.&lt;unique code name&gt;.\n\"Note that the player needs to put into the command more variables than just the name of the sounds. See &lt;a href=\"Commands/playsound\"&gt;playsound&lt;/a&gt; for more info.\"\nCave ambience.\nCave ambience (also known as cave sounds, or eerie noises according to the &lt;a href=\"subtitles\"&gt;subtitles&lt;/a&gt;) are sounds that occasionally play when the player is underground or in a dark area, based on the &lt;a href=\"%23Mood%20algorithm\"&gt;mood algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.\nCave ambience sounds can play in all biomes except the Nether biomes, as long as there is a cave or a dark enough area present.\nThe code name for cave ambience is . There are 19 different cave ambience sounds in total.\nUnderwater ambience.\nUnderwater ambience plays while the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s head is underwater. There are 22 different underwater ambience sounds in total.\nThey can be heard within a body of water of any size and in any &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnderwater ambience is divided into two groups: \"Loop\" and \"Loop Additions\". Both of these play independently of each other while player is underwater. Additionally, \"Loop Additions\" are divided into 3 more groups. \nIts code name is ambient.underwater.&lt;group code name&gt;\nNether ambience.\nNether ambience plays while the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Each biome has its own unique ambience. There are 126 different nether ambience sounds in total.\nNether ambience is divided into three groups: \"Loop\", \"Loop Additions\", and \"Mood\", all of which play independently of each other while the player is in the Nether.\nIts code name is ambient.&lt;biome&gt;.&lt;group code name&gt;\nMood algorithm.\nMood ambience sounds occur based on a \"mood\" percent value between 0\u2013100. The mood increases when the player is in a cave or in a dark place, and decreases otherwise. When the mood reaches 100%, one of the sounds plays randomly, resetting the mood to 0% and thus restarting the cycle. The darker it is, and the more non-transparent blocks there are, the quicker the mood increases. , the current mood value appears on the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is the simplified algorithm for computing this value in pseudocode:\nThis method is called once every &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;. It selects a random block in a 17\u00d717\u00d717 area centered around the player's eye position, and alters the mood value accordingly:\nThis means that if you are in complete darkness and there are no lit blocks around you, an ambient noise will play every 6000 ticks (5 minutes).\nSince non-transparent blocks are considered to have a sky and block light level of 0, the mood value increases especially fast if you're in a cave."}

These are the same percentage increases as ores (except &lt;a href=\"redstone%20ore\"&gt;redstone ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;).\nNatural generation.\nAmethyst buds and clusters generate naturally as part of &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20geode\"&gt;amethyst geode&lt;/a&gt;s, on exposed faces of budding amethysts.\nPost-generation.\nEvery time a &lt;a href=\"budding%20amethyst\"&gt;budding amethyst&lt;/a&gt; block receives a &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;, there is a 20% chance for a small amethyst bud to generate on any of its sides, as long as the block being replaced with the small amethyst bud is &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source block.\nUsage.\nGrowing into amethyst clusters.\nAn amethyst bud placed on a &lt;a href=\"budding%20amethyst\"&gt;budding amethyst&lt;/a&gt; (rather than any other block) regardless whether it was placed by the player or spawned by the budding amethyst itself grows over time, going through three growth stages \u2013 small, medium, and large \u2013 before reaching its 4th and final growth stage as an amethyst cluster, which drops &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20shard\"&gt;amethyst shard&lt;/a&gt;s when mined.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the below logic can be applied:\nAs such, the math can be applied if a player is within random tick range as:\n(68.27 seconds average for random ticks) x (20% chance of growth for any given single side) x (6 sides) x (4 growth stages) = 68.27 x 5 x 6 x 4 = 8192.4 seconds average, also 2 hours 16 minutes 32.4 seconds, also 6.827 in-game days.\nDecoration.\nThey can also be placed on certain other types blocks for decoration. Most blocks have not yet been tested, but it seems that they can be placed only on full blocks, or those sides of blocks that form a full surface. They can be placed on the bottom of stairs (or top of upside down stairs), but not on their side or top. They can not be placed on any type of &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;.\nLight.\nSmall, medium and large amethyst buds give off a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of 1, 2 and 4 respectively, while amethyst clusters give off a light level of 5.\nSound.\nUnique among other blocks, an amethyst cluster in all its growth stages makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\""}

This is not unique to placeholder textures, and can also be noted when viewing the raw textures for liquids in 13w02a and above, as well as applying internally for generated liquid textures. A larger texture is used here since the texture is rotated accordingly to match the flow direction, while otherwise remaining at the same resolution. As a result, 16x16 textures would be too small to show a continuous texture if rotated at all, as with the most extreme case, a 45 degree rotation, there would be clear gaps at the corners, as one corner to the other would cross 16\u221a2 pixels rather than 16.\nWater.\nWhen the generated animation was added for water in 0.0.19a, the old water texture used before that point was kept in for use as a placeholder texture.\nA second copy of the water texture was added in the 20091223-1 Indev build, which was without a doubt linked to the addition of the flowing water texture.\nIn the 20100616 build of Infdev, the water placeholder textures were moved to the bottom-right of &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;. The still water texture remained as a single texture square, and the flowing water texture became a 2x2 square of water textures, as explained earlier.\nWith the addition of animated texture images in 13w02a, these textures were decommissioned and removed soon after.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Pocket Edition being based off of the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.3, both the still and flowing water texture placeholders from said version are there by default. It was used as the water texture on certain devices, seemingly on either very new or very old devices relative to 2011-12. It seems that as of v0.7.0 alpha, the generated water texture would always be used, and the placeholder texture's use in later versions is unknown.\nIt was updated in v0.10.0 alpha to more closely resemble the generated water texture, becoming opaque as a result.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Xbox 360 Edition being the same as the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.6.6, both the still and flowing water texture placeholders from said version are there by default, and would carry on into the other respective consoles. What the water placeholder textures were used for in this edition is unknown.\nIt was updated in TU25 and equivalent versions to more closely resemble the generated water texture, and was updated again in TU31 and equivalent versions alongside all other translucent textures to appear more translucent.\nLava.\nWhen the generated animation was added for lava in 0.0.19a, the old lava texture used before that point was kept in for use as a placeholder texture.\nA second copy of the lava texture was added in the 20100110 Indev build, presumably for flowing lava, despite flowing lava not appearing visually distinct from still lava until the 20100616 build of Infdev. Whether this even represents where flowing lava would be at all, or if versions before 20100110 and inclusively after 20091223-1 would use the same placeholder texture for would-be \"flowing\" lava (in an identical situation to water) as it would still lava or if it would use the texture at this position instead which was a duplicate of the top of grass at the time, is currently unknown.\nIn the 20100616 build of Infdev, the lava placeholder textures were moved to the bottom-right of &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;. The still lava texture remained as a single texture square, and the flowing lava texture became a 2x2 square of lava textures, as explained earlier.\nWith the addition of animated texture images in 13w02a, these textures were decommissioned and removed soon after.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Pocket Edition being based off of the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.3, both the still and flowing water texture placeholders from said version are there by default. It was used for all lava seemingly regardless of device up until v0.7.0 alpha, when lava became animated on seemingly all devices.\nIt was updated in v0.14.2 to more closely resemble the generated lava.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Xbox 360 Edition being the same as the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.6.6, both the still and flowing lava texture placeholders from said version are there by default, and would carry on into the other respective consoles. What the lava placeholder textures were used for in this edition is unknown.\nIt was updated in TU25 and equivalent versions to more closely resemble the generated lava texture.\nFire.\nDespite fire being added in early Indev in January, a dedicated placeholder texture for fire was not added until late Infdev in June. Initially, the placeholder texture was a hilarious red-orange scribble, but was changed several days later to a red square with \"FIRE TEX! HNST\" (Fire texture!, honest!) cut out of it.\nIn Beta 1.2, a second copy of the placeholder texture was added to &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; below the original copy. This is very likely linked to there being two similar but different fire textures, with there now being one placeholder texture each.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Pocket Edition being based off of the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.3, both of the spaces that held fire texture placeholders also hold fire texture placeholders here. Interestingly, however, all of the fire placeholders which exist throughout Pocket Edition are much different from any of those encountered in Java Edition. The first texture, in v0.1.0 alpha, resembles a red U-shape. This texture was quickly changed to a translucent orange texture in v0.1.3 alpha, which, upon further investigation, can be seen to be based off of the water placeholder texture. In v0.8.0 alpha build 1, despite the scrapping of &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;, two new fire texture placeholders were created, which could be seen in &lt;samp&gt;terrain-atlas.tga&lt;/samp&gt;, resembling small orange rectangles.\nIn earlier versions, the fire placeholder texture would appear in front of burning players, successfully functioning as a stand-in for the fire texture. It also appeared as the item texture for &lt;a href=\"Technical%20blocks/Fire\"&gt;fire as an item&lt;/a&gt; until v0.7.0 alpha, which made fire render correctly.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Xbox 360 Edition being the same as the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.6.6, both fire texture placeholders from said version are there by default, and would carry on into the other respective consoles. What the fire placeholder textures were used for in this edition is unknown.\nNether portals.\nThe nether portal placeholder texture was added in Alpha v1.2.0, alongside the nether portal block itself.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Pocket Edition being based off of the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.3, the nether portal texture placeholder from said version is there by default. However, due to the absence of nether portals in this version, it remained unused until its removal in v0.8.0 alpha build 2. A second placeholder texture was added when nether portals were actually added in v0.12.1 alpha build 1.\n\nDue to the first &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Xbox 360 Edition being the same as the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from Beta 1.6.6, the nether portal texture placeholder from said version are there by default, and would carry on into the other respective consoles. What the nether portal placeholder texture was used for in this edition is unknown.\nGears.\nThe gear placeholder textures were added in the January 28, 2010 build of Indev, alongside gears themselves. There were two gear placeholders, likely corresponding to the two possible rotation directions."}

{"id": "41121", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41121", "title": "Anvil", "text": "An anvil is a gravity-affected utility &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; used to rename items, combine &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; and repair items without losing the enchantments. An anvil has limited durability, and as it is used or dropped too far, gradually becomes a chipped anvil, then a damaged anvil, then breaks into nothing.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nAnvils can be mined using any &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.\nNatural generation.\nA damaged anvil generates in the \"Forge room\" of the &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting.\nA total of 31 iron ingots (including 27 for three &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20iron\"&gt;blocks of iron&lt;/a&gt;) are required to craft an anvil.\nUsage.\nRepairing and renaming items.\nAnvils have two modes to repair items that have a durability rating:\nIf the items are unable to be combined, a red \"X\" appears over the arrow pointing to the slot of the resulting item. Also, if the target item is at full durability and the sacrifice does not have any enchantments, the anvil will also refuse to combine the items, unless if &lt;a href=\"%23Renaming\"&gt;renaming&lt;/a&gt; the item to a valid name.\nIn addition, the player can rename any item \u2013 not just items with durability \u2013 by using an anvil.\nRepairing.\nRepairing with materials works for the most part, but not with all items: in general, repairing works for items with their material in the default name. For example, an anvil can repair an \"iron\" pickaxe with materials (iron in this case) while an anvil cannot repair bows or shears except with other bows or shears. Special cases: chain armor can be repaired with iron ingots, &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;s can be repaired with &lt;a href=\"scute\"&gt;scute&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; can be repaired with &lt;a href=\"phantom%20membrane\"&gt;phantom membrane&lt;/a&gt;s. The repair does not need to be complete; one material repairs of the item's maximum durability. Repair of an unenchanted item can cost more material than simply crafting a new item or combining damaged items. The exception is armor, which consumes less material at the cost of experience levels.\nRepairing with a matching item works for any item with durability including bows, shears and so on. The items must be a matching tool and of a matching material. For example, a golden pickaxe cannot combine with a golden sword or iron pickaxe.\nIn both cases, the resulting durability is limited to the item's maximum, and there is no discount for \"over-repair\".\nAs a subset of repairing one item with another, the anvil can transfer enchantments from the sacrifice to the target. This can have a synergistic effect when both items share identical enchantments, or simply add to each other when they do not. Two Sharpness II swords can be combined to make a Sharpness III sword, for example, or a pickaxe with Efficiency can be combined with one that has Unbreaking. This can produce enchantments and combinations that are not possible with an enchanting table. But even so, some enchantments cannot be combined if they are similar, or contradicting, in terms of what they do. If the target is damaged, the player has to pay for the repair as well as the transfer.\nTransferring high-level enchantments is more expensive, and renaming an item has an additional surcharge. The anvil has a limit of 39 levels; beyond that, repairs are refused. This limit is not present in Creative mode.\nEvery time armor or tools are repaired, the minimum experience cost doubles (e.g., 1 level, 2 levels, 4 levels, 8 levels, etc.).\nRenaming.\nAny item or stack of items can be renamed at a cost of one level plus any prior-work penalty. If the player is only renaming, the maximum total cost is 39 levels. The maximum length for renaming is 30 characters or 50 characters. Some items have special effects when renamed:\nAny name changes to items are applied to the data tag codice_1. Similarly, this data tag can be accessed by the argument using &lt;a href=\"target%20selectors\"&gt;target selectors&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the item name field is left blank, or is only whitespace or s (or a combination of both), the default name for that item is used instead. Also, if the item name is unchanged from its current name (which can occur when renaming an item for the first time and using any of the aforementioned blank parameters), a red \"X\" will appear on top of the arrow in the GUI.\nNamed items do not stack with unnamed or differently-named items of the same type.\nEnchanted books.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20book\"&gt;Enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s are used to enchant tools. Enchanted books themselves can be combined to create higher-tiered books. This makes an anvil an alternative to the &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalling anvils.\nWhen there is no supporting block below an anvil, the anvil falls in the same way &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s fall. A placed anvil cannot be pushed or pulled by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, but a falling anvil can be pushed (though cannot be pulled), as it is an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;. This is different where anvils can be pushed and pulled by pistons. Anvils make a metallic clang sound when they land.\nA falling anvil damages any player or mob that it falls on. The damage amount depends on fall distance: per block fallen after the first (e.g., an anvil that falls 4 blocks deals damage). The damage is capped at , no matter how far the anvil falls. Wearing a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; reduces the damage by , but this costs twice as much durability on the helmet as on other armor pieces. When a player dies by an anvil falling on them, the &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;\"player\"&gt; was squashed by a falling anvil\" appears. However, if a player is merely touched by a falling anvil entity, no damage is dealt unless the falling anvil becomes an anvil block in the same block where the player is located.\nIf an anvil falls onto a block with a solid top surface, but the same block it is in cannot be replaced (&lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), it breaks and drops as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn anvil can fall into the void if there is a straight path to it.\nMaps.\n, an anvil can be used instead of a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; to zoom a map out, to clone a map, or to place a player position marker on a map.\n However, with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;, this feature became dispensable.\nBecoming damaged.\nWith each use, an anvil has a 12% chance to become damaged \u2013 degrading one stage at a time, first becoming chipped, then damaged, then eventually destroyed. An anvil typically survives for 25 uses on average or approximately one use per 1.24 iron ingots used in crafting the anvil.\nAn anvil can be damaged and destroyed from falling. If it falls from a height greater than one block, the chance of degrading by one stage is 5% \u00d7 the number of blocks fallen.\nThe damage state does not affect the anvil's function, but only anvils of the same damage state can stack in inventory.\nWhen an anvil is destroyed, the player automatically leaves the anvil GUI and it disappears.\nCreative mode.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt;, the anvil functions a little differently than other &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt;s:"}

The &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; is primarily used to repair tools, armor, and weapons, which it can do without stripping their &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s, unlike the &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used to combine the enchantments of two items, to give an item a custom name, or to crush enemies, mobs or other players that walk beneath it while it is falling, with more damage inflicted upon the target from each block fallen. All its functions, except for damaging mobs and players, cost &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; levels, and some have material costs.\nThe anvil has five basic functions:\nRenaming items can be done in the same work step as repairing or combining, provided the experience cost is not too high. In &lt;a href=\"survival%20mode\"&gt;survival mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventure%20mode\"&gt;adventure mode&lt;/a&gt;, the anvil can apply only 39 levels worth of work in a single operation. If the job would cost 40 or more levels, it is rejected as \"Too Expensive!\" This does not apply in &lt;a href=\"creative%20mode\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach time something is repaired, enchanted, or renamed using an anvil, the anvil has a 12% chance to degrade. There are three degradation levels: \"Anvil\", \"Chipped Anvil\", and \"Damaged Anvil\" in \"\", and \"Anvil\", \"Slightly Damaged Anvil\", and \"Very Damaged Anvil\" in .\nAnvil uses.\nAnvil uses are the number of times an item has been used in an anvil. \nEvery time an item is used in an anvil, except for being renamed, it gets one anvil use. If the player adds an enchanted book that has never been used in an anvil with a sword that has never been used in an anvil, then the sword gains 1 anvil use.\nAs an item gets more anvil uses, the experience required to use the item in the anvil increases to the point where it says \"Too expensive!\" From there the player must use &lt;a href=\"creative%20mode\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt; to repair/enchant/rename items using an anvil. \nCombining items of the same or different number of anvil uses takes the greater number and adds 1 for the final product. For example, two items with 2 anvil uses are combined into one with 3 anvil uses. For another example, an item with 3 anvil uses and an item with 2 anvil uses yields one with 4 anvil uses. \nUsing an enchantment table on an item does not affect anvil uses.\nThe formula for prior use penalty is:\n (prior use penalty) = 2^(Anvil use count) - 1\n&lt;a href=\"Item%20repair\"&gt;Item repair&lt;/a&gt; on a crafting grid removes all prior work penalties, enchantments, and custom names. If a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; is used, the item instead keeps its custom name while losing all its prior work penalties and enchantments (except for curses), returning some XP from enchantments in the process.\nRenaming.\nAny item or stack of items can be renamed. If only renaming an item or stack of items (instead of enchanting or repairing), renaming costs a single level in addition to any prior work penalty. There is no extra cost to renaming a stack of items as opposed to renaming a single item. The maximum level cost is 39 levels even if the prior work penalty is higher. Renaming does not increase the prior work penalty. However, if the penalty reaches or exceeds 2147483647, further renames become impossible.\nAn item can be renamed at the same time it is repaired or enchanted. In those cases, renaming adds 1 level of cost to the total enchanting or repair cost.\nIf the item name field is left blank, or is only whitespace or s (or a combination of both), the default name for that item is used instead. Also, if the item name is unchanged from its current name (which can occur when renaming an item for the first time and using any of the aforementioned blank parameters), a red \"X\" will appear on top of the arrow in the GUI.\nRenamed items can stack only with renamed items that share exactly the same name and work penalty. Renaming an item that doesn't have a work penalty gives it a work penalty of 0, making it stackable only with renamed items, even if it's custom name is reset. The custom name of a renamed item can be reset by renaming it to a name that consists of spaces. However, that item's repair cost is not reset. Therefore, it cannot be stacked with other items of the same type with different repair costs or with items that have never been renamed.\nBecause prior work penalty is charged for any rename, it is most economical to rename a weapon either before or while repairing or enchanting it, minimizing the penalty the player must pay for the rename.\nRenamed blocks that do not normally store &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; data lose their name and repair cost when placed. Blocks such as &lt;a href=\"chests\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shulker%20boxes\"&gt;shulker boxes&lt;/a&gt;, which do have associated block entity data, retain their custom names (but do not retain their repair cost).\nUnit repair.\nSome items are \"&lt;a href=\"Tiers\"&gt;tiered&lt;/a&gt;\" and can be repaired using units of its repair material, each unit restores up to 25% total &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; of the item (rounded down) and costs 1 level per unit of material used in addition to any applicable prior work penalties.\nAnvils cannot be repaired by any iron item or block.\nCombining items.\nThe &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; can be used to combine two &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s of the same type and &lt;a href=\"Tiers\"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt;, or an item with an &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;. This applies only to items with &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as enchanted books. The first (left) item is the \"target\" item, the second (right) item is the \"sacrifice\" item. The \"sacrifice\" item is destroyed upon combination of the two items. Combining two similar items does either or both of two things; each of which cost levels, though part of the cost is shared if they're both done at once:\nThe total cost for combining two similar items is the sum of:\nIf the sacrifice is a book, there is no repair, but the anvil tries to combine the book's enchantments onto the target. The item can also be renamed at the same time. The enchantment cost is generally less than for combining two similar items.\nIf the target item is at full durability and the sacrifice does not have any enchantments, the anvil will also refuse to combine the items, unless if renaming the item to a valid name.\nCosts for combining enchantments.\nPlanning the enchanting order.\nThere are two important things to notice about the anvil mechanics when planning the order of multiple enchantments to the same item:\nPrior work penalties are minimized by combining two items with equal penalties if possible. For example, it is possible to have 7 different enchantments on a single pair of boots. Starting with an unenchanted pair of boots and the 7 enchantments on individual books, the limit on the cost permitted by the anvil is exceeded if trying to combine the books one at a time with the boots. However, it is possible to avoid this by properly pairing up the items. First combine the boots with one of the books, plus the remaining 6 books in 3 pairs. Then combine the boots with one of the books and the other two books that have 2 enchantments each. Finally combine the boots with the book that has 4 enchantments. This results in a pair of boots with 3 workings on it, although in practice 7 workings have taken place.\nIt is also possible to minimize the cost of combining by carefully pairing up the items for combination. The enchantment with the highest cost should be in the sacrifice slot the least amount of times. For example. The 7 enchantments can be combined using the pairing method in the following order:\nHowever, at times it's better to avoid a pairing so as to avoid paying the enchantment cost multiple times. For example, in the above we pay the costs of Protection IV, Feather Falling IV, and Unbreaking III twice, and Mending three times. If we combine the items this way instead, we spend an extra 4 levels on prior work penalties but pay for Protection IV only once and Mending only twice, saving 6 levels, for a net savings of 2 levels:\nEnchantment equation.\nThe equation to calculate an enchantment is as follows:\n Experience cost = [Value of sacrificed (right placed) item] + [Work Penalty of target (left placed) item] + [Work Penalty of sacrificed (right placed) item] + [Renaming Cost] + [Refilling Durability] + [Incompatible Enchantments (Java Edition)]\nThe equation to calculate the new value of an item to be enchanted:\n New value = [Value of target (left placed) item] + [Value of sacrificed (right placed) item]. \nUsing the 7 enchantment pairing method shown, and looking at just the first enchantment (Diamond Boots + Soul Speed III) as an example: \nGoing to the next level of enchanting with Diamond Boots (Soul Speed III) and Thorns III + Feather Falling IV book: "}

The anvil is primarily used to repair tools, armor, and weapons, which it can do without stripping their &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s. It can also be used to combine the enchantments of two items, to give an item an individual name, or to crush other players that walk beneath it while it is falling. All its functions, except for crushing players, cost &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; levels, and some have material costs.\nThe anvil has five basic functions:\nRenaming items can be done in the same work step as repairing or combining, provided the experience cost is not too high. In &lt;a href=\"Survival%20mode\"&gt;Survival mode&lt;/a&gt;, the anvil can only apply 39 levels worth of work in a single operation. If the job would cost 40 or more levels, it will be rejected as \"Too Expensive!\". This does \"not\" apply when the player is in &lt;a href=\"Creative%20mode\"&gt;Creative mode&lt;/a&gt;. Such jobs can often be done piecewise: rename first, then repair, then combine. Note that it \"is\" possible to produce items so heavily enchanted that they cannot be worked on at all.\nBase value of items.\nThe most important concept for using an anvil is the \"Base Value\" of an item, figured in experience levels. Other than combining with enchanted books, any change made to an item will cost its Base Value plus costs for the change. An item's Base Value is the sum of the costs of its enchantments, plus a charge for the number of its enchantments. Note that the item's material does not affect its base cost, nor does the order of its enchantments. An unenchanted or unenchantable item has Base Value of 0.\nAs formulas:\nFinally, an extra value (NumEnchantCost) needs to be added based on how many enchantments the item has, which can be found from the table below.\nNotes:\nExample:\nTake a sword with Sharpness 3, Knockback 2, and Looting 2. Referring to the table we see that the Enchantments will cost 3\u00d71=3, 2\u00d72=4, and 2\u00d74=8 respectively, and another 6 levels for having three of them. 3+4+8+6=21. In the anvil for the first time, this sword will cost at least 21 levels to work on, even before considering \"what\" to do with it.\nPrior work penalty.\nRegardless of the work being done, be it rename, repair, or combine, there will be an extra cost, the \"prior work penalty\", to work on an item which has previously been altered in an anvil.\nRenaming.\nRenaming something with durability costs (Base Value + Prior Work Penalty) + 7 the first time, later renames cost (Base Value + Prior Work Penalty) + 10. \nRenaming an item \"without\" durability costs 5 the first time, then stays 9 for all later renames. This includes the implicit prior-work penalty, and everything without durability except enchanted books has a Base Value of 0.\nUnit repair.\nRepairing a \"tiered\" target item using units of its material restores up to 25% total &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; per unit and costs the sum of the unit costs of each unit (In addition to the Base Value and Prior Work Penalty).\nCombining items.\nThe anvil can be used to combine two items of the same type, or an item with an enchanted book. This applies only to items with &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;: swords, tools, and armor. The first/left item is the \"target\" item, the second/right item is the \"sacrifice\" item, which will be destroyed. Combining two similar items does either or both of two things. Each of these costs levels, but if they're both done at once, part of the cost will be shared:\nThe total cost for combining two similar items is the sum of:\nIf the sacrifice is a book, there will be no repair, but the anvil will try to combine the book's enchantment onto the target. The item can also be renamed at the same time. The cost will be much less than for combining two similar items.\nCosts for sacrifice repair.\nThe target item will end up with the sum of both items durabilities, plus a bonus (12% of the items' \"maximum\" durability, rounded down) up to the maximum.\nThe cost for the repair depends only on the sacrifice's current durability and (slightly) the type of item:\nFor each item type and sacrifice durability, the repair cost is:\nCosts for combining enchanted items.\n(This is just the enchanting cost. The total cost outline is in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics%23Combining%20Items\"&gt;Combining Items&lt;/a&gt;.) \nExamples:\nCosts for combining an item with an enchanted book.\nThe costs for enchanting with books expose more of the internals of the anvil system, but while this makes them more complex, they also include some major discounts compared to item combination. Naturally, repair costs do not apply.\nNormally, enchanted books only have one enchantment, but books with multiple enchantments can be produced by combining two books on an anvil. Such books will have their own prior-work penalty.\nNotes:\nExamples: \nSpecial uses of enchanted books.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20book\"&gt;Enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s can produce any &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; available to the &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;, and some that the enchanting table can't match:\nEnchanted books can also be combined with each other to produce higher-level or multi-enchantment books."}

{"id": "1708", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1708", "title": "Chunk", "text": "A chunk is a 16\u00d716 portion of a &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. Chunks are the method used by the game to divide maps into manageable pieces. They are divided in 16-block tall sections.\nDescription.\nChunks are 16 blocks wide, 16 blocks long. They extend from the bottom void of the world, all the way up to the top sky. In vanilla &lt;a href=\"overworld\"&gt;overworld&lt;/a&gt;, their building height are 384 blocks, and they have 98,304 blocks total. In vanilla &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20end\"&gt;the end&lt;/a&gt;, building heights are 256 blocks.\nChunks generate around players &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Player%20spawning\"&gt;when they first enter the world&lt;/a&gt;. The generating and loading progress are displayed on the &lt;a href=\"loading%20world%20screen\"&gt;loading world screen&lt;/a&gt;. As they wander around the world, new chunks generate as needed.\nChunks generate with the help of the map &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;, which means that the chunks are always the same if you would use the same seed again, as long as the map generator and &lt;a href=\"Versions\"&gt;version number&lt;/a&gt; remain the same.\n, &lt;a href=\"spawn%20chunk\"&gt;spawn chunk&lt;/a&gt;s, a 19x19 set of chunks around the world spawn, are always loaded, so you can use that to your advantage when making automatic farms.\nChunk loading.\nSince \"Minecraft\" worlds are 30 million blocks in each cardinal direction and contain an extreme number of chunks, the game loads only certain chunks in order to make the game playable. Unloaded chunks are unprocessed by the game and do not process any of the game aspects.\nJava Edition chunk loading.\nTickets.\nLoading starts when a chunk receives ticket. All loaded chunks originate from the ticket. Each load ticket has three properties: \"Level, Ticket type\" and (optional) \"Time to Live.\"\nLevel and load type.\nLevels are numbers that determine what load type the chunk is in. A lower level represents higher a load type. For a given chunk, it may get different level from different tickets, but only its lowest level matters.\nLoad levels range from 22 to 44 in regular gameplay, while only 22 to 33 are relevant to chunk loading. Load levels less than 22 are valid but possible only with a modded game. Load levels above 44 are instantly unloaded in vanilla.\nThere are four chunk load types; each load type has different properties. This excludes unloaded chunks.\nLevel propagation.\nLoad levels \"propagate\" or flow from source chunk with a ticket to neighboring chunks, but each time it increases its level by 1 until the maximum of 44.\nThe chunks that get load level from level propagation activate the assigned load type.\nTicket types.\nThere are different ticket types, which come from various sources.\nThis ticket is caused by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; and is assigned level 31. A player ticket is given to each chunk within a square region surrounding the chunk where the player is located, as defined by the formulas described below, and propagates as described in the table above.\nIn singleplayer, \"Render Distance\" in &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; decides the side length of the square. It follows the formula formula_1, where \"r\" is the selected render distance, and \"l\" is the side length (in chunks) of the square.\nIn multiplayer, \"view-distance\" configured in &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; decides the side length of the square. It also follows the same formula formula_1 where \"r\" is the configured \"view-distance\" and \"l\" is the side length of the square region.\nFor example, in a single-player game with a \"Render Distance\" of 5 chunks, a region of 11 \u00d7 11 chunks centered around the player has a load type of \"entity ticking\" (level 31). The strip of chunks at the outer edge of a 13 \u00d7 13 perimeter surrounding the player have \"block ticking\" (level 32), and the next enclosing chunks (15 \u00d7 15 perimeter) are \"border chunks\" (level 33).\nA ticket can also be created by using the command. It has a level of 31, so its propagation can be seen in the table above.\nChunks remain force-loaded even after exiting and re-entering the level.\nTicket created by the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23World%20spawn\"&gt;world spawn&lt;/a&gt; for the chunk it is located at, loading a 23 by 23 chunk area known as the \"&lt;a href=\"spawn%20chunk\"&gt;spawn chunk&lt;/a&gt;s\". Its position can be changed by a command. It has a level of 22, the lowest in the game.\nTicket created when an entity is teleported through a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;, given to the chunk at the other side of the portal. It has a level of 30, so it is stronger than the player/force loaded ticket.\nIt expires after 300 &lt;a href=\"Tick\"&gt;game ticks&lt;/a&gt; (equivalent to 15 seconds). Because they are created each time an entity passes through the portal, it is possible to create a \"chunk loader\". Perpetually keeping chunks loaded without the player being near, which can be used for various in-game mechanics such as farms, but can create lag.\nTicket created at the start of the battle with the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; and is given to the 0,0 chunk. It has a level of 24.\nIt expires if there are no players within a Euclidean distance of 192 blocks from (0.0, 128, 0.0), or the dragon dies.\nTicket created when entity is teleported either by going through the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; or using or commands. The and command has a level of 32, whereas, for the end portal, it has a level of 33.\nIt expires after 5 &lt;a href=\"Tick\"&gt;game ticks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the game needs to immediately use the data of a chunk, but the chunk has not yet been created or generated to required step, the game automatically gives a ticket named \"unknown\" to the chunk. It expires after 1 game tick (0.05 seconds). The load level depends on the step to which the game needs the chunk to generate, and it is always greater than 32. It is in various game calculations, such as mob AI, mob spawning, etc.\nFor example, when a generic mob wandering AI is executing, it asks if a certain block has a solid top surface. As part of that check, that chunk has an \"unknown\" ticket with level 33 placed on it. Similarly, commands such as , , , and generate an unknown ticket when reading data from or writing it to a previously loaded chunk; if run every tick, they can prevent the chunk from unloading until the world is reloaded.\nThe light ticket is only used for world generation, and has a level of 33. A chunk gets a light ticket when starting the light step of chunk generation, to ensure that it is accessible to calculate light. After the light calculation is completed, this ticket is removed.\nLimitations.\nTicking.\nThough respective game aspects are available if a chunk loaded to a certain level, whether these game aspects are processed depends not only on chunk loading. It is also subject to some other restrictions.\nChunk loading caused by a player ticket allows entities to be ticked only if the chunk is in a square around the chunk which has the player ticket, as defined by the formulas described below. Entity despawning is not affected by this.\nIn singleplayer, \"&lt;a href=\"Simulation%20distance\"&gt;Simulation Distance&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; decides the side length of the square. It follows the formula formula_3, where \"s\" is the selected simulation distance, and \"l\" is the side length (in chunks) of the square.\nIn multiplayer, \"simulation-distance\" configured in &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; decides the side length of the square. It also follows the same formula formula_3 where \"s\" is the configured \"simulation-distance\" and \"l\" is the side length of the square region.\nChunk loading caused by a player ticket allows block entities to be ticked and &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Scheduled_tick\"&gt;scheduled tick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Chunk_tick\"&gt;chunk tick&lt;/a&gt; (without mob spawning) to be processed only if the chunk is in the aforementioned square region along with a one-chunk-thick square frame surrounding this region. That is, a square region with side length of formula_5.\nFor example,\nTechnically, the above game aspects are controlled by another different ticket system named ticking ticket.\nIdle timeout.\nEach &lt;a href=\"Dimensions\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; has its own idle timeout. It increases 1 every game tick. If there are &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Commands/forceload\"&gt;forceloaded&lt;/a&gt; chunks in the dimension, the timeout is reset to 0 and disabled. When entity leaves or enters this dimension, the timeout is reset to 0.\nIf the timeout reaches 300 &lt;a href=\"Tick\"&gt;game ticks&lt;/a&gt;, the dimension stops processing certain actions. These include entity and block entity ticking, &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; fight, and global entities (&lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;).\nOthers.\nSome game aspects don't always get processed in loading chunks because there may be other conditions for their progress, which includes the following:\nExpections.\nEvents in a chunk may affect blocks in outside chunks. If the outside chunk is inactive, the effects are suspended in most cases. Specifically,\nBedrock Edition chunk loading.\nAll game aspects are active in loading chunks, including chunks within a player's &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt; and chunks loaded by &lt;a href=\"Commands/tickingarea\"&gt;Commands/tickingarea&lt;/a&gt;. Unloaded chunks are unprocessed by the game and do not process any of the game aspects.\nException.\nEvents in a ticking area may affect blocks in outside chunks. If the outside chunk is inactive, the effects are suspended in most cases. Specifically,\nFinding chunk edges.\nX and Z coordinates that are divisible by 16 represent the boundaries between chunks. EG: (96, -32) is a corner where four chunks meet. One of those chunks is between X coordinates 80 to 96 and Z coordinates -48 to -32. Another one is between X coordinates 96 to 112 and Z coordinates -32 to -16, and so on. When either X or Z crosses a multiple of 16, the player is moving across chunks. \nEssentially, the player is in the top-left corner (north-western) of a chunk when both X and Z coordinates are divisible by 16.\nAdditionally, the player can know the chunk they are on by this formula:&lt;br&gt;\nThe X of a chunk is floor(X coordinate / 16)&lt;br&gt;\nThe Z of a chunk is floor(Z coordinate / 16)&lt;br&gt;\nWhere floor is the largest previous integer. E.g. Floor( 27.9561 ) is 27 &lt;br&gt;\nIn other words, if X was 27, Z was \u221215 the chunk is chunk (Floor(27/16), Floor(\u221215/16)), meaning that the player is on chunk (1, \u22121).&lt;br&gt;\nAlso, the coordinates of a block within a chunk can be found by taking the coordinate mod 16.\n, the key can be used to display chunk boundaries. Alternately, pressing the \"F3\" button opens the &lt;a href=\"Debug%20screen\"&gt;Debug screen&lt;/a&gt; that shows the player's X, Y, and Z coordinates, in addition to the \"chunk\" variable. These coordinates change as the player moves around. The player can know the chunk they are in by the variable \"chunk\".\n, when toggling fancy graphics, the world renders again, loading only the chunk the player is in for a split second, briefly showing the chunk boundaries. When the player changes the render distance rapidly, chunk barriers appear as a blue line.\nAlso, if in mid-air and bridging with full blocks, the next block placed fades into view when a chunk border is intersected, showing the chunk border. This is sometimes unreliable, and it happens only on chunk borders. This does not happen underground or when the block placed is close to more than one block.\nSlime chunks.\n\"Slime chunks\" are specific chunks capable of spawning &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s below Y=40 regardless of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. These chunks are otherwise same as all other chunks.\nJava Edition.\nSlime chunks generate throughout the world (except in &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20island\"&gt;mushroom island&lt;/a&gt;s). 1 chunk in 10 is a slime chunk. These slime chunks are determined pseudo-randomly by combining their chunk coordinates with the &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;seed of the world&lt;/a&gt;:\nThat is, using the chunk coordinates to help generate a seed, a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive is generated, and if that number is 0, the chunk can spawn slimes. To convert world coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide by 16 and round down. Note that are 32-bit integers (&lt;samp&gt;int&lt;/samp&gt;s).\nBedrock Edition.\nThe slime chunk algorithm is different from . The algorithm doesn't depend on the world seed, thus the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in are the same for every world."}

They are stored in &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT format&lt;/a&gt;, with the following structure (updated for 1.18):\nBlock format.\nIn the Anvil format, block positions are ordered YZX for compression purposes.\nThe coordinate system is as follows:\nThis means indices are ordered like in a book, with its top to the North, read from beneath and with words written backward: each letter is a different X-index, each line a Z-index, and each page a Y-index. In case of a flat 2D array, the Y-index is omitted, and the array reads like a single page.\nEach section is a 16\u00d716\u00d716-block area, with up to 16 sections in a chunk : from 0 at the bottom, to 15 on top. Empty sections are not saved. Each section has a \"Y\" byte for its Y-index (0 to 15), a \"Palette\" list linking IDs to block states, and a \"BlockStates\" long array storing the IDs per block location, compressed by fitting multiple IDs inside each entry (see &lt;a href=\"Chunk_format%23NBT_structure\"&gt;NBT_structure&lt;/a&gt; above for details on the compression). There is an additional section at the top and bottom of the world used to store light, so that light travels properly over and under the world limits.\nThe \"BlockLight\" byte array is for block light levels. The \"SkyLight\" byte array stores the maximum sky light that reaches each block, regardless of current time. Each of them are 2048 bytes long, and both are omitted if no light reaches this section of the chunk. Light level is stored as 4 bits per block, 2 blocks sharing a byte : starting at 0, even blocks take the first nibble, and odd blocks the second one. This is the only known instance of data storage in Java Edition.\nThe pseudo-code below shows how to access individual block information from a single section.\nBlock entity format.\nA &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; (not related to &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;) is used by \"Minecraft\" to store information about a block that can't be stored in the block's block states. Block entities were called \"tile entities\" until the 1.18 snapshots and that term is still used in some &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; usage.\nTile tick format.\nTile Ticks represent block updates that need to happen because they could not happen before the chunk was saved. Examples reasons for tile ticks include redstone circuits needing to continue updating, water and lava that should continue flowing, recently placed sand or gravel that should fall, etc. Tile ticks are not used for purposes such as leaf decay, where the decay information is stored in the leaf block data values and handled by Minecraft when the chunk loads. For map makers, tile ticks can be used to update blocks after a period of time has passed with the chunk loaded into memory.\nToBeTicked format.\nThis TAG_List is always present, and contains 16 TAG_lists, each representing one of the \"sections\" of the chunk. Those inside lists may contain TAG_Shorts, each representing a packed coordinate relative to the section : The 4 most significant bits are always 0, then each group of 4 bits (or nibble) represents a section-relative coordinate, from 0 to 15. The order of sections in the list appear to be ordered from bottom to top, and the packing order of the coordinates is 0ZYX. When converting \"proto-chunks\" to full chunks, only coordinates that are stored in PostProcessing appear to receive a tick update, tick updates stored in \"block_ticks\" and \"fluid_ticks\" are ignored.

A table of the required parameters is below:\nThe simplest way to send a heartbeat is to open a TCP socket to port 80 on minecraft.net, and send the following (with the values changed, obviously):\nGET /heartbeat.jsp?port=25565&amp;max=32&amp;name=My%20Server&amp;public=True&amp;version=7&amp;salt=wo6kVAHjxoJcInKx&amp;users=0, plus a CRLF(Carriage-return and Line feed).\nMake sure any strings, like name, are escaped.\nIf everything goes well, in the response body you'll receive a URL to the server. Otherwise you'll get a nice HTML error message. There aren't any HTML headers to parse, as the HTTP version is not specified so HTTP/0.9 is used, which does not have headers.\nUser Authentication.\nThe \"key\" provided when a user joins the server can be compared to the MD5 checksum of the server's \"salt\" plus the username to verify that the user is logged in to minecraft.net with that username. This is useful for establishing enough trust of the name provided to ban or op the player by name.\n if( player.key == md5( server.salt + player.name ) ) {\n // player is logged in via minecraft.net\n } else {\n // player is forging the username\nThis is also the way that Notch prevents \"cracked,\" or pirated, clients from accessing online servers. When a cracked client tries to connect to an online server, an error will come up at the connection screen saying, \"Failed to Connect: User Not Premium\"\nNote: This means that you should make sure your \"salt\" is kept a secret and shared only with heartbeat.jsp. If your server's \"salt\" is visible anywhere to users, it is trivial for users to produce valid-looking \"key\"s without being logged in to minecraft.net.\nPacket Protocol.\nEvery packet starts with a byte representing the Packet ID.\nPlayer Position.\nFixed Point.\nPlayer position is represented via X, Y, and Z fixed-point coordinates. The fractional portion is 5 bits, so dividing the short integers received in position update packets by 32, you will have floating point coordinates for the player. This position corresponds to the center of the client viewport.\nStanding On Things.\nThe bottom of the player's feet is located 1.59375 (fixed-point: 51) units below the center of the viewport, so to position the player on top of a particular block you could send a teleport (0x08) packet specifying a Y value based on the block position as: (Y x 32 + 51)\nOrientation.\nA yaw value of 0 means the player is facing in the Z- (negative Z) direction. This value increases in a clockwise direction as seen from above. If we call the negative Z direction \"North\", then a yaw of 64 means \"East\", 128 means \"South\", and 192 means \"West\".\nA pitch value of 0 means level and this value increases in a downward direction. 64 is down, and 192 is up. Values of 65 to 191 should never occur because the player cannot look further up or down than the 64 \u2192 0, 255 \u2192 192 range. However, the Minecraft Classic client does not ignore invalid values, so it is possible to make players' heads \"upside-down\".\n&lt;a href=\"Color%20codes\"&gt;Color codes&lt;/a&gt;.\nMessages sent from the server to the client can contain color codes, which allow coloring of text for various purposes.\nAn ampersand symbol (&amp;) followed by a hex digit in the message tells the client to switch colors while displaying text. The current version of the game uses a section (\u00a7) symbol, but the 0.30 version uses ampersands. For the formatting codes for the current version of the game, see &lt;a href=\"Formatting%20codes\"&gt;Formatting codes&lt;/a&gt;.\nColor coding at the start of the message will only work if the player ID byte is less than 127. If it's 127 or higher, the game automatically adds &amp;e before the message, making it yellow. However, color codes after the first character still work. If you use an ID below 127, it doesn't add a color code, so the ones you use will work."}

Cobwebs also diffuse sky &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlocks can be placed on cobwebs. &lt;a href=\"Painting\"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s can be placed on their sides, or on top in the case of signs.\nDespite being slowed down by them, mobs do not try to pathfind around cobwebs, which can be exploited to construct clever mob traps.\nThey can be useful in PvP servers, where a player can quickly erect a barrier of cobwebs that can trap players, or force them to destroy the cobwebs. They are also useful in traps that are deliberately intended to troll players, such as a long pitfall with cobwebs and lava at the bottom.\nRedstone circuits.\nCobwebs can be used as a delaying mechanism in a redstone circuit, for example, to delay an item falling on a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; or into a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be used to cancel random momentum of an item thrown from a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; by placing them directly on their face.\nEffects.\nAll mobs except for &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s experience slow movement through a cobweb. A mob falling through a cobweb takes 13 seconds to move down 1 block. A cobweb can partially stop blast damage if a player and the entity causing the &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; are both caught in the cobweb. The slowing effect of the cobweb increases if it is placed on &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe slowest a player can move in vanilla Minecraft without commands or other third-party tools is by placing cobwebs on Blue Ice, sneaking, drinking a level IV Turtle Master Potion, and blocking, which causes the player come to a near-total standstill, moving only a single block every few minutes.\nA cobweb affects the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s movement abilities, as well. While in contact with it, the player can move at a speed of about 15% of the normal &lt;a href=\"Player%23Movement\"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; speed. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"jumping\"&gt;jumping&lt;/a&gt; vibrates the player akin to jumping in a 2-block-high space. A cobweb also limits the rate at which a player can &lt;a href=\"breaking\"&gt;break&lt;/a&gt; blocks. Like &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, falling into a cobweb prevents a player from taking &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;, meaning a fatal fall can be mitigated with cobwebs. Attacking while falling through cobwebs counts as a critical hit, the same as when falling after a jump.\n&lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt; thrown into a cobweb are slowed and fall through it after a maximum of about 24 seconds depending on where it enters. They do not merge with other items of the same type thrown on the ground.\nCobwebs have different effects on moving &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"falling%20block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt; that enters a cobweb slows down, then drops as an item after existing for 30 seconds. An &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; shot at a cobweb passes through without being slowed.\nA &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; with no players in it takes about 9 seconds to fall through a cobweb if a &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; is placed directly under the cobweb, however, if there is air between the cobweb and the rail, the minecart takes about 34 seconds to fall. Every extra cobweb added gives an additional 25 seconds of falling time. Players are unaffected by cobwebs when in a minecart unless they come into direct contact.\nCobwebs can be placed before a fall to prevent &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;."}

With no power, it appears as a very dark red, whereas it appears bright red at full power.\nPotion cauldrons.\nPotions placed in cauldrons also use colors to represent the contained potion.\nConstant colors.\nA small subclass of blocks use colors which do not change at all under any circumstances. Why this is done is unknown, as a colored texture with no color would achieve the exact same visual outcome and allow for further customizability with resource packs.\nEntities.\nDyed sheep.\nSheep colors do not seem to match dye colors or firework star colors directly one to one, they differ slightly.\nWolf and cat collars.\nBoth wolf and cat collars use the &lt;a href=\"Dye%23Color%20values\"&gt;dye colors&lt;/a&gt; directly one to one.\nExperience orbs.\n&lt;a href=\"Experience%20orb\"&gt;Experience orb&lt;/a&gt; textures are mostly white, gray, and red; a gradient is applied afterward to make them green and yellow.\nOther.\nParticles.\nAlongside potion particles, several other &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s are stored as gray textures with colors applied to them after the fact. Notable examples are the various dripping particles (water, lava, honey, crying obsidian, spore blossom), critical hit (which has a white texture but an orange color is later applied), and magic crit (same).\nNote blocks also emit particles, whose base texture is gray, that change color through the spectrum.\nCommands can be used to set the colors of some but not all particles.\nBanners.\nBanners are colored according to default &lt;a href=\"Dye%23Color%20values\"&gt;dye colors&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeacon Beam.\nBeacon beams are colored according to default &lt;a href=\"Dye%23Color%20values\"&gt;dye colors&lt;/a&gt;. Without any stained class, it defaults to the color for white dye.\nEnd gateway beam.\nThe &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt; creates a beam under certain circumstances which is colored different colors depending on why said beam is created.\nGuardian beam.\nWhen attacking, &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s shoot a ranged beam which follows a gradient dependent on time.\nWorld border.\nThe &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt; has several colors. A blue color is applied if the border is stationary. If expanding, the world border takes on a green hue. If the world border is shrinking, the world border turns red. In the Nether, the world border is always red no matter if it is expanding, stationary, or shrinking. The world border becomes more opaque the closer the player is to it, and more transparent if the player is further away.\nBiome colors.\nThe temperature and downfall values of a biome are used when determining the colors of a selection of blocks: &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, some &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, and other features such as &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and the sky. Blocks such as &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mossy%20stone%20bricks\"&gt;mossy stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, and the stems of &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s are not affected by biome coloration.\nBiome grass and foliage colors are selected from two 256\u00d7256 colormap images: grass.png and foliage.png. Both colormaps can be found in codice_1 or codice_2. The grass.png colormap sets the colors for the &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; top and overlay sides, grass, tall grass, fern, tall fern. Meanwhile, the foliage.png colormap sets the colors for oak, jungle, acacia, dark oak, and mangrove leaves.\nBiome colormaps use a triangular gradient by default. However, only the colors in the lower-left half of the image are used, even though the upper-right side of foliage.png is colored. Furthermore, as shown in the template image to the left, a select few pixels are considered when the colormap is read by the game, and are determined by the code below.\nThe temperature and downfall values are used when determining the biome color to select from the colormap. Treating the bottom-right corner of the colormap as temperature = 0.0 and downfall = 0.0, the adjusted temperature increases to 1.0 along the X-axis, and the adjusted downfall increases to 1.0 along the Y-axis. The clamp limits the range of the temperature and downfall to 0.0\u20131.0. The clamped downfall value is then multiplied by the 0.0\u20131.0 adjusted temperature value, bringing its value to be inside the lower left triangle. Some biomes' ranges are shown in the template above; the multiplication makes all the line segments point toward the lower right corner.\nAt borders between or among biomes, the colors of the block and its eight neighbors are computed and the average is used for the final block color.\n, biome colors are also visible on &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHard-coded colors.\nCertain biome colors are hard-coded, which means they are locked into the \"Minecraft\" code and are not retrievable from any texture file. Thus, they cannot be modified without the use of &lt;a href=\"mod\"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"shaders\"&gt;shaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nSwamp color.\nSwamp temperature, which starts at 0.8, is not affected by &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise\"&gt;Perlin noise function&lt;/a&gt; is used to gradually vary the temperature of the swamp. When this temperature goes below \u22120.1, a lush green color is used (); otherwise it is set to a sickly brown ().\nDark forest color.\nThe dark forest biomes' grass color is retrieved normally, then &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_%28computing%29\"&gt;bit masked&lt;/a&gt; with the number #FEFEFE, and averaged with a dark green color () to produce the final color.\nBadlands color.\nAll badlands biomes' grass and foliage have hard-coded colors, which are two tan colors ( and respectively). These are not modifiable by grass.png and foliage.png, and are unaffected by temperature.\nOther colors.\nSeveral other biome colors are set into the game and currently require external tools in order to be changed. This includes blocks such as birch and spruce leaves and water (which have a hard-coded overlay set onto them), and other features such as the sky and fog."}

The chance for melon seeds to drop increases with the stem's age.\nNatural generation.\nMelon stems generate naturally in stem farm inside &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMelon stems generate in 20% of the farm plots in &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, and 10% of the farm plots in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; villages.\nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s sell melon seeds for 1 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nFarming.\nMelon seeds can be planted only on &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, as stems. Over time, a stem grows through several stages[\"\"] and, at its final growth stage, will produce &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s on any adjacent &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coarse%20Dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rooted%20Dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20Mangrove%20Roots\"&gt;muddy mangrove roots&lt;/a&gt;. If a melon is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem it does not grow more melons until the melons is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of melons. Melon stems need a minimum light level of 10 in the block above the stem to grow and give melons. Melon seeds are affected by &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual melons.\nBreeding.\nLike other seeds, melon seeds can be used to &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.\nTaming.\nLike other seeds, melon seeds can be used to tame &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nComposting.\nPlacing melon seeds into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nMelon Stem.\nA melon stem is the block that is planted on &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt; when melon seeds are used on it. It starts underground, and rises up as the plant grows. The stem is colored green when young, and then yellow once fully grown.\nThe stem curves once a melon has grown from it. A fully-grown single stem connects to any &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt; in an adjacent square, thus there are 5 possible appearances to a stem. If there are multiple melons it can connect to, it favors the east, then west, north, and south. When the melon is removed, the stem returns to its straight shape."}

Minecarts can also be retrieved with one attack from a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; provided the player's attack cooldown is reset. A minecart is also destroyed if it makes contact with a &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, or if shot with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and arrow.\nEntity loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20command%20block\"&gt;Minecart with command block&lt;/a&gt;s can be given to the player with the command or through the Creative inventory under certain conditions; &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20monster%20spawner\"&gt;minecart with monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s are available only via the command. Each drop 1 minecart when broken.\nUsage.\nA minecart can be placed in the same manner as most blocks but can be placed only on top of a &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;. Once placed, it may be derailed by pushing it off the end of the track. After this, it can be railed again by placing a rail directly below it or pushing it onto a track.\nTransportation.\nMinecarts can be ridden by on them. Once inside, an external impulse may be needed to make the minecart start moving. The player can slowly move the minecart forward while riding it, by pressing . If a mob walks in front of an empty minecart, it is pulled into the cart.\nAfter rolling off of the end of a track, a minecart can be pushed around on open blocks. If a minecart is pushed onto or falls onto tracks, it \"snaps\" to those tracks. When riding a minecart, if the minecart lands on a rail, the player does not take any fall damage. \nUnlike with &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied minecart.\nDismounting.\nPlayers can exit the minecart by pressing . When a player or mob dismounts a minecart, either by choice, by breaking the minecart, or by passing over an &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;, the minecart tries to find a safe ejection destination one block away. First it checks the eight horizontally adjacent blocks in the following order of priority relative to direction of travel: right, left, rear right, rear left, front right, front left, rear, front. A valid destination has a block underneath with a solid (not necessarily full) top surface and a space with enough headroom and width for the passenger to fit in when standing at the center. The space can even contain liquid or have open trapdoors if the mob is slim enough, and presence of other mobs doesn't matter. If no valid destination exists on same horizontal level, the minecart then checks the blocks one above, then one below. For a player, the minecart also checks for crawlable destinations. If still none, the minecart chooses its own location. Once the minecart picks a destination, it actually ejects the passenger one block up in the air and the passenger settles down on its own. Under a low ceiling this may cause one tick of suffocation damage. The air drop exists to allow passengers to land on carpet or bottom slabs.\nBehavior.\nSpeed.\nMinecarts have a predefined speed limit of exactly 8 blocks per second. However, this speed limit does not change the minecart's speed value but instead limits how far a minecart can travel each tick to 0.4 blocks. Therefore, a minecart moving from powered rail to normal rail will move at constant speed for some time until decelerating because its internal speed value is over its speed limit of 8. However, the maximum speed can be changed by the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Powered%20rail\"&gt;Powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s powered by redstone give minecarts a boost of speed. Speed is gradually decreased (due to drag) if there are no powered rails to assist its movement, and an unpowered powered rail slows down a minecart rapidly. The speed decreases at a faster rate when going uphill, compared to when moving horizontally. A minecart does not need powered rails to assist its movement down a hill.\nAnything in the way of the minecart brings it to a stop. Once a minecart has left the track, it rapidly decelerates within one or two blocks. When mobs touch a minecart, they affect it in the same way a player would, i.e. mobs that move up against a still cart set it in motion.\nIf a minecart is moving fast enough, it can skip across one block without a track and reattach to track on the other side, at significantly reduced energy and speed. A minecart's hitbox can skip turns if the minecart is boosted using enough powered rails.\nThe speed and momentum of a minecart can differ depending on whether or not it is empty, and in the case where a minecart has a container, the speed can differ depending on the quantity and type of items inside.\nMerged minecarts.\n, two or more minecarts can be merged by pushing them into each other so that they overlap. Merged minecarts move as a collective, like a train, and can be useful for long-distance transport because while moving in a straight line, they \"do not need powered rails to keep their speed\".\nTo summarize:\nDistance traveled by empty carts starting on a downward slope.\nThis table shows the distance traveled by an unoccupied minecart on a downward slope, with a boost (or no boost). The most efficient way is to use only 1 boost at the bottom of the incline on the flat surface. Using 2 increases distance by about 20% or 1.5 blocks. All distance trends based on the height seem to be logarithmic.\nThe carts started from rest, on a slope Height blocks up.\nCollision.\nMinecarts are about the same size as a block (1\u00d71). Because of this, a ladder, door, or trapdoor prevents it from falling down a 1\u00d71 hole. Carts on &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s also ignore collision in certain situations. A cart traveling uphill, downhill, or on a curve with a block placed in front of it, goes through the block.\nA minecart that reaches the end of a rail up against an opaque solid block bounces back, but if the block is transparent then it stops. The minecart can even bounce against an opaque block from a standstill if the rail underneath is powered. A player or mob riding in a minecart does not collide with or suffocate in any transparent blocks but suffocates inside opaque blocks.\nMinecarts are completely unaffected by &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt;; they can also be destroyed by coming in contact with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Minecarts can even be pushed by flowing water.\nMobs.\nMobs can ride minecarts, but cannot control them. Mobs cannot exit the minecart unless the minecart is destroyed or moves onto an active &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;. However, , &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; are able to teleport out of minecarts.\nA mob can ride a minecart when pushing by a moving minecart on rails or when colliding with a minecart . It is easier to pick up a mob when a minecart is turning. , &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s can also be picked up.\nMost mobs can be picked up by minecarts, except &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s. , &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be picked up either.\nA &lt;a href=\"jockey\"&gt;jockey&lt;/a&gt; riding a minecart automatically accelerates the minecart. Mobs in minecarts don't despawn, and don't count towards the mob cap.\nBoats.\nDue to the bug , &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s can be captured by minecarts. When a boat is placed in a minecart, the minecart travels faster on rails, approximately as fast as on powered rails. The movement in the boat minecart is glitchy and moving forward with the W key moves the cart backward relative to the player, and vice versa for moving backward with the S key. The minecart also moves on the rail-less ground at a crawling speed, but it does not float in the water despite being in a boat. \nUsing this glitch can be far more resource-efficient since the boat minecart can move at the speed of a powered rail track on flat ground and on slopes. Another physics glitch with the boat minecart is the extreme reduction in friction when the minecart is on rails, which is similar to the lack of friction when a boat is riding on ice. This glitch can be done in Survival without cheats simply by pushing a minecart into a boat on the track. This bug is now patched.\nSounds.\nMinecarts use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nMinecarts have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity."}

It can be powered with &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; to propel it across a &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; line for a limited time, which can be used to move other minecarts.\nObtaining.\nMinecarts with furnace can be retrieved by attacking them, and by doing so it drops as an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nMinecarts with furnaces are placed in the same way as other minecarts. It does not have a graphical user interface, unlike a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinecarts with furnaces can be powered, done by feeding fuel (&lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;) into the furnace minecart with the button. The fuel is consumed immediately and it starts to move in the same direction the player clicked toward. Pressing always turns it to that direction, even when not holding coal.\nAny piece of fuel, added at any time, increases the total range by an additional 3600 ticks (equal to 180 seconds or 3 minutes). The upper limit is 32767 ticks, approximately 27 minutes.\nWhen powered, minecarts with furnaces cover 240m per minute (about 4\u00a0m/s, slightly slower than walking speed) or 720m per piece of coal. They do not accelerate beyond this speed when going downhill or on active &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s, and as long as they remain powered, they do not slow down when going uphill, on inactive powered rails, or when pushing or pulling other minecarts.\nIf a powered furnace minecart is derailed and then pushed back onto a rail, it starts moving again in the direction it came from, so they are not easily turned around in this state unless a player is nearby to redirect it with .\nMinecarts with furnaces can climb up steep inclines while pushing other minecarts as long as they have fuel. If a minecart with furnace reaches a slope while pulling another minecart, the pulled minecart is switched to the forward position so that it can be pushed along the slope instead of pulled.\nWhen a minecart with furnace bumps into another minecart or multiple minecarts, the other minecarts are pushed forward with great speed. The furnace minecart continues on with its own speed. Because of this speed difference, some of the minecarts may end up inside unloaded chunks on straight tracks.\nTrain mechanics.\nA furnace minecart can be made to pull up to four other minecarts. All minecarts in this train move at the constant speed of the furnace minecart. Trains are formed when a minecart is pushed into the back of a powered furnace minecart or a short-enough train. These shunts are fragile at best and easily come undone, but some methods are stronger than others. For example, pushing a minecart into a furnace minecart and then powering the furnace gives a weaker shunt than pushing the furnace minecart into the other minecart against a wall, and then powering the furnace in the other direction.\nA high-speed minecart running into the back of a furnace minecart going in the same direction automatically creates a weak shunt with it, pulling it along.\nPulling a minecart with TNT causes it to explode.\nWhen a train comes to a turn, the shunt comes undone with the pulled minecart jettisoned backward. The correct way to make such a turn is having the shunt undone before a turn, and then make the two rejoin on a straight rail later by having the pulled cart catch up with the minecart with furnace.\nSince the train runs slower on a fully powered track than a normal minecart (~5 m/s compared to 8m/s), a train pulled by an unpowered furnace minecart is ideal for AFK farms involving breaking or placing blocks like &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;.\nProperties.\nThe coal is not stored as an item in the entity, but in the object data in the fuel property as a time in ticks. \"Fuel\" is a short value, i.e. a maximum of 32767 ticks, which is about 27 minutes. However, alone doesn't make it go since it doesn't have a direction. It can be right-clicked on a track to give it a direction, or it can be summoned with the properties \"PushX\" and \"PushZ\" set, which are responsible for the direction. The codice_1 property of every entity allows for movement of the minecart, but it does not direct the minecart to move on its own.\nSounds.\nMinecarts with furnaces use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nMinecarts with furnace have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity."}

In Bedrock Edition, a minecart with hopper on curved rail pulls in items in a hopper lying in front of its moving direction and 1 block above if hopper's output funnel is pointed downward and no block is below that hopper.\nThe hopper can be disabled by passing over a powered &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;, and can be reenabled by an inactive activator rail.\nAn empty minecart with hopper can travel more than 85 blocks without stopping (as opposed to a normal cart going less than 12 blocks) from a dead stop using a 2 powered track starter even with another cart in front of them. However, the distance traveled by a minecart with hopper depends on the hopper's load. Using a 1 powered rail starter track, a minecart with an empty hopper travels 64 blocks until it stops (as opposed to an empty normal minecart going 8 blocks). The distance traveled diminishes non-linearly with increased hopper load; a minecart with a full hopper can travel only 16 blocks in this setup.\nSounds.\nMinecarts with hoppers use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nMinecarts with hoppers have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity."}

For other causes there is a random delay between 0 and 1.9 seconds, but more likely to be close to 1.\nIt detonates instantly on these conditions:\nUpon detonation it acts as normal TNT, &lt;a href=\"exploding\"&gt;exploding&lt;/a&gt; and damaging nearby blocks, players, and entities. Upon detonation after activating on activator rail, it does not destroy its rails and the blocks the rail is on, however other nearby carts can. More than one minecart can be placed on the same rail block, allowing many of them to fit into a single block. They explode when touched, dealing large amounts of damage.\nThe explosion has a base &lt;a href=\"Explosion%23Explosion%20strength\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; of 4, the same as regular TNT, but the game also adds a random bonus value up to 1.5 times velocity, but no higher than 7.5. This means that with a speed of 5 or higher the power will be a random value between 4 and 11.5. When triggered by an activator rail or by damage, the bonus value is calculated using the horizontal velocity of the minecart. When hit by a flaming arrow the velocity of the arrow is used instead. When triggered by fall damage, the fall distance divided by 10 is used.\nMinecarts with TNT bounce off of other minecarts and cannot be linked to &lt;a href=\"minecarts%20with%20furnace\"&gt;minecarts with furnace&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSounds.\nMinecarts with TNT use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nMinecarts with TNT have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity."}

Mining can involve &lt;a href=\"digging\"&gt;digging&lt;/a&gt; a hole from the surface or going down through a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mineshaft\"&gt;Mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s create extra areas that may contain resources, since they are usually rich in ores.\nCrafting and smelting.\n&lt;a href=\"Crafting\"&gt;Crafting&lt;/a&gt; allows players to create new &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s using items from their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequent versions often contain crafting &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s for new blocks and &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. A player can use the 2\u00d72 grid in the inventory or the 3\u00d73 grid provided by a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; to craft. Smelting requires a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; in addition to fuel and processes blocks into a more useful form such as from &lt;a href=\"raw%20iron\"&gt;raw iron&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, which can then be crafted into iron &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s and iron &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrewing and enchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Brewing\"&gt;Brewing&lt;/a&gt; creates &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s from various ingredients and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;. They are stored in a &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt; and then consumed by the player or thrown at other mobs to generate a certain effect based on the magical ingredients used to create the &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; is also used to upgrade &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, tools or &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s with an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. More powerful enchantments can be accessed by gaining &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and placing &lt;a href=\"Bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; around the enchanting table.\nMobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s (short for \"mobiles\") are the animals and other creatures that inhabit the map. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Hostile&lt;/a&gt; mobs attack the player while passive mobs do not. Neutral mobs attack when provoked (not all neutral mobs are provoked the same way).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; contains many passive mobs that may be killed for &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;bred&lt;/a&gt; with one another; these include:\nMobs that drop food drop the raw version of their &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; unless killed while on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommon hostile mobs found throughout the Overworld include:\nThe Overworld also contains some rarer mobs that spawn only on occasion or in specific &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, places or times:\nSome are found exclusively in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, including:\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; contains the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, which is the main boss mob in \"Minecraft\" and allows the player to exit back to the Overworld when it dies, as well as &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, block-like mobs that shoot homing bullets at the player which inflict the &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation effect&lt;/a&gt;. They also drop their &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20Shell\"&gt;shells&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the player to craft &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es.\ns are the second boss mob in \"Minecraft\" and are created by the player by placing &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton%20skull\"&gt;wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt;s on top of &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; in a specific pattern. When spawned, they shoot wither skulls at nearby non-&lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs, while also causing any mob hit by the skulls to get the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28effect%29\"&gt;Wither effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nether.\nThe Nether is a dimension in \"Minecraft\" accessible from the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of five unique &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, which are the &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;crimson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Forest\"&gt;warped forests&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt;s. Each biome has unique generation and terrain. It is populated by &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglins\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s. Ores in the Nether include &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Gold%20Ore\"&gt;nether gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;. The Nether also has large oceans of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s walking on them.\nThe End.\nThe End is another dimension of the game where the player battles the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. The End is accessed by entering an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; found in a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. The End is composed of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; and is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;. It also contains tall &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20pillar\"&gt;obsidian pillar&lt;/a&gt;s on top of which are &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s that heal the ender dragon. Once the ender dragon is slain, the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; is created in the center of the map and an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway%20portal\"&gt;end gateway portal&lt;/a&gt; is created near an edge of the map, which transports the player to the expansive &lt;a href=\"outer%20End%20islands\"&gt;outer End islands&lt;/a&gt; which are full of &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt; forests and &lt;a href=\"End%20City\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt; filled of &lt;a href=\"chest%20loot\"&gt;chest loot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s. The end gateway portal is only accessed by throwing an &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s to enter the portal. There are no ores in the End. \nMultiplayer (\"Java\").\n\"Minecraft\" multiplayer servers have developed to include their own rules and customs, guided by their &lt;a href=\"admin\"&gt;admin&lt;/a&gt;istrators and moderators. The term &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Griefing\"&gt;griefer&lt;/a&gt;, meaning a player who causes grief, is a typical term on the internet but has taken up its definition on \"Minecraft\" servers: a person who destroys or defiles other users' creations on servers. \nGriefers are the reason many server administrators make rules, but this has been taken a step further with modifications to the \"Minecraft\" server and even plugin-based replacement servers such as . Because of these plugin-based servers, new user-created features have shown up in \"Minecraft\". This includes features like money, vehicles, protection, RPG elements and more. These features normally do not require modification to a user's client and can be accessed by using chat commands. With the default controls, the chat screen is brought up by pressing .\nOne popular game on multiplayer servers is &lt;a href=\"Spleef\"&gt;Spleef&lt;/a&gt; (a play on the word \"grief\"), a game where the player aims to make another player drop through the floor by destroying blocks beneath the opponent's feet. This is typically played in a designated area and is usually run automatically using server plugins.\nMany popular multiplayer servers exist that may contain, PvP arenas, custom &lt;a href=\"minigames\"&gt;minigames&lt;/a&gt; or large &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; worlds.\nMultiplayer (\"Bedrock\").\nMultiplayer differs from multiplayer on the \"Java Edition\" in that it is centered around a friend system. A player can add friends through the Friends tab in the menu or in the pause screen of a world. A player may invite friends to a world instead of having to pay for a server or realm. \"Minecraft\" has &lt;a href=\"featured%20servers\"&gt;featured servers&lt;/a&gt; on \"Bedrock\", which means that they are available when opening the game. There are six featured servers: The Hive, CubeCraft, Lifeboat, Mineville, Galaxite, Enchanted Dragons, and Pixel Paradise.\n\"Minecraft\" Realms.\n\"Minecraft\" Realms is an official subscription-based &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; hosting service that allows players to create and manage their own private \"Minecraft\" multiplayer worlds. Hosted by &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt;, Realms provides an easy and fast way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without prior knowledge of the concepts for hosting on the internet. However, Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server. Private Realms servers are easy to set up and available 24/7 as long as the owner pays for it.\nEditions.\n\"Java Edition\".\nThe original platform for \"Minecraft\", running on Windows, macOS, and Linux and started through the \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt;\". The game was initially released for an \"early private singleplayer alpha\" on May 17, 2009, followed by several development stages (notably Classic, Indev, Infdev, Alpha, Beta) with the game finally being released on November 18, 2011. The \"Java Edition\" has seen many significant updates since its official release.\n\"Bedrock Edition\".\nThe Bedrock Edition (also known as the Bedrock Platform, Bedrock Codebase or Bedrock Engine) refers to the multi-platform family of editions of \"Minecraft\" developed by &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; and . Prior to this term, as the engine originated with \"Minecraft: Pocket Edition\", this entire product family has been referred to using as \"Pocket Edition\", \"MCPE\" or \"Pocket/Windows 10 Edition\". \nMinecraft, with no subtitle, is the title of all \"Bedrock\" editions of \"Minecraft\". Before the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;, it had different subtitles on different platforms including (for all mobile platforms), &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;\"Console Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;, , , and .\n\"Minecraft: Pocket Edition\" was initially launched exclusively for the on Google Play for US$6.99 on August 16, 2011. It was later released for other devices on October 7, 2011, and on November 17, 2011. On September 13, 2012, the \"Pocket Edition\" was made available for purchase on the Amazon Appstore. The version was released on the Windows Phone Store on December 10, 2014, for which the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;Pocket Edition 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; release and newer are available only for Windows 10 Phone and newer. Since then, four adaptations of \"Pocket Edition\" have been released; for &lt;a href=\"Windows%2010%20Edition\"&gt;Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; on July 29, 2015, the &lt;a href=\"Gear%20VR%20Edition\"&gt;Gear VR&lt;/a&gt; on April 27, 2016, &lt;a href=\"Apple%20TV%20Edition\"&gt;tvOS&lt;/a&gt; on December 19, 2016, and the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20TV%20Edition\"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt; on December 19, 2016. As of September 24, 2018, the has been discontinued.\nLegacy Console Edition.\nLegacy Console Edition refers to the editions of \"Minecraft\" for consoles that are developed and updated by &lt;a href=\"4J%20Studios\"&gt;4J Studios&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Legacy Console Edition was initially announced for the on June 7, 2011, during . released digitally on May 9, 2012 followed by a physical release on June 4, 2013. The game was later released on additional platforms as on December 17, 2013, on September 4, 2014, on September 5, 2014, on October 14, 2014, on December 17, 2015, and on May 11, 2017. As of December 10, 2019, no further feature updates have been released for these versions, and the newest available update depends on the platform. The most recent update on and is the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Color%20Update\"&gt;World of Color Update&lt;/a&gt;, while , , , and have access to &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt;. is the most up-to-date version with &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Minecraft Education\".\n\"Minecraft Education\" is an educational version of \"Minecraft\" specifically designed for classroom use. It is developed by Mojang Studios and Xbox Game Studios and contains features that make \"Minecraft\" easy to use in a classroom setting. The full game was released on November 1, 2016.\n\"New Nintendo 3DS Edition\".\n\"Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition\" was released on September 13, 2017 for the New Nintendo 3DS/2DS systems. It is a unique port developed by &lt;a href=\"Other%20Ocean%20Interactive\"&gt;Other Ocean Interactive&lt;/a&gt;. Multiplayer is limited to local play. This edition was discontinued on January 15, 2019.\nOther.\nThere are a number of other versions of \"Minecraft\". is a simple version of \"Minecraft\" in the style of other \"4k\" Java games (everything is packaged in 4 kibibytes) that Notch has entered in contests. &lt;a href=\"Pi%20Edition\"&gt;\"Minecraft: Pi Edition\"&lt;/a&gt; was a free ported version of the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20version%20history%230.5.0\"&gt;0.5.0 version&lt;/a&gt; of for the , which was intended as an educational tool for novice programmers. It allowed users to manipulate the game code and supported multiple programming languages; however, it was discontinued in January 2016. &lt;a href=\"China%20Edition\"&gt;\"Minecraft: China Edition\"&lt;/a&gt; is a localized version of \"Minecraft\" for mainland China.\nGame customization.\nAdd-ons.\nAdd-ons are the first step toward bringing customization to all editions of \"Minecraft\" and are officially supported by &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt;/\"Minecraft\". They currently allow players to transform the look of their worlds, change the behavior of mobs, and add entities, items and blocks, structures, functions and biomes.\nBehavior packs.\nBehavior packs change how vanilla mobs and fogs behave. They are still in development, and will soon also be able to modify how blocks and items work.\nResource packs.\nThe game officially supports changing most of its various textures, sounds, and texts through resource packs. Resource packs must contain a certain structure of files and folders placed in the &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\".minecraft\"&gt;.minecraft&lt;/a&gt;/resourcepacks&lt;/samp&gt; folder. Installed resource packs, as well as the folder in which resource packs are placed, can be accessed in the options menu. The extent to which the resources are changed is dependent on how many files are contained in the resource pack.\nData packs.\nData packs provide a way for players to further customize vanilla worlds in a similar way to resource packs. Unlike resource packs, which modify the game's resources, data packs can be used to override or add new advancements, functions, loot tables, structures, recipes and tags without any code modification.\nSkins.\nSkin refers to the texture that is placed onto a player model or mob.\nThe skin is divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (for example, the front head area, left leg area, etc.). A skin allows only solid color; transparency is not allowed on the skin file except on the second layer, which is transparent by default; playing offline, pixels can be left free resulting in \"holes\" in the skin. The second layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories. Players can also change the arm size to be slim or normal. The slim variant is 3 pixels wide while the normal variant is 4 pixels wide.\n\"Java Edition\".\n, there are no special features in the skins. This version has only the features listed in the first part of this section.\n\"Bedrock Edition\".\n, there are many more types of skin customization. &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s can add 3D custom hair, eyes, mouths, arms, legs and more. Players can also change the size of a character. Players can also get many different accessories for the skin. However, the player cannot do this with a custom skin, only with an in-game skin. Players can also buy accessories and skins. Having a skin that is smaller than normal or larger does not affect the hitbox size, but can still give an advantage in multiplayer servers because it can be harder to see them. Some of the skins also do not show their armor or hand-held &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCapes.\nCapes are an uncommon vanity item that can be equipped on a player's back. , players start with a cape that is not equipped by default and some skins come with capes.\nCapes also flail around when the player runs. When the player equips elytra, the texture of the elytra changes to an equipped cape.\nUnofficial mods.\n\"Minecraft\" can be modified by replacing or adding Java class files to &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; . This method of making custom modifications is not supported by Mojang as it can break the game if the mod is outdated, defective, or in conflict with another mod. Some such modifications impressed Notch or Jeb sufficiently that they were added to the game and the authors were credited under Additional Programming. Some examples of mods being implemented into the main game include Hippoplatimus' &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt; Mod and horses from Dr. Zhark's Mo' Creatures mod were added in &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7\"&gt;Beta 1.7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;1.6.1&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nThird-party programs.\nThere are many programs designed for \"Minecraft\". These include 3D map editors and viewers, game modifiers, various informational programs (such as crafting recipes) and server wrappers, and other specialty programs. As with Minecraft mods, these too are not supported by Mojang.\nReception.\n ranked \"Minecraft\" as one of the best video games of the 2010s, and Video Game Canon ranks \"Minecraft\" as one of the best games of all time.\nAwards.\nSince release \"Minecraft\" has won numerous awards including:\nReferences in popular culture.\nMany references have been made in culture in response to the popularity of \"Minecraft\", this includes many &lt;a href=\"https%3A//knowyourmeme.com/search%3Fq%3Dminecraft\"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; and also references in these video games, TV shows, and movies.\nVideo.\n&lt;jwplayer media-id=\"9ix6EBF4\" /&gt;"}

This setting can still be changed via commands, so players have the option to set the spawn chunk size to the one prior to the 1.20.5 version.\nNormally, old &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s beyond player's chunk loading distance get unloaded from the memory and new chunks get loaded into the memory. Because of this, events such as &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; mechanisms and farms in unloaded chunks stop processing. Since spawn chunks remain loaded, events occurring in them continue to process, even if no players are nearby. If the world spawn is set to a laggy area using commands, such as an area with many redstone clocks, lag is present wherever the player is in the world.\nBehavior.\nThe so-called \"spawn chunks\" behavior arises from a &lt;a href=\"chunk%23Ticket%20types\"&gt;start ticket&lt;/a&gt; which is created for the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23World%20spawn\"&gt;world spawn&lt;/a&gt; chunk. This ticket has a level of 22 which \"propagates,\" or flows, to neighboring chunks. Each time the level flows, it increases its level by 1 until the maximum of 34 is reached. This behavior is illustrated by the picture to the right.\nDifferent levels of propagation have different behaviors. These levels are divided into 4 load types.\nLimitations.\nThere are some limitations which may affect the behavior of spawn chunks.\nEach &lt;a href=\"Dimensions\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; has its own \"idle timeout.\" Without a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Commands/forceload\"&gt;forceloaded&lt;/a&gt; chunks in the overworld, this timeout eventually expires. When the timeout expires, some behaviors such as entity processing stop for spawn chunks and the rest of the dimension. The timeout can be reset by frequently sending entities through a portal.\nOnly chunks with horizontal distance between its center and a player less than 128 blocks are ticked on every game tick. This stops events caused by random ticking, such as crop growth.\nChanging location.\nA new world spawn point can be set using . If no coordinates are provided, the block position that the player is currently standing on becomes the spawn point. The chunk where the world spawn is located is then given a start ticket with a level of 22 and the ticket for the old spawn chunks is cleared."}

Players who have any &lt;a href=\"permission%20level\"&gt;permission level&lt;/a&gt; except for level 1 are able to bypass it and build anyway. There are several indirect ways to bypass spawn protection, namely activating pistons, dispensers, explosives and using mob griefing. If there are no ops on the server, then spawn protection does not apply. Spawn protection only applies in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. Spawn protection does not apply in singleplayer.\nThe codice_1 field in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; determines the side length of the square spawn protection area as 2\"x\"+1. Setting this to 0 or a negative value disables the spawn protection. A value of 1 protects a 3\u00d73 square centered on the spawn point, 2 protects 5\u00d75, 3 protects 7\u00d77, etc. The area that it protects is (spawn-protection\u00d72 + 1)\u00d7(spawn-protection\u00d72 + 1)."}

It is not available in the settings, and although is listed as a gamemode in the suggestion list of the command, using causes it to throw an error: .\nInvisibility.\nSpectators are not noticed by &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, and do not trigger mob &lt;a href=\"spawning\"&gt;spawning&lt;/a&gt; (including from &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s), nor do they prevent mob despawning, but they are noticed by commands and/or &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpectators who are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;Glowing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; can still be seen in Spectator mode by other players, although not by mobs.\nHighlighting players.\nSpectators can also use the \"Highlight Players (Spectator)\" &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt; if changed from the default (nothing). This allows the spectator to see other &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s as if they have the Glowing effect, and if let go the effect disappears. The color of the outline reflects the player's &lt;a href=\"team\"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntangibility.\nSpectators can move through blocks, entities and other players. When their head is inside a block, they can see through all blocks.\nSpectators can see through &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Powder%20Snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;, and their underwater vision is set to maximum instantly instead of gradually like in other game modes.\nSpectators cannot take &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, as all blows go through them. &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocation&lt;/a&gt; also do not affect them. However, they can take damage from the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; or .\nCommands (including player selectors) can still target spectators.\nFlight.\nSpectators are always flying. They cannot stop flying by landing, as the player just passes through the blocks. The mouse scroll wheel and the &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; key affect the flying speed, but the &lt;a href=\"slowness\"&gt;slowness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"swiftness\"&gt;swiftness&lt;/a&gt; effect do not.\nThe maximum speed that can be achieved is 43.556\u00a0m/s (156.8\u00a0km/h) without sprinting and 87.111\u00a0m/s (313.6\u00a0km/h) when sprinting.\nGUIs.\nIf a player opens their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; while in Spectator mode, they cannot interact with or use any of the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s in it. Likewise, viewing GUIs is possible, but it is not possible to interact with them. If a container uses a &lt;a href=\"loot%20table\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt; to generate its contents, but the loot has not yet been generated, a player in Spectator mode cannot open the container to view its contents. Items in the world also cannot be picked up. Also, the player's head is slightly visible but in a translucent, darker color.\nIf a number key is pressed, the player can teleport to a specific player on that server by pressing , or the player can teleport to a team member by pressing and afterward clicking on the number of the player twice to be teleported or once to see their name.\nSeeing invisible entities.\nSpectators can see other spectators and invisible &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as themselves using . Spectators appear as a translucent disembodied head, and any held or equipped items are invisible. Invisible mobs appear translucent, like when viewing an invisible ally with set to true. (Before 1.13: )\nMob view.\nA spectator can click on an entity with the attack button, to take its view. Their position is locked to that of the entity, and their POV moves in accordance with the entity. Viewing oneself while spectating from an entity's point-of-view using shows the entity. Pressing the dismount key ( by default) returns the player to flying mode. In addition to spectating mobs, players can also spectate any other entity, such as an &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"primed%20TNT\"&gt;primed TNT&lt;/a&gt;, or an &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;. If the spectating mob takes any form of &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, the screen tilts a little as if the player was taking damage. \nCertain mobs also apply a post-processing &lt;a href=\"shader\"&gt;shader&lt;/a&gt; while looking from their point-of-view. This filters how the world is portrayed to the spectator. Similar to the Super Secret Settings, if one presses , it removes the filter without dismounting the mob. Below is a table of mobs that have a filter."}

Spiders attack by biting the target, and they can also climb walls and lunge at them.\nSpawning.\nUp to four spiders may spawn in a 3\u00d71\u00d73 space centered on an opaque block in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 0, except in &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biomes. \nThe block \"above\" the spawning space cannot be a full solid block, including transparent ones such as leaves or &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, but non-full blocks, such as &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, are allowed.\n, spiders can also spawn overhead in 3\u00d72\u00d73 empty spaces on &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, causing more of them to spawn in forested biomes due to more possible spawning surfaces, although they do not spawn in groups.\nMonster spawners.\nSpiders spawn from &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s found in &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Room\"&gt;monster rooms&lt;/a&gt; (25% chance) as well as in secret rooms surrounded by &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStatus effects.\nSpiders occasionally spawn with &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Hard\"&gt;Hard&lt;/a&gt; difficulty. For each &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Pack%20spawning\"&gt;pack spawn&lt;/a&gt;, there is a (10\u00d7&lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23Clamped%20regional%20difficulty\"&gt;clamped regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;)% chance of the game applying a status effect. This does not apply to &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s. These spiders can spawn with following effects:\nThe effect is then applied to all entities within the pack, lasting forever. If the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; status effect is applied to a spider, its eyes remain visible.\nSpider jockeys.\nThere is a 1% chance for a spider to spawn with a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; riding it, forming a &lt;a href=\"spider%20jockey\"&gt;spider jockey&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, if a spider is spawned there with a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;, commands or &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, it has a 0.8% chance to spawn a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt; on its back and form a &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Jockey\"&gt;wither jockey&lt;/a&gt; instead. In some of snowy &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, a spider has a 0.8% chance to spawn a &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt; on its back and form a &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Jockey\"&gt;stray jockey&lt;/a&gt; instead. A spider jockey can also be spawned by the command .\nThe spider controls how both mobs move. The spider acts like a normal spider and the skeleton acts like a normal skeleton, except its movement is determined by the spider it rides upon. The skeleton's arrows can sometimes damage the spider jockey itself, if the spider happens to be in the way of the shot.\nDrops.\nUpon death, a spider drops up to two s. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for 0 to 5 strings with Looting III. &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs are dropped by a spider when it is killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a chance of dropping a when killed by a player or tamed wolf. The maximum amount of spider eyes is increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;. The chance of a spider not dropping any spider eyes can be found using the formula codice_1. For example, Looting III gives a chance of not dropping any spider eyes.\nBehavior.\nA spider stays hostile toward the player and an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; as long as the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level immediately around the spider is 11 or less; otherwise, it does not attack unless attacked first. \nHostile spiders see up to 16 blocks, continuing to chase even when exposed to well-lit locations. If a spider sustains damage from a source other than a direct attack, such as falling, its hostility resets to a neutral state. If shot with arrows when outside of the detection range, a spider turns and runs in the direction from which the arrow was fired. If the player moves away, the spider continues following the same path unless the player enters the detection range, in which case the spider changes direction and attacks.\nAn aggressive spider pounces at close range. When it is swimming in 1-block-deep water it pounces upon touching the submerged floor. They can attack when their Y-axis position is changed, biting in mid-air.\nSpiders can climb up over solid blocks that are not &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s, but do not climb on underside surfaces. A spider pursuing a player can detect a player through blocks. If a spider cannot find an ideal path to the player due to a wall barring the way, it approaches as close as possible to the player's position and proceeds to climb the wall vertically until it gets to the top, even if it loses its aggression toward the player. When a spider loses its aggression, it continues moving forward blindly for 2 seconds; this behavior causes the spider to climb up any walls in its path.\nWhen climbing a wall a spider may sometimes reach a corner and become stuck in a climbing status, thus losing and becoming unable to be aggravated. \nSpiders gravitate towards cobwebs.\nIf a spider tries to go through the &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt;, it starts climbing the world border instead.\nSpider can also climb on full &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, full &lt;a href=\"boat%20with%20chest\"&gt;boats with chests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEven though normal spiders do not inflict the Poison &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;, they are immune to it. They are also immune to the slowing applied to most mobs when walking through &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpiders flip onto their backs when they die, unlike all other mobs, which land on their sides.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt; enchantment inflicts &lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt; IV and deals more damage to spiders.\nSounds.\nSpiders use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nSpiders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

{"id": "172", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=172", "title": "Spleef", "text": "Spleef is a competitive minigame played within \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\". When playing spleef, players destroy &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s below other players, allowing them to fall off the playing field and into a pit. The object of the game is to be the last &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; on the field.\nThe name is a portmanteau of \"splat\", referring to the sound of players hitting the ground below, and \"grief\", as the game involves destroying blocks.\nPlaying field.\nSpleef is played on an easily-destructible block such as &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, with a pit located under the playing field to collect players when they lose. Players destroy blocks on the platform near or under opponents to cause them to fall, while avoiding falling themselves. Those who fall from the platform lose the round, while the remaining players win. Spleef can be played on teams, in 1v1 scenarios, or with multiple players all against each other.\nRules.\nSpleef has a few basic rules to ensure a fair experience without being too restrictive, but as with many activities, rules vary greatly from one server to another.\nThe spleef arena.\nSince spleef requires the playing field to be easily broken, most arenas use &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"clay%20block\"&gt;clay block&lt;/a&gt;s as they can be broken relatively quickly. Some basic arenas use dirt if better materials are not available. &lt;a href=\"Wool\"&gt;Wool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; are also used.\nSpleef players should be equipped with a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;, for wool, or &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; for basalt) to ensure fast block destruction.\nWalls surrounding the arena are usually made to prevent players from evading gameplay. The walls are often made with hard to mine materials, such as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bricks\"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. There is often seating for spectators located on the side of the field, so that they can view the players in the arena.\nThere is usually a pit located below the arena with a tunnel or stairway out for losers to exit the arena. On longer drops, arena builders can use &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the losers from taking &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany stadium builders fill the pit with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; as an intimidating consequence for losing. Often they provide chests for participants to store their items so they don't lose their items if they die.\nCustom arena.\nCustom arenas if you want to create a small, medium, large, and expert.\nVariations.\nDue to the flexible nature of spleef, the gamemode can be altered in many ways. A common variation is to create multiple levels of playing fields, and upon losing on one arena, the player descend to the next. A common theme among variations is incorporating gameplay elements such as &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Some versions allow someone to destroy blocks from under the players, and others incorporate challenges such as not allowing players to jump. As stated in the rules above, hitting other players may occasionally be allowed as well.\nInstead of having to break down blocks manually, players may be given items that have the special ability to shoot projectiles. When the projectile hits a block, the block disappears. When players are on separate islands, they can still shoot those projectiles in order to cause other players to fall. This variant is usually hosted on minigame Minecraft servers, like Hypixel (TNT Games - Bow Spleef), HiveMC (Splegg, which has shovels that can shoot snowballs), and with the use of these servers, many other things can be added, such as upgrades, boosters, high jumps, explosions.\nHistory.\nSpleef was started on a server before June 23, 2009 soon after the &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt; Multiplayer Creative Mode release. The rules and name were created by Greenslimy, Pentaclam and Maulrus. It first gained popularity after Notch blogged about this article on his Tumblr. Soon after, a plethora of spleef servers and variations sprung up. Spleef instantly caught on in \"Minecraft\" Classic, while slowly also gaining popularity in Alpha, which soon became Beta. It is considerably popular in the latest version of \"Minecraft\" today, with almost every major public server having some sort of Spleef arena.\nIt is questionable, but it could have started as a port from Blockland to \"Minecraft\". In 2004, Blockland was a \"spleef\" where you would throw spears at the blocks and they would disappear, thus killing anyone on them. Someone who played this may have re-created it in \"Minecraft\" and others started doing it too.\nTron 2.0 featured a similar game mode in 2002, with opposing teams using the Tron disc to destroy platforms on either side of a chasm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; of the game includes an official variation of Spleef called \"&lt;a href=\"Mini%20Games%23Tumble\"&gt;Tumble&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

However, the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt; supported splitscreen even without a TV, purely because its screen had a higher resolution of 720p over the Wii U Gamepad's 480p screen.\nLocal Splitscreen.\nThe following guide shows step by step how to set up and play a Local Splitscreen game.\n\"Note: Images are from &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStep 1.

While sprinting, the player's field of view expands slightly while increasing the player's reach by .5-1 block. Players also inflict more &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; on the first hit when sprinting.\nActivating.\nTo sprint, the player can press while moving, or double tap .

The player can turn while sprinting, resulting in slightly reduced speed. Sprinting also increases the speed of &lt;a href=\"flying\"&gt;flying&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, and the speed of &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;.

When saturation reaches zero, the &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar depletes at a rate of every 40 meters, or 7 seconds.\nSprinting produces &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; at the player's feet corresponding to the block type they are running on. When a player attacks any &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; (excluding &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s) while sprinting, the mob suffers a larger knockback than usual. Sprinting and holding down jump at the same time is usually faster, but actually becomes slower when under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; II or higher.\nSprinting ends when the player collides with a solid block at an angle of greater than 8 degrees, &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blocking\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; or attacks a mob. If none of these happen, the player automatically stops sprinting after 30 seconds. Sprinting also ends if the hunger bar is reduced to or less.\nSprinting pauses when the player eats &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; or drinks &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, but pressing while eating food or potions does not start sprinting."}

When height-constrained, the trunk height maximum is two less than the roof. The headroom of 9 blocks limits the tree to a trunk height of 7, which enables harvesting from ground level.\nBlocks and items.\nThese items can be obtained from all variants of spruce.\nPlanting.\nSpruce &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s may be planted and grown on:\nIn order to grow a 2\u00d72 tree (be it mega spruce, mega pine, mega jungle or dark oak), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used on any of the saplings. The largest mega spruces and mega pines reach 30 blocks tall.\n1\u00d71 spruces require a 5\u00d75 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree and 1 level above (a sapling planted in a hole 2 blocks deep can still grow).\n2\u00d72 mega spruces require a 5\u00d75 column of unobstructed space at least 14 blocks above the saplings to grow (15 blocks including the saplings themselves). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. A 3\u00d73 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings).\nOther variant spruce trees.\n, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.\nDying trees.\nA dying spruce and dying pine has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nFallen spruces and pines.\nA fallen spruce may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.\nA fallen spruce log has a length of 6\u201310 blocks, and the stump is never covered with vines.\nFoliage colors.\nSpruce leaves do not follow the &lt;a href=\"tint\"&gt;foliage color&lt;/a&gt; rules that cause the trees to appear in different colors in different biomes. Spruce leaves are always the same color regardless of the biome."}

The spyglass changes the FOV to of the FOV set in &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;. By default, the FOV is set to 70\u00b0 in \"Java Edition\" and 60\u00b0 in Bedrock Edition, resulting in an FOV of 7\u00b0 in \"Java Edition\" and 6\u00b0 in Bedrock Edition through the spyglass. The player's FOV can be set from 30\u00b0 to 110\u00b0, so the spyglass FOV can range from 3\u00b0 to 11\u00b0. Regardless of the situation, or status effects the player has, using the Spyglass always shows a FOV of the FOV set in &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;.\nA square vignette is applied when in use, similar to the effect when wearing a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;. Pressing removes the vignette, similar to a carved pumpkin. \nHazy distant objects remain hazy when viewed in the spyglass. Mobs too distant to render also do not render in the spyglass. The spyglass shows a magnified view of what the player already sees.\nThe player is slowed down while watching through the spyglass. When the player uses the spyglass continuously for , the interface is automatically closed.\nIf the player has a certain effect on their screen like &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, the spyglass does not remove that effect on the player's screen."}

The block above must also be water, and the block below must be water or waterlogged. Squid share the water creature &lt;a href=\"mob%20cap\"&gt;mob cap&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s.\n, 2 to 4 squid can spawn in ocean biomes, and two can spawn in river biomes. 5% of squid can spawn as babies. In addition, squid spawn only on the surface, i.e. there must not be a solid or spawnable block above the spawn location.\nDrops.\nLike other baby mobs, killing a baby squid yields no items or experience.\nBehavior.\nSquid are &lt;a href=\"passive\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; toward the player. They are not attracted to light and do not deliberately interact with the player.\nWhen a squid moves, its tentacles open and close, giving it an appearance of pushing itself leisurely forward. A squid hovers in place when first spawned into the world and wanders around aimlessly in three dimensions.\nA squid's hitbox does not include its tentacles, and therefore cannot be damaged by attacking its tentacles.\nSquid suffocate when out of water, dying after 300 game &lt;a href=\"ticks\"&gt;ticks&lt;/a&gt; (15 seconds). While on land, they remain stationary until they suffocate. They can take fall damage and &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; like any other land mob, but they cannot drown. When out of the water, squid are extremely resistant to knockback.\nSquid cannot swim in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, even if given a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect. They simply pass through the lava and behave as if on land.\nOn Bedrock Edition, a squid can survive on land if given a &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; effect. however they will still behave as if on land.\nUnlike land-based mobs, squid can swim against a current and not get pushed by it, if on Java Edition.\n&lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s attack squid in the same manner as they would do to a player, even if the squid is affected by &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. \nSquid are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment \u2014 because they are aquatic mobs; as long as they touch water.\nSquid produce a cloud of black ink particles and swim away when attacked. They also produce unique dark blue bubble particles when hit. \nSquid sometimes beach themselves.\nSquid are attacked by &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlthough squid have a baby variant in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, there is no way to &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; them.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode or is far away from the squid, the squid remains stationary. When attacked in this state, the squid cannot flee.\nLike a land-based mob, a squid can be picked up by a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nSquid use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nSquid have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nBedrock Edition:"}

Non-wood stairs drop themselves as items only if broken with a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;.

Therefore, walking up stairs doesn't make the player hungry at all.\nBehavior.\nGenerally, the solid faces of stairs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces.\nFuel.\n&lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; wood stairs can be used as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nNote blocks.\nWood stairs can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nNon-wood stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nSounds.\nOther.\nBrick, purpur, quartz, red sandstone, sandstone, stone brick, and cobblestone stairs):\nAll other stairs:"}

When starting houses were added, they were made of mossy cobblestone (which was unavailable naturally on the map anywhere else) and 4 &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, one filled with &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, one with a full stack (99 at the time) of every type of &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, another with every type of &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; and one filled with every color of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;. As Indev progressed from testing items and blocks to testing the actual survival aspect, these chests were removed. Later, the design of the house was changed. The floor was changed to &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and the walls and roof were changed to &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "4641", "revid": "40452312", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4641", "title": "Biome", "text": "A biome is a region in a world with distinct geographical features, &lt;a href=\"Plants\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt;, temperatures, humidities, and sky, water, fog, grass and foliage colors. Biomes separate every generated world into different environments, such as forests, deserts and taigas.\nThe biome of a location is determined during world generation and by the current environment. If the player completely changes all the blocks in a large area to imitate the terrain of other biomes, the biome will not be affected. This can be only be done with the command, which can change the biome in an area.\nBiomes can be located using the command in the chat.\nList of biomes.\nBiome types.\n, there are 64 different biome types: 53 for the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, 5 for &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and 5 for &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, plus one used only for a &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; preset. there are 90 biome types: 53 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether, 5 for the End, and 27 unused.\nOn this page, for convenience of description and reading, the biomes in Overworld are divided into 8 categories, which are not official. While in each category, biomes may be further divided into some sub-categories. Biomes in a sub-categories are placed in one page, such as &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sunflower%20plains\"&gt;sunflower plains&lt;/a&gt;, and are described as variants on this wiki.\nOverworld.\nOffland biomes.\nThese biomes are used for the generation of &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s and mushroom fields. They are large, open biomes made entirely of water going up to y=63, with underwater relief on the sea floor, such as small mountains and plains, usually including &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Squid\"&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt; and fish spawn frequently in the water.\nThese biomes are further divided into three categories: &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, Deep Oceans, and Mushroom Fields.\nHighland biomes.\nHighland biomes are biomes with high Y-level, rugged terrain, and snow-covered peaks appear above the snow line.\nThese biomes are further divided into two categories: &lt;a href=\"Mountain\"&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Windswept%20Hills\"&gt;Windswept Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nWoodland biomes.\nWoodland biomes are rich in plants, with &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;es constituting the flora on the surface. It is one of the ideal birthplaces where plenty of wood resources are available, but the dense vegetation makes it dangerous to move around the forest at night because the trees block the view.\nThese biomes are further divided into 7 categories: &lt;a href=\"Forest\"&gt;Forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Taiga\"&gt;Taiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Growth%20Taiga\"&gt;Old Growth Taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Taiga\"&gt;Snowy Taiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Birch%20Forest\"&gt;Birch Forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Forest\"&gt;Dark Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jungle\"&gt;Jungle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWetland biomes.\nWetland biomes contains &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;es. They have a large amount of water resources. Rivers separate other biomes; beaches generate as a transition between the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and land.\nFlatland biomes.\nThese biomes have a flat terrain and a wide view. &lt;a href=\"Tree\"&gt;Trees&lt;/a&gt; spawn less here, while lakes are more common here.\nThese biomes are further divided into two categories: &lt;a href=\"Plain\"&gt;Plain&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Plain\"&gt;Snowy Plain&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArid-land biomes.\nIn these biomes, it neither rains nor snows at all, but the sky still turns overcast during inclement weather. The surface is covered with sparse vegetation.\nThese biomes are further divided into three categories: &lt;a href=\"Desert\"&gt;Desert&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Badland\"&gt;Badland&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCave biomes.\nThese biomes generates inside &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. They're mostly found underground but can sometimes leak out of cave entrances.\nThe Nether.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; is considered a different &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;. It is a hellish place; all biomes in this dimension are dry and it is not possible to place &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in these biomes; &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; can still be placed, though it does not turn into &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; upon melting.\nThe End.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; is considered a different dimension.\nUnused biomes.\nThese biomes don't generate in default worlds. They have been completely removed from the game .\nRemoved biomes.\nThese biomes no longer exist in current versions of the game.\nJoke biomes.\nThese biomes can only appear in joke snapshots of the game.\nTint.\nPlants.\nBiome grass and foliage colors are selected from two 256\u00d7256 colormap images: grass.png and foliage.png under or . The grass.png colormap sets the colors for &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, ferns in &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, tall grass, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s, stems of &lt;a href=\"pink%20petals\"&gt;pink petals&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the foliage.png colormap sets the colors for &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt; and tree leaves of oak, jungle, acacia, dark oak, and mangrove. Only the colors in the lower-left halfs of both images are used, even though the upper-right side of foliage.png is colored.\nThe adjusted temperature and adjusted downfall values (recognized as AdjTemp and AdjDownfall in the following, respectively) are used when determining the biome color to select from the colormap. They are computed as follows:\ncodice_1.\n\"clamp\" limits the range of the temperature and downfall to 0.0\u20141.0. The clamped downfall value is then multiplied by the adjusted temperature value, bringing its value to be inside the lower left triangle. Treating the bottom-right corner of the colormap as codice_2 and codice_3, the adjusted temperature increases to 1.0 along the X-axis, and the adjusted downfall increases to 1.0 along the Y-axis.\nSpecial plant tints.\nIn the following cases, the plants are not tinted exactly according to the colormap. , severals of them are specified in &lt;a href=\"custom%20biome\"&gt;biome Json&lt;/a&gt;s in vanilla data pack.\nIn Swamp and Mangrove Swamp, the color for grass blocks, ferns in flower pots, grass, sugar canes, and the stems of pink petals is based on a noise on XZ plane. When the value of this noise is less than -0.1, it uses the color . Otherwise using . The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is in Swamp and in Mangrove Swamp, which are not affected by the colormap.\nIn Dark Forest, the color for grass blocks, ferns in flower pots, grass, sugar canes, and the stems of pink petals is the result of the bitwise AND between the color in the colormap and , and then averaging with . In vanilla, that is .\nIn Badland, Wooded Badland, and Erosion Badland, the color for grass blocks, ferns in flower pots, grass, sugar canes, and the stems of pink petals is . The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is . Both are not affected by the colormap.\nThe color for plants in the Cherry Grove is always , which is not affected by the colormap.\nThe color for spruce leaves is and the color for birch leaves is . Both are not affected by the biome.\nEnvironment.\nThe color of the sky in Overworld changes according to the basic temperature value of the biome. The basic temperature is first modified as codice_4. Then the triple formula_1 is the sky color.\nIn addition, the colors of water, underwater fog and fog in a biome are defined in the vanilla data pack or vanilla resource packs.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23List%20of%20biome%20climates\"&gt;List of biome climates&lt;/a&gt; for these colors.\nTransition.\nWhen plants or water are at the borders between or among biomes, the color is affected by the biome of the surrounding blocks at the same Y-level. The range of the block involved in the calculation is determined by the biome blend radius in &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;. Takes the plant color or water color of the biomes within a square centered on this block and with the side length being the biome blend radius, and calculates their average value to get the final color for this block.\nThe sky color and the fog color use the color processed by from colors of the biomes at each block in the range of 5\u00d75\u00d75 centered on the block the camera is in.\nClimate.\nA biome has three climate attributes: temperature, downfall, and precipitation.\nTemperature.\nEach biome has a base temperature value (see the &lt;a href=\"%23List%20of%20biome%20climates\"&gt;List of biome climates&lt;/a&gt;), but the actual temperature value at each location in the biome is also affected by the height of the location. Locations with Y\u226480 use the base temperature as actual temperature. At Y=81, the actual temperature value randomly fluctuates up and down by -0.00875 \u2014 +0.01125 from the base temperature based on a noise on the XZ plane, and at Y\u226581 the actual temperature decreases by 0.00125 () every block up.\n, specially, in and , it is also affected by another noise on XZ plane. In some regions according to the noise, the base temperature value is always regarded as 0.2. The actual temperature values for these regions are also calculated on this basis. This is detectable in , as its base temperature is low enough to freeze or snow, so that only these regions do not freeze or snow at sea level.\nDownfall.\nThe downfall value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (see the &lt;a href=\"%23List%20of%20biome%20climates\"&gt;List of biome climates&lt;/a&gt;). When the downfall value is greater than 0.85, the biome is marked as humid, which is related only to the random extinction of fire. This value doesn't affect the weather.\nPrecipitation.\nThe precipitation value can be \"true\" or \"false\". If the precipitation of the biome is false, no rain or snow occur. Otherwise, a location is rainable when its temperature value is greater than 0.15, and snowable otherwise.\nSo, if the base temperature is not greater than 0.15, it's snowable at any Y level. And if greater than 0.15, it can snow above a certain Y level, which are listed below:\nSnow accumulation.\n, the maximum snow accumulation layer can be set by &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt;s. , the maximun snow layer is based on the snow accumulation value of the biome. The value is a array of 2 numbers, representing the minimum and maximum snow heights, with 0.0 being no snow and 1.0 being the full height of one block.\nGeneration.\nOverworld.\n&lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; biome generation is based on 6 parameters: Temperature, Humidity (aka. Vegetation), Continentalness (aka. Continents), Erosion, Weirdness (aka. Ridges) and Depth, which are calculated with 6 &lt;a href=\"density%20function\"&gt;density function&lt;/a&gt;s. They respectively correspond to T, V, C, E, W and D in the \"NoiseRouter\" line of &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;. Except \"depth\", the other 5 parameters are based on only horizontal coordinates.\nThinking of them as a six-dimensional space, in the space a lot of intervals are defined for biomes, as described in the tables below. If the six parameters at a location fall into an interval, the corresponding biome is generated. If the six parameters at a location do not fall into a defined biome interval in these tables, it uses the closest biome interval to the 6D parameter point, in order to form a transition between biomes.\nTemperature.\nThe temperature parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.\nThe range of temperature is about from -2.31 to +2.31. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\nTemperature values from -1 to +1 are divided into 5 levels. The corresponding ranges from level 0 to level 4 are: -1~-0.45, -0.45~-0.15, -0.15~0.2, 0.2~0.55, 0.55~1. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"T\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Temperature values less than -1 are displayed as level ; higher than +1 are displayed as .\nNote that the temperature parameter is not the &lt;a href=\"%23Temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; of a biome, but they roughly correspond each other, e.g. if a location's temperature parameter is level 0, the base temperature of the biome here is usually low enough or the terrain is high enough, that the surface is covered in snow and ice.\nHumidity.\nThe humidity (also known as vegetation) parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.\nThe range of humidity is about from -1.76 to +1.76. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\nHumidity values from -1 to +1 are also divided into 5 levels. The corresponding ranges from level 0 to level 4 are: -1~-0.35, -0.35~-0.1, -0.1~0.1, 0.1~0.3, 0.3~1. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"H\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Values less than -1 are displayed as level ; higher than +1 are displayed as .\nContinentalness.\nThe continentalness (also known as continents) parameter is used to decide between ocean/beach/land biomes. It affects the terrain height during terrain generation. The larger the continentalness, the higher the average terrain height. And when the continentality is extremely low, the terrain height also becomes higher, in order to generate mushroom fields in the center of the ocean.\nThe range of continentalness is about from -3.80 to +3.80 . Biome intervals are defined only from -1.2 to +1.0.\nIf the continentalness of a location is between -1.2~-1.05, the mushroom fields biome is generated; when it is between -1.05~-0.455, deep ocean biomes are generated; when -0.455~-0.19, ocean biomes are generated; when -0.19~1.0, inland biomes are generated. For inland biomes, continentalness values are further subdivided into 4 types: coast (-0.19~-0.11), near-inland (-0.11~0.03), mid-inland (0.03~0.3) and far-inland (0.3~1.0). The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"C\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Values less than -1.2 are displayed as ; higher than +1.0 are displayed as .\nErosion.\nThe erosion parameters mainly affect inland terrain during terrain generation. The higher the erosion at a location, the lower the terrain height and the flatter the terrain.\nThe range of erosion is about from -2.52 to +2.52. Biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\nErosion values from -1 to +1 are divided into 7 levels. The corresponding intervals from level 0 to level 6 are: -1~-0.78, -0.78~-0.375, -0.375~-0.2225, -0.2225~0.05, 0.05~0.45, 0.45~0.55, 0.55~1. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"E\" in the \"Biome builder\" line of the debug screen. Values less than -1 are displayed as level ; higher than +1 are displayed as .\nWeirdness.\nThe weirdness (also known as ridges) parameter affects whether to generate a weirder biome or not. If the weirdness value is greater than 0, the generated biome becomes weirder. For example, using the variant of the &lt;a href=\"Jungle\"&gt;Jungle&lt;/a&gt; biome \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Bamboo%20Jungle\"&gt;Bamboo Jungle&lt;/a&gt;; not using beach biomes when on the coast.\nThe range of weirdness is about from -2.97 to +2.97,but biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\nThe PV (\"peaks and valleys\", aka. \"ridges folded\") value is calculated through the formula formula_2, which is also shown at the \"PV\" in the \"NoiseRouter\" line of the debug screen.\nWhen the weirdness value is between -1.0 and 1.0, the PV values are divided into 5 levels:\nNot that the PV value is defined no matter what the weirdness is, but these 5 PV levels are defined only when weirdness is between -1.0 and 1.0. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"PV\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Though the five PV levels are defined only when weirdness is between -1.0 and 1.0, the PV level is always displayed even when weirdness is out of \u00b11.0, and PV values less than -1.0 are displayed as . So, when weirdness is not between -1.0~1.0, the PV level in the \"Biome builder\" line often doesn't match the biome here.\nBoth weirdness and PV affect the terrain height during terrain generation, especially the PV value has a more significant impact on the terrain height inland. The higher the PV value, the higher the terrain. Usually, at places with low continentalness or high erosion, when the PV level is \"Valleys\", the terrain is low enough to generate rivers. At high terrain, negative weirdness values lead to taller and more jagged and point peaks. When the erosion level is approximately 5, positive weirdness values result in weird inland terrain that is shattered and extremely precipitous and craggy. Since the weirdness value controls both whether the biome is a weird variant and whether the valley is generated, a biome and its variants often not appear on the same bank of a river.\nDepth.\nUnlike other five parameters, depth is not based on a single noise. Depth corresponds approximately to the terrain height. It is roughly 0 when at surface, and increases by (0.0078125) for every 1 block down. The depth parameter affects whether a surface biome or a cave biome is placed. The table below lists the depth values for surface biomes and cave biomes.\nNon-inland surface biomes.\nThe generation of non-inland biomes has nothing to do with humidity, erosion and weirdness. The following table lists the relation between non-inland surface biomes and continentalness and temperature. \nInland surface biomes.\nThe following table lists the relation between inland surface biomes and continentalness. erosion, and PV.\nIn which, the specific biome generation of beach biomes, badland biomes, middle biomes, plateau biomes, and shattered biomes is determined by the temperature, humidity and weirdness values.\nBeach biomes generates in the low terrain along the coast, and the specific biome generation is only related to the temperature value.\nBadland biomes usually generate inland with low erosion value, and can also generate along the coast with high terrain and low erosion. The specific biome generation is related to humidity and weirdness.\nMiddle biomes are the most extensive biomes inland, and the specific biome generation is related to temperature, humidity, and weirdness.\nPlateau biomes generate at inland high terrain with moderate erosion. The specific biome generation is related to temperature, humidity, and weirdness.\nShattered biomes are generated at inland places with high erosion, and the specific biome generation is related to temperature, humidity, and weirdness.\nThe Nether.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; uses three parameters to generate biomes: temperature, humidity, and offset. Unlike the Overworld, the Nether biome specifies biomes with points, while the Overworld uses 6D intervals.\nThe offset parameter isn't from density function. It is always 0 at any location in a world. This means that the parameter point of a location is always in the temperature-humidity-plane. The closer the offset (of a biome point) is to 0, the closer the point is to the T-H-plane, and the greater the advantage it has during biome generation.\nThe End.\n, &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; uses only one density function value: erosion. If the horizontal distance from the chunk origin of a chunk to the world origin is less than 1024, the locations in the chunk is . Otherwise, the biome is determined by erosion.\n, in the End there's only one biome: ."}

This made many biome variants that were in the game redundant, as the only difference between their regular counterparts was the way terrain generated in them. As a result, most variant biomes were removed from the generator. , these biomes were merged with their normal variants, while , these biomes still exist, but remain unused.\nGeneration.\nMinecraft biomes were generated in layer stacks. These layers generated specific aspects of Minecraft biomes, such as scale, rivers, varieties, and biome categories.\nEarlier stages.\nBiome generation was initialized as a 1 to 4096 scale of ocean, with a few spots of landmasses scattered throughout. This map was then scaled and additional landmasses shuffled around to decrease the amount of ocean, twice, to reach a scale of 1 to 1024. Additional layers that decrease the amount of ocean were repeatedly applied until the ratio of land to ocean was about 50-50. Snowy biome categories were then assigned to a few spots of land, which was then shuffled around a final time to obtain a ratio of 33% ocean and 67% landmass.\nAt this stage of biome generation, the final climate zones were applied as follows. Areas of dry landmasses were assigned to be a normal biome if it bordered a cold or frozen landmass. Areas of snowy landmasses were assigned to the cold temperature category if it bordered a normal or dry temperature zone. 1 out of every 13 landmasses was then marked as \"Special\", which would be used to place some of the rarer biomes in later stages of biome generation. This map was then scaled twice, until a scale of 1 to 256. An additional layer was applied to create a more jagged coastline, creating areas of large islands and lakes around the coastline. 1 out of 100 areas of oceans were assigned as mushroom biomes and areas of ocean far from the coast converted into deep ocean.\nThe final areas of climate areas were as follows: 31% oceanic, which consisted of 22% deep ocean and 9% ocean, 0.07% mushroom, 13% dry, 22% medium, 23% cold, and 6% frozen. Areas of rare biomes made up 4% of the total area.\nThe biome generation was then split into 3 separate stacks.\nGeneration of biomes and biome variants.\nOne stack of biome generation generated the actual biomes in-game. The biome categories generated the following biomes as follows. Some biomes were weighed more and as such generated more commonly than other biomes. Snowy biomes had an unused rare biome variant and as such generated as normal snowy biomes.\nForest and biomes could generate in both cold biome clusters in addition to normal temperature clusters. Plains biomes could generate in all temperature clusters except in frozen biomes.\nBamboo jungles overwrote certain areas of jungle biomes since &lt;a href=\"Village%20and%20Pillage\"&gt;Village and Pillage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis map is scaled twice until a scale of 1 to 64 in both Java and Bedrock Editions. In Legacy Console Edition, the map is not scaled at all at this stage of biome generation unless biome size was set to medium or large. To ensure a smooth transition between biomes, some biomes generate an \"edge biome\" as follows. These edge biomes can also generate hills and modified biome variants:\nModified and hill biomes are then merged into the biome generation. Most biomes have a \"hills\" variant but some biomes use other biomes as their \"hills\" variant, which are listed below. This stage also allows islands to generate in areas of Deep Ocean:\nSwamps and regular badlands do not generate a hills biome variant. Oceans do not have a \"modified\" biome variant. While most biomes have a \"modified\" variant, few biomes generate a unique \"modified hills\" variant, such as birch forests and mountain biomes. Some other biomes use another existing biome as a \"modified hills\" variant. If a biome does not have a \"modified hills\" variant, such as swamps or snowy taigas, the regular biome variant generates instead.\nAdditional areas of sunflower plains were generated separately to the modified biome stage of biome generation, covering 1/57 of normal plains biome.\nThe map was then scaled and the coastline made more jagged, then scaled again and beaches are generated. The generation of shorelines and beaches were as follows, this also added a few additional biome edge biomes for jungles and badlands, without biome variants:\nThis also creates unique quirks in generation, where gravelly mountains and swamp hills generate a beach biome, and swamp hills bordering a regular jungle edge, with a modified jungle edge bordering jungles.\nThis biome map was scaled two more times (scaled 4x) until a scale of 1 to 4. River generation was merged with the regular biomes, then ocean climate zones merged.\nGeneration of rivers.\nA layer stack for river noise generation was used as a random number generator to generate areas of hills and mutated biomes, which was scaled twice before applied to the biome stage of biome generation at scale 1 to 64. Since &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt;, modified biomes could conform to an entire biome or border a river. A separate layer stack to generate rivers throughout was scaled 4 times, before it was merged with the rest of the generation at scale 1 to 4.\nRivers generated across all land biomes excluding areas of oceans. Frozen rivers replaced rivers in regular .\nOnce the ocean temperature stack and river generation stack was merged with the biome generation stack, a final layer was applied to make the biome scale 1:1, which was the final biome generation used in Minecraft.\nJava Edition oceanic temperature generation.\nOcean biomes generated their climate zones separately from land biome generation, to avoid changing existing Minecraft seeds/biome generation in its entirely. Ocean climate zones were initialized at a scale of 1 to 256, then scaled 6 times, before it was merged with the rest of the biome generation.\n, ocean climate areas were done so warm oceans could not border frozen oceans. One must go incrementally from warm oceans, to lukewarm oceans, regular oceans, and cold oceans, before reaching frozen oceans.\nIf a frozen ocean or frozen deep ocean bordered a land biome, a regular cold ocean generated. If a warm ocean generated next to a land biome, a regular lukewarm ocean generated. Warm oceans overwrote deep oceans as warm deep oceans did not generate.\nOcean climate zones were based off the 48 bit seed, unlike the rest of the land biome generation, as such, &lt;a href=\"Seed_%28level_generation%29%23Shadow_seeds\"&gt;shadow seeds&lt;/a&gt; contained entirely different ocean climate areas, even though common land biomes generated identically in Java Edition shadow seeds.\nOther information.\n, the possible shapes of biomes could use only the first 24 bits of the 64-bit world seed, and biome shapes within a world seed could repeat beginning around blocks from 0,0. Biome generation overflowed at blocks from 0,0. However, as biomes were generated in a zoomed out stage, before it was scaled upward, it technically means that biome generation could extend further out during earlier stages of biome generation as the integer overflow point is further out.\nEven though there are 64-bit seeds on Java, there were only unique noise maps for continental/ocean biome generation, because a quadratic equation was used, and quadratic equations always can be mirrored so that for every input except one to the quadratic equation, there is another that results in the same output (halving the number of truly distinct possibilities). For any seed, the other seed resulting in the same output to this equation was colloquially known as a shadow seed. In this case, land biome and general ocean biomes were exactly the same in a pair of seeds, but ocean biome temperatures, structures and hills differed in the shadow seed. A user could find a shadow seed by adding the constant -7379792620528906219 to the negative of their current world seed, to obtain the shadow seed. Shadow seeds were exclusive to Java Edition.\nWith using 32-bit seeds and a different world generation algorithm, there were few similarities between it and the 64-bit world generation. The positions of mutated biomes, oceans (and islands), rare biomes (jungles, badlands, mushroom fields, giant tree taiga), as well as specific biomes in cold, temperate, or dry biome clusters, bore some geographical relationship with the equivalent positive value seed of the 64-bit generation. The biome shapes deviated significantly. The specific generation of lush biomes and ocean variants was completely different on Bedrock.\nRemoved/Unused biomes.\nBadlands.\nBadlands Plateau.\nThe badlands plateau featured large flat-topped hills composed of stratified colors of terracotta ranging in warm colors. Plateaus had steep edges that rose to within 20-30 blocks above sea level, where they quickly flatten. The top of these plateaus typically had scattered dead bushes. Occasional ponds appeared on plateau tops. The sides of the plateau occasionally revealed caverns and mineshafts. &lt;a href=\"River\"&gt;River&lt;/a&gt; biomes that passed through badlands plateau biomes cut steep grooves, giving off the appearance of narrow canyons. These posed a fall damage hazard if the player was not careful. Ravines also frequently spawned in badlands plateau biomes, which caused the same as above. This biome was not always present in the badlands biomes, but it was likely to appear.\nBadlands plateaus used the same mob spawning chances as badlands.\nModified Badlands Plateau.\nThe modified badlands plateau featured smaller plateaus and somewhat harsher terrain than the badlands plateau, mimicking large plateaus that have weathered more over time. &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20badlands\"&gt;Eroded badlands&lt;/a&gt; replaced the usual thin desert border that this biome variant shared with other biomes. The modified badlands plateau was the second rarest biome in Minecraft, after modified jungle edge, and was only present in about 1/5 of the badlands biomes, and almost always (98% chance) came with an eroded badlands bordering the edges and modified wooded badlands plateaus surrounding it at the center.\nModified badlands plateaus used the same mob spawning chances as badlands.\nModified Wooded Badlands Plateau.\nSimilar to the modified badlands plateau, the modified wooded badlands plateau had a weathered appearance and featured smaller plateaus with more erratic terrain, allowing for significantly fewer oak trees to grow at the highest layers. &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20badlands\"&gt;Eroded badlands&lt;/a&gt; replaced the usual thin desert border that this biome variant shared with other biomes.\nModified wooded badlands plateaus used the same mob spawning chances as badlands.\nBirch forest.\nBirch Forest Hills.\nBirch forest hills featured hillier terrain than regular birch forests, being identical to them in every other aspect. It was fairly common due to its wide spread.\nBirch forest hills used the same mob spawning chances as birch forests.\nTall Birch Hills.\nLike the other hills biomes, the tall birch hills biome had hillier, rougher terrain, along with the taller-than-normal birch trees of the tall birch forest variant. The hills were steep in this biome, comparable to the &lt;a href=\"windswept%20hills\"&gt;windswept hills&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nTall birch hills used the same mob spawning chances as birch forests.\nDark Forest Hills.\nDark forest hills broke the leaf canopy, increasing visibility and decreasing the chance of daytime hostile mob spawning, though the hills were steep compared to other hill biomes. Hills generated near &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s led to cliffs. Small plains-biome clearings didn't generate within the dark forest hills variant.\nDark forest hills used the same mob spawning chances as dark forests.\nDeep Warm Ocean.\nThe deep warm ocean was similar to the warm ocean, but twice as deep and without &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s. Since they were a deep ocean variant, tall seagrass was more frequent and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s could generate as well. Unlike shallow warm oceans, pufferfish could not spawn in deep warm oceans.\nThis biome did not naturally generate in any non-snapshot or beta version.\n, deep warm oceans used the same mob spawning chances as oceans for hostile and ambient categories, and had different chances for water creature and water ambient categories:, deep warm oceans used the same mob spawning chances as warm oceans:\nDesert.\nDesert Hills.\nDesert hills variants featured hillier terrain, just like all other hills &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in the game. Desert hills reached slightly higher elevations than other hills, and were comprised mostly of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; like the rest of the desert. No structures other than &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"desert%20well\"&gt;desert well&lt;/a&gt;s generated within the hills, making this variant overall more difficult. Desert hills didn't generate if their base desert is a thin border around a &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nDesert hills used the same mob spawning chances as deserts.\nDesert Lakes.\nThe rare desert lakes variant featured slightly rougher and hillier terrain than the base desert biome, though not as much as the desert hills. This made them more likely to have oases of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; across its landscape. No structures other than &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"desert%20well\"&gt;desert well&lt;/a&gt;s generated here.\nDesert lakes used the same mob spawning chances as deserts.\nGiant Taiga.\nGiant Spruce Taiga Hills.\nGiant spruce taiga hills were a variant intended to be a more mountainous version of the giant spruce taiga. However, , due to a likely error in the way terrain height is calculated, there was no difference in the terrain between giant spruce taiga and giant spruce taiga hills. Specifically, the game used internal values known as and when generating hills biomes, but these values were the same for both giant spruce taiga and giant spruce taiga hills, resulting in no actual difference between the two. This was the only hills biome in the game with this issue.\n, this biome generated as a hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, however, this biome generated the same trees as the giant tree taiga hills tree type (not giant spruce tree type) resulting in no actual difference between giant tree taiga hills and giant spruce taiga hills (except in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; color).\nGiant spruce taiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as giant spruce taigas.\nGiant Tree Taiga Hills.\nLike all other hills biomes, giant tree taiga hills featured elevated, hillier terrain compared to the normal giant tree taiga, making the landscape less suitable for shelter. Podzol, coarse dirt, and rocks all still generated on the hills. Wolves, foxes and rabbit spawned here.\nGiant tree taiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as giant tree taigas.\nJungle.\nBamboo Jungle Hills.\nThe bamboo jungle hills variant was similar to the bamboo jungle, though with steeper terrain just like the regular jungle hills variant. Large amounts of bamboo covered the landscape, and patches of &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; replaced most &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s. Naturally-generated &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s were always large variants, and pandas spawned here, like in the bamboo jungle. &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;Jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s also spawned here .\n, bamboo jungle hills used the same mob spawning chances as jungle hills for hostile and ambient categories, and had different chances for passive categories:, bamboo jungle hills used the same mob spawning chances as bamboo jungles:\nJungle Hills.\nSimilar to the wooded hills biome, the jungle hills biome featured steeper terrain, making it a more difficult variant of the already difficult jungle for survival purposes. Ocelots, parrots, and pandas spawned here and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s generated here.\n, jungle hills used the same mob spawning chances as jungles for ambient categories, and had different chances for the others:, jungle hills used the same mob spawning chances as jungles:\nModified Jungle.\nThe rare modified jungle variant featured much more mountainous terrain, being taller and steeper than jungle hills. The heights, combined with the thick foliage, rendered the ground below almost entirely out of sight. Ocelots, parrots, and pandas spawned in this biome, but jungle pyramids didn't generate here.\n, modified jungles used the same mob spawning chances as jungle hills for hostile and ambient categories, and had different chances for passive categories:, modified jungles used the same mob spawning chances as jungles:\nModified Jungle Edge.\nThe rare modified jungle edge variant generated only in strict conditions, and it was the rarest biome in the game. If a jungle biome bordered a swamp hills biome, then the modified jungle edge spawned as part of a double-layered transition, with a thin normal jungle edge bordering the swamp hills, and the modified jungle edge bordering the jungle. As both jungles and swamp hills were already rare, and even more rarely did they generate bordering each other, the conditions for a modified jungle edge to generate were rarely met. When they actually did manage to generate, they were often just a few hundred blocks in length, but in some cases were less than 10 blocks, making them one of the smallest biomes as well. Modified jungle edges featured the same smooth transition and lowered tree density that regular jungle edges had, though with much more mountainous terrain and occasional overhangs. Ocelots, parrots, and pandas spawned in this biome, but jungle pyramids didn't generate here. Modified jungle edges covered only a few millionths (0.00027%) of the overworld by area.\nModified jungle edges used the same mob spawning chances as jungle edges.\nMountains.\nGravelly Mountains+.\nGravelly mountains+, also referred to as modified gravelly mountains in code, was a rare variant of the wooded hill biome that had the exact same features as the regular gravelly mountains, making this biome almost indistinct from the former. with the only difference being the fact that it can rarely generate standalone as a thick separation when a desert lakes biome borders a snowy biome.\nGravelly mountains+ had the same mob spawning chances as windswept hills.\nMountain Edge.\nThe mountain edge variant used to generate before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly to the &lt;a href=\"sparse%20jungle\"&gt;sparse jungle&lt;/a&gt; biome, it was a technical biome intended to provide a smooth transition from other biomes to the windswept hills. It was nearly identical to the biome, but with gentler slopes.\nMountain edges had the same mob spawning chances as windswept hills.\nMushroom Field Shore.\nThe mushroom field shore was a technical biome that represented both the &lt;a href=\"Beach\"&gt;shores&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s of the mushroom fields. It generated when a river cus through it as well as when it bordered an ocean, unless the ocean was a deep variant, in which case a steep cliff generated instead. The terrain of this biome was much flatter and shallower in elevation, similar to beaches, though it was equal to the mushroom fields in every other way. &lt;a href=\"Buried%20treasure\"&gt;Buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s generated here.\nMushroom field shores used the same mob spawning chances as mushroom fields.\nShattered Savanna Plateau.\nLike the normal windswept savanna, the shattered savanna plateau variant featured steep mountains, cliffs, and overhangs, which made it a treacherous place to explore. Though it was nearly indistinguishable from the regular shattered savanna at first glance, the shattered plateau's terrain was slightly gentler, though often risked fatal fall &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; if not above &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. The giant lakes characteristic of the regular shattered savanna did not generate here either. , the foliage was a more vibrant green color, and rain would often occur in it.\nShattered savanna plateaus used the same mob spawning chances as savannas.\nSnowy Mountains.\nThese hills were no taller than most other hill biomes in the game, despite the name 'mountains'. No structures generated in this biome, though polar bears, rabbits and strays spawned. Caves frequently generated on the sides of the mountains. , no hostile mobs other than strays and skeletons spawned here.\nSnowy mountains used the same mob spawning chances as snowy plains.\nSnowy Taiga.\nSnowy Taiga Hills.\nLike all other hills biomes, snowy taiga hills featured hillier, more erratic terrain. These hills were somewhat steep, making this variant difficult for &lt;a href=\"survival%20mode\"&gt;survival mode&lt;/a&gt;. Pillager outposts and villages generated in this biome, however, unlike the regular snowy taiga, igloos didn't generate here.\nSnowy taiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as snowy taigas.\nSnowy Taiga Mountains.\nThe very rare snowy taiga mountains featured much steeper terrain than the hills. Similarly to the taiga mountains, this variant reached high elevations. The steep elevations made this biome difficult for survival. Buildings didn't generate here. This biome was the third rarest in the game, behind modified badlands plateau and modified jungle edge.\nSnowy taiga mountains used the same mob spawning chances as snowy taigas.\nSwamp Hills.\nThe swamp hills variant featured hillier terrain rising up between the flat marshes. These hills would tower over the otherwise low-elevation swamp. Additionally, flooded areas in swamp hills tended to reach lower depths than the rest of the swamp, sometimes deep enough to have a &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; floor in place of a dirt floor, like normal &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s. Swamp huts did not generate in swamp hills, nor did slimes spawn, but fossils did still generate underground. Additionally, seagrass did not generate in flooded areas of swamp hills. If it connected to a it had a chance to create a modified jungle edge biome.\nSwamp hills used the same mob spawning chances as swamps.\nTaiga.\nTaiga Hills.\nTaiga hills, like all other hills biomes in the game, featured steeper terrain compared to the base taiga biome. Villages and outposts didn't generate in this biome, though wolves and foxes still spawned.\nTaiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as taigas.\nTaiga Mountains.\nThe rare taiga mountains variant was much steeper than the taiga hills, with peaks occasionally crossing the snowfall line. The steep terrain made this a more difficult version of the regular taiga. Like the hills, villages and outposts didn't generate here, though wolves and foxes still spawned.\nTaiga mountains used the same mob spawning chances as taigas.\nWooded Hills.\nWooded hills were similar to forests, though the terrain was hillier and generally more erratic, making it less suitable for shelter. Wolves spawned here.\nWooded hills used the same mob spawning chances as forests."}

The specific biome was determined by where the combination of temperature and rainfall put it.\nHeight variation was entirely independent of biome type, with biomes having no influence on the shape of terrain. This meant things like cliffs and mountains were able to generate up to nearly 128 on the y-axis in any biome. Tall grass was also much less present in pre-1.8 worlds (except in the \"Plains\" and \"Rainforest\" biomes).\nThere were 13 &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; types: 10 in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and 2 unused ones that are in the code but aren't encountered in normal play. These biomes were added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%201.2.0\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha 1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, and relatively few changes were undergone to these biomes other than the introduction of birch and spruce trees in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.2\"&gt;Beta 1.2&lt;/a&gt; (which allowed for new chunks to have birch trees generate in forests and spruce to generate in taiga in place of oak trees), desert biome borders being rotated due to then not lining up in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.4\"&gt;Beta 1.4&lt;/a&gt;, and the introduction of tall grass and ferns in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6\"&gt;Beta 1.6&lt;/a&gt;. \nGrass and foliage colors were determined by an algorithm based on the temperature and humidity, rather than from the biomes directly. This means there can be a wide range of different grass and foliage colors for any one biome. Once the game gets the temperature and humidity values by pulling grass and foliage colors, it uses said values to grab colors from /misc/grasscolor.png or /misc/foliagecolor.png, and applies it to the uncolored grass or leaves. The same implementation also existed for water colorization with /misc/watercolor.png. However, this feature wasn't enabled in the code, and wasn't implemented until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is most commonly found in birch forest biomes. Tall birches are found only in old growth birch forest biomes and cannot be grown with saplings without the use of cheats. As with oaks, a birch tree near flowers can generate with a &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; attached.\nVariants.\nThere are two types of birch trees:\nBirch trees that are grown from saplings grow to be 5 to 7 blocks tall, while birch trees in the old growth birch forest biome can generate with trunks up to 13 blocks in height.\nLeaf arrangement.\nAll birch trees lack branches. Birch trees always grow around 50 to 60 leaves. The leaf distributions are shown visually above, each table cell representing one 'slice' of the tree viewed from above. The transparent leaves represent areas where leaves \"may\" grow, but do not always. The growth pattern, in detail, is as follows:\nSmall oak and 1\u00d71 jungle trees also have this arrangement of leaves.\nGeneration.\nRegular birch trees generate in &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;, while tall birch trees only generate in &lt;a href=\"old%20growth%20birch%20forest\"&gt;old growth birch forest&lt;/a&gt;s and rarely in meadow.\nA regular birch near &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s may generate with a &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; attached.\nGeneration.\nThe birch tree variants spawn naturally in the indicated biomes:\nBlocks and items.\nThese items can be obtained from birch trees, except that saplings cannot be obtained from tall birch:\nPlanting.\nBirch &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s can be planted on:\nOnly normal birch trees can be grown from saplings. Tall birch trees generate naturally in the world.\nBirch trees require a 3\u00d73 column of unobstructed space at least 6 blocks above the sapling to grow (7 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, birch trees require 5\u00d75 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow).\nA birch tree grown from a sapling and within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a bee nest containing 1\u20133 bees.\nFallen birch trees.\n, a fallen birch may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.\nA fallen birch tree has a log length of 5\u20138 blocks. A fallen tall birch has a log length of 5\u201315 blocks. The stump is never covered in &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoliage colors.\nBirch leaves do not follow the &lt;a href=\"tint\"&gt;foliage color&lt;/a&gt; rules that cause the trees to appear in different colors in different biomes. Birch leaves are always the same color regardless of the biome."}

Blast furnaces serve as the counterpart to &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used mainly to cook food faster. Smelting equipment yields one iron or gold nugget from their respective materials. Once an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; are placed into the blast furnace, the block state changes to and the item is smelted twice as fast as a regular furnace.

If a blast furnace's codice_2 tag is not blank, the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the codice_2 tag's text.

Blazes attack at range by firing a trio of fireballs or can attack the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; that gets too close to them with their spinning rods.\nSpawning.\nBlazes may spawn naturally in nether fortresses in groups of 2 or 3 at a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 11 or less. Blazes spawn from &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s in nether fortresses. The spawners are located on small platforms with a three-block staircase leading up to it.\nDrops.\nA blaze may drop 1 or from 0 to 4 with &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; III when killed by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"tamed%20wolf\"&gt;tamed wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs are dropped if killed by a player or tamed wolf.\nBehavior.\nBlazes are immune to damage from fire and lava, and &lt;a href=\"fly\"&gt;fly&lt;/a&gt;, although when not attacking they stay on the ground or sink down slowly through the air. Blazes attempt to swim upward in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Blazes fall through lava and water when idle. Despite taking damage from water, blazes make no attempt to protect themselves if pushed or dropped into water.

If a blaze is damaged by a player or other mob, it alerts other blazes within 48 blocks to target the attacker. A blaze flies when it acquires a target, slowly approaching while attempting to remain from 0.5 to 3.5 blocks above the target.\nA blaze's normal attack is a trio of &lt;a href=\"small%20fireball\"&gt;small fireball&lt;/a&gt;s, shot from up to 48 blocks or 16 blocks. A blaze shoots only when it has a clear line of sight to its target. If line of sight is broken in the middle of its volley, the blaze suspends the remainder of its volley until line of sight returns. When using this attack, the blaze burns with fire for 3 seconds, shoots three small fireballs over the course of 0.9 seconds, then extinguishes its flames and waits for 5 seconds before attacking again. A blaze shoots its small fireballs with roughly the same lack of accuracy as a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;; however, the blaze's shots maintain the same speed all the way to the target, unlike the dispenser's, which start slow and accelerate. \nA blaze that touches its target performs a melee attack that does damage on normal difficulty, once per second. This attack is not considered fire damage and does not ignite the target. This cannot be prevented by the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nSounds.\nBlazes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nBlazes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nHistory.\n "}

They can be prevented from oxidising by being waxed with &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s.

If a block of copper is mined without the use of a pickaxe, it drops nothing.\nWaxing.\nCopper blocks can be turned into the respective waxed copper blocks by a &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; item on them. Waxed copper blocks do not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.\nScraping.\n an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; on a waxed copper block turns it into the respective non-waxed copper block. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized copper block reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper block respectively.\nLightning strike.\nNon-waxed copper blocks are completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed copper blocks nearby are deoxidized randomly.\nUsage.\nBlocks of copper can be used to store copper ingots in a compact fashion. Weathered or cut variants cannot be crafted back into copper ingots, but the waxed block variant can. The cut variant can be crafted into slabs or stairs. Stonecutting blocks of copper gives four times more products than typical for stone.\nOxidation.\nNon-waxed copper blocks have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20bolt\"&gt;Lightning bolt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s can remove the oxidation on copper blocks. \nAs the block begins to oxidize (exposed copper), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered copper), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized copper), the block is teal with several green spots.\nOxidation of copper blocks relies only on &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;s. Rain or water does not accelerate oxidation, and covering copper blocks with other blocks does not prevent oxidation.\n, groups of non-waxed copper blocks oxidize far more slowly than single copper blocks that are spaced at least 4 blocks apart. This is because a block in a group being less oxidized than the others slows down the oxidation process for all other blocks within 4 blocks of &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;. However, if one wishes to increase the oxidation speed, placing oxidized copper blocks around less oxidized copper blocks \"does not\" offer a speed improvement over simply placing the blocks 4 apart. The calculations for the oxidation behavior are as follows:\n, when a random tick is given, a copper block has a chance to enter a state called pre-oxidation. This means a copper block enters pre-oxidation after approximately 20 minutes.\nIn pre-oxidation, the copper block searches its nearby non-waxed copper blocks for a distance of 4 blocks &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;. If there is any copper block that has a lower oxidation level, then the pre-oxidation ends, meaning that this copper block does not weather. \nLet \"a\" be the number of all nearby non-waxed copper blocks, and \"b\" be the number of nearby non-waxed copper blocks that have a higher oxidation level. We derive the value of c from this equation: \"c\" = . We also let the modifying factor \"m\" be 0.75 if the copper block has no oxidation level, or 1 if the copper block is exposed or weathered. Then the oxidation probability is \"mc2\".\nFor example, an unweathered copper block surrounded by 6 unweathered copper blocks and 6 exposed copper blocks has a 21.7% chance to oxidize if it enters the pre-oxidation state. In this case, a = 12, b = 6, and m = 0.75.\nThe most efficient way of laying out the copper blocks for oxidation is in a 7\u00d77\u00d76 . \nDeoxidation.\n an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; on a waxed copper block turns it into the respective non-waxed copper block. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized copper block reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper block respectively. The axe removes wax first, then oxidation layers.\nLightning can also remove oxidation from copper blocks. A lightning bolt striking an non-waxed copper block (or a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt; attached to one) removes all oxidation from the struck block, and may also deoxidize randomly selected copper blocks nearby.\n, these additional blocks are chosen by \"random walks\" as follows: The position of the struck copper block is set as the \"start point\". Then, the game performs 3 to 5 \"walks\". In the beginning of each walk, a \"judgment point\" is set at the start point. For each step of the walk, the game randomly selects 10 blocks from a 3\u00d73\u00d73 volume centered on the judgment point. If an non-waxed copper block is found among these 10 blocks, the judgment point is transferred to the \"first\" such block found, and 1 oxidation layer of that block is removed (if the block is still unoxidized, the block stays as it is). The number of steps in a walk is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), chosen randomly for each walk. This means that one single lightning strike can deoxidize up to 41 blocks (1 block initially struck by lightning + 5 max walks*8 max steps in every walk)."}

When a block changes (due to a player, an entity, or a &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Chunk_tick\"&gt;chunk tick&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), it notifies nearby blocks that they should check if they need to respond to the change.\n\"Java Edition\".\n, there are three types of block updates: post placement (PP), neighbor changed (NC), and comparator.\nPriorities.\nWhen a block changes, it can send different block updates that have different priorities:\nPost placement update.\nA post placement (PP) update (aka update post placement, update neighbor shapes, update shape) is the most common type of block updates, mainly used for connected blocks changing their shapes (e.g. stairs, fences) and attached blocks dropping into items (e.g. torches, cactus, wheat). It almost always has a priority of 2.\nReceiving.\nWhen a block receives a PP update, the direction of the PP update may be considered. For example, a &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; block accepts only PP updates from beneath.\nOnly following blocks can receive PP updates:\nNeighbor changed update.\nNeighbor changed (NC) updates (aka neighbor changed, update neighbors, redstone update) are the most widely known type of block updates, and are mainly used for redstone components.\nReceiving.\nWhen a block receives a NC update, the source of the NC update may be considered. For example, a rail accepts only NC updates from power components.\nOnly following blocks can receive NC updates:\nComparator update.\n&lt;a href=\"Redstone%20comparator\"&gt;Redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;s can use certain blocks and entities as power sources, and in turn, the blocks or entities send comparator updates (i.e. Block entity updates, Update neighbor for output signal) when changing.\nWhen a block/entity that can be detected by comparators changes, it sends updates to surrounding comparators (include comparators separated by a solid block), in order of north, east, south, and west.\nOnly comparators can receive these updates. When receiving, they calculates and changes their signal.\nSpecial blocks.\nPistons and beds have complex behavior.\nBlock updates and DFS.\nBlock updates follow the principle of DFS.\nFor example, when Block A changes, it maybe sends block updates to B and C one by one. Receiving the update, B maybe changes and sends updates to D and E. Receiving update from B, D changes and sends updates to some block. Then E receives the update from B. Then C receives the update from A.\nSelf update.\nWhen a block is placed, it maybe checks and adapts itself to its surroundings, in a priority of -1. Strictly speaking, this isn't a block update. However , there is a significant bug: When a block is placed/changed, if it changes again when self update, then the former change does not produce any updates that is in a priority of 0, 1, or 2. That's why self update is mentioned on this page.\nHere is a list that self updates that can cause the bug."}

When released at half charge or more, the trident is thrown and deals damage to any &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; it hits. Note that it doesn't have to be full charge for the complete damage and length. It flies on a ballistic trajectory similar to that of an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;, but at 80% strength.

A Loyalty-enchanted trident fired from a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; just sticks to the block it strikes. Higher levels of enchantment result in shorter recovery times. , throwing a trident enchanted with Loyalty into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; destroys it, while it automatically returns to the player. Tridents (if enchanted with Loyalty), can take &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage but still return to the player if thrown in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. This is especially helpful in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; should the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; be using a trident instead of a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. If a trident enchanted with Loyalty attempts to return to a player with no available inventory space, the trident floats near the player until inventory space becomes available.\nThrown tridents take 1 durability damage, regardless of whether it hit an entity or not. Tridents with 1 durability remaining cannot be thrown.\nTridents enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; launch the player a certain distance when thrown, with the distance increasing for higher enchantment levels. They can be thrown only if the player is standing in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, or if it is raining on the block they are standing on. If the player charges it but walks into a nearby dry area, the charge is canceled. If the player throws a Riptide trident and collides with a mob, the mob takes melee damage (including critical damage if the player is falling). tridents enchanted with Riptide take one durability damage upon throwing, and lose an additional 1 durability if it collides with an entity on both editions. Each level of Riptide increases the distance traveled by six blocks. The enchantment at level one launches the player nine blocks, fifteen blocks at level two, and twenty-one blocks at level three.\nTridents enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; summon a lightning bolt if there is a thunderstorm, although only upon hitting a mob or player standing in the rain as well as a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt; placed in the rain.\nUnlike other projectiles, the trident does not slow down when thrown through water or lava.\n, the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment affects \"all water mobs\". , it deals extra damage to &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s and mobs in water or rain.\nUnlike arrows, thrown tridents do not despawn. Tridents despawn after 60 seconds if they are not picked up.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt;, nearby players or mobs are dealt &lt;a href=\"Harming\"&gt;splash damage&lt;/a&gt; within an 8.25\u00d78.25\u00d74.25 cubical area. It stacks with the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment and &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; effect.

There are 2,700 naturally occurring variants of tropical fish of different colors and shapes with unique names.\nSpawning.\n, random varieties of tropical fish spawn in groups of 8 in lukewarm or warm oceans (as well as their deep variants) at Y-level 50 to 63, and in lush caves at any Y-level. They are subject to &lt;a href=\"Fish%23Spawning\"&gt;fish spawning requirements&lt;/a&gt;.\n, tropical fish spawn underwater at 12-32 blocks away from the player. Tropical fish spawn only in warm, lukewarm, deep lukewarm ocean biomes and lush caves, in groups of 3-5 for the same preset pattern, and in groups of 1-3 for a random pattern. In addition, tropical fish in warm, lukewarm ocean and deep variants can only spawn at Y levels between 50 and 64 and must be on the surface (i.e., there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top). Tropical fish in lush caves can spawn on any Y levels but require underground.\nBehavior.\nTropical fish tend to swim in schools of fish (a maximum of nine tropical fish per school). Tropical fish are also able to go against the water flow.\nThe player may collect a fish by a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; on it, which gives the player a &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20fish\"&gt;bucket of fish&lt;/a&gt;. Fish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it.\nWeaknesses.\nTropical fish cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until eventually they suffocate and die. , they rotate when flipping. Fish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.\nFish have a weakness to weapons that have the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, which also affects &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVarieties.\n\"Java Edition\".\nWhen tropical fish spawn in the wild, 90% of the time they appear as one of the 22 varieties seen on the right, and the other 10% of the time their patterns, size, and colors are completely random, drawn from any of 2 shapes, 6 patterns, 15 base colors, and 15 pattern colors. The color black does not appear on any naturally-spawned tropical fish, since the eyes are usually hard to see. These result in 2,700 naturally-occurring combinations.\nTropical fish can be &lt;a href=\"summoned\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; with black as one or both of their colors, and/or without any visible pattern, though even without the pattern they can still have a pattern color, causing a further 884 possible combinations, 480 of which look the same due to the missing pattern.\nBedrock Edition.\nTropical fish do not have common varieties . Instead, naturally spawned tropical fish have 2 spawn attempts, the first chooses one of the 21 preset variants, and the other will use randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black)\nTropical fish spawned from a spawn egg will use randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black).\nBy using commands, tropical fish may be spawned as one of the 21 preset variants.\nNames.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;Tropical fish variants in buckets have names that are assigned based on their colors and type. , the names are in the name of the bucket, giving names like \"Bucket of Plum Blockfish\", \"Bucket of Sky-Orange Snooper\", or \"Bucket of Orange-Lime Dasher\". , the type, and colors are displayed as item tooltips. \n, the following colors are renamed from their defaults when they refer to tropical fish. Parentheses indicate default name and color id - see \u00a7 Entity data.\nThe base color is first, and the pattern color is next if it is different.\nThe fish type is determined according to the shape and pattern of the fish:\nSome varieties of tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system; instead, they reference real-life fish species. , these unique fish are limited to the 22 common varieties. , there are 21 uniquely-named tropical fish, though they are not all the same as . These uniquely-named tropical fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.

They are the only source of &lt;a href=\"scute\"&gt;scute&lt;/a&gt;s, which drop from baby turtles when they mature into adults.\nSpawning.\nTurtles spawn on the sand in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;es with daylight, but not in its &lt;a href=\"Beach%23Snowy%20Beach\"&gt;snowy variant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Beach%23Stony%20Shore\"&gt;stony shores&lt;/a&gt;, occasionally in small groups of up to 5 individuals.\n10% of turtles spawned are babies.\n, turtles spawn at &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt;s greater than 8, on &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; blocks less than 4 blocks above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;.\n, turtles spawn in groups of 2\u20136, at light level 7 or higher, at Y=60\u201367.\nDrops.\nWhen turtles &lt;a href=\"die\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;, they drop:\nBaby turtles do not drop anything when they &lt;a href=\"die\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a baby turtle grows up to an adult it drops:\nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped.\nBehavior.\nTurtles can both move around on land and swim in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. They move slowly on land, but they can swim at a fast speed in the water. Like other passive &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, they move around aimlessly and flee when attacked. When on land, they generally attempt to move to the nearest water source with direct sky access. When in an enclosed area, such as a player-made enclosure, they generally swim in circles if the water is in the area, and rarely go on land to explore, if there is any.\nTurtles cannot be attached to &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s, but they can be led by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; holding &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt; within 10 blocks of the turtle.\nTurtles can be picked up by &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTurtles are killed instantly when struck by lightning.\nAs with other &lt;a href=\"aquatic%20mobs\"&gt;aquatic mobs&lt;/a&gt;, turtles suffer extra damage when hit by a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, and cannot drown, despite the fact that real-life turtles breathe air.\nPredators.\nTurtles and &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s are attacked by the following mobs:\nZombies and their variants deliberately trample on turtle eggs, causing them to break.\nHome beach.\nTurtles remember the block on which they hatch as their home beach. No matter how far away the turtle is, it always attempts to return to its home beach to lay its eggs after &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player uses a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; to obtain and move &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s to a new location before hatching, the baby turtles remember the new hatching location as their home beach.\nIf a turtle is spawned from a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;, summoned with the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;, or spawned by &lt;a href=\"mob%20spawner\"&gt;mob spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, it remembers the spawn location as its home beach.\nBreeding.\nFeeding two turtles &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt; causes them to enter &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;love mode&lt;/a&gt;, causing one of the turtles to have &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; and appear a bit bigger (about 0.2 of a block) than normal turtles. The pregnant turtle then travels back to its home beach, which is where it first spawned. Upon arrival, it seeks a nearby &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; block on which to lay its eggs. A turtle always lays eggs within 9 blocks from where it was born. The turtle digs vigorously while turning 360 degrees for several seconds a few times, and then lays 1\u20134 &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s. Turtles have a 90-second cooldown after breeding , and a five-minute cooldown .\nEggs.\n&lt;a href=\"Turtle%20egg\"&gt;Turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s can be placed on any block in clusters of up to 4, however, they hatch only on &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20sand\"&gt;suspicious sand&lt;/a&gt;, above or below water. Eggs can be broken without tools and can also be trampled by living entities falling or walking on them. When a multi-egg block is trampled, eggs are broken one at a time. A turtle can walk on the eggs without breaking them. Harvesting eggs with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; drops an egg, which the player can collect. Mining an egg with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; resets the egg's growth.\nTurtle eggs progress toward hatching by cracking. Cracking occurs during random ticks, and an egg hatches once it has cracked 3 times. When a multi-egg block hatches, all eggs within the block hatch simultaneously. Eggs grow fastest during the night and typically take 4 to 5 in-game days to hatch. See &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20egg%23Hatching\"&gt;Turtle egg#Hatching&lt;/a&gt; for more details.\nBabies.\nWith a height of 0.12 blocks, baby turtles are among the smallest &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in the game. Baby turtles are small enough that when they walk on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, they are entirely within the space at the top of the &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon hatching, baby turtles search for the nearest water block within a 47\u00d71\u00d747 region two blocks below the turtle and attempt to approach it.\nBaby turtles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes). The growth can be accelerated using &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt;. Each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%. Upon becoming an adult, the turtle drops a &lt;a href=\"scute\"&gt;scute&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nTurtles use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nTurtles have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

If broken without the enchantment, pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, or broken by a player or mob falling onto it, the egg breaks without dropping anything.\nWhen mining a cluster of more than one turtle eggs, the eggs break one at a time, instead of all at once like other clustered blocks such as &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"candle\"&gt;candle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBreaking a cracked turtle egg with a Silk Touch tool resets the growth stage when the egg is placed on a different block.\nPost-generation.\nAfter two turtles are bred with &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt;, one of them travels back to its home beach, digs in the &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, and lays an egg block with 1\u20134 eggs after several seconds. See hatching mechanics below.\nTrampling.\nTurtle eggs can be trampled by living entities (players, mobs, etc.) that fall onto or stand on top of them. Eggs in a multi-egg block are trampled one at a time until no eggs remain. End crystals can also break turtle eggs if they explode.\nEggs can be trampled by a crouch-walking (or \"&lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;\") player. Though eggs cannot be trampled by non-living entities like arrows, they can be trampled by &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s. When a falling block such as an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; block is dropped onto an egg, the falling block is dropped and turned into an item leaving the egg unharmed.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and their variants (&lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s) seek out and trample turtle eggs that have 2 blocks of air above them unless is false. The range of detection is a 47\u00d77\u00d747 or 11\u00d75\u00d711 box centered on the block the mob is standing on. When a player in Survival or Adventure Game-mode is nearby (also includes &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s), the zombie prefers to attack the player rather than trampling the turtle egg.\nOther than zombies and their variants, mobs do not seek out turtle eggs to trample them, but still may break them by accident. An entity falling onto an egg has a chance of trampling the egg and an entity standing on top of an egg has a chance per tick of trampling the egg.\n&lt;a href=\"Turtle\"&gt;Turtle&lt;/a&gt;s cannot break turtle eggs, even when they are on top of them.\nUsage.\nPlacement.\nUp to 4 turtle eggs can be placed in one block and slowly hatch into turtles. Though turtle eggs can be placed on any block, they only hatch on sand blocks. When adding more eggs to an existing block, they will retain their hatching progress.\nTurtle eggs do not require a supporting block below and unlike dragon eggs are not affected by gravity. Eggs are also capable of supporting lanterns hanging under them.\nHatching.\nTurtle eggs hatch on sand and red sand. Eggs crack over time and hatch after cracking three times. Eggs hatch significantly faster at nighttime.\nTurtle eggs have a very low chance of cracking during &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;s during the day (1/500 chance). However, they are guaranteed to crack during random ticks between 21600 and 22550 ticks in-game time (3:36 am and 4:33 am). This is a roughly 48-second window for the player. About 95% of eggs crack or hatch during this night-time window. On average, an egg hatches in 4-5 nights. 90% of eggs hatch in 7 nights or less.\nWhen a multi-egg block hatches, all eggs hatch simultaneously.\nEggs do not progress toward hatching if the player is not within 128 blocks of horizontal distance of the egg. This is due to the egg's chunk not receiving random ticks."}

Each tutorial hint appears as a toast in the top right of the screen (much like new &lt;a href=\"Recipe%20Book\"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"advancements\"&gt;advancements&lt;/a&gt;). Each hint consists of the hint title, a description of how to complete it, and an image to describe it.

In the four-block crafting space, place the log and pick up the &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; from the output slot. Distribute these four planks evenly in the crafting space to make a 2\u00d72 square and pick up the resulting crafting table.\nAlternatively, use the recipe book and just click the crafting table to craft it.\nTime to Farm!\nGoal: Construct a wooden &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlace the &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; you just made on the ground, and right-click with your mouse on it, to use it. If you changed the use &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;/place &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; key to something else, use that instead.\nThen make some &lt;a href=\"sticks\"&gt;sticks&lt;/a&gt;, note that this can also be done in your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; crafting grid:\nNow arrange your sticks and some planks in the crafting table to make a hoe:\nBake Bread.\nGoal: Make &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreak several blocks of &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt; until you gain three &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s. You can do this with one seed but it will take longer.\nThen right-click with your hoe on three &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s to create &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, preferably near &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, so the seeds get hydrated, and grow faster.\nNext, hold the seeds, and right-click on all the farmland blocks. Wait for 1-3 in-game days for the seeds to grow into &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;. Alternately, using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on the seeds will cause it to grow into wheat faster.\nAfter that, break the wheat.\nArrange the wheat like so to craft bread:\nThe Lie!\nGoal: Make &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis achievement is a reference to the video game \"Portal\" which spawned the meme phrase \"The Cake Is A Lie\".\nCollect the following:\nIf you don't have a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;, you can also craft it using &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArrange the ingredients like so to craft &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;:\nTime to Strike!\nGoal: Construct a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20sword\"&gt;wooden sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nMake sure that you have one stick and two wooden planks in your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Better &lt;a href=\"materials\"&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; for the blade work for this &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; too.\nArrange the ingredients like so to craft a wooden sword:\nCow Tipper.\nGoal: Pick up &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind a &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;. Cows can appear at any place with &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and enough light, unless it is an ocean &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;. Horses and Donkeys can only spawn in a &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biome. Red mooshroom only spawn in &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; biome. Llamas only spawn in &lt;a href=\"mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; and savanna biomes. You may have to wander a bit to find one, so make sure you'll be able to find your way back.\nThen when you find one, stand next to it and left-click to hit it. You will need to hit it a lot to kill it. They can drop one or two &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; (cows along with &lt;a href=\"raw%20beef\"&gt;raw beef&lt;/a&gt;). If you did not get any, try the same with another cow, mooshroom, horse, donkey, or llama.\nAnother way to obtain the achievement is to find and kill some &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s until you have 4 &lt;a href=\"rabbit%20hide\"&gt;rabbit hide&lt;/a&gt;s. Then craft leather and throw it on the ground. When you pick it up, you'll get the achievement.\nAnother way is by fishing leather if you have luck.\nRepopulation.\nGoal: Breed two cows with each-other.\nUse wheat on 2 &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s or 2 &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s to make them breed.\nWhen Pigs Fly.\nGoal: Take any amount of fall damage when &lt;a href=\"Saddle\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;.\nGet a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse the saddle on a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;, which should be near a cliff. The easiest way to get it to jump off a cliff is to hold a carrot on a stick in your hand and walk, like you normally would, in the direction of the cliff until you and the pig fall.\nAlternatively, you can put the pig on a piston, trapdoor, fence gate, or any kind of opening mechanism. Then ride the pig up there and open the mechanism so you and the pig will take fall damage.\nMonster Hunter.\nGoal: Kill a hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; (monster).\nFind a hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, they can only spawn in darkness, so you should wait until night, or find a dark area like a cave. In &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, most can spawn in bright areas. In &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; can only spawn in darkness. You can also find a spawner in a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; and wait for a monster to spawn. &lt;a href=\"Silverfish\"&gt;Silverfish&lt;/a&gt; can be hidden in stone blocks in mountains biomes, and will spawn when the stone is broken.\nThen hit it until it dies. With a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or some &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s, this goes faster.\nSniper Duel.\nGoal: Kill a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; by shooting it from a distance of at least 50 blocks.\nFind a large flat area on the surface. Dig a trench one and a half blocks deep, two blocks wide and several blocks long. Line the trench with light. Just over 50 meters away from the lip of the trench, make a tower 15 blocks high. When night comes, wait for a skeleton to fall into the trench or lure it in. Then from your tower, aim just above the skeleton, about halfway between it and the horizon, and fire from full charge until it dies. With a &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;, you can see where your arrows landed better and can adjust your aim easier, but the skeleton might die of the fire, not giving the achievement.\nTime to Mine!\nGoal: Construct a &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Pickaxe\"&gt;Wooden Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nMake sure that you have 3 planks and 2 &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s in your inventory.\nArrange the ingredients like so or click the wooden pickaxe button in the recipe book to craft a wooden pickaxe:\nGetting an Upgrade.\nGoal: Construct a &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, or better, &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; from sticks and cobblestone, or other better ingredients.\nUse your new wooden pickaxe to mine some &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, which in return you will receive &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure that you have 2 sticks in your inventory.\nOverpowered.\nGoal: Eat an &lt;a href=\"Notch%20Apple\"&gt;Enchanted Apple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese can not be crafted as of 1.9. You must now find them in &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHot Topic.\nGoal: Construct a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nMine 8 blocks of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and open your crafting table. Arrange the cobblestone like so to craft a furnace:\nDelicious Fish.\nGoal: Obtain the item that gets created after cooking &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe easiest way to catch a fish is to swim underwater and using a sword, attacking the salmon/cod.\nAlternatively, you can craft and use a fishing rod. Cast your rod into a water body, then right-click so the \"bait\" lands into the water, and wait till it comes closer to the rod and right-click again when you hear a splash sound. The fish will fly towards you and probably will be picked up by you too. \nAt last, put the cod or salmon you got in the &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; like so:\nAcquire Hardware.\nGoal: Pick up an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;.\nMine &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; with a stone pickaxe, and put it in the furnace like so:\nAlternatively you can find them in various loot chests, and are also a rare drop from zombies.\nOn a Rail.\nGoal: Travel 500 blocks with a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; from where you started.\nIt will take at least 192 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s as well as 32 &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s to craft enough &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s (512 or 8 stacks). Alternatively, you can find and break them in &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. Then, build a continuous track so that a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; can travel the full distance. Afterwards, place a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; on the start of the track, then travel from the start to the end without leaving the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe achievement does not allow you to repeatedly loop the same section of the track.\nYou will most likely need &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s to get this achievement. These will take additional resources. You can also make a gradual decline from a great height to use gravity instead of powered rails.\nDIAMONDS!\nGoal: Pick up a &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nLook in various loot chests or search below &lt;a href=\"Level\"&gt;layer&lt;/a&gt; 16 for &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt; (layer 5-12 is also good, layer 12 is the best; press F3 to see your coordinates) and destroy it using your &lt;a href=\"iron%20pickaxe\"&gt;iron pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; explosions have a chance of dropping the diamond as well. Mineshafts are extremely useful for this achievement.\nArrange the ingredients like so to craft an iron pickaxe:\nDiamonds to you!\nGoal: Throw a diamond at another player or mob that can pick it up.\nDrop/throw a &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; using Q or the key that you use, at another player or mob that can pick it up, such as a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: Mobs won't pick up items on Easy difficulty, or if the gamerule codice_1 is sets to codice_2. &lt;a href=\"Fox\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;es do not work.\nEnchanter.\nGoal: Craft an &lt;a href=\"Enchantment%20Table\"&gt;Enchantment Table&lt;/a&gt;\nMake a diamond &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; so you can mine at least 4 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; (or find it in various loot chests):\nThen get 3 &lt;a href=\"paper\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; and 1 &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, the paper being made from &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s like so:\nThen craft a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; like so:\nArrange the ingredients like so to craft an enchantment table:\nLibrarian.\nGoal: Construct a &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt;.\nMake sure you have 6 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s in your inventory,\nArrange the ingredients like so to craft a bookshelf:\nTo achieve the maximum potential from the enchantment table, place 15 bookshelves 1 block away from the enchantment table (in a box shape), like this:\nAlthough not required, this is the most efficient method to acquire the highest enchantment possible. Any additional bookshelves around the enchantment table beyond 15 will not increase the maximum level beyond 30 and will only serve aesthetic purposes.\nOverkill.\nGoal: Deal 9 hearts of &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; in one hit.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchant\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt; with a level high enough to deal together with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%23Crafting\"&gt;sword's base damage&lt;/a&gt; at least in one hit to a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, enchant &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt;. Dealing &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s greatly helps for this achievement. Potions of strength will count as increased damage so strength will make this achievement easier. The &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; sword is the easiest.\nInto the Nether.\nGoal: Create a Nether Portal\nCollect at least 10 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; with a diamond or netherite &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; and build a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;. If you cannot get obsidian in item form, create a mold and pour &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; next to &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; source blocks (more details can be found in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20survival\"&gt;Tutorials/Nether survival&lt;/a&gt;). Light the nether portal with &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlace your obsidian blocks like so, upright. The cobblestone can be replaced with obsidian, or any other block (including air).\nYou can make nether portals up to 23\u00d723, but it is not recommended as it requires a lot of obsidian.\nReturn to Sender.\nGoal: Kill a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Ghast%23Ghast%20Fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;.\nAim at the &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; then punch the fireball when it is close enough to you to deflect it. If you can perfectly aim, a shot &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; bobber may hit the fireball and deflect it, or you can hit it back with a sword. When you are hitting it you have to time it right, and to hit it back with a sword you use the use button with a sword in your hand.\nInto Fire.\nGoal: Pick up a &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;.\nKill a &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; and collect its dropped &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;. An easy way to do this is to find a nether fortress, then find a blaze &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;. Armed with over 7 &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s, attack the blaze from range. Blazes don\u2019t always drop their rods so you might have to try a few times. A potion of Fire Resistance is useful. Upon the blaze's death, collect the rod.\nLocal Brewery.\nGoal: Pick up a &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; from one of the 3 lower &lt;a href=\"Brewing%20Stand\"&gt;Brewing Stand&lt;/a&gt;'s slots.\nGet a &lt;a href=\"water%20bottle\"&gt;water bottle&lt;/a&gt;, Place it in one of the 3 lower &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;'s slots, then put &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; in the fuel slot. Then put a potion ingredient in it, and wait until it is done brewing. If you don't have glass bottle, you can craft it using glass. To create glass, smelt sand:\nNext, craft an glass bottle:\nThen fill the glass bottle with water, to turn it into a water bottle.\nArrange the ingredients like so to craft a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe End?\nGoal: Enter an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrow ender eyes and follow them to locate a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen find the &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;'s portal room.\nAfter that activate the portal by using an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt; in every empty &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; edge block slot, then jump into the portal.\nArrange the ingredients like so to craft an eye of ender:\nAdventuring Time.\nGoal: Set foot in 17 biomes.\nTravel and step into 17 biomes in the game.\nNote: This achievement is almost unobtainable in old worlds.\nThe End..\nGoal: Enter the &lt;a href=\"Exit%20Portal\"&gt;Exit Portal&lt;/a&gt; after killing the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere is how to slay it:\nThe Beginning?\nGoal: Spawn the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere are some tips for how to spawn it:\nOnce you have three wither skeleton skulls and four soul sand, build the wither as follows:\nThe Beginning..\nGoal: Kill the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is the easiest way to defeat the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, however, some would say it takes the fun out of killing the wither. It's your game, so play it how you want to play. but this is the most efficient way:\nBeaconator.\nGoal: Create a full beacon.\nCraft a beacon:\nThis is the second most tedious achievement because you will need 164 blocks of gem/metal, or 1,476 gem/metal ingots (around 23 stacks).\nMOAR Tools.\nGoal: Construct one of each type of tool.\nThis achievement is fairly simple. Collect 4 logs and then turn them all into planks. Use 4 of the planks to craft 8 sticks. Lastly, use the remaining planks and sticks to craft a wooden pickaxe, axe, shovel, and hoe. You should have 3 planks left over.\nCrafting wooden axe and shovel:\nNote: You can also use other materials such as stone, gold, iron, or diamonds to get the achievement.\nDispense With This.\nGoal: Craft a dispenser.\nThis achievement has several steps:\nLeader of the Pack.\nGoal: Tame a total of five wolves.\nMake sure you have at least 30 bones incase of defective dog taming and they are found in:\nPork Chop.\nGoal: Eat a piece of porkchop.\nYou are going to need some raw porkchop to earn this achievement, so kill a pig or a &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt; until you get at least a porkchop. You also need a furnace (or a &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;). Mine 8 cobblestone and craft a furnace (and you can use the furnace and 4 stripped logs for a smoker, or instead [insert materials to make a campfire here] to make a campfire) on your work bench. Use some fuel to power the furnace (or smoker, if you use a campfire just right click the campfire with the pork) and put the pork in the top spot.\nAfter eating the cooked porkchop, the achievement is awarded to you!\nAwarded All Trophies.\nGoal: Get All of the achievements completed.\nAutomatically obtained when all other trophies have been obtained (PlayStation only).\nPassing the Time.\nGoal: Play for 100 days.\nPlay for 100 Minecraft days, which is equal to 33 hours and 20 minutes in real time.\nThe Haggler.\nGoal: Acquire or spend 30 &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;s by trading.\nFind a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, if you see a farm and farmer villager, see what their trades are, you can sell wheat, potato, carrot, or beetroot depending on what the farmer offers. You may need an extra farm if you cannot find these crops already growing in the village. You can easily get a ton of emeralds using this method, up to 12 per day for each farmer villager. You can also trade with a butcher villager for 7 raw porkchops for an emerald.\nPot Planter.\nGoal: Craft a &lt;a href=\"Flower%20Pot\"&gt;Flower Pot&lt;/a&gt;\nThis achievement has several steps:\nIt's a Sign!\nGoal: Place a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;\nYou need a stick and 6 planks then craft a sign, then finally place it.\nIron Belly.\nGoal: Eat &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;Rotten Flesh&lt;/a&gt; while Starving\nYou need to deplete your hunger bar to zero (empty), then eat rotten flesh.

If you don't live in the ocean, you need to find one. Create a map using a cartography table, so it only costs one paper instead of nine. Then, add a pointer by adding a compass to an empty map. After an empty locator is created, use the map and zoom in from scale level 1:1 to 1:8, which requires 3 papers if zoomed in using a cartography table. As you fill the map, you having a high chance to find ocean ruins, since it's commonly generated in the ocean, but rarely on lands. This method is very effective for frozen ocean biomes and deep variants since dolphins don't spawn here. Keep your eyes peeled, ocean ruins are made of a block, which resembles the ocean floor, in regular ocean, cold ocean, frozen ocean, and their deep variants ruins primarily made out of stone brick as the ocean floor is gravel, while in warm, lukewarm, and their deep variants primarily made out of sandstone as the ocean floor is sand.\nSail the 7 Seas.\nGoal: Visit 9 &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt; biomes.\nThere are 11 ocean biomes variants, but 2 of them which are and are unused, so only 9 of ocean biomes which is:\nYou can travel using boat or swimming.

After you get kelp, cook it in furnace, smoker, or campfire.\nAhoy!\nGoal: Find a &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck\"&gt;Shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis achievement is a bit harder than finding ruins as shipwrecks are rarer than ocean ruins. On rare occasions, you may find shipwrecks on land. Shipwrecks will be easily visible as they are made out of planks, which easy to spot. Also, undamaged shipwrecks are more noticeable, especially in warm oceans, due to coral reefs making them easy to distinguish.\nI'm a Marine Biologist.\nGoal: Catch &lt;a href=\"Cod\"&gt;Cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salmon\"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pufferfish\"&gt;Pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Fish\"&gt;Tropical Fish&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Bucket\"&gt;Empty Bucket&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;Water Bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nHold an empty bucket or water bucket, then press use on a cod, salmon, pufferfish, or tropical fish. Cod can only spawn in lukewarm, normal, and cold ocean (along with their deep variants). Pufferfish and tropical fish spawn only in warm oceans. Salmon spawn in cold, frozen ocean (along with their deep variants), river and frozen river. Salmon are the easiest to encounter, since rivers are easier to find than oceans.\nDo a Barrel Roll!\nGoal: Use &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt; to launch yourself any distance with it.\nTo obtain a trident, you must kill some drowned. You can find them in the ocean and rivers or you can convert zombies into drowned. Drowned can still drop tridents, even when they don't spawn holding a trident.\nAfter you have a trident, enchant it with Riptide. Since it can only be launched during rain or when on water, you can go to one block water then facing to the sky and throw the trident.\nMe Gold!\nGoal: Open a &lt;a href=\"Buried%20treasure\"&gt;Buried Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo find buried treasure, first, you need to find treasure maps, this map can be found in &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s and underwater ruins. Treasure maps usually lead you to &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20beach\"&gt;snowy beach&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"stone%20shore\"&gt;stone shore&lt;/a&gt;s, or even &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20field%20shore\"&gt;mushroom field shore&lt;/a&gt;s. If it generates in a stone shore, the buried treasure will usually generate higher than sea level. Buried treasure is marked with an 'X' on the map. Use your pickaxe to break stone and shovel to dig sand. Lastly, open the treasure chest.\nMoskstraumen.\nGoal: Construct a &lt;a href=\"Conduit\"&gt;Conduit&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse prismarine, prismarine bricks, dark prismarine, or sea lanterns to make a conduit frame. Conduits can only active if the 3\u00d73\u00d73 area around it is filled with water. Prismarine, dark prismarine, sea lanterns, and prismarine bricks can be found in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. Prismarine and sea lanterns can also be found in cold underwater ruins. You can also craft it from ingredients dropped by &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThen, you need to find 8 &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s, which is dropped by &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; that is holding it, bought from &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s or as fishing junk. Next, you need to find a &lt;a href=\"heart%20of%20the%20sea\"&gt;heart of the sea&lt;/a&gt;, which always contains one in buried treasure.\nNow, craft a conduit:\nSleep with the Fishes.\nGoal: Spend 20 minutes underwater without any air. \nBrew 3 potions of Water Breathing (8:00). Drink a potion and stay underwater without losing oxygen. Each potion lasts for 8 minutes so you have an extra 24 minutes of water breathing, more than 4 minutes of the goal required. While you're underwater, you can explore underwater caverns, the sea floor, fight &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, find structures such shipwrecks, ocean ruins, or ocean monuments, or build underwater to spend the 20 minutes.\n&lt;a href=\"Conduit%20Power\"&gt;Conduit Power&lt;/a&gt; also grants you underwater breathing indefinitely as long you are underwater near an active conduit.\nAlternative Fuel.\nGoal: Power a furnace with a &lt;a href=\"Dried%20Kelp%20Block\"&gt;Kelp Block&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, you need to get 9 dried kelp, then craft it into a block, lastly use it as fuel in furnace.\nOne Pickle, Two Pickle, Sea Pickle, Four.\nGoal: Place four &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Pickle\"&gt;Sea Pickle&lt;/a&gt;s in a group \nFind sea pickles in a warm ocean. Alternatively, if you cannot find a warm ocean, go to desert villages and find small houses that have 2 sea pickles as mugs. Then, place 4 sea pickles in a single block.\nTop of the World.\nGoal: Place Scaffolding to the world limit. \nFirst, you need some string and bamboo. Bamboo can be found in large quantities at &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20jungle\"&gt;bamboo jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Bamboo can also be found in jungle temple chests and appear rarely in regular &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s. It can also be caught as fishing junk in jungle biomes. Alternatively, if you cannot find jungle biomes, you can get bamboo from &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; supply chests.\nThen go to a mountain biome or pillar jump to Y=320 then place one scaffolding on top of the pillar to save materials or place scaffolding until you reach the maximum world height limit.\nWhere Have You Been?\nGoal: Pickup gift from tamed &lt;a href=\"Cat\"&gt;Cat&lt;/a&gt;\nFirst, travel to a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, which you will find stray cats there. Then, tame a cat using raw cod or raw salmon. Wait until a stray cat approaches you. Once tamed, you can see they have a cat collar. Now, sleep in a bed at night. When you sleep, the tamed cat will sleep with you and give you a gift in the morning. Pick up the gift and you get the achievement.\nZoologist.\nGoal: Breed &lt;a href=\"Panda\"&gt;Panda&lt;/a&gt;s\nPandas spawn in any jungle biomes, but are rarer in regular jungles. However, they are not rare in bamboo jungles. Find 2 pandas then make sure there is at least 8 bamboo nearby, or you can plant the bamboo manually. Once the requirement is met, use the bamboo to breed the pandas.\nFruit on the Loom.\nGoal: Use Enchanted Apple on &lt;a href=\"Banner\"&gt;Banner&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind an enchanted apple, add paper to it in a crafting table to craft the thing banner pattern. Then, apply the pattern using a loom by combining the banner and dye.\nPlethora of Cats.\nGoal: Have 20 Tamed Cats\nCats spawn for every 4 beds in a village and the cat population is capped at 10 per village, so you need to travel to several villages to get 20 cats. Villages can be found in:\nBuy Low, Sell High.\nGoal: &lt;a href=\"Trade\"&gt;Trade&lt;/a&gt; for the Best Possible Price.\nOne way to achieve this is to get the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; and from trading with villagers. Another way is to cure a zombie and trade with the new villager.\nDisenchanted.\nGoal: Use a &lt;a href=\"Grindstone\"&gt;Grindstone&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; from an Enchanted Item.\nGrindstones can be found in village weaponsmith buildings, or you can craft one.\nFirst, you need stone, you can obtain it by mining using &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; or smelting cobblestone.\nThen, craft stone slabs in crafting table:\nYou can also use stonecutter to craft stone slab. To craft a stonecutter:\nNow, put stone in stonecutter to get stone slab:\nNext, craft a grindstone.\nLastly, place the grindstone and disenchant your enchanted item using the grindstone by placing the enchanted item in the input slot and take out the output.\nI've got a bad feeling about this.\nGoal: Kill a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;Pillager Captain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 2 ways to find pillager captains, from &lt;a href=\"pillager%20patrol\"&gt;pillager patrol&lt;/a&gt;s or from &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s. Pillager outposts can be found in biomes where villages can generate. Pillager captains can be easily distinguished between other &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s as this pillager will be wearing a &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt; on their head. Kill this mob and you will get achievement, plus the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nWe're being attacked!\nGoal: Walk in a &lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect applied.\nYou can trigger a pillager raid after you get the Bad Omen effect, which obtained after you kill a raid captain. Just enter a village boundary (at least 1 villager with 1 claimed bed) and the raid will start.\nSound the Alarm!\nGoal: Ring the &lt;a href=\"Bell\"&gt;Bell&lt;/a&gt; while being chased by an angered Pillager or hostile mob that attacks villager in the Village.\nBells can be found in a village meeting point. They can be rung using redstone, projectile, or by pressing use on them. If you create your own village, bells are sold by armorer, toolsmith and weaponsmith villagers for 36 emeralds.\nKill the Beast!\nGoal: Defeat a &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt;.\nRavagers spawn during the 3 waves in raids. These mobs have and have high melee damage. It's recommended to defeat these mobs from a distance as blocking with a shield can stun ravagers and cause them to roar, knockbacking and dealing damage to nearby mobs except for other illagers. Since this mob can only use a melee attack, build a 3 block pillar and shoot the ravager using a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; until it dies.\nMaster Trader.\nGoal: Obtain 1,000 &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt;s from trading with &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThis achievement can be easier with &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; effect, as it gives a trading discount, which lowers the price of items needed to trade with emeralds, so you require a fewer amount of items to exchange with emeralds.\nAs long you have huge crop farms, the best trade is crop trades from farmers as it can give you a huge amount of emeralds. Make sure to transform every villager in the village into farmer by placing as many &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; as many villagers in villages, so they can restock their trades.\nYou can sell &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"melon%20slice\"&gt;melon slice&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;s to farmer villagers. Trade with villagers until you get 1000 emeralds or 15 stack of emerald + 40 emeralds.\nIf you craft it into &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20emerald\"&gt;block of emerald&lt;/a&gt;, it's equal to 111 blocks of emeralds with one extra emerald or a full stack of a block of emeralds + 47 blocks of emeralds and one emerald left.\nTime for Stew.\nGoal: Give Someone a &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Stew\"&gt;Suspicious Stew&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo complete this achievement, you must throw a suspicious stew at another player and have them pick it up. Having a fox pick it up does not work.\nBee our guest.\nGoal: Use a &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Campfire&lt;/a&gt; to collect &lt;a href=\"Honey%20Bottle\"&gt;Honey&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Beehive\"&gt;Beehive&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"Glass%20bottle\"&gt;Bottle&lt;/a&gt; without aggravating the &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirst, you need to have a &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; you want to collect a &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt; from. It only gives you the achievement if you collect a honey bottle and not &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;. Next you need to place a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; under the beehive. Note that if you try to harvest any kind of honey from a beehive without placing a campfire underneath it, the &lt;a href=\"bees\"&gt;bees&lt;/a&gt; will get angry. They will come out and sting you, which will hurt you, inflict you with &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and kill the bees in about a minute. You will not get the achievement. Try to place the campfire a few blocks below the hive, otherwise the bees may injure themselves coming out. Remember that campfires will break and only give you &lt;a href=\"Charcoal\"&gt;Charcoal&lt;/a&gt; if you try to pick them up without &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. After you have \"smoked\" the hive like this, use a &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt; on the hive to collect a honey bottle. You should then get the achievement.\nTotal Beelocation.\nGoal: Move and place a &lt;a href=\"Bee%20Nest\"&gt;Bee Nest&lt;/a&gt;, with 3 &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s inside, using &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, you need to make sure you have a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Any tool with the enchantment will work. If you try to collect a bee nest without Silk Touch, then it will break, disappear, and any bees inside and close by will get angry and attack you. Then you need to make sure three bees are inside the hive. If there aren't enough, you can breed bees with any kind of &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;. Once three bees are inside, mine the nest with your Silk Touch tool. You should then get the achievement and can move the nest wherever you like.\nSticky Situation.\nGoal: Slide down a &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt; to slow your fall.\nThis achievement is easiest obtained in 2 ways:\nEither way, it may take several tries.\nBullseye.\nGoal: Hit the bullseye of a Target block\nFirst, craft a target block:\nThen try to hit the center with any projectile.\nOooh, shiny!\nGoal: distract a Piglin with gold\nGo to the Nether and make a piglin aggressive (either by removing any gold armor you're wearing, hitting it or mining gold), then throw any gold related item and wait for the piglin to pick it up.\nCover me in Debris.\nGoal: Wear a full set of Netherite Armor.\nYou need 24 diamonds and 4 &lt;a href=\"netherite%20ingot\"&gt;netherite ingot&lt;/a&gt;s to craft full set of netherite armor.\nFirst, craft a full set of diamond armor.\nDiamond armor can also be obtained from end city chest, bastion remnant chest, bought from armorer villager, or rarely dropped by zombies or skeletons.\nNext, craft 4 netherite ingots. You need 16 gold ingots and 16 &lt;a href=\"netherite%20scrap\"&gt;netherite scrap&lt;/a&gt;s to craft 4 netherite ingots.\nNetherite ingots can also be found in &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt; chests.\nLast, convert from diamond armor to netherite armor.\nHot tourist destination.\nGoal: Visit all Nether biomes.\nVisit these 5 biomes by exploring the nether: basalt deltas, crimson forest, nether wastes, soul sand valley, and warped forest.\nCaves and Cliffs.\nGoal: Free fall from build height limit (Y=320) to bottom of the world (min. Y=-62) and survive.\nThe easiest way to go down to minimum Y=-62 is go down to the deepest spot of a ravine or cave . Then, mine blocks until you reach the Y -62 coordinate.\nTo go up at Y=320, climb up on a tall mountain and place missing blocks to the build height limit or simple place blocks to a build height limit without climbing on anything.\nTo survive the fall, the easiest way is by placing water at the bottom of the world (Y=-62)."}
{"id": "101751", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=101751", "title": "Tutorials/Acquiring a conduit", "text": "This tutorial is meant to show you how to acquire a &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;, which requires a &lt;a href=\"heart%20of%20the%20sea\"&gt;heart of the sea&lt;/a&gt; and eight &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHeart of the sea.\n&lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20sea\"&gt;Heart of the sea&lt;/a&gt; items cannot be farmed. They generate only in &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; chests, which are difficult to find.\nStep 1: Underwater breathing.\nBefore diving down underwater, a player should secure a way to breathe underwater. This can be done with &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"water%20breathing\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, helmets with the &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, and &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA simple but time-consuming way to extend your underwater time is to obtain a helmet with the &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Even one level of Respiration doubles your normal 15-second underwater time to 30 seconds, and each level of Respiration adds another 15 seconds.\nYou can try &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; until you obtain a book with a Respiration enchantment, and use an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; to enchant a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nOr, you can find a zombie &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Drowned%20farming\"&gt;drowned or zombie farm&lt;/a&gt; to get enchanted gold armor in Hard difficulty, which may include a Respiration-enchanted helmet dropped by zombies when they drown or die. If you are playing Bedrock Edition, you can also use this farm to obtain &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s, which are necessary for crafting the conduit.\nStep 2: Treasure maps.\nBuried &lt;a href=\"treasure%20map\"&gt;treasure map&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"underwater%20ruin\"&gt;underwater ruin&lt;/a&gt;s chests. These structures can be found just about everywhere in oceans, and underwater ruins are usually marked with &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;.\nOptionally, the player can feed a nearby &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;, which then leads the player to a structure with treasure.\nIf you are fortunate enough to find a shipwreck in reasonably shallow water (enough for you to dive down, linger for about 5 seconds, and return to the surface), go straight for the map chest. This is located in the lower section of the stern of the ship. You likely have to open a door to get into that section. Open the chest, get the map (not the blank pieces of paper, but the paper with a mark on it), and don't be distracted by anything else. Return to the surface immediately after obtaining the map. If you want to explore the ship, save it for another breath.\nStep 3: Following the map.\nBuried treasure maps are usually blank with a white indicator dot. This shows where the player is in relation to the buried treasure. Remember that upward on the map is north and rightward on the map is east. As the player gets closer to the treasure, the indicator dot increases in size until they start filling in map features. Traveling may involve a long &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; ride. Upon reaching the red \"X\" use a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; to start digging 2\u00d72 or 2\u00d73 around that area to find the treasure chest. A more convenient method is to dig straight down the center of the chunk when at the red \"X\" (chunk coordinate 9,?,9 , 8,?,8 ), because treasure chests always generate in this certain position in a chunk. A buried treasure chest always contains a heart of the sea.\nNautilus shells.\nDepending on your setup, obtaining eight &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s could be tedious.\nMethod 1: Fishing.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; is practical and easy, yielding an occasional nautilus shell as a treasure catch. Fishing this may also yield enchanted fishing rods that improve the catch rate and chance of treasure. The &lt;a href=\"Fishing%23Junk%20and%20treasure\"&gt;odds of receiving a nautilus shell from fishing&lt;/a&gt; with an unenchanted rod are 0.7%, so you have to spend a lot of time fishing.\n\"Always fish in open water\", otherwise you don't catch nautilus shells or other treasure, you just catch fish and junk. Fishing directly under the sky while it's raining decreases waiting time between bites.\nMethod 2: Drowned.\nDrowned have a chance to drop nautilus shells, but ease of obtaining them depends on the Edition.\nMethod 3: Trading.\nAnother way to obtain nautilus shells is via trading with a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;. A wandering trader can spawn anywhere after one in-game day and has a chance of offering a nautilus shell as one of their trades. One nautilus shell costs five &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, so obtaining eight nautilus shells require spending 40 emeralds. Despite costing many emeralds, this method is the fastest way to obtain 8 nautilus shells, provided you have a village available as a source of emeralds for trade. However, because the nautilus shell trade is locked after 5 transactions, the player needs to trade with 2 wandering traders that offer nautilus shells to have enough for a conduit, which may take a long time, as not every wandering trader sells nautilus shells.\nPrismarine.\n&lt;a href=\"Prismarine\"&gt;Prismarine&lt;/a&gt; can be the most difficult ingredient to obtain if the player has not already &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20a%20monument\"&gt;defeated an ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;. Sources of prismarine or its crafting materials come from ocean monuments and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Prismarine and &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s can also be found as part of underwater ruins, but not every ruin generates sea lanterns or prismarine.\nTo get started, the top two layers closest to the ocean surface yield 16 prismarine blocks and 4 sea lanterns. If you're lucky, the top of the ocean monument is close to the sea surface. You need only 16 prismarine blocks to construct a minimal activation frame to create an initial conduit. You can also use 180 blocks of sand to surround the top structure completely, allowing you to mine further down to get 12 more prismarine blocks of the top structure. Another way to get prismarine from an ocean monument is with an &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Affinity\"&gt;Aqua Affinity&lt;/a&gt; enchanted helmet and a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; of water breathing.\nStep 1: Craft a conduit.\nA conduit can be crafted with 8 nautilus shells and heart of the sea. To make it functional, you need a minimum of 16, and up to 42 &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt; blocks. Each ingredient has its own section.\nStep 2: Get temporary underwater breathing.\nIn order to acquire enough prismarine, the player must secure a way to breathe underwater. The best way is to get into an ocean monument and place a conduit strategically to give the player conduit power. The top of an ocean monument is a 4\u00d74 ring of prismarine. A player can mine the supporting prismarine pillars under this ring for four additional prismarine, to expand the top ring to 5\u00d75. Conduit power from a single 5\u00d75 ring of prismarine is sufficient to enclose the entire monument. This can be constructed near the surface, or from a platform constructed around the top of the monument. The &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; effect from the monument's elder guardians greatly lengthens the task of expanding the top ring, so use a good pickaxe.\nOnce you have the 5\u00d75 ring, put the conduit in the middle to activate it. Once it activates, it grants the &lt;a href=\"Conduit%20Power\"&gt;Conduit Power&lt;/a&gt; effect, which allows the player to breathe indefinitely, see better, and mine faster underwater. Then you can breathe underwater inside a radius that covers the entire monument, allowing you to get more prismarine to move your conduit elsewhere later.\nThe player can also secure a temporary way to breathe underwater. This can be done with &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s, non-solid blocks that cannot be waterlogged (such as &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, as well as &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStep 3: Obtain prismarine.\nPrismarine can be obtained from the &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s themselves and from the structure of the monument. The guardians can be a nuisance and the mining fatigue from elder guardians can make mining impossible. For these purposes, it is best to bring building materials that can be broken instantly such as &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Killing guardians is much easier if the player has a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Strider\"&gt;Depth Strider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; are also helpful.\nThe only way to break the monument structure with elder guardians in the way is to detonate &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. To do this effectively, place a gravity block such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; on top of the TNT. When it ignites, it turns into an entity, causing the gravity block to fall inside it. When the TNT explodes, it destroys some of the prismarine and leaves some items. Without the aid of a gravity block, TNT damages mobs without destroying underwater blocks."}

The beauty in exterior design can come from many different elements all interacting together. No matter what architectural style or color scheme you choose, the most important aspect of exterior design is adding details. This means that if you're building a blue colonial style home, you want to make sure to use different shades of blue blended together, maybe with another color as an accent. Try not to make your build look like a box. People may not always agree with your style, but attention to detail is undeniable.\nBasic.\nNote: The player can install a furniture mod to add even more realistic furniture. \"Carpenter's Blocks\" is also a good mod which lets you shape any block however you want.\nFloor.\nUnder certain circumstances, a glass floor can look excellent (for example, as a see-through bridge over a ravine or river, or a room where the ceiling and floor are identical), but in most builds, glass is not the material to use. It's recommended that the floor should not be made out of grass or dirt blocks, as they are better suited to outdoor landscaping. It is better to use a floor made of &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Rock\"&gt;its variants&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;). Smooth stone looks good as tiles, as well as polished granite, diorite, and andesite. &lt;a href=\"Wool\"&gt;Wool&lt;/a&gt; is decorative, but keep it away from fire hazards. Use &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; as a fireproof alternative. &lt;a href=\"Carpet\"&gt;Carpet&lt;/a&gt; is a much better alternative to wool, due to its being cheaper. Also, you can put mycelium under carpet to make the carpet look mystical or sparkly. To add a touch of oldness to your floor, for example, if it is made out of stone bricks, use some regular stone bricks (the more, the less abandoned it looks), some cracked stone bricks, and some cobblestone/gravel as very cracked stone bricks. Variation of blocks in your floor adds detail to it, you can also use the mossy variant of stone bricks/cobblestone. To make the floor look worn down/heavily trampled use stone and/or light gray wool. Sandstone floors can have cracks if a sandstone stair block is placed in an upside down position. For a tiled effect, try &lt;a href=\"dark%20prismarine\"&gt;dark prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, which look good in environments such as kitchens, bathrooms and swimming pools. &lt;a href=\"Terracotta\"&gt;Terracotta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt; blocks can form a satisfying, space age floor. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20blocks\"&gt;Bone blocks&lt;/a&gt; can look good when placed sideways to make a smooth, white, lined floor. &lt;a href=\"Wood\"&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt; or stripped wood floors can also look good.\nWindows.\nIf you are in the beginning of your survival, it's a matter of preference as to whether or not you want to go focus on aesthetics or material conservation. If you choose the latter, then it's recommended \"not\" to use &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; blocks, as you can use &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s to conserve materials. If you either chose the former or are more advanced in your world, you should use glass blocks if it looks better. \nIf windows are at one to two blocks above the ground, it is easy to see out of them. Make large windows that take up a section of wall for a more open feel. If you make 1\u00d72 windows, you can add wood blocks or trapdoors at the ends for shutters.\nIf you want your glass blocks to have a cloudier look, grab eight of them and one &lt;a href=\"white%20dye\"&gt;white dye&lt;/a&gt; and craft some white stained glass. The resulting blocks, if used correctly, can look amazing. Other colors can be used, for example, a muddy effect can be created with a brown stained glass, and blue stained glass blends in almost perfectly with water.\nAgain, depth is crucial to making your buildings stand out, and this also applies to windows. Some examples of depth being used are bay windows, which extrudes the glass out to make a mini room. The circular framed windows are another popular choice, which has an outer frame with the glass placed behind.\nIt is highly recommended to use the circular frame, however, if it doesn't fit your build, an arch will do the same job. Several YouTubers including Grian and MinecraftCinematics have created videos explaining the concept of depth further, they also provide easy tutorials suitable to your theme of choice.\nCeiling.\nIf your ceiling is 2 blocks high, people can't jump. Adjust it so that it measures 3 to 4 blocks high, so your home will have a more spacious feel. Remember that &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; are three blocks tall, so keep your house well lit to prevent them from spawning; note that this will not prevent endermen that have spawned elsewhere from teleporting into your home. Or you could just make a 2.5 tall room by having a slab ceiling. A top slab floor will prevent any mobs from spawning.\nAppearance wise, many would suggest 4-5 blocks high as a small room, so remember that your house should have varied room ceilings. For example, a living room in a medieval house would usually reach to 5-6 blocks high, while dining halls in a medieval castle would reach up 10-12 blocks high, with the rooms reaching a mere 4-5 blocks tall. Your color palette should be used in the roof, as with the rest of your house. This means that for a house made of mainly oak and spruce planks, acacia planks for a ceiling would not fit.\nTo add detail, one example would be to place staircases near columns reaching to the ceiling, in order to smoothen the transition between wall and roof. \nStairs.\nIf you have staircases that use full blocks instead of &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; blocks, it is a good idea to switch them out. It makes it much easier to walk. If you want long stairs, use slabs. For completely vertical transport use a minecart, piston, or water elevator. If you want to use up horizontal space, use slabs and blocks. You could also use a slab/stair/block recurring pattern for slightly longer stairs (1.5 blocks apart to be exact), for more horizontal travel. Also you can use slab/slab/block/block, slab/slab/stairs/block/block and so on to state the stairway's shininess.\nHall.\nMake a hallway if you have multiple rooms. They should be three or four blocks wide for a large house, and two blocks wide for smaller ones. Use carpets for this part to add some color, though wool works as well. It is recommended to also leave a space for a window if you have the space, so it will look brighter.\nExterior.\nInclude a garden of shrubs, flowers, a few trees, and some potted plants. Put one or two leaf blocks on top of wood to make hedges. If your garden is large enough, consider adding a tree house, pool, or even a fountain (see far below) to be the center of attention. Make sure to put stairs and other tile blocks (like stairs and slabs) to make it look even better.\nSafety.\nWhen building a settlement or construction, you want a safe, useful, and reliable building. You don't want your finely decorated home, filled with diamond, plants, fountain, etc. to explode down to the ground or go down in flames. Here are a few safety precautions:\nOthers.\nKeep lots of open spaces and do not use too many doors, so your house will look more than \"Designer\". Light rooms up with redstone lamps or &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s and glowstone instead of torches to improve lighting, or add chandeliers for a classier look. Also you can put &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s or item frames on the walls that look empty.\nYou can \"hang up\" a torch by placing a torch on a block, then an item frame on the same block, before finishing it up by placing a stone button, stone slab, or an anvil inside the item frame. Note that this will not work due to the fact that item frames are not entities in that version. You can also keep &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dog\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;s in the building.\nRooms.\nKitchen.\nInclude tables. These can be made either by making an extended piston upwards, by placing a carpet/pressure plate on a fence/wall, or using upside-down stairs and slabs. The piston and slab methods allow you to place decorations on the table.\nDon't forget a sink. It can be built using a filled cauldron or a hopper directed at the wall, with a down lever or tripwire hook at the top to simulate your taps. You could also place a dropper filled with water bottles behind the block bearing the lever (faucet), which when \"turned on\" will pour out free water.\nFor a cooking range you could use a &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt; topped by iron pressure plates or detector rails, and put some stairs a few blocks above to simulate a range hood. \nAdd a crafting table as a worktop, and droppers with item frames containing rotated snow layers as cabinets that hold bowls and bottles.\nYou could also add an island in the middle of the room, iron bars to simulate an area to hang pans, and a table that contains normal &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; and chocolate cake simulated by &lt;a href=\"daylight%20detector\"&gt;daylight detector&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlthough expensive, hanging a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; from the ceiling makes for elegant lighting.\nLiving room.\nInclude chairs and couches, and something decorative or something to do. You can also add a fireplace, but beware of fire! You can make fireplaces out of any material, but it is recommended to use stone or brick. You can also use a campfire to remove the risk, and add decorative appeal. Add a few chests and put some trapdoors on their faces, and you have a cabinet. You can also hide chests under chests here.\nBedroom(s).\nInclude a bed, paintings, a jukebox, and a dresser made by stacking chests behind doors.\nOptionally, you may wish to include an ender chest to keep safe any valuables and easily transport materials in bulk. However, it may not be recommended due to the cost of the components used in construction. A bedside table is also great decoration (see \"furniture\" for table construction).\nBathroom.\nUse dark prismarine for the floor, as it resembles small bathroom tiles. For bigger tiles, quartz does no harm. Glazed terracotta blocks can also help with tiling.\nAdd fences/ladders or end rods as a towel rack. Iron bars could also do good as a small radiator.\nTo build a toilet, put two upside down quartz stairs that are facing away from each other. On one side put a normal quartz block with a lever on top, and put an iron trapdoor on it so it lies on top of the other upside down stair.\nSome Designs.\nFurniture.\nChair\nNote that you can make a couch by adding more stairs. Chairs can also be made using a slab of preferably oak for the bottom, armrests made of trapdoors and a door for the back to give your chairs that extra-classy feel.\nTable\n&lt;br&gt;\nA village-style table can be made from a pressure plate atop a fence post. Carpets can be used the same way, and look better. Connecting more than one table when using carpets will look better also. Oftentimes, a simple slab floating at waist-height can suffice, sometimes fitting in with 'alternative style homes'. Another way of making larger tables with only four legs is to use carpets, fence posts and string, as carpets can be placed on string.\nAppliances.\nSink\n \nOven\nReplace the furnace with a dispenser for a washing machine, clothing dryer or dishwasher.\nFridge\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWater cooler\n&lt;br&gt;\nFish Tank\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPlace the stairs upside down, and facing out the way the ice is. The player can also build an \"actual\" fish tank with using glass (not panes, as water will flow through them) and &lt;a href=\"fish%20bucket\"&gt;fish bucket&lt;/a&gt;s. First, build a box out of glass, and then fill it with the fish buckets and buckets of water. It is possible to add some &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s for decoration, or even &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt;s if the tank is large enough. A larger tank can be used to hold &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; and, if it has an open top, &lt;a href=\"dolphins\"&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, but will be quite hard to create in survival. A tank holding &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s is also possible, but should be only done in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;, as guardians are extremely hostile towards players. Squid should never be held in the same tank as guardians, as guardians will attack them, eventually resulting in the squid's death. &lt;a href=\"Silverfish\"&gt;Silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, despite their name, are \"not\" fish, and will drown if placed in a fish tank.\nLarge building decorations.\nTo give beauty to your builds, you could build on of these builds down below.\nStatue.\nSide view (Cross section)\nFountain\nSide view (Cross section)\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTop view \n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nArchitectural styles.\nAnother easy way to make a building or group of buildings look nice is to build them according to real-world styles. The style will determine the shape of your building, the material, and possibly the location as well.\nMedieval.\nOne of the most used architectural styles in \"Minecraft\", comes from Europe and Britain in the period between 476 and 1500. The \"Medieval\" period of European history is roughly the time between the fall of the Roman Empire, and the appearance of modern-style nations. The used materials are usually wood and stone, but stained glass and roofs with varying colors (prismarine, amethyst, and colored concrete can work well) can add a more fantastic touch.\nColonial.\nThese types of houses were first built during American Colonial times (1600-1700 roughly) using either brick or wood, depending on what was plentiful in the area. Massachusetts has a lot of good clay, so brick is popular. Farther north you might see more wooden constructions. Real-life wooden houses can be made just about any color with paint (in-game can be a little trickier), although red, white, yellow, and blue are common. The house type is fairly simple, as it is a rectangular prism with a few windows and add-ons basically. These could look good in a player-made town in a forest biome.\nVictorian.\nThis style came over from England with the influx of European settlers used between 1840 and about 1900. The mainstay of the time period, most buildings were made out of mass-produced brick and looked very similar. A good example of Victorian Architecture is the row houses outside many British cites during the industrial revolution. This type of architecture was very bland looking with very symmetrical design. This style looks good on flat terrain and built around large brick factories.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.thespruce.com/what-is-brutalism-4796578\"&gt;Brutalism&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis build style, starting in 1950s England and spreading over the next two or three decades usually involves visually heavy edifices with geometric lines, solid concrete frames (indeed, a lot of exposed concrete in general), exaggerated slabs, double height ceilings, massive forbidding walls, and a predominantly monochrome palette, brutalist buildings prioritized function over form, and stripped-back minimalism over flashy design. In Minecraft, most building materials consist of concrete or stone as well as iron, glass, or wooden blocks. Brutalism tends to produce either iconic builds or eyesore builds.\nModern.\nThis contemporary style is based largely on the availability of more modern building materials such as pre-stressed concrete and other composites. It can feature many different colors, layouts, and building materials, but the materials allow for more open spaces and larger windows. Normally, houses are made up of rectangles all fitted together with many windows present. Try quartz or glass.\nFuturistic.\nThis style, inspired by the ambitions of late-20th century science fiction, includes sleek-looking, space age buildings, and often includes spacecraft. In the real world, buildings can be more fanciful, with structures that seem impractical (and often \"would\" have been, with older materials). In-game, large expanses of &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; blocks are often used, with &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt; as other main materials. This style usually has a lighter color scheme. Especially appropriate for The End, where it can be used for making space stations."}

{"id": "4705", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4705", "title": "Tutorials/Advanced redstone circuits", "text": "Advanced redstone circuits encompass &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mechanisms\"&gt;mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; that require complicated &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt;ry. They are usually composed of many simpler components, such as logic gates. For simpler mechanisms, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mechanisms%23Electronic%20Mechanisms\"&gt;electronic mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Traps%23Wired%20Traps\"&gt;wired traps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nComputers.\nIn \"Minecraft\", several in-game systems can usefully perform information processing. These systems include &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;. Of all these systems, only redstone was specifically added for its ability to manipulate information, in the form of redstone signals. \nRedstone, like electricity, has high reliability and high switching-speeds, which has seen it overtake the other mechanical systems as the high-tech of \"Minecraft\", just as electricity overtook the various mechanics such as pneumatics to become the high-tech of our world.\nIn both modern digital electronics and redstone engineering, the construction of complex information processing elements is simplified using multiple layers of abstraction.\nThe first layer is that of atomic components; redstone/&lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es/&lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s/blocks, pistons, &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s are all capable of affecting redstone signals. \nThe second layer is binary logic gates; these are composite devices, possessing a very limited internal state and usually operating on between one and three bits.\nThe third layer is high-level components, made by combining logic gates. These devices operate on patterns of bits, often abstracting them into a more humanly comprehensible encoding like natural numbers. Such devices include mathematical adders, combination locks, memory-registers, etc.\nIn the fourth and final layer, a key set of components are combined to create functional computer systems which can process any arbitrary data, often without user oversight.\nConverters.\nThese circuits simply convert inputs of a given format to another format. Converters include Binary to BCD, Binary to Octal, Binary to Hex, BCD to 7-Segment, etc.\nPiston mask demultiplexer.\nYou can understand this design as a combination of AND gates. \nDemultiplexer is a circuit that uses the following logic:\nOutput 0 = (~bit2) &amp; (~bit1) &amp; (~bit0)\nOutput 1 = (~bit2) &amp; (~bit1) &amp; (bit0)\nThe most obvious way to implement a demultiplexer would be to put a whole bunch of logic gates and connect them together, but even with 3 or 4 bits it turns into a mess.\nIf you look at the binary numbers table, you can notice a pattern.\nIf the number of bits is Q, the most significant bit reverses every Q/2 numbers, the next bit reverses every Q/4 numbers an so on until we get to the Qth bit.\nTherefore, we should make a circuit that looks like this:\nWhere the green triangles are non-reversing and red triangles are reversing. The black lines are imaginary AND gates.\nWe can easily implement this using 3 \"punch cards\" that consist of solid blocks and air. The \"punch cards\" or the masks are being moved by pistons with slime blocks. \nSo the signal is only being propagated if all three layers of masks align in a specific way.\n Open the picture to see the layers.\nAs you can see, this system is very compact and comprehensible.\nYou can use this in reverse as well (not as a multiplexer, but if you reverse the repeaters the signal from every ex-outptut (0\u20137) will only propagate if it matches the current state of the demultiplexer, so it works like \"Output3 = (Input3) AND (Demux=011)\").\nBinary to 1-of-8.\nA series of gates that converts a 3-bit binary input to a single active line out of many. They are useful in many ways as they are compact, 5\u00d75\u00d73 at the largest.\nAs there are many lines combined using &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Logic%20circuit%23OR%20Gate\"&gt;implicit-OR&lt;/a&gt;s, you have to place diodes before each input into a circuit to keep signals from feeding back into other inputs.\nRequirements for each output line (excluding separating diodes):\nBinary to 1-of-16 or 1-of-10.\nA series of gates that converts a 4-bit binary input to a single active line out of many (e.g. 0-9 if the input is decimal or 0-F if the input is hexadecimal). They are useful in many ways as they are compact, 3\u00d75\u00d72 at the largest.\nAs there are many lines combined using &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Logic%20circuit%23OR%20Gate\"&gt;implicit-OR&lt;/a&gt;s, you have to place diodes before each input into a circuit to keep signals from feeding back into other inputs.\nRequirements for each output line (excluding separating diodes):\n1-of-16 to Binary.\nYou also can convert a 1-of-16 signal to a 4-bit binary number. You only need 4 OR gates, with 8 inputs each. These have to be isolating ORs to prevent signals from feeding back into other inputs.\nFor every output line, make an OR gate with the inputs wired to the input lines where there is a '1' in the table below.\nExample.\nThe example on the right uses ORs (&gt;=1), &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit%23XNOR%20Gate\"&gt;XNORs&lt;/a&gt; (=), &lt;a href=\"Memory%20circuit%23RS%20NOR%20Latches\"&gt;RS NOR latches&lt;/a&gt; (SR) and some &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Repeater\"&gt;delay&lt;/a&gt;s (dt*). For the XNORs I would prefer the C-design.\nThe example on the right uses a 4-bit design, so you can handle a hexadecimal key. So you can use 15 various digits, [1,F] or [0,E]. You only can use 15, because the state (0)16 = (0000)2 won't activate the system. If you want to handle 16 states, you edit the logic, to interact for a 5-bit input, where the 5th bit represents the (0)16 state.\nIn the following we'll use (0)16 = (1111)2. And for [1,9] the MUX-table upon. So the key uses decimal digits. Therefore, we have to mux the used buttons to binary data. Here look through the first two columns. The first represents the input-digit in (hexa)decimal, the second represents the input-digit in binary code. Here you can add also buttons for [A,E], but I disclaimed them preferring a better arranging. The /b1\\-box outputs the first bit, the /b2\\-box the second, and so on.\nNow you see Key[i] with i=1..3, here you set the key you want to use. The first output of them is the 1-bit, the second the 2-bit and so on. You can set your key here with levers in binary-encryption. Use here the MUX-table upon, and for (0)h := (1111)2. If we enter the first digit, we have to compare the bits by pairs (b1=b1, b2=b2, b3=b3, b4=b4). If every comparison is correct, we set the state, that the first digit is correct.\nTherefore, we combine (((b1=b1 &amp; b2=b2) &amp; b3=b3) &amp; b4=b4) =: (b*=b*). In \"Minecraft\" we have to use four ANDs like the left handside. Now we save the status to the RS-latch /A\\. The comparison works the same way for Key[2], and Key[3].\nNow we have to make sure, that the state will be erased, if the following digit is wrong. Therefore, we handle a key-press-event (--/\"b1 OR b2 OR b3 OR b4\"\\--/\"dt-\"\\--/\"dt-\"\\--). Search the diagram for the three blocks near \"dt-\". Here we look, if any key is pressed, and we forward the event with a minor delay. For resetting /A\\, if the second digit is wrong, we combine (key pressed) &amp; (not B). It means: any key is pressed and the second digit of the key is entered false. Therewith /A\\ will be not reset, if we enter the first digit, /A\\ only should be reset, if /A\\ is already active.\nSo we combine (B* &amp; A) =: (AB*). /AB*\\ now resets the memory-cell /A\\, if the second digit is entered false and the first key has been already entered. The major delay /dt+\\ must be used, because /A\\ resets itself, if we press the digit-button too long. To prevent this failure for a little bit, we use the delay /dt+\\. The OR after /AB*\\ is used, for manually resetting, i.e. by a pressure plate.\nNow we copy the whole reset-circuit for Key[2]. The only changes are, that the manually reset comes from (not A) and the auto-reset (wrong digit after), comes from (C). The manual reset from A prevents B to be activated, if the first digit is not entered. So this line makes sure, that our key is order-sensitive.\nThe question is, why we use the minor-delay-blocks /dt-\\. Visualize /A\\ is on. Now we enter a correct second digit. So B will be on, and (not B) is off. But while (not B) is still on, the key-pressed-event is working yet, so A will be reset, but it shouldn't. With the /dt-\\-blocks, we give /B\\ the chance to act, before key-pressed-event is activated.\nFor /C\\ the reset-event is only the manual-reset-line, from B. So it is prevented to be activated, before /B\\ is true. And it will be deactivated, when a pressure-plate resets /A\\ and /B\\.\nNot really a con: in this circuit the following happens with maybe the code 311: 3 pressed, A activated; 1 pressed, B activated, C activated. To prevent this, only set a delay with a repeater between (not A) and (reset B). So the following won't be activated with the actual digit.\nIf you fix this, the circuit will have the following skill, depending on key-length. ( digit = 2n-1, possibilities: digitLength )\nMiscellaneous.\nSorting device.\nThis is a device which sorts the inputs, putting 1s at the bottom and 0s at the top, in effect counting how many 1s and how many 0s there are.\nIt is designed so that it is easily expandable, as shown in the diagram. The 5\u00d75 center square is tileable. The inputs are at the bottom and right and the outputs are at the top and left\nTruth table for a three-bit sorting device:\nTimer.\nTimers can detect the time difference between the first input and the second.\nThe amount of time can be determined by how far the signal travels. For example, if 5 of the locked repeaters are powered, it means the time difference was 0.4-0.5 seconds, ignoring lag. If the time difference is exactly 0.4 seconds, 4 repeaters will be powered.\nThe repeaters that will lock can be set to different delays. For example, if they are set to 4 ticks and the first 3 are active, it means the time difference was 0.8-1.2 seconds. You can even have a mix, which can be handy if you know what the range is likely to be. However, you will need to be careful when reading these timers.\nIf you are measuring higher scales, the second signal might not reach all of the repeaters. You will need repeaters to replenish the signal.\nIf the signals are short times (like if you are using &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s), you may not have time to read the data. \nYou can also measure how long a signal lasts.\nPlease note the following when making a duration timer:\nSerial interface lock with D flip-flops.\nD flip-flop is an electronic component that allows you to change its output according to the clock. It's and RS NOR latch that sets its value to the D input when the \"&gt;\" (clock) input is changing its state from low to high (in some cases from high to low). \nBasically, it's equivalent to the expression: \"Set the output Q to the input D when the input C goes from 0 to 1\".\nFor example, you can use D flip-flops to shift the value from left to right.\nIn this lock, the &gt; signal propagates from the rightmost flip-flop to the leftmost, so the signal shifts to the right. This circuit allows you to input a 4-bit number with two levers. You can use any number of bits, but this configuration is already pretty secure even if someone figures out what a lock it is.\nSo, if you want to input the combination 1-0-1-0, follow these steps:\nIn theory, you can program the lock from this serial interface as well. Just attach 4 RS NOR latches and a hidden place for the programming levers.\nThis design is not very practical as a lock, but might be a nice feature on something like a puzzle challenge map."}

Three advancement guides are in need of cleanup. For more information about advancements in general, see the &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt; page. For a guide on 's &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s, see the page &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Achievement%20guide\"&gt;Tutorials/Achievement guide&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasics.\nAdvancements are basically tasks to complete that will help guide you in advancing further into the game. Some of the more advanced advancements will also give you experience as a reward. Advancements are organized into five categories: Minecraft, Nether, The End, Adventure, and Husbandry.\nEven though many advancements have parents and are parents of other advancements, it does not matter which order you complete the advancements; the parents of advancements are just a guide of the easiest order to work through the advancements. For example, the advancement \"Husbandry\" is the parent of \"The Parrots and the Bats\", but this does not mean that \"Husbandry\" must be completed before \"The Parrots and the Bats\". Each advancement is independent of one another, despite them having parents. For more information, see the &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt; page.\nMinecraft.\nMinecraft.\nThe heart and story of the game\nRequirements: Have a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; in your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nGet a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory to get this advancement. This one is easy, but requires some prerequisites. First, just hold down the on a &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; until it breaks, then collect the dropped block by walking over it.\nLogs are found on &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, which are very easy to find (as long as you didn't start out in an &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; or desert &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;). Just look around when you spawn.\nUse the log you just got from the tree and open your . You will see a &lt;a href=\"2%C3%972%20grid\"&gt;2\u00d72 grid&lt;/a&gt; near the top right-hand corner; place your wood log in any of those grids. Then, click on the &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; that appear to obtain them.\nIf you turned on a &lt;a href=\"bonus%20chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt; when you created your world, there is a good chance that it will contain logs, planks, or both. If you have these, you probably won't need to get any wood to create a crafting table.\nFinally, put one of the four planks you got into each container of your grid (a 2\u00d72 square of planks). You can to place a single plank into the grid, instead of all four.\nOnce you have the crafting table in your inventory, you will get the advancement.\nParent of: Stone Age\nStone Age.\nMine stone with your new pickaxe\nRequirements: Have &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobbled%20deepslate\"&gt;cobbled deepslate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nFirst, place your crafting table on the ground by holding the crafting table in your hand and the ground. Follow the crafting recipe below to make &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s (note that this can also be done in your inventory crafting grid):\nNow arrange your sticks and some planks in the crafting table to make a wooden &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;:\nNote that you may need to get more wood in order to have enough to make a wooden pickaxe.\nTo get the advancement, you must find &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; (which is easy, you don't need to find a cave for this), and mine it with your wooden pickaxe to get &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; (stone will become cobblestone if you mine it without a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe). Exposed stone can be found on the sides of hills and in ravines/caves. If you find a cave or ravine, do not go deep into it, because you will encounter mobs (such as zombies and skeletons). \nIf you are in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or below Y = 8, you can also mine &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobbled%20deepslate\"&gt;cobbled deepslate&lt;/a&gt; to get this advancement although the chances of you getting to the Nether or finding a &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt; blob without picking up any cobblestone are very slim. Blackstone is located in the &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt; biome. You may also find blackstone in other biomes near the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20features%23Lava%20sea\"&gt;lava ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nParent of: Getting an Upgrade\nGetting an Upgrade.\nConstruct a better pickaxe\nRequirements: Have a stone &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nYou need to make a stone &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; to get this advancement. Using your wooden pickaxe, mine three &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; blocks so you have three &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; blocks. If you are deep underground, you can also mine &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt; which turns into &lt;a href=\"cobbled%20deepslate\"&gt;cobbled deepslate&lt;/a&gt;, which is suitable for crafting.\nIf you are in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, you can also make a stone pickaxe using &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt;. Blackstone is located in the &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt; biome. You may also find blackstone in other biomes near the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20features%23Lava%20sea\"&gt;lava ocean&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow arrange your sticks and cobblestone/blackstone /deepslate blocks in the crafting table to make a stone pickaxe:\nStone pickaxe also spawn in &lt;a href=\"bonus%20chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt;, bought by novice-level toolsmith &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, or by toolsmith &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; gifts.\nParent of: Acquire Hardware\nAcquire Hardware.\nSmelt an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;\nRequirements: Have an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nThe intended method for attaining this advancement is to find &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;. Iron ore is found at almost any &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;height&lt;/a&gt; in the world, but is most common at altitudes 15 to 232. It does not generate at all between layers 73 to 79, so you shouldn't look there for it. The two main ways to find iron ore are to find it in a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;, or to find it in an exposed stone surface either on the ground or in the side of a &lt;a href=\"Mountains\"&gt;hill/mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Because caves often have &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; in them, they are not recommended to go into until you have some &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, so finding an exposed surface in the ground with iron in it is much safer. If you find iron in the side of a hill, you may need to place blocks to make a tower or staircase up to it, especially if the hill is very high. If there are no caves or exposed stone surfaces near you, you could start a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;. If you are feeling very daring and adventurous, make a stone &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and go ahead and search a cave. Torches can be made once you find &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, which is spawn very common in level 0 to 320 in the Overworld. You can also &lt;a href=\"smelt\"&gt;smelt&lt;/a&gt; the log to make &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, which can turn into torches. The way turn make furnace and smelt will be below. The torch recipe will be below. You can usually find iron in caves very quickly, because the walls of the caves will expose a lot of blocks.\nIf you are lucky, you can find iron ingots in &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; blacksmiths, armorer's house, toolsmith's house; &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20nugget\"&gt;Iron nugget&lt;/a&gt;s can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; taiga houses, which if you have 9 iron nuggets could be turn into 1 iron ingot.\n&lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; can also generate &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20iron\"&gt;block of iron&lt;/a&gt;, which can turn into 9 iron ingot.\nOnce you find iron ore, mine it with your stone &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; (don't mine it with a wooden pickaxe since it won't drop anything). It will drop &lt;a href=\"raw%20iron\"&gt;raw iron&lt;/a&gt; (unless you mined it with the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, in which case it will drop an iron ore). &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20raw%20iron\"&gt;Block of raw iron&lt;/a&gt; can also generate in &lt;a href=\"ore%20vein\"&gt;ore vein&lt;/a&gt;, which can turn into 9 &lt;a href=\"raw%20iron\"&gt;raw iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen make a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cobbled%20deepslate\"&gt;cobbled deepslate&lt;/a&gt; and put the raw iron or &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; in it along with a fuel source, such as &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;. After 10 seconds, it yields an iron ingot.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt; can spawn in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;; which when kill drops 3-5 iron ingot. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; also have a chance to drops 1 iron ingot. Iron nugget also can be obtain by &lt;a href=\"smelt\"&gt;smelt&lt;/a&gt; an iron &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse%20armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"chainmail%20armor\"&gt;chainmail armor&lt;/a&gt;; and by &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;. The way to get &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt; will be below.\nYou will get the advancement once you transfer the iron ingot from the furnace to your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Iron ingots can further be made into many useful tools, weapons, and armor.\nParent of: Suit Up | Hot Stuff | Isn't It Iron Pick\nSuit Up.\nProtect yourself with a piece of iron armor\nRequirements: Have any type of iron &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nYou need to collect at least four iron ingots.\nArrange the iron ingots in the crafting table to make at least one piece of the following armor:\nIron armors can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; armorer's house, and blacksmith; &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient city&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt;; in &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt; in taiga &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; outdoor armory; by having a small chance to drop when killing &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;; can be bought from armorer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, or by &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou will get the advancement when you put one of the pieces of armor in your inventory.\nParent of: Not Today, Thank You\nHot Stuff.\nFill a bucket with lava\nRequirements: Have a lava &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nGather 3 iron ingots, and arrange them in the crafting table to make a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;:\nBucket can also be found in chests in savanna &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; houses, &lt;a href=\"monster%20room\"&gt;monster room&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Water%20bucket\"&gt;Water bucket&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in village fisherman's houses. &lt;a href=\"Bucket%20of%20aquatic%20mob\"&gt;Bucket of aquatic mob&lt;/a&gt; can also bought from novice-level fisherman &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s and from &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNow, all you have to do is find &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and your bucket to fill it up. &lt;a href=\"Lava%20lake\"&gt;Lava lake&lt;/a&gt;s can be found rarely on the surface in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes underground above Y=0. They often light the surrounding grass and trees on fire, which makes them easy to spot from a distance, especially at night. However, lava is most common at Y=-55 and below, where it fills all of the caves in place of air. If you are in the Nether, getting lava can be very easy because it is found in the &lt;a href=\"lava%20sea\"&gt;lava sea&lt;/a&gt; there. If you are high up in the Nether, getting down to the lava ocean could be quite difficult though. Lava can also generate as a &lt;a href=\"spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; block in both Overworld and the Nether, or spawn in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith, &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"delta\"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotice that you have to use the bucket on the source of lava. Normally, if the lava you see is not flowing, you can use the bucket anywhere, because every block of lava is a source block. But if you see a stream of flowing lava, you have to trace the lava flow to its source, and use the bucket on it.\nParent of: Ice Bucket Challenge\nIsn't It Iron Pick.\nUpgrade your pickaxe\nRequirements: Have an iron &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nThis advancement can be achieved by making an iron pickaxe, which requires 3 iron ingots.\nArrange the iron ingots and 2 sticks in the crafting table to make the iron pickaxe:\nIron pickaxe can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith, and toolsmith's chest; and &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt;; or &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; from journeyman-level toolsmith &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nParent of: Diamonds!\nNot Today, Thank You.\nDeflect a projectile with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;\nRequirements: Block an incoming &lt;a href=\"projectile\"&gt;projectile&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, you need to craft a shield:\nThen you need to find a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to help you, or anything else that fires projectiles. Holding the shield in either hand, hold , and let the projectile shoot toward you. The shield should block it (except if an arrow was shot from a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt;), therefore rewarding you the advancement.\nIce Bucket Challenge.\nObtain a block of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;\nRequirements: Have an &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; block in your inventory.\nUse three diamonds to make a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20pickaxe\"&gt;diamond pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;:\nDiamond pickaxe can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou also need a bucket of water: find a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source and it with your &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext, you need to go down to the bottom of a cave, at below Y-level 11. Find a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; lake (you cannot use flowing lava, or else it will become &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;) or any &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;s that have lava, and pour the bucket of water next to the lava. An alternative method is to find a flat &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and search for a lava lake there, and do the same thing. The water should flow onto the lava, turning it into obsidian. If you find naturally occurring obsidian, that works as well. Mine the &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; with your diamond pickaxe, and pick it up. Note: This doesn't work in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, since &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; vaporizes in the Nether.\nObsidian can also in the chest in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith, &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;; as a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"end%20spike\"&gt;end spike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;obsidian platform&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"end%20ship\"&gt;end ship&lt;/a&gt;; and by &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\nParent of: We Need to Go Deeper\nDiamonds!\nAcquire &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s\nRequirements: Have a &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nGet a diamond in your inventory to get this advancement. \nFirst of all, you must find &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt;. Diamond ores are very rare, but by either &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining\"&gt;branch mining&lt;/a&gt; deep down in the world or exploring &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s that go very low, you will eventually find one. Diamond ore generate below level 15, most commonly between level -50 and -64. Mine it with your iron pickaxe, and collect the dropped &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiamonds can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith, toolsmith's house; &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20diamond\"&gt;Block of diamond&lt;/a&gt; can also generate in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;, which can be turn into 9 diamonds.\nParent of: Cover Me With Diamonds | Enchanter\nWe Need to Go Deeper.\nBuild, light, and enter a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Portal\"&gt;Nether Portal&lt;/a&gt;\nRequirements: Enter &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; dimension.\nFirst of all, you will need to build a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;, or find a &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt; and fix it. To make a portal, you need at least 10 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Make your portal using the obsidian like so (build it upright, or else it will not work): \nBudget version\nAlternatively, you could build it like this, but it uses more obsidian:\nFull version\nIf you find a ruined portal, you wouldn't need to build an entire portal on your own, but you do need to fix it up to be complete. Depending on how broken (and large) the ruined portal is, it might be easier to fix it than to make your own, but it could also be a lot harder, making it not worth to try fixing. To fix a ruined portal, you need to mine any &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt; in the portal (except for the corners because these don't count) with a diamond pickaxe, then complete the portal by placing regular obsidian in the gaps. There is a chest near the portal that may contain some obsidian to help you with this, but it's likely that you will have to get some on your own anyway. The chest also may contain a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, which is very useful because this will light the portal, even if you can't fix the ruined portal and decide to make your own.\nNow you need a way to light the portal to activate it. This could be a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have either of these, you need to get an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt; and a piece of &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; and place these anywhere in your 2\u00d72 crafting grid to make a flint and steel.\nFlint can be obtain by breaking &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, or generate in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; fletcher's house, and &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;. Light your portal by using the flint and steel or fire charge on the top surface of one of the bottom blocks. You can also light the nether portal using &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; next to flammable blocks, or &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. If the portal doesn't light up, make sure that it is complete and the correct size, does not contain any crying obsidian (only regular obsidian), and does not have blocks inside the frame, then try again. Your portal will now look like this:\nOr like this:\nOnce you stand inside the portal for a few seconds, you will be teleported to the Nether and you will get the advancement. If you are not prepared to go into the Nether, go back to the Overworld the moment you set foot in the Nether. To return, step out of the portal and step back in again.\nParent of: Zombie Doctor | Eye Spy\nCover Me With Diamonds.\nDiamond armor saves lives\nRequirements: Have any type of diamond armor in your inventory.\nCraft any piece of diamond armor.

Paper can be obtain by crafting from 3 &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;.\nSugar cane can generate naturally near &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Paper can also generate in village cartographer's house, &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;, and stronghold library. When you have enough materials, you can make a book.\nA &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; 3 books without using &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. Bookshelves generate as a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; in village library houses, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; libraries. Book can also be obtain by disenchanting an &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;. And finally, book can generate in village plains and desert house, shipwreck, stronghold library, and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient city&lt;/a&gt;. Now when you have a book, you make an enchanting table.\nTo enchant, you will need a &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, or a piece of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. You will also need between 1 and 3 &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be found in &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli%20Ore\"&gt;ore form&lt;/a&gt; between levels -64 and 64, being much more common in underwater caves than in dry caves. Lapis can also be found in item form in desert village temples, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, and shipwrecks. A &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;block of lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; can generate in a &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;, which can be turned into 9 &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlso, make sure you have plenty of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; levels, as you will need them to enchant an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nZombie Doctor.\nWeaken and then cure a Zombie Villager\nRequirements: Turn a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrow a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;splash potion of Weakness&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; and give it a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; (by facing the zombie and pressing the key with a golden apple in your hand). Then, wait a few minutes. Don't let the zombie burn in the daylight.

Glass also generate in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient city&lt;/a&gt;. You need to have Silk Touch to obtain glass otherwise, it drops nothing.\nWater bottles can also obtain by &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following steps are performed in the brewing stand.\nTo turn a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;potion of Weakness&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;splash potion of Weakness&lt;/a&gt;.

So now, back to the brewing section:\nFor more information about brewing, see the pages \"&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Brewing\"&gt;Brewing&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSplash Potion of Weakness also generate in brewing stand in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es also throw splash potion of weakness if somehow you can't go to the Nether or don't spawn near the &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, zombie villager also spawn in igloo.\nAlternatively, you can shoot the zombie villager with an &lt;a href=\"Arrow%23Tipped%20arrows\"&gt;arrow of Weakness&lt;/a&gt;. It can be crafted by 8 arrow and 1 Lingering Potion of Weakness (the way to obtain arrow and dragon's breath will be below), but it's hard to obtain &lt;a href=\"dragon%27s%20breath\"&gt;dragon's breath&lt;/a&gt;.

Strongholds can be found by using &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;. Eye of ender can be craft using 1 &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; and 1 &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt;. Ender pearl can be obtain by killing &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with expert-level cleric &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, or can be found in \"fake end portal\" room of &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. A very feasible way to obtain ender pearls in early game is to find a biome in the Nether, and kill as many endermen there as possible. Blaze powder is crafted from &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s, which only drop from blazes; this means you will have to find a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; and kill a few blazes to obtain their rods.\nAlthough the player usually needs 10-12 eyes of ender to activate the end portal, much less are needed to find a stronghold. Usually, 4 eyes of ender is a good amount to start, given that the player doesn't throw the eyes too often and lose all of them before reaching the strnghold. \n to throw eyes of ender up in the air and following which direction they go. When you throw them and they go into the ground, dig where they went underground, until you reach &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, which is the stronghold.\nFor more tips on finding the stronghold, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20the%20ender%20dragon%23Stronghold\"&gt;this part of the tutorial on defeating the ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nParent of: The End?\nThe End?\nEnter the End portal.\nRequirements: Enter &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; dimension.\nJump into an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal room&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s. You may need to fill the eye into the end portal to go to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, which mean you need a maximum of 12 &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt; to go to the End. Ender pearl also spawn in stronghold &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, which can turn into eye of ender and can fill the end portal. When you go to the End, you will get the advancement before the actual terrain loads. Once the End's terrain loads, you will get \"The End\" advancement (the difference is the question mark). Make sure you come prepared before going to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, because the only way out is to either defeat the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, or die in the attempt. In &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, to beat the ender dragon, you must not die otherwise you cannot respawn.\nNether.\nNether.\nBring Summer Clothes\nRequirements: Enter &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; dimension.\nTo get this advancement, you will need to enter &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; dimension.

Other fireballs do not work.\nKill a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; using its own fireball to get this advancement. When a ghast shoots a fireball at you, wait until it comes towards you, and then the fireball to send it flying back to the ghast and kill it. The reflected fireball will roughly go in the direction the player's crosshair is pointing in, so the player can aim at the position where the ghast is about to fly to.\nTo reflect the fireball without endangering themselves too much, the player should face the fireball, stand slightly to the side, and start spam-clicking the attack button as the fireball comes close. The fireball can be attacked slightly outside its hitbox, so even if the player fails to hit the fireball, it flies past the player without hitting them. The spam-clicking is beneficial because the time window to hit the fireball is very short, and that the fireball can be reflected regardless of &lt;a href=\"attack%20cooldown\"&gt;attack cooldown&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe above method is, however, very dangerous for unskilled players. A safer method is to shoot a projectile, such as an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;, at the fireball.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 50 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nParent of: Uneasy Alliance\nThose Were the Days.\nEnter a Bastion Remnant\nRequirements: Go inside a &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get this advancement, the player needs to enter a &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;.

This essentially means that for every one block you travel in the Nether, you travel eight blocks in the Overworld. This also means that you must travel at least 875 blocks in the Nether in order to travel 7000 blocks in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 100 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Terrible Fortress.\nBreak your way into a Nether Fortress\nRequirements: Enter a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnter a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; to get this advancement.

A warped fungus on a stick can be crafted using the recipes below. A saddle can be found in loot chests, from &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, or it can be obtained by &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with master-level &lt;a href=\"Trading%23Leatherworker\"&gt;leatherworker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce you have those items, you have to find a &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;.

Alternatively, you could attract them with &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus\"&gt;warped fungus&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you have a strider in range of you, it with the saddle to saddle it. If there is a &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; or a baby strider on top of the strider, then you will have to choose a different strider. However, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s are good, because the strider which is riding the zombified piglin will have a saddle already equipped on it. There is a 1 in 30 chance of a zombified piglin riding a strider. If that is the case, try killing the zombified piglin. Then, you will have an already saddled strider. \nAfterwards, the strider to ride it. Then, select the warped fungus on a stick and ride the strider.

Before attempting to move the ghast through it you should enter the portal to load the chunks and remove any block which might suffocate the ghast. Then you can use fishing rods (prepare a lot of them because they break really fast) to move a ghast through the portal. Keep a flint and steel in the hotbar in case the ghast breaks the portal. Elytra and fire resistance potions are not necessary but really helpful.\nOnce the ghast is in the Overworld, you will have to kill it.

To acquire this, place &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20iron\"&gt;blocks of iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; on the ground in a 9 x 9 layout. Place another layer of minerals blocks on top of that in a 7 x 7 layout, and another on top of that in a 5 x 5 layout. Finally, your final layer should be 3 x 3, and you can place your beacon on top of this. Once the beacon shoots its beam to the sky, you will get the advancement. A level 4 beacon can also give special and rare powers to the player, if opened and given a type of &lt;a href=\"mineral\"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow Did We Get Here?\nHave every effect applied at the same time\nRequirements: Have every non-instantaneous status effect applied to the player that is obtainable in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode at the same time (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Saturation\"&gt;Saturation&lt;/a&gt;).\nTo get this challenge advancement, you need to be affected by all the following &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s at once:\nBefore attempting this advancement, you must have killed the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, so that you can reach the outer islands of &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. You so must have killed the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, so that you have access to a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, find a naturally-generated &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt; (such that its codice_2 property is codice_3 according to the targeted block info on the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;) as close as possible to an unexplored &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt; (such that it still has at least one &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;). If you know your seed or are on a singleplayer world, you can use a seed map program like &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map\"&gt;Chunkbase&lt;/a&gt; to look for a &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biome with a nearby ocean monument (note that, due to how the deep dark generates, it's impossible for a deep dark biome to be right under a deep ocean biome).\nDig a simple 2\u00d72 staircase down to near the inner horizontal edge of the deep dark biome to about Y=-51 and tunnel around inside the deep dark biome to look for a cave system with a shrieker in it. Use the F3 debug screen to confirm that the shrieker's codice_2 property is codice_3, then surround the shrieker with wool (optional) and start destroying any nearby &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt;s, followed by any &lt;a href=\"sculk%20catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt;s. If there are any other shriekers nearby besides the one you intend to use, destroy those first. If shriekers are activated three times (such that one of the \"Warden draws close\" sounds plays), carefully leave the area and wait at least thirty minutes for your warning level to drop back down to 0 before continuing, as a fourth shrieker activation within ten minutes after the \"Warden draws close\" sound will summon a &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;. When done, double check that there are no more sensors nearby by making some extra noise around the area, then remove the wool surrounding the shrieker, but put a bottom slab on top of it to prevent you from accidentally stepping on it.\nThen, begin building the contraption around the shrieker as shown below. The stone bricks can be any full, solid block that blocks mob sightlines (including glass blocks), and the gold block can be any solid opaque block that can be powered by redstone. Note that all dispensers and observers are horizontal and the piston is facing up. The trapdoor in layer 2 should be covering the adjacent dispenser face, and the trapdoor in layer 1 should be covering the block under it so that the shulker minecart is raised slightly off the ground. When done, remove the bottom slab over the shrieker. The water column above the beacons should extend all the way up to sea level, and there should be no opaque blocks between the beacons and the sky (things like water and leaves are fine). The iron blocks can be any beacon-compatible mineral block, but iron is the easiest and fastest to obtain because it can obtain from &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce finished, place the spectral arrows in the Layer 1 dispenser and the splash potions in the layer 2 dispenser and set the beacons to Strength I+Regeneration I, Haste II, Speed II, Jump Boost II, and Resistance II. Dig a simple tunnel at least 1 block wide and at least 2 blocks tall from the top of the water column (at sea level) to the ocean and fill it with at least 1 layer of water (keeping at least 1 layer of air). Find a dolphin (remember that they can spawn in all ocean biome types except frozen and cold) and lead it back to the tunnel and down to the room with the waterlogged chests, then tie it to the fence post there and put a nametag on it to prevent it from despawning. The waterlogged chests should prevent the dolphin from drowning while also allowing it to keep contact with water to prevent it from dehydrating.\nFrom the rails on layer 5, dig a straight staircase up and toward the world spawn until you reach the surface. At that point, go directly to the world spawn and use a compass to find the specific location of the world spawn, which is (by default) the northwest corner of the chunk. Press F3+G (or equivalent on a non-QWERTY keyboard) to show chunk borders and use a compass to find the 1\u00d71 vertical column that the compass always points to as you walk around it. Make sure that there are no blocks over this block (including non-solid ones like flowers, grass, torches, and leaves), then surround the spot with glass and rails as shown below:\nThe netherrack shown above represents the world spawn, where entities show up when they come through the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtend the rail out by 16 blocks on both ends, then begin running rails from this spot all the way to the staircase dug earlier, bridging over water if necessary. If possible, try to tunnel through hills rather than going over them, as the minecart could get stuck otherwise. It may take thousands of rails and bridging blocks to get from the world spawn to the build site, so it may be easier to simply bring a few stacks of logs and iron blocks with a crafting table to craft rails as you go. This is one of the most time-consuming parts of this advancement, but it's far more reliable than using a boat since boats can't be moved vertically up without a piston, riding a boat across water risks drowning the shulker if you move too quickly, and moving a boat across a bridge in the end risks &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/ur0hxx/the_moment_i_watched_my_past_hours_work_fall/\"&gt;having an enderman teleport and push the boat off the bridge and into the void&lt;/a&gt;. Using a minecart to carry the shulker, pushed by a furnace minecart, also allows the player to keep a healthy distance to avoid getting shot at by the shulker, and using a furnace minecart and regular rails instead of powered rails is much more resource-efficient.\nOnce the rails are run all the way from the world spawn to the build site, double check that there are no gaps anywhere in the rail line from the world spawn all the way up to the contraption's drop shaft, then break the most recently used bed, make sure you're not wearing any armor with Thorns, optionally grab a shield, and head into the end and find an &lt;a href=\"End%20City\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt; with two shulkers still at the entrance. The city should be as close to an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt; as possible, though exact distance is less important than how much bridging you'll need to do between the two. Again, Chunkbase can be used to find a suitable candidate. Enter through the opposite side from the entrance to prevent the shulkers from seeing you and place blocks as shown below to obscure the shulkers' vision and set up the rails which will eventually be used to pick up the shulker.\nOnce that's done, place regular rails leading all the way up and into the end gateway. Take note of the direction your rails are facing using the F3 debug screen, then go through the gateway. A trapdoor or fence gate can be used to force you into the 1-block-tall swimming position to go through without using an ender pearl each time. Depending on the type of gateway, you'll either end up at a corresponding gateway on the main island or on the obsidian platform at codice_6. If you arrive at the obsidian platform, just remember that any blocks on and above it will be reset to air anytime an entity enters the end, so if you exit and re-enter the end after building here (or if anyone else enters the end if you're on a server) before you get the shulker, you'll need to replace the rails. Wherever you arrive, place rails under yourself in the same direction as before and continue placing rails up to the corner of the exit portal, with an activator rail at the end, powered by a lever. The activator rail will try to eject the shulker into one of the up-to-8 adjacent air blocks at its Y level, so make sure that there are solid blocks in the spaces around the activator rail so that the only available spot is inside the exit portal.\nNow head back to the end city, double-check to make sure you don't have Thorns on your armor, enter through the back like before, place a minecart on the powered rails, and crouch and use a fishing rod to hook the minecart, then get behind the glass blocks and pull the minecart. Wait for the shulker to pass by, then place a furnace minecart on the powered rails and give it some coal/charcoal and a push toward the shulker minecart. Keeping a safe distance, follow the two through the gateway, onto the main island, and up to the exit portal. You should see an empty minecart and furnace minecart and no shulker nearby. Grab both minecarts and go through the exit portal and you should see the shulker in the glass enclosure from earlier. Place the minecart and furnace minecart on the rails leading to the shulker, give the furnace minecart some coal/charcoal and a push, and the shulker will be picked up. Follow it at a safe distance all the way to the build site, but be careful to not let the shulker take damage on the way. If you suspect the shulker may not be at full health, hit it with a splash potion of regeneration. The shulker minecart should fall into the column on top of the trapdoor. Once it does, place a top slab just over the shulker to lock it in place.\nNow head to the ocean monument and time how long it takes to go from the ocean monument back to the build site. If it takes longer than about two and a half minutes, you'll need to use nether portals to get from place to place. It may be helpful to build the portals &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Breaking%20bedrock%23Phasing%20through%20bedrock\"&gt;on top of the nether roof&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate easy, safe transit. Now look for the nearest &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt; and village (Chunkbase can be used for this as well) and build portals to get there as well (unless you can get from the village to the pillager outpost and from the pillager outpost to the build site in under 10 minutes each). At the village, trap at least one villager in a fully-enclosed area with access to a job site, as this is all that's required to count as a \"village\" for the purpose of raids. At the pillager outpost, it may be helpful to fill the spawning area of the outpost (a 72\u00d754\u00d772 cuboid centered on the top floor) with as many grass spawning platforms as possible to maximize the chances for pillagers (and therefore pillager captains) to spawn and decrease the time it'll take after beating a raid to get Bad Omen again.\nAt this point, double check that the contraption is set up correctly with a nametagged dolphin tied to the fencepost, a shulker in a minecart next to the shrieker, spectral arrows in the lower dispenser, and splash potions of Fire Resistance, Invisibility, Night Vision, Slowness, Slow Falling, Water Breathing, and Weakness in the upper dispenser (behind the vertical trapdoor). Make sure you can get from the village to the pillager outpost in under 10 minutes, from the pillager outpost to the ocean monument in under 10 minutes, and from the ocean monument to the contraption in under 2.5 minutes (if not, you may need some extra swiftness potions or some other means of fast transportation through the nether portals. Also make sure that the bottom slab covering the sculk shrieker has been removed. If everything looks good, you should be ready to start the process of getting all the effects. It's recommended to make a backup of the world before continuing in case something goes wrong. It may also be helpful to record your screen so that, if something goes wrong, you can see exactly which effect(s) weren't applied.\nThe sequence for getting the effects is as follows:\nThis is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; has completed the advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 1000 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, which is the equivalent of 26 levels if the player previously had no experience.\nThe End.\nThe End.\nOr the beginning?\nRequirements: Enter the End dimension (Same as 'The End?').\nTo get this advancement, you will need to enter &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; dimension, by going through an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;. Once the terrain forms, you will get the advancement.\nParent of: Free the End\nFree the End.\nGood luck\nRequirements: Kill the Ender Dragon for the first time.\nTo get this advancement, you must deliver the last hit to the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. If there are multiple players, only the player that deals the last hit to the dragon will get the advancement. See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20the%20ender%20dragon\"&gt;the tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on how to kill the ender dragon for a proper tutorial.\nParent of: The Next Generation | Remote Getaway | The End... Again... | You Need a Mint\nThe Next Generation.\nHold the Dragon Egg\nRequirements: Have a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nTo get this advancement, you must get the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; into your inventory. This is achievable after defeating the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. However, when you punch the dragon egg, it will only teleport. The easiest way for the dragon egg to drop as an item is to place a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; facing the dragon egg, with a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; behind it. Flip the lever to push the piston, which will make the dragon egg drop as an item. Alternatively, you may bring a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; (or just take one of the torches on the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt;), dig one block under the block the dragon egg is sitting on, place the torch under, and break the block. The dragon egg will fall on the torch, then drop as an item.\nOf course, any non-full block will work in place of the torch (such as a Fencepost, Bottom-Half Slab, or Pressure Plate). However, the usage of torches is suggested, as they are cheap and easy to obtain.\nRemote Getaway.\nEscape the island\nRequirements: Enter an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get this advancement, you must enter an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;. Because the gateway opening is only one block high, you cannot walk in directly. You can either throw an &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; through, or force your player model in &lt;a href=\"crawling\"&gt;crawling&lt;/a&gt; position, most easily achieved with a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;. This will teleport you to one of the outer islands in the End, which is the only place where &lt;a href=\"End%20City\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nParent of: The City at the End of the Game\nThe End... Again....\nRespawn the Ender Dragon\nRequirements: Respawn the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTo get this advancement, you need to respawn the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. This is possible by placing &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on certain blocks of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; that surround the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; in the End. The exit portal is surrounded by three bedrock blocks on each side, with blocks connecting each of the sides, for a total of 16 blocks. Place an end crystal on the middle block of each of the sides. This will respawn the &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"End%20spike\"&gt;obsidian towers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ender dragon herself.\nYou Need a Mint.\nCollect dragon's breath in a glass bottle\nRequirements: Have a bottle of dragon's breath in your inventory.\nTo get this advancement, you must collect &lt;a href=\"dragon%27s%20breath\"&gt;dragon's breath&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, a glass bottle on the dragon's breath particles, and you will get the advancement as soon as there is a bottle of dragon's breath in your inventory.\nThe City at the End of the Game.\nGo on in, what could happen?\nRequirements: Enter an &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get this advancement, you must walk into an &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt;. The only place in the game where you can find end cities are on the outer islands of the End, accessible through an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;, which generates when the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; is killed. End cities contain lots of valuable treasure, along with many other things.\nParent of: Sky's the Limit | Great View From Up Here\nSky's the Limit.\nFind Elytra\nRequirements: Have a pair of Elytra in your inventory.\nTo get this advancement, you must get the &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory, which can be found in &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt; ships.\nGreat View From Up Here.\nLevitate up 50 blocks from the attacks of a Shulker\nRequirements: Travel 50 blocks vertically while being affected by Levitation.\nTo get this advancement, you must travel vertically for at least 50 blocks under the &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; effect, which is acquired by getting hit by a &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;'s projectile. Earning this advancement becomes significantly easier if you throw an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; at an &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt; tower above you after gaining Levitation. To avoid dying from fall damage after the effect wears off, you can throw another ender pearl, glide down using &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, try to position yourself just above a tower roof, place a water bucket where you intend to land, or wear iron or diamond &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with a high &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; level.\nAnother way to complete the advancement is to make a 50 block tall tower. Place water at the top, and swim up once the shulker hits you.\nYou can also get this advancement by traveling \"downwards\" 50 blocks, so you can get to the top of a tall &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt; (more than 50 blocks), and be hit by a &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;. You will be granted the &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; effect. Next, get at least 8 blocks away from the end city, and then eat a &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the way chorus fruit teleportation works, it will teleport you directly on the ground, and you will get the advancement. An alternative to a chorus fruit is to throw an ender pearl at the ground below while you still have Levitation.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 50 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure.\nAdventure.\nAdventure, exploration, and combat\nRequirements: Kill a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or get killed by one.\nThis advancement is easily achieved; either by killing any &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; or being killed by any entity. The easiest entity to find early in the game is probably &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, if you spawn near water. Otherwise, you can try to find animals to kill, or wait until nighttime to kill a hostile mob. Overall, no special attention is needed to get this advancement.\nParent of: Voluntary Exile | Monster Hunter | What a Deal! | Sticky Situation | Ol' Betsy | Light as a Rabbit | Sweet Dreams\nVoluntary Exile.\nKill a raid captain.\nMaybe consider staying away from villages for the time being...\nRequirements: Kill an illager captain, either from an &lt;a href=\"illager%20patrol\"&gt;illager patrol&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis advancement is rather easy. All you need to do is wait for an &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;illager patrol&lt;/a&gt; to happen, and find the &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt;. Kill it and you will get the advancement.\nAlternatively, you can find a &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt; and wait for a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt; to spawn in. Then you need to kill him in a 'direct' way like a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. Once you kill it, you will get the same result.\nIf you don't want to start a raid, make sure to drink a bucket of &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; as soon as you get the advancement. If you don't have milk with you, find the nearest cow, mooshroom or goat, and milk it.\nParent of: Hero of the Village\nIs It a Bird?\nLook at a &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"spyglass\"&gt;spyglass&lt;/a&gt;\nRequirements: Use a spyglass while aiming at a parrot.\nThis advancement is relatively straightforward. You need to obtain a &lt;a href=\"spyglass\"&gt;spyglass&lt;/a&gt;, crafted using two copper ingots and one amethyst shard. You also need to locate a parrot, which are only found in &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Once you zoom in on the parrot, you are granted the advancement.\nParent of: Is It a Balloon? | Is It a Plane? \nMonster Hunter.\nKill any hostile monster\nRequirements: Kill any hostile mob.\nYou must kill a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt; to get this advancement. One of the 34 mobs you could kill are: &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s. You can use any type of weapon, block, or your bare hands to kill the monster, but it is recommended to have a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, to decrease your chances of being killed yourself.\nParent of: A Throwaway Joke | Take Aim | Monsters Hunted | Postmortal\nThe Power of Books.\nRead the powered signal of a Chiseled Bookshelf using a Comparator\nRequirements: Place a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; inside a &lt;a href=\"chiseled%20bookshelf\"&gt;chiseled bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; while a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; is behind it.\nThis advancement should be straightforward to finish once you obtained the three components listed above. Make sure that the comparator is pointing away from the chiseled bookshelf, that is, the white triangle on top of it is pointing away.\nWhat a Deal!\nSuccessfully trade with a Villager\nRequirements: Trade with a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo do this, gather the item that the villager wants, the villager to access their trades, and put it in their trading slot. Then, put the item that they give you in return in your inventory.\nParent of: Hired Help\nCrafting a New Look.\nCraft a trimmed armor at a Smithing Table\nRequirements: Trim a piece of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"smithing%20table\"&gt;smithing table&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"smithing%20template\"&gt;smithing template&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo complete this advancement, a smithing template is required. It can only be found in rare generated structures, and a &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Template%23Chest%20loot\"&gt;complete list can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. Before trimming the armor, it is strongly recommended to duplicate the smithing template using seven diamonds and a corresponding material, so you may apply this template to other armor pieces later, as the smithing template is consumed each time you trim an armor using it.\nParent of: Smithing with Style\nSticky Situation.\nJump into a Honey Block to break your fall\nRequirements: Jump into the side of a &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt; so that it slows you down as you fall.\nTo acquire this advancement, you need to have a honey block. To craft a honey block, you need to have four &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s. Next, place the four bottles in a crafting grid like so:\nPlace the honey block one block above the ground and jump onto the \"side\" of it. The advancement should be awarded if the player touches the honey block before touching the ground.\nOl' Betsy.\nShoot a crossbow\nRequirements: Load (fire up) a crossbow, then shoot with it.\nThis advancement is achieved by simply firing a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;. Crossbows can be made with three &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s, two &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;, and one &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt;. Crossbows can also be obtained from &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt; drops.\nParent of: Two Birds, One Arrow | Who's the Pillager Now? | Arbalistic\nSurge Protector.\nProtect a villager from an undesired shock without starting a fire\nRequirements: Be within 30 blocks of a lightning strike that doesn't set any blocks on fire, while an unharmed villager is within or up to six blocks above a 30\u00d730\u00d730 volume centered on the lightning strike.\nTo complete this advancement, distance is crucial: the lightning rod needs to be not too close to the villager to convert it into a witch, and not to far so that this advancement is not triggered. The player also needs to be close to the lightning rod.\nTo make the lightning not set any blocks on fire, the best option is to build a small pillar out of non-flammable blocks at least 4 blocks high, and put the lightning rod on top of it. Make sure the lightning rod has access to the sky. The villager need to be at least 4 blocks away from the lightning in order to not be converted into a witch. Once the lightning strikes, all players within a 30 block radius of the lightning rod are granted the advancement.\nCaves &amp; Cliffs.\nFree fall from the top of the world (build limit) to the bottom of the world and survive\nRequirements: Falls from at least y=319 to at most y=-59 with a vertical distance of greater than 379 blocks.\nThe usual way of completing this advancement involves creating a tall pillar all the way to the build limit, and a shaft straight down to the &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; layer right next to it.\nThe easiest way to create the pillar is using &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;: simply place one down, and keep clicking on the side, until you cannot place any more of it. If you start at sea level, you will need 256 pieces of scaffolding, or about 4 stacks. If you don't have easy access to bamboo or string, you can alternatively build the pillar out of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, as a pillar made of them can be easily removed by placing a torch or slab at the bottom. Once you get to the top, you can either use a water bucket to get down, or roll down using a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo dig the shaft, the easiest way is to dig straight down by standing in the middle of two blocks, place a bucket of water at the bottom, and then pillar up on one side of the shaft. This leaves a 1 by 1 hole going down straight to bedrock.\nRespecting the Remnants.\nBrush a Suspicious block to obtain a Pottery Sherd\nRequirements: Brush suspicious sand and suspicious gravel and obtain a pottery sherd from each.\nSneak 100.\nSneak near a Sculk Sensor or Warden to prevent it from detecting you\nRequirements: Sneak within 8 blocks from a sculk sensor, or 16 blocks from a warden.\nSweet Dreams.\nSleep in a bed to change your respawn point\nRequirements: Sleep in a bed.\nThis advancement is achieved by sleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. Beds can be made with 3 &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, which is easy if players have &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nSleeping in a bed will reset the player's &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; point, so that when they die, they will respawn next to their bed. Note that this advancement can only be done at &lt;a href=\"night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt; or during a &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly perform the above steps while in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. If you try to sleep in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, the bed will explode.\nParent of: Adventuring Time,\nHero of the Village.\nSuccessfully defend a village from a raid\nRequirements: Kill a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt;, enter a village and complete a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, kill a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt; (which will award the \"Voluntary Exile\" advancement) and get the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect. Then, go to a village. You will see a &lt;a href=\"bossbar\"&gt;bossbar&lt;/a&gt; labeled \"Raid\" and your Bad Omen effect disappeared, indicating that the &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; has started. There will be numerous amounts of waves of the raid based on the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. There are 3 waves in Easy, 5 in Normal, and 7 in Hard.\nMobs that will spawn during the raid are: &lt;a href=\"pillagers\"&gt;pillagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vindicators\"&gt;vindicators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ravagers\"&gt;ravagers&lt;/a&gt;, which spawn on all difficulties. &lt;a href=\"Evokers\"&gt;Evokers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vexes\"&gt;vexes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"witches\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; only spawn on normal and hard difficulties. Ridden ravagers spawn with a pillager on normal and with pillagers, vindicators and evokers on hard. &lt;a href=\"Illusioners\"&gt;Illusioners&lt;/a&gt; are unused.\nOnce you have completed the raid (you have killed every illager in the raid), you will get the \"Hero of the Village\" advancement. You will also get the &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; of the same name of the advancement, &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 100 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nIs It a Balloon?\nLook at a ghast through a spyglass\nRequirements: Look at a ghast through a spyglass while the ghast is focused on you.\nParent of: Is it a Plane?\nA Throwaway Joke.\nThrow a trident at something.\nNote: Throwing away your only weapon is not a good idea.\nRequirements: Throw a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; at any entity.\nTo get this advancement, you will first need to kill a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; holding a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;. Drowned can be found in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt; or underwater in light level 7 or less in &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; biomes (except in warm ocean), and &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; biomes. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s can be converted to drowned, but they do not spawn with a trident. Tridents are a rare drop from drowned, so you may need to kill a few drowned to get the trident. 6.25% of drowned spawn with a trident, and there is a 8.5% chance for the drowned to drop the trident, with an 11.5% chance to drop with &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; III. A &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful fighting drowneds underwater, as their tridents deal massive damage.\nOnce you have obtained the trident, you then have to throw it at an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;. You can't hit the entity while holding the trident; it has to be a thrown. Once the thrown trident has hit an entity, you will be rewarded the advancement. The trident's durability will be reduced by 1 in the process.\nParent of: Very Very Frightening\nIt Spreads.\nKill a mob near a Sculk Catalyst\nRequirements: Kill a mob that drops experience within 8 blocks of a sculk catalyst.\nTake Aim.\nShoot something with an arrow\nRequirements: Hit any &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; with a shot arrow.\nThis advancement requires a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; and one or more &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s to be crafted beforehand. You can also obtain the bow and arrows by killing skeletons, and get the crossbow from killing &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce your bow/crossbow and arrow(s) are crafted, shoot any entity to get the advancement. One arrow will be consumed in the process.\nParent of: Sniper Duel | Bullseye\nMonsters Hunted.\nKill one of every hostile monster\nRequirements: Kill every hostile mob at least once.\nKill every type of &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;, and you only need to kill it once. Killing a type of hostile mob in your current world will be saved in the progress bar of this advancement. The 34 mobs you will need to kill include: &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe hardest mobs to kill for this challenge advancement are the ender dragon and the wither (they are bosses). The harder mobs to kill are elder guardians, ravagers (have health, deal up to melee damage on Hard difficulty, can roar (dealing damage and high knockback) when blocked with a shield, and spawn only in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s), evokers and vindicators (spawn only in woodland mansions and raids), piglin brutes (have health and do up to damage when armed on Hard difficulty), zoglins (requires to get a hoglin into the Overworld, made even harder by their fear of &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portals&lt;/a&gt;), silverfish (found only in strongholds and infested stone variants, and are small), and cave spiders (spawn only from &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s).\nThe player can track their progress by going to the \"Mobs\" section in their &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;. All mobs that are killed by the player (or have killed the player) at least once will be shown on the page. Killing a &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; is not required for this advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 100 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nPostmortal.\nUse a Totem of Undying to cheat death\nRequirements: Take fatal damage while holding a Totem of Undying.\nBefore attempting this advancement, you must go to a &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; or initiate a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, and kill an &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;, which will drop a &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt;. Then, if you take fatal damage while holding the totem of undying in either hand (switch between hands by pressing , better for &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;ing), you will not actually die; instead, your &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; will regenerate (from &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt; and you gaining ) and you will get the advancement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s you will get from the Totem of Undying are: 45 seconds of II, 40 seconds of , and 5 seconds of II. The Totem of Undying will remove all of your current status effects and apply these instead.\nHired Help.\nSummon an Iron Golem to help defend a village\nRequirements: Use 4 blocks of iron and 1 carved pumpkin to spawn an iron golem.\nYou must summon an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; to get this advancement, although summoning it in a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; is not necessary. The first thing you must do is gather 36 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;. Use the iron ingots to make 4 &lt;a href=\"iron%20block\"&gt;iron block&lt;/a&gt;s, and place them in a \"T\" shape on the ground. Place the carved pumpkin on top of the top middle block.\nThis should spawn an iron golem; therefore, you will get the advancement. Iron golems will kill any nearby &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;. Iron golems are considered &lt;a href=\"neutral%20mobs\"&gt;neutral mobs&lt;/a&gt; when naturally generated (meaning they will attack you if provoked), but if the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; summoned the iron golem, they will become passive toward the player.\nStar Trader.\nTrade with a Villager at the build height limit\nRequirements: Stand on any block that is higher than 318 and trade with a villager or wandering trader.\nThis advancement requires the player to transport a villager to the build limit of 319, and then trade with it. The villager can be transported upward in a variety of ways, but the easiest solution is usually a vertical &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;, with the benefit that a tower of some sort need not be constructed.\nTo conduct the flying machine technique, first trap the villager in a minecart or a boat, and then build a flying machine under it. Once the flying machine is finished, make sure you have the work station and some emeralds to trade with the villager, and then stand on the flying machine, and activate it. To ensure that you or the villager don't accidentally fall down and die, place some water at the bottom as a safety measure. Once the flying machine is activated, it will fly upward, carrying you and the villager with it. Once it reaches the build limit, it automatically stops, and you can place down the work station and trade with the villager. Once you performed the trade, you will receive the advancement.\nTo get down safely, you can either activate the flying machine to make it go downward, or simply disassemble the flying machine, and fall down into the water you placed below.\nSmithing with Style.\nApply these smithing templates at least once: Spire, Snout, Rib, Ward, Silence, Vex, Tide, Wayfinder\nRequirements: Apply all smithing templates listed above at least once.\nTwo Birds, One Arrow.\nKill two Phantoms with a piercing arrow\nRequirements: Shoot a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; with the enchantment &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt; at two &lt;a href=\"phantoms\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt; with one arrow.\nIn order to unlock this advancement, two phantoms must be simultaneously killed with a crossbow enchanted with any level of Piercing.\nPhantoms spawn after three in-game days wherein the player does not sleep (unless the &lt;a href=\"commands/gamerule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; codice_7 is set to codice_8).\nDue to their health bar, phantoms cannot be killed in one shot with a crossbow. A crossbow does of damage at minimum, at average, and at maximum, therefore requiring two shots.\nIt's easier to let the phantoms dive down then move into a place with a roof. Now trap the phantoms and wait until two already damaged phantoms line up one after another, and fire a shot traveling through both to kill them. This will complete the advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 65 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nWho's the Pillager Now?\nGive a Pillager a taste of their own medicine\nRequirements: Kill a &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst, you will need to obtain a crossbow. To do this, you have to either kill some &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, or craft one.\nAfter you have obtained a crossbow, find a pillager (usually found frequently in &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outposts\"&gt;pillager outposts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt;s), and kill it using your crossbow. You will need at least 3 &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s to do this. Alternatively, attack the pillager with melee attacks until it is on low health, and finish it off with a crossbow shot. You will then be awarded the advancement.\nArbalistic.\nKill five unique mobs with one crossbow shot\nRequirements: Use a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt; IV to kill any 5 different mobs in one shot.\nTo complete this advancement, you must kill five different mobs in one shot with a crossbow enchanted with Piercing IV, which allows arrows to hit five different mobs. \nFirst, you must prepare a 4\u00d74 area then place &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s all around the perimeter. This area is where the mobs will be trapped in. For this method you must also use passive mobs such cows or sheep. With these kinds of mobs, this size should be sufficient to trap all five mobs inside without any issues. If you are using &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s, or any other passive mob that has a larger size than a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;, or the other normal-sized mobs, it is a good idea to make the fence area slightly larger.\nNow, prepare all of the mobs' food, the food that is used to &lt;a href=\"feed\"&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; them, and lure them toward the trapping area. &lt;a href=\"Lead\"&gt;Lead&lt;/a&gt;s are also a good option. Once you have all five passive mobs trapped in the same 4\u00d74 area, you need to prepare a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20Poison\"&gt;splash potion of Poison&lt;/a&gt; II. Throwing this at the mobs will allow them to be reduced down to one &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health point&lt;/a&gt;, but not fully kill them, which allows you to finish them off with the crossbow shot. You may want to bring a bucket of &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, just in case you poison yourself.\nAfter the poison wears off, it is time to line them up so you can kill all five with a crossbow shot. It is recommended to lure the animals closer together using their breeding food. Holding different types of breeding food in both hands is also a good option because it will lure more animals toward you (for example, holding a carrot in your &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; while holding wheat in your main hand, will lure pigs, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, sheep, and cows).\nOnce they are attracted with your food each hand, quickly switch to your crossbow shot and fire the arrow in the best possible angle so that all the mobs die at the same time. It is recommended to aim for the mobs which have the smallest hitbox first, like a &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt; or rabbit's, because those are harder to hit, while mobs with larger hitboxes should be prioritized last, like a cow or horse's. If they all die after you fire the arrow, you should be rewarded the advancement.\nThis is a hidden advancement, meaning that it can only be viewed when the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; has completed the advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 85 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nCareful restoration.\nMake a Decorated Pot out of 4 Pottery Sherds\nRequirements: Craft a &lt;a href=\"decorated%20pot\"&gt;decorated pot&lt;/a&gt; using 4 &lt;a href=\"pottery%20sherd\"&gt;pottery sherd&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAdventuring Time.\nDiscover every biome\nRequirements: Find some but not all biomes in the Overworld.\nThis advancement is achieved by setting foot in all 52 standard &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s or in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; (the Nether and the End are excluded).

Once you have been in every biome, you will be rewarded the advancement.\nThe player can check their progress by going to the Advancement tab and hover their cursor over the advancement. A progress bar will show how many of the 52 biomes they have visited. However, it does not show \"which\" of the biomes have been visited, so it is recommended that you create a notepad document and tick off biomes as you visit them.\nFor a singleplayer world, a reliable way to check for which biomes have been visited is to read the .JSON file that stores the advancements. It involves the following steps:\nThe file keeps a record of which biomes the player has visited, as well as the exact time that the player visited them for the first time. By reading this file, the player can learn of which biomes they need to visit in order to complete this advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 500 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nSound of Music.\nMake the Meadows come alive with the sound of music from a Jukebox\nRequirements: Play a Music Disc in a Jukebox located in a meadow biome.\nFirst, craft a jukebox as shown below:\nThen, obtain a &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them can be dropped by &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s when killed by a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, and some can also be found as loot in certain &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;. After you get a music disc, find a &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt; biome. Place your jukebox in the meadow and play your music disc in it by using the disc on the jukebox. You should then get the advancement.\nLight as a Rabbit.\nWalk on Powder Snow...without sinking in it\nRequirement: Walk on powder snow using Leather Boots\nFirst, craft a pair of Leather Boots with the recipe shown below.\nThen, locate powder snow, which spawns naturally in groves and snowy slopes on the sides of &lt;a href=\"mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt;. It can be distinguished from regular snow by its texture. You can also obtain powder snow by placing a cauldron in a snowy biome. Make sure it has exposure to the sky, and then wait for it to snow, as it will fill with powder snow during snowy weather. Once the cauldron is full, you can use a bucket to remove the powder snow from the cauldron and place it elsewhere. The crafting recipe for the cauldron is shown below.\nOnce you have found or placed the powder snow, equip your leather boots and stand on top of it. You will not sink into the powder snow, and you will get the advancement.\nParent of: Sweet Dreams\nIs It a Plane?\nLook at the Ender Dragon through a spyglass\nRequirements: Zoom in on the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; while holding a spyglass.\nVery Very Frightening.\nStrike a &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;\nRequirements: Hit a villager with lightning created by a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nFor this advancement, a villager will need to be struck by lightning.

When this happens, you will be rewarded the advancement.\nSniper Duel.\nKill a Skeleton from at least 50 meters away\nRequirements: Be at least 50 blocks away from a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and kill it with a &lt;a href=\"projectile\"&gt;projectile&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo complete this advancement, you need to kill a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; with a projectile that is shot from at least 50 blocks away horizontally. The best way to do this is to first trap a skeleton into a 2\u00d71\u00d71 block area, using &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, so that you don't have to deal with a moving target. Also, make sure that it is nighttime so that the skeleton will not burn in the daytime. Alternatively, if the skeleton has a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; on, it will also not burn in the daylight. To ensure that the skeleton doesn't despawn, put a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; on it. \nThen, making sure that you are at least 50 blocks away from the skeleton horizontally, throw your projectile at about a 45 degree angle toward the skeleton. It may take many tries to shoot correctly. You will get the advancement once the skeleton is killed by the projectile.\nTo weaken the skeleton and kill it in one hit with your projectile, you can hit it with another &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; for a certain number of times, until you can hit the skeleton with the projectile in one hit. You will get the advancement as long as when the skeleton is killed and it was hit by your arrow at last. If you have an iron &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, diamond sword, netherite sword, or any type of &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; (except netherite), you can hit the skeleton twice with that weapon before shooting the skeleton with a fully charged arrow in one hit. If you have a wooden, stone, or gold sword, hit the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; three times with that weapon before shooting the skeleton. A bow enchanted with Power IV or V can kill a full health skeleton in one hit. Although arrows are the easiest to use, any projectile can be used for this advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 50 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBullseye.\nHit the bullseye of a Target block from at least 30 meters away\nRequirements: Hit the absolute middle of a &lt;a href=\"target\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; from at least 30 blocks away.\nTo complete this advancement you need to craft a &lt;a href=\"target\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen, place the target on the ground. Now you need to get a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and at least one &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;. Shoot on the bullseye (center) of the target from at least 30 blocks away horizontally until you hit the bullseye. Changing the &lt;a href=\"Options%23Options\"&gt;FOV&lt;/a&gt; value to 30 may be useful here.\nTo acknowledge where the arrow lands and how close you were, you can place 15 Redstone dust in a line starting from the target with Redstone lamps below. The more lamps light up the more accurate your hit was.\nWhen you hit the bullseye from at least 30 blocks away horizontally, you will be rewarded the advancement.\nAn easier way to do this is to place an iron trapdoor on top of the target block. Set up a Redstone trail 30 or more blocks long (use repeaters too). shoot the trapdoor in the middle and then pull the lever 30 blocks away. this will grant you the advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 50 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nHusbandry.\nHusbandry.\nThe world is full of friends and food\nRequirements: Eat any item that can be eaten, and replenishes at least 1 hunger point.\nEat any type of &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, other than &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s. It doesn't matter whether it's a &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;; as long as it is a type of food, you will get the advancement.\nParent of: Bee Our Guest | The Parrots and the Bats | Best Friends Forever | Fishy Business | Total Beelocation | A Seedy Place\nBee Our Guest.\nUse a Campfire to collect Honey from a Beehive using a Bottle without aggravating the bees\nRequirements: Without provoking the &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, place a lit &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; under a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;, then harvest &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; from it.\nFirst, craft a campfire. You will need 3 &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s, 3 &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stripped%20log\"&gt;stripped log&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stripped%20wood\"&gt;stripped wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stem\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stripped%20stem\"&gt;stripped stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hyphae\"&gt;hyphae&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"stripped%20hyphae\"&gt;stripped hyphae&lt;/a&gt;.

Cows and sheep breed with &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; and chickens with &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlso, you can breed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;tamed wolves&lt;/a&gt; with any type of &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; and tamed &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s with any type of &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;. However, wolves and &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s are a little bit rarer than most animals although &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s naturally &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSee the chart under the advancement \"Two by Two\" for details on what item each animal needs to breed.\nParent of: Two by Two\nYou've Got a Friend in Me.\nHave an Allay deliver items to you\nRequirements: Have an Allay deliver an item to you.\nFirst, you need two of one block or item.\nNext, find an .

Not putting a campfire under the beehive and then shearing the beehive will result in the bees potentially stinging you, which may poison you.) \nYou will acquire 3 honeycombs.\nNext, you will need to get a copper block.\n&lt;a href=\"Copper%20ore\"&gt;Copper ore&lt;/a&gt; can be found most often generating at Y level 47 to 48. When mining it, remember to use a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; that is anything but wooden, the ore will drop either &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Copper\"&gt;Raw Copper&lt;/a&gt; or copper ore (the latter will only drop if you're using Silk Touch).\nSmelting either raw copper or copper ore will result in a copper ingot.\nCopper block can be crafted with 9 copper ingots, like this:\nAfter obtaining both the copper block and honeycomb, place the copper block down, and the honeycomb on the copper block.\nParent of: Wax Off\nTwo by Two.\nBreed all the animals!\nRequirements: Breed all possible animals.\nLike the in-game description says, breed all the &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s! The advancement \"The Parrots and the Bats\" tells you how to breed animals. The 23 animals are &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a chart with what all the &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breedable&lt;/a&gt; animals can be bred with:\nOcelots and foxes will run away from the player, so bringing &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s is recommended.\nHoglins are hostile toward the player, making them difficult to breed.\nPandas require 8 bamboo blocks within 5 meters to breed.\nTrader llamas don't count toward this advancement, only normal llamas do.\nA way to check which mobs a player has bred is introduced in the &lt;a href=\"%23Adventuring%20Time\"&gt;\"Adventuring Time\"&lt;/a&gt; section, which also applies to this advancement; the only difference is that the entry to look for is codice_10.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 100 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBirthday Song.\nHave an Allay drop a Cake at a Note Block\nRequirements: Have an Allay drop a Cake at a Note Block.\nFirst, you must craft two cakes and a note block. The crafting recipes for the cake and note block, respectively, are shown below.\nNext, you must find an in a &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; jail cell or a &lt;a href=\"Pillager%20Outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt; cage.\nOnce you find an allay, you must give it the first cake you made earlier. Place down the note block, drop the other cake, click the note block with either mouse button, and the allay will fly to it and drop the cake. When the cake is dropped, you should get the advancement.\nParent of: Wax On\nA Complete Catalogue.\nTame all cat variants!\nRequirements: Tame all the 11 different &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; variants.\nYou will need at least half a stack (but preferably a stack) or either &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt;, usually obtained from &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; or killing &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; mobs. You then need to use it to tame all 11 cat variants in the game. To tame a stray cat, you have to hold the raw fish in your hand, then slowly approach it. Cats will flee from you if you get too close or approach too quickly, so sneaking toward it is a good approach. Eventually, the stray cat will start crawling slowly toward you. Once it comes to a stop in front of your feet, it with the fish several times until red hearts appear on top of the cat, showing that it is now tamed. Each cat variant has a different appearance, and a different name. They are: Black, British Shorthair, Calico, Jellie, Persian, Ragdoll, Red, Siamese, Tabby, Tuxedo, and White. Once you successfully tame all 11 cat variants, you will be awarded the advancement.\nCats only spawn in villages and swamp huts, but it is much more practical to find them in a village. For a village to spawn a cat, there needs to be at least 5 villagers and 5 beds, so make sure to increase the villager population if it's not big enough. Once you have successfully tamed a cat, move it far away from the village, so that more stray cats can continue to spawn.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 50 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactical Fishing.\nCatch a fish... without a fishing rod!\nRequirements: Catch a &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou will need a water bucket for this advancement. it on any type of fish. Fish are naturally found in any aquatic biome. Once you have obtained the &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20fish\"&gt;bucket of fish&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20cod\"&gt;bucket of cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20salmon\"&gt;bucket of salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20pufferfish\"&gt;bucket of pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20tropical%20fish\"&gt;bucket of tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;), you will be rewarded the advancement.\nParent of: The Cutest Predator\nWhen the Squad Hops into Town.\nGet each Frog variant on a Lead\nRequirements: Use a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; on all three variants of &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s at least once.\nLittle Sniffs.\nFeed a Snifflet\nRequirements: Feed a Snifflet (Baby Sniffer) with &lt;a href=\"Torchflower%20Seeds\"&gt;Torchflower Seeds&lt;/a&gt;\nA Balanced Diet.\nEat everything that is edible, even if it's not good for you\nRequirements: Eat every &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; item that can be eaten.\nEat everything that can be eaten in the game, excluding &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, as they are rather drunk than eaten. Here is a list of all the 40 foods needed to get the advancement:\nThe player can check their progress on this advancement in 3 ways:\nEating all these foods will reward the advancement.\nCompleting this advancement will reward the player 100 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nSerious Dedication.\nUse a Netherite ingot to upgrade a hoe, and then reevaluate your life choices\nRequirements: Upgrade a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;diamond hoe&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;netherite hoe&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"smithing%20table\"&gt;smithing table&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo complete this advancement, you must have a &lt;a href=\"netherite%20ingot\"&gt;netherite ingot&lt;/a&gt; and a diamond hoe. Next, craft and use a &lt;a href=\"smithing%20table\"&gt;smithing table&lt;/a&gt;. Place your diamond hoe in the first slot, and put the netherite ingot in the second slot. In the output, you should get a netherite hoe.\nThe advancement should be rewarded as soon as you collect the netherite hoe.\nWax Off.\nScrape Wax off of a Copper block!\nRequirements: an &lt;a href=\"Axe\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt; to revert a &lt;a href=\"Waxed%20Copper%20Block\"&gt;Waxed Copper Block&lt;/a&gt;.\nRefer to the Wax On achievement tutorial above to see how to make a Waxed Copper Block.\nOnce you have obtained a Waxed Copper Block, use any type of &lt;a href=\"Axe\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt; on it, and the achievement will be awarded to the player.\nThe Cutest Predator.\nCatch an axolotl in a bucket\nRequirements: a water bucket on an axolotl.\nFirst, you would need a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou would need to craft a bucket using this configuration:\nThen, the bucket on a water source block, you should now have a water bucket.\nNext, you need to find an &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;. Axolotls usually spawn in water in &lt;a href=\"lush%20cave\"&gt;lush cave&lt;/a&gt;s above clay blocks. You can encounter them usually by searching in lush caves.\nOnce you have located an axolotl, your water bucket on the axolotl. You should have now both a bucket of axolotl and the achievement for it.\nParent of: The Healing Power Of Friendship!\nWith Our Powers Combined!\nHave all Froglights in your inventory.\nRequirements: Have a pearlescent, ochre, and verdant &lt;a href=\"froglight\"&gt;froglight&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory.\nThe Healing Power Of Friendship!\nTeam up with an axolotl and win a fight\nRequirements: Have the &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; effect applied from assisting an axolotl or it killing a mob.\nRefer to the previous advancement to find how to get a &lt;a href=\"Bucket%20of%20Axolotl\"&gt;Bucket of Axolotl&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter you have caught an &lt;a href=\"Axolotl\"&gt;Axolotl&lt;/a&gt;, locate an underwater hostile mob (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Guardian\"&gt;Elder Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, though Guardian and Elder Guardian is not recommended, since they can kill the Axolotl easily).\nFacing your enemy, release your axolotl and let the axolotl hit the mob once. After that, kill the mob, do not let the Axolotl kill the mob. Then, you should have the Regeneration I effect thanks to the Axolotl, and this advancement.\nPlanting the Past.\nPlant any Sniffer seed\nRequirements: Plant a &lt;a href=\"Torchflower%20Seeds\"&gt;torchflower seed&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"pitcher%20pod\"&gt;pitcher pod&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, it is still possible to survive in this mode by finding resources in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, among other things.\nSetting up an Adventure world.\nThe way to survive is choosing a normal world with &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;. This is because there are &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruin\"&gt;ocean ruin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fossil\"&gt;nether fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20cities\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt; which can all be looted. If you want to, you can also enable \"Bonus Chest\" to generate a &lt;a href=\"bonus%20chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt;. Once the terrain is loaded, using command will switch the player into Adventure mode. If you want to, you can use a seed that have a stronghold that have an active end portal (because of the fact that you can't insert eye into end portal frame in Adventure mode), which have an chance of 1 in 1,000,000,000,000.\nSurviving.\nWhen you first spawn into your world, kill any mobs you come across, except for &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, but make sure that you leave at least 2 of each animal, for &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; later. Try to sprint and jump as little as possible to save food. Killing sheep can be useful for their mutton, but remember that there is no use making a bed with their wool, as it cannot be placed in Adventure mode. However, you can sleep in beds inside village houses.\nDon't eat raw meat unless you're desperate; wait until you cook it in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; blacksmith or in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s. You can also trade it for &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s if you wish, though this won't achieve much in the long run, unless you save up for &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; tools or armor. Many &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; trades can be cheap and not worthwhile, so it's important to know what trades will be useful in the long run. See the &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; article for more information.\nVillages.\nThe most important thing to do early in the game is to search for a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. For plains villages, if the village does not have a &lt;a href=\"weaponsmith\"&gt;weaponsmith&lt;/a&gt; or a small house with a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, search for another village, but take note of the first village's coordinates. You will have a much easier time if you find a plains village with both a weaponsmith and a small house with a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;. Use the crafting table in the small house for crafting and the 2 &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s in the blacksmith for cooking meat. Crafting table can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"witch%20hut\"&gt;witch hut&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe easiest way to find a village is to first find a &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20tundra\"&gt;snowy tundra&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt; biome, and look throughout the whole biome. There is a good chance that once you have found one of these biomes, a part of that biome will contain a village. If you've found a village that does not have a furnace or a house with a crafting table, take notes of the coordinates and search for another village. That way, you will at least have a place to stay safe for the night.\nWhile crafting tables can be found in some village small houses, only some buildings generate furnaces.\nA furnace can also spawn in ancient cities.\n&lt;a href=\"Smoker\"&gt;Smoker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; can also be used as furnace alternatives since the main use is only for cooking, and these blocks cannot smelt non-food resources. You can find a smoker in each village &lt;a href=\"butcher\"&gt;butcher&lt;/a&gt; shop, while campfires can only be found in taiga and snowy taiga villages.\nA smoker cooks food twice faster than a furnace, while campfires cook food three times longer than a furnace and can only cook up to 4 items, but can cook different foods at the same time and don't require fuel.\nAfter you have found a village and settled in, loot the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; in all buildings. Use the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; as a trash can for useless stuff you find in the chest or obtained from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s (see below). You can now use this chest for your storage purposes.\nIf the village bell is reachable by many villagers and there are enough &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s for gossiping, and you have enough armor and preparation, you can kill the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; for its &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. However, be very careful, as you can't tower up to kill iron golems (unless your world have a favorable terrain), iron golems have lots of health, and can deal great amounts of damage. Iron golems can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGaining resources.\nGathering resources in Adventure mode can be difficult, as blocks cannot be mined or placed.\nOne extremely useful tactic is to get &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s to blow up a house, farm in a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, terrain, &lt;a href=\"terrain%20feature\"&gt;terrain feature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"feature\"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;, or other structures; this way, you can get &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wheat\"&gt;Wheat&lt;/a&gt; can be used to breed animals or crafted into &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; cannot be replanted. Trampling is a more efficient way as you will not lose any of the &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt; farms in savanna and desert villages and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; farms in taiga and snowy taiga are useless due to trampling stem drop seeds while pumpkins and melon are unbreakable. since you cannot place or destroy blocks in Adventure mode; only blocks that are used in crafting or for &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; can be useful.\nIf you are lucky and have enough supplies, you can get &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s to blow up gravel and craft &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; which can only be used to ignite creepers or &lt;a href=\"tnt\"&gt;tnt&lt;/a&gt;. You can also make arrows with &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt;, although this is probably unnecessary because they can be obtained by killing &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Note that &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used on pre-mature wheat, since that counts as interacting with a block or object.\nA &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; can also be useful since it not only gives you infinite amounts of fish but can also give you junk and treasure items which can be useful in Adventure mode. Village animal pens and plains stables can also be used as a makeshift pen for animals and mobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to move blocks and they are your only way to do such a thing.\nOnce you are done with a village, take as many useful items as you can from your &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and head off for the next village. Repeat the above steps if necessary and see how long you can survive! It's also possible to find a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s or even an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient city&lt;/a&gt; by exploring &lt;a href=\"caves\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;. Although there are extremely valuable items you can find in chests, it is also extremely dangerous. For entering the stronghold, seek out the dead end of a corridor by exploring around in caves because sometimes dead-end corridors have an open hole to the cave.\nIf you prefer to explore the ocean, &lt;a href=\"shipwrecks\"&gt;shipwrecks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;s (for those you'll need to remove the sand covering the chest with creepers) are the only structures which can be looted, as you cannot dig the blocks covering the chests in &lt;a href=\"ruins\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt;, making that structure useless, another structure that is useless is &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monuments\"&gt;ocean monuments&lt;/a&gt; which provide nothing more than just a challenge due to you being unable to break &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gold%20block\"&gt;gold block&lt;/a&gt;, nor use &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"guardians\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt; as you cannot place blocks made from the prismarine you crafted.\nYou can also find lootable structures on the surface. They are: &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temples\"&gt;jungle temples&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outposts\"&gt;pillager outposts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansions\"&gt;woodland mansions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"swamp%20huts\"&gt;swamp huts&lt;/a&gt; (swamp huts continuously spawn &lt;a href=\"witches\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Nether.\nAccessing the Nether in Adventure mode is really difficult but not impossible. To build the nether portal you need to find a 5 blocks deep lava pool and to use creepers to funnel water so that it converts the bottom-most layer of lava into obsidian. Then, using the endermen's ability to place blocks, you need to remove all the lava sources except those which will create the portal. Endermen however will only place blocks where there is air, meaning that you will need a platform over the lava pool where endermen could place gravity affected blocks, then a creeper to blow up the platform to make those blocks fall into the lava and remove the lava sources you don't need.\nYou can then funnel more water to convert the remaining lava into obsidian, remove the water you used with the endermen's help once more and remove the blocks you used to remove the lava by exploding a creeper.\nNow you need to light the nether portal. There are 2 ways to do it:\nAlso, if you lucky enough, nether portal can be built by the world generation. There is a super small chance that a ruined portal generates inside the \"Lava room\" in a &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;. That ruined portal will need to fit the obsidian frame of the lava room, and doesn't have any &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Finally the lava in the ruined portal will catch fire of the wood in woodland mansion. Over time, this will light the portal. Although it's very rare, some seeds already had this.\nObtainable items.\nNote: Items with a use in Adventure mode are in bold."}

Therefore, a collected list of things the player should not do or forget has been compiled below in order to make the game experience as enjoyable as possible, This guide should help players get the grips of adventuring and being away from base for long periods of time.\nRegardless of the advice given here, players should feel free to ignore any advice and play the game in their own way.\nPreparation.\nBefore an adventure or trip, you may want to go and gather food, it is good to spend a couple of days at base before you set off.\nTools.\nDo \"not\" bring any valuables unless the purpose of the adventure is for resources, if within in that case bring a spare, You are better off with iron as it can be easily replaced with iron farms or mining. \nFood.\nBring a stack (64) of cooked meat of any kind, Otherwise bring supplies for farming in the case you will be away from your base for a long period of time.\nBlocks.\nBring a couple stacks of wood and cobblestone in the event you will be away from your base for a long time, this will prove handy in making small bases, however you do not need to gather blocks if you decide to live in caves, which you still shouldn't neglect keeping some, as you will need a crafting table or furnace.\nTravelling.\nUse horses! Try and get a fast one, but the jumping ability is not a major concern, however it may be handy for jumping across rivers or 2-block tall structures. If on feet, avoid sprinting to conserve food.\nLeaving base.\nStorage.\nMake sure to leave anything that you don't need, this will be quite useful when exploring for otherworldly resources.\nBase.\nMake sure that nothing can go in apart from yourself, this can be as simple as closing or blocking up a door. Make sure the base is lit up so that mobs dont spawn inside of it, Make sure to keep your tamed mobs somewhere secure so you don't end up taking them with you unknowingly.\nLivestock.\nMake sure to do a breed, so that when you come back you have lots of more animals to work with.\nDuring an adventure.\nUnless you\u2019re going to a specific coordinate, the complete randomness of Minecraft will intrigue you.\nDesert pyramids.\nIgnore these, looting pyramids wastes time."}

A torch attached to any of the blocks above also breaks. This continues to the last torch.\nConstruction.\nDesign 1.\nAn airlock requires only two components, a block affected by gravity (such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;) and torches (&lt;a href=\"Torches\"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt;, soul fire, or &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Torch\"&gt;Redstone&lt;/a&gt;). When placing an airlock, be sure to think about choosing narrow passageways and choke points, so that less time is spent on the project. For a building with multiple entrances, multiple airlocks may be needed to achieve optimal dryness. Airlocks are usually built directly across the hallway. Most sand-based airlocks are only 1 block thick, due to the fact that only 1 layer of sand is needed to stop the water.\nDetermining the materials needed is simple enough. The number of torches is equal to the width of the corridor, and sand is equal to the width of the corridor times the height of the corridor. Optionally, a shovel and a pickaxe can be taken along, to speed up digging and to waste less time on mistakes.\nFor the first step, the hallway must have a ceiling height equal to the highest water level possible plus 1, to compensate for the torch. Also, each new column must be 1 block higher, as the torch is 1 block higher each time.\nA torch is placed on either wall at a level where water can contact it and there is enough space above to provide the required amount of sand to seal the Chamber.\nSand is now placed above the torch until the sand reaches the ceiling, or until it reaches the desired level. \nA passageway more than 1 block wide must be extended from wall to wall in a particular fashion. A torch is placed on the block of sand above the previous torch, and sand is placed above that. This process is repeated until the hall is waterproofed.\nDesign 2.\n&lt;a href=\"Sugar%20cane\"&gt;Sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; can be used as a type of airlock, though this presents the difficulty of growing it inside.\nDesign 3.\nSince the introduction of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, they can be used to make much more compact airlocks using the same basic techniques. Piston-based airlocks are not restricted to using sand or gravel, but they may require Redstone circuitry which tends to make them costlier and more complex than torch/sand or torch/gravel airlocks. A simple way to build one would be to make a piston system that is retracted when the current is stopped and then placing Redstone across the passage.\nOther uses.\nAirlocks are one of the first completely environmentally reactive &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Traps\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; in \"Minecraft\".\nThe use of Airlocks in stopping water flow can also be applied to the concept of controlled flooding, allowing one to flood an area until a certain water level or redirect it when those levels are reached.\n The airlock works essentially the same, but faster and directly controlled by water flow, and not player interaction (Making it a completely standalone mechanism), Although this video proves that the method can be used to effectively trigger multiple walls and seal off multiple areas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; system could also trigger sand falling into a room, where a hole in the ceiling then opens up and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; then pours in to cancel out the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. As long as it involves the movement of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, it's quite an effective trigger system."}

Despite their rarity, allays are very useful for redstone farms and item sorters, since they are the easiest and simplest way to sort &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Non%20stackable%20item%20sorters\"&gt;non stackable items&lt;/a&gt;. For example, they can be used in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Raid%20farming\"&gt;raid farms&lt;/a&gt; to sort the &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Drowned%20farming\"&gt;drowned farms&lt;/a&gt; to sort the &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMechanics.\nAn allay duplicates when it is given an &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20shard\"&gt;amethyst shard&lt;/a&gt; while it is dancing from a nearby &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting an allay.\nAllays can only spawn in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s. There is not a guaranteed chance of finding an allay in either of these structures, however pillager outposts are far more common, so searching them is recommended.\nAllays generate in the wooden cages in pillager outposts, and in prison cells in woodland mansions. Once you choose which structure, search for them until you find an allay. Once you find an allay, you need to leash it and take it back to the area which you will dupe your allay, ideally near your base or an &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20geode\"&gt;amethyst geode&lt;/a&gt;. You will only need one allay, but it is recommended to bring as many as you can in case an allay flies away or dies. You can transport the allays however you like, but it is recommended to use &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; since it is most likely the fastest (but riskiest) way back if you have a nether portal to your location. Avoid using an &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, since allays already are flying, and if you fly too quickly with the elytra the lead might snap and you lose your allay."}
