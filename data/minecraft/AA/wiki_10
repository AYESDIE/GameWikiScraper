{"id": "113321", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=113321", "title": "Tutorials/Honey farming", "text": "Honey farming is the process of collecting &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt;s and bee nests. To get honeycombs, you can use &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; or bee nest has reached 5. Honeycomb is used for crafting your own beehives or bee nests for &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s to inhabit, as well as for crafting decorative &lt;a href=\"honeycomb%20block\"&gt;honeycomb block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"candle\"&gt;candle&lt;/a&gt;s, and waxing &lt;a href=\"copper%20blocks\"&gt;copper blocks&lt;/a&gt;. To get honey bottles, you can use an empty bottle on a hive or nest at honey level 5. Honey bottles are &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; items that are able to cure &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, and can also be used for crafting &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s, the latter of which have sticky properties that give them a variety of useful applications. \nHoney is generated by bees after they collect pollen and nectar. Bees emerge from their home and go looking for &lt;a href=\"Flower\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt;. After collecting pollen and nectar at the flowers, the bees return home and go inside to turn the nectar into honey. When done, the bees emerge again to look for more flowers. Over time the honey collects until the bee nest or beehive is full and can then be harvested by the player in various forms. \nGetting started.\nObtaining bees.\nThe first step on your foray into apiculture is to find bees in your world. Your initial source of bees is a naturally generated or spawned bee nest. Bee nests have a small chance to generate on &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt; trees in &lt;a href=\"Beehive%23Natural%20generation\"&gt;specific biomes&lt;/a&gt; during world generation. After world generation, there is also a chance for a bee nest to spawn on an oak or birch tree when that tree grows near flowers (see &lt;a href=\"Beehive%23Post-generation\"&gt;post-generation&lt;/a&gt;). \nBee nests and beehives both slowly fill up with honey over time as the bees do their work collecting pollen from flowers. If you find a natural bee nest and it is conveniently located, you can leave it as is and return to collect the honey when you want. Keep in mind that breaking a bee nest without Silk Touch breaks it without dropping anything \"and\" causes all the bees from that nest to swarm the player regardless of whether or not a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; was placed underneath it. Aside from hazard to the player, this is disastrous because the bees die from stinging you, and this can wipe out a hive. \nIf you want the bees at another location, you have a few options for getting them there. First, you need a beehive at the new location. (Beehives are constructed using honeycomb. To get your first honeycomb, you need to find a bee nest that has reached honey level 5 and then use shears on it. See &lt;a href=\"%23Avoiding%20bee%20anger\"&gt;Avoiding bee anger&lt;/a&gt; below.) You can then bring bees to your hive from the nest. You can also just move a whole nest if you want, see below.\nBees can be lured (and bred) using any type of &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt; (including 2-block flowers and &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;wither roses&lt;/a&gt;), and can also be moved using &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s. If you feed the bees the flowers, they enter love mode and &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt;, producing a baby bee. However, if the bee nest is situated at a large distance from where you wish to do your beekeeping, a convenient way to transport bees is to break an occupied bee nest with a tool with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; and bring the nest with you. Bees that are occupying the nest when it is broken with a tool with Silk Touch remain inside the nest as an item and are not angered. Bees return to their nests at &lt;a href=\"night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt; or when it is &lt;a href=\"Weather\"&gt;raining&lt;/a&gt;; these are optimal times to break the nest. \nIf you don't have a tool with Silk Touch or don't want to remove the bee nest from its natural location, another option is to stay with the bees as they work until they have filled their nest with honey. Then, place a campfire at least two blocks directly below the hive, and put carpet on top of the campfire . The campfire keeps the bees from getting angry with you, and the carpet keeps you from cooking the bees alive.\nWhen this is in place, use shears on the hive to extract three honeycombs (they'll fly out in a random direction). The honeycomb can be used to craft a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; that you can place anywhere you like. \nA &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; is functionally identical to a bee nest, but it is not destroyed if broken with a tool without Silk Touch (though this still causes the bees inside to exit the hive and swarm). Also, if you don't want to completely remove the original bee population, consider breeding your own group of bees from the original group to take home with you. You can lure them to follow you by holding flowers.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.15.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.15.2&lt;/a&gt;, occupied bee nests additionally have a 5% chance to spawn on oak or birch trees in any biome that were grown from &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s within two blocks of any &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt; at the same &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;y-level&lt;/a&gt;. With a bit of luck and a large enough supply of oak or birch saplings and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, one can obtain bees relatively easily without having to travel, by repeatedly growing trees near flowers until one spawns a bee nest as it grows. This is also an ideal way to obtain bees in older worlds created prior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.15\"&gt;Java Edition 1.15&lt;/a&gt;, as it saves players from having to locate anything.\nFlowers can be harvested from the landscape, and/or produced by using &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass blocks&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron farm&lt;/a&gt; will provide an endless supply of poppies as a byproduct.\nHelping bees work.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, bees follow their own schedule. During the &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; in clear weather, bees leave their beehive or bee nest and wander around in search of flowers. When a bee finds a flower, it hovers over the flower for a short time to collect pollen, changing its appearance, after which it heads back to the hive. The pollen-laden bee enters the hive and works for 2 minutes, and then if it is still daytime and the weather is clear, it exits the hive to repeat the process. When night falls or the weather is rainy or stormy, bees return to their hives regardless of whether they have collected pollen.\nTo help improve the efficiency of the bees' work, place &lt;a href=\"Flower\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt; near the hive so they can gather pollen and return to their hive as quickly as possible. You can also improve the efficiency of your bees by relocating them to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, as these dimensions do not experience weather or daylight cylces, meaning that bees can work at any time. If you're worried about bees wandering too far away from their hives, it may be wise to build an enclosure to both protect them and prevent them from straying too far away. This is especially important if you choose to keep the bees in The Nether or in The End, as these dimensions can be particularly dangerous. \nIt is worth noting that the pollen particles that fall from bees can cause &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; to advance growth stages similar to using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it can be beneficial to build your beehives near your crops to allow the bees to help them grow faster, although doing so does not improve the bee's efficiency in making honey.\nHarvesting.\nPollinated &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s fly into beehives and start working for a while. When done, they exit the hive, increasing the honey level by 1. When the honey level has reached 5, the block's appearance changes, indicating that it is full of honey, and produces dripping honey &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s if suspended above the ground. If &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; are on a full beehive, it drops three &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike with shearing &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, these honeycomb items are generated directly in the center of the block, causing them to spray everywhere (this is intended behavior). If an empty &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt; is used on a full beehive, the bottle fills with honey, becoming a &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;. However, if this is done by hand without preparation, the bees take offense and attack the player!\nAvoiding bee anger.\nUnfortunately, casually harvesting honey or honeycomb causes any &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s inside the hive to emerge and attack the player who does it. If the player fights back with any attack, every bee in range joins the attack. Any time a bee succeeds in landing an attack, the player gets poisoned, and the bee itself dies about a minute later. Naturally, this is bad when you were hoping to adopt those bees, and worse when most of your own swarm commits suicide!\nThere are two main ways to avoid this fate: One is to place a lit &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; (or even &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;) directly underneath the hive. A campfire can be within five &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s underneath the hive, \"if\" nothing blocks the smoke. This \"smokes\" the hive, so that harvesting does not aggravate the bees. However, a campfire (let alone a fire block) also damages mobs that touch it, and bees are no exception. In \"Java Edition\", you can put the campfire just below ground level, with a carpet over it. The carpet does not block the smoke, and the covered campfire can stay there forever, allowing you to harvest the nest or hive. A trapdoor also works just as well. In Bedrock Edition, carpeting the campfire blocks the smoke. It is best to put the campfire in a hole below the beehive and put a fence around the hole to prevent animals from burning themselves (this works in \"Java Edition\" too).\nThe other is to maintain deniability by using redstone: Hives can be harvested by using a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; (with a or ), and then the bees do not attack anyone. This works because the whenever a block gets activated by redstone, such as a &lt;a href=\"Dispenser\"&gt;Dispenser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, the game cannot determine who activated said block - it only sees that the targeted block was activated via redstone. As such, the game is unable to assign a target for the bees to attack. This mechanic can also extend to other aspects of the game, such as determining who attacks a &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt; via exploding TNT or the ability to block TNT with a &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"%23Automatic%20harvesting\"&gt;#Automatic harvesting&lt;/a&gt; section below discusses designs for using redstone.\nEven if there are no bees in a nest or hive, harvesting them or breaking them can anger bees if they are nearby. One way of making sure a nest or hive is empty before breaking it is to block all six sides of the hive with solid blocks so bees can't enter. Then wait until night so the bees go back into their remaining hives, and the hive can be broken (or harvested) safely. The blocks must be solid and touching the hive. Fence posts, glass panes, and trap doors do not block the surface or contain the bees.\nBees exit a hive or nest through the front. On rare occasions, one may harvest a nest from the front at the exact moment a bee emerges from the hive. If this happens, the bee considers itself struck, even if there is smoke under the nest, and nearby bees will attack. To avoid this rare situation, always harvest honey or honeycombs from a side other than the front of the hive.\nProtecting your bees.\nBe careful about hazards in the vicinity, remembering that bees explore a wide range and fly over fences and walls. Water, lava, fire, uncovered campfires, and cactus can all act as \"bug-zappers\" and wipe out your colony. Bees can also wander through nether portals \u2014 you may want to keep a flower or two ready on the other side to help lure them back. Aside from making the area safe, you may want to breed up an extra hive/nest or two, collect them with Silk Touch, and stash them someplace safe in case of disaster.\nOnce you've built up a few productive hives, the most likely disaster is accidentally aggravating your bees \u2014 never mind the hazard to \"you\", but every bee that stings successfully will die, which can wipe out whole hives. If you can't quickly escape to someplace where the bees can't follow you, the best option might be to just stand there and let the bees get it over with \"quickly\", and wait out the bee's deaths. Just eat enough food so the sting damage won't kill you -- the poison damage can't kill you by itself, and if you already have a honey bottle you can cure it anyway. After you've waited out the bees' deaths, grab some spare flowers and keep waiting a bit longer \u2014 if you're lucky, a few of your bees may have been busy \"inside\" their hives for the duration of the attack, so you can breed them to re-fill the newly-emptied hives. As above, keeping backup hives safely in a chest can also help with this situation.\nProducts.\nHoney bottles.\nHoney bottles can be farmed using &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt;s on beehives or bee nests. Bees fly around a flower to collect pollen. If they carry the pollen back to their hive, then the honey level of the hive is raised by 1. When the honey level reaches 5, the texture of the hive or nest changes to show honey dripping out, and you can collect the honey. Then you can press the 'use item' button on the nest with a glass bottle in your hand to get a honey bottle. Honey bottles provide a stackable remedy for &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;; unlike &lt;a href=\"Milk%20Bucket\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, they do not remove other buffs or debuffs. Honey bottles stack to 16 per inventory slot. \nHoney bottles can be crafted into &lt;a href=\"Honey%20Block\"&gt;honey blocks&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory's crafting grid; you do get the empty bottles back. Honey blocks have a variety of useful features: As a floor, they reduce fall damage by 80%, but also slow movement and jumping. As a wall, they let players slow their fall and avoid fall damage. When moved by pistons, they can drag along adjacent blocks (like slime blocks) and even (unlike slime blocks) carry along creatures walking atop them. You can also craft them back into honey bottles, by putting them into a crafting table with four empty bottles (four separate slots/stacks). \nHoneycombs.\nUsing shears on a hive or nest that is full of honey yields three honeycombs. Four honeycombs can be crafted into a &lt;a href=\"Honeycomb%20Block\"&gt;honeycomb block&lt;/a&gt;, which is a purely decorative block. As of 1.17, honeycombs can also be used to make &lt;a href=\"Candle\"&gt;candles&lt;/a&gt; and to preserve &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Copper\"&gt;copper blocks&lt;/a&gt; from (further) oxidation.\nBut, most immediately relevant, honeycombs are also used for crafting beehives. The recipe for a beehive is below. Beehives differ from natural bee nests in that the hive can be harvested without Silk Touch (but any bees within, or flying nearby, must be placated).\nAutomatic harvesting.\ns can be used to harvest honey bottles and honeycomb from a hive using a redstone signal. The output of the dispenser must point toward the beehive, and the dispenser must contain glass bottles to collect honey bottles, or shears to collect honeycomb. Collecting honey bottles places the item directly into the dispenser, whereas collecting honeycomb causes the items to drop onto the floor. You can prevent filled honey bottles from getting placed back in the dispenser by using an item filter below the dispenser. The benefit to using an item filter is that you don't need to fill each slot of the dispenser. Dispensers deplete the durability of the shears with every use. Note that harvesting from the hives using dispensers doesn't anger the bees, so placing campfires underneath them is not necessary if you harvest this way.\ns output a redstone signal from a beehive based on the honey level of the hive. Every time a bee exits the hive after having worked with the pollen it has collected, the honey level increases by 1. Each honey level increases the redstone output from a redstone comparator by 1, to a maximum of 5, which is when the hive changes in appearance and indicates it is ready for harvest. By using this mechanic, you can set up a system with the output signal to activate a dispenser as soon as the hive is full. The two designs shown are both tileable; the longer and more expensive one puts the hive on top, and allows a filtering hopper to be placed below..\ns are less useful here, because they output a signal every time the honey level of the hive changes, not just when the hive is ready to be harvested. This is a problem if trying to collect honey bottles: If the hive is not ready to be harvested, the dispenser ejects a glass bottle when the observer activates it. This could lead to a lot of glass bottles being lost if you don't have a system to pick them back up again. Observers work better for harvesting honeycomb \u2014 if the hive isn't ready, dispensers don't wear down the shears or eject them.\nHoneycombs.\nWhen a dispenser collects honey from a beehive or bee nest with shears in its inventory, 3 honeycombs are produced and the shears inside the dispenser lose 1 point of durability. the honeycombs are spawned inside hive block and can be collected by a hopper beneath the hive, while they are produced at the edge of an adjacent block even if solid.\nThe dispenser should be filled with as many shears as possible to maximize the time the system can operate before refilling. You could even set up a way to automatically restock the dispenser with shears when the durability runs out. \nThese schematics show a 1-block wide setup to activate a dispenser above the hive and collect the honeycombs with a hopper. A honey block indicates the bee hive or nest, with its front to the left.\nThe dispenser is triggered every time the honey level changes, to no effect if the hive is not yet full. Various other &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Mechanism%20components\"&gt;redstone mechanism components&lt;/a&gt; may be used in place of the trap door.\nIf the hive has become full and the dispenser has run out of shears, even after being resupplied it does not harvest the hive. In this case the trap door may be manually toggled to restart the farm.\nOther designs, using comparators rather than observers:\nHoney bottles.\nWhen a dispenser collects honey from a beehive or bee nest with a glass bottle in its inventory, a honey bottle is placed into its inventory. In order to extract the honey bottles from a dispenser in a lossless fashion, the best way to do so is to set up an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Hopper%23Item%20sorter\"&gt;item sorter&lt;/a&gt; underneath the dispenser to collect only honey bottles. 8 of the 9 slots of the dispenser should be filled with as many glass bottles as possible, leaving at least one space empty for the honey bottles. The more glass bottles that are loaded into the dispenser, the longer this system can run without restocking. Naturally once you pick up the honey bottles, you can craft them into honey blocks, thus freeing up the bottles for reuse.\nThis schematic shows a 1-block wide setup that collects honey using a dispenser and extract the honey bottles with an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Hopper%23Item%20sorter\"&gt;item sorter&lt;/a&gt;. A honey block indicates the bee hive or nest, with its front to the left.\nThe design also has one non-obvious failure state \u2014 if a hive becomes full and the dispenser has run out of bottles, even after being resupplied it does not harvest the hive. The solution here is to break and replace a piece of redstone dust on the hive's top-layer trail. This interrupts the comparator's signal and allows the dispenser to trigger on the full hive. \nOther designs:\nNote: Tiling the design as shown in the final two gallery images will make the dispensers inaccessible \u2014 the grass block in front of the dispenser needs to be replaced with a slab, fence, or trapdoor so the dispenser can be refilled with empty bottles. The top hopper in each row must be set up with 2 honey bottles in the first slot, and 11-13 \"junk\" items (stackable to 64) spread across the other slots. As honey is collected, one bottle is kept in the lower hopper, but bottles after that are passed on to the output. "}
{"id": "38938", "revid": "42078177", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=38938", "title": "Tutorials/Hopper", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20component\"&gt;redstone component&lt;/a&gt; that can be used to manage &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAutomatic smelting.\nTo make the &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt; process more efficient, it is possible to use &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s to ensure a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; is never left empty. In the shown schematic, chest A is for &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s such as uncooked meat, chest B is for &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, and chest C holds the output. Since &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s can hold fuel without a chest, chest B and its hopper are unnecessary. This type of system also works with the &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs furnaces retain &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; when items are removed by hoppers, multiple of these can be run for an extended period of time to make an experience farm. When one &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; is removed from a furnace, all experience is received immediately.\nUsing a hopper system like this greatly speeds up the process of smelting large numbers of items. Should it become necessary to smelt an even larger number however, it is possible to link multiple modules to create what is commonly called a \"furnace array.\" These vary in size and can range from small to using close to a hundred furnaces.\nItem sorter.\nAn item sorter is a type of &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; mechanism that can be used to filter specific &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. They generally work using two &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s, as shown in the schematic. The top &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; is filled as shown under the image. The hopper underneath is &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Power\"&gt;powered&lt;/a&gt; so that it cannot remove items from the top. The top hopper must be pointed away from the bottom hopper, otherwise it pushes items into the bottom hopper. When enough items fill the top hopper, the bottom hopper is unpowered so that it can remove the extra items. Note that some method of passing the items to be sorted along the top of a sorter chain may be necessary - this can be done with another hopper pipe transporting items over the top, or with water/ice streams.\nThis design relies on the fact that, inside of Minecraft's code, hoppers search for an item to be taken from the input side \"before\" outputting an item to another container. This results in the bottom hoppers taking the filtered item(s) before the items currently running through the storage system are passed over to the next hopper. However, because hoppers have a 0.4 second cooldown after transferring an item, bear in mind that \"both\" the input and output activate should there be more than 1 item available to pass. For example, if 2 iron ingots were in the same hopper, 1 of them would get taken by the hopper beneath, while the second one would get outputted to the side and continue along the sorting chain.\nStorage.\nUsually &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s are placed sideways to the right of the bottom hopper. Additional hoppers can be added below or to the right of the bottom hopper to attach more chests. The bottom hopper is the only one that needs to be powered (though one immediately below it would also be powered by the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;), so as many hoppers and chests as necessary can be added.\nAt the end of an item sorter, there is usually a chest to catch any items that didn't get sorted for some reason. This is helpful in case a valuable tool or such is accidentally dropped in. If a chest becomes full, it can also prevent the loss of items of that type. Sometimes large farms' storages use &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; instead to prevent a buildup of items should the storage completely fill up.\nOverflow protection.\nWhen multiple sorters are tiled directly next to each other, it is usually desirable to have overflow protection. In an overflow safe sorter, even if the topmost hopper has filled up due to an \"overflow,\" the redstone signal strength isn't great enough to interfere with adjacent sorters. In the sorter shown, 1 full stack of items and 4 junk items produce a signal strength of 3. This is just strong enough to unlock the bottom hopper without affecting adjacent hoppers. If the signal strength were to get up to 4 however, the adjacent hoppers would be unlocked causing the whole system to break down.\nThe first slot of the input hopper should contain the item being sorted out. The other slots should contain items that never go through the system. Named &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; are all common 'junk' items used for this purpose. Only one junk item should be placed in each slot. Otherwise, the sorter does not have ensured overflow protection.\nIf such named 'junk' items accidentally get into the sorter anyway this simple overflow protection has no value, but &lt;a href=\"%23Hybrid_design\"&gt;hybrid designs&lt;/a&gt; remain protected.\nTip: Use \"named\" \"junk\" items in the first sorter row/tile to sort out normal un-named junk items of \"the same type\". This way you can safely use that normal junk item in all other sorter rows. Add a safety overfill detector on the storage container attached to that first sorter that disables the input for the entire sorter for an additional layer of security.\nIt is possible to remove the center column of blocks from this \"basic\" sorter design. However, doing so turns it into the &lt;a href=\"%23Variations\"&gt;\"compact\" variation&lt;/a&gt; without overflow protection. If the input hopper fills up, it has a signal strength of 3, which unlocks adjacent hoppers.\nItem transportation.\nThere are multiple methods that can be used to carry items across the input hopper to potentially be picked up. The methods most frequently used are hopper pipes, item streams, and chest- or hopper-minecarts.\nA hopper pipe is simply a chain of hoppers all pointing at each other in a continuous line. This requires extra &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and may cause consistent lag on large scale. Another limitation is that hopper pipes transferring a full load at full speed (for example, continuously moving items that have been stacked in an input chest) pushes a small percentage of items past filters without allowing them to be sorted.\nItem streams, on the other hand, are made by running water over the hoppers and dropping items into the flow with a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever the stream grows too weak, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; and blocks that stop water flow but not moving entities (such as &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, open &lt;a href=\"fence%20gates\"&gt;fence gates&lt;/a&gt;, top &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"trapdoors\"&gt;trapdoors&lt;/a&gt;, buttons, etc.) are used to carry items across the breaks. This is a cheaper method, provided &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; has been obtained. However, while items are flowing through the system, it may generate more lag than using hoppers. Additionally, if too many items move past a filter at one time there is a chance for items to skip over and not be sorted. edition, any item in collection range of a filter hopper that does not match the filter item in the hopper can block the hopper from collecting a matching item. Hoppers also have a collection cooldown that limits them to collecting only one group of items every 8 game ticks.\nChest-minecarts and hopper-minecarts can be used to deliver items to filter hoppers by moving them across rails on top of the filter hoppers. This method of delivering items is reliable but also typically much slower than hopper pipes or items streams.\nVariations.\nA couple of variations of the standard overflow-protected design exist that either sacrifice the overflow protection or require some input method other than a hopper pipe.\nIf you are looking at variations that are not overflow-proof because they hold back fewer of the sorted item, you may want to consider one of the &lt;a href=\"%23Hybrid_design\"&gt;hybrid designs&lt;/a&gt; with inherent overflow protection instead.\nHybrid design.\nTo use only one item in a sorter with overflow protection, total isolation of the circuit is required. To achieve this you can use a hybrid solution.\nIf you combine designs \"h-A\" and \"h-B\" (in ABABAB... configuration) then you get an item sorter with better overflow protection, because the signals are completely isolated from each other and never interfere with adjacent tiles.\nResource optimized hybrid (OH).\nNote that types I-IV below are prone to redstone torch flicker burnout in Java 1.18+ when used in a storage sorting setting (with a steady stream of 2.5 item per second). The burnout may cause all the filter items to drain, breaking the sorting. The issue is not present on Bedrock due to different torch burnout mechanics and is unlikely to manifest in Java in a farm setting (since farms rarely provide a steady stream of items).\nOH type III.\n(= 17 , which is \"less\" then a set of two &lt;a href=\"%23Variations\"&gt;\"compact\"&lt;/a&gt; ones!) \nWhen initializing such a sorter array any \"oh3-B\" filter-hopper (F) can be be filled with filter and filler items only after at least one neighboring \"oh3-A\" has already been initialized. The \"oh3-B\" comparators need the adjacent comparators to output at least a power level of one to keep their own output-hoppers (O) locked and thus from puling the filter+filler from the filter-hopper (F). \nOH type IV.\nby r/Agantas\nOH type V.\nby r/Agantas\n(= 23 ) \nHybrid with Bedrock Edition.\nWhen using &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Hopper%23Hybrid%20design\"&gt;Dark Altair's design&lt;/a&gt; on the Bedrock Edition, you might have issues with the 21 non filter items in Item Sorter Part B. With 21 items the hopper tends to run the 1 item filter trough as well. \nIn order to make it work you should put 20 non filter items in. This way you sometimes get 2 filter items, but generally it drains to 1 filter item. \nIn order to have only1 filter item when storing items that stack till 16, you need to decrease the number of non filter items.\nBelow here is a link to a video that shows the use of this design on Bedrock Edition and with stacks of 16.\nStorage silos.\nIt is sometimes necessary to store &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s in more than just one &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s, it is possible to store items in hundreds or even thousands of chests. This is usually done with either a connected design or an accessible design.\nThe connected design should be used when it is necessary to take &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s from a single output. Any items stored in this silo funnel down as the bottom chest is emptied. Since the chests are not all easily accessible, this is more helpful in automation rather than use by &lt;a href=\"the%20player\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt;. However, if it is not necessary to remove a large number of items, it could work. Silos like this are commonly used to hold &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es.\nThe accessible design should be used when &lt;a href=\"the%20player\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; uses the stored items, not &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; contraptions. When the bottom chest is emptied, only items stored in the adjacent hopper can fill it back up. Since the bottom chest is the only one that can be drained with a hopper, it is impractical to use this for automation. Silos like this are commonly used in combination with sorting systems.\nThe accessible design is slightly faster than the connected design since the &lt;a href=\"Hopper%23Redstone%20component\"&gt;hoppers&lt;/a&gt; are in a vertical line. If an item is still in the top hopper after the one below has grabbed another, it puts the item into the chest. If the upper chests become full, however, the speed slows down to the normal 2.5 items per second.\nThese designs are easily expandable to fit storage needs. The expandable design can easily be tiled upward and to one side, while the connected design can be expanded in all directions. Below are some schematics demonstrating some of these possibilities.\nSpecial item filters.\nSpecial item filters, while similar to item sorters, sort items using unique properties rather than item type and name. They are usually used to sort unstackable items such as &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s. As item filters do not work with every item type, they may be most useful in combination with item sorters rather than as a standalone.\nUnstackable items.\nAn unstackable item filter can be used to separate unstackable &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s, from stackable items. This can be useful with &lt;a href=\"mob%20farm\"&gt;mob farm&lt;/a&gt;s where &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s should be separated from everything else.\nWhen an unstackable item enters input &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; A, it unlocks output hopper B. The unstackable item then goes into hopper B to be sorted elsewhere. If a normal item enters hopper A, hopper B remains locked and the item can be outputted from hopper A.\nThe optional hopper C can prevent valuable items such as &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; armor from being temporarily stuck in the system. When hopper B is locked, there is usually an item left in it. Hopper C, however, can still pull the items from hopper B. In one of the tileable designs, hopper C is locked with hopper B and cannot do this.\nNote that these designs are not overflow protected. Should the storage connected to hopper A fill up, items begin to flow into storage B. An overflow with a tileable design could cause similar issues with adjacent modules.\nPotions and shulker boxes.\nThis item filter uses certain &lt;a href=\"container\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;s that restrict the kind of &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s that can enter them. The two containers that do this are &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es. These allows potions and shulker boxes to be separated from other items. This could be handy to sort potions to a storage or shulker boxes to be unloaded.\nWith this design, items are inputed through &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; A. Any items that are allowed to enter are outputted through hopper B and items that are restricted through hopper C. If a brewing stand is used, potions are allowed to enter the stand and go to output B. If a shulker box is used, shulker boxes are prevented from entering and go to output C.\nThis design has a circuit delay of 5 ticks, which is slower than the speed of hoppers at 4 ticks. To ensure that every item gets an attempt to be pushed into the container, the input rate must be throttled to at one item per 5 redstone ticks. This could be done with a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; on a 5 tick &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen building, note that the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt; should be on a 3 tick delay. Hopper C is optional as it is used only to make the design item-safe. If using a brewing stand, &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; can be pushed into it but not removed. This usually shouldn't be a problem, however it may be desirable to fill the stand beforehand.\nThis design can also be used to filter for a &lt;a href=\"Music%20Disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt; by using a &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt;. Be aware that the music disc will be only removed from the jukebox after it finished playing. So it can filter regular items at 5 ticks, but music discs at a much slower pace.\nAlternate version.\nThis is a hopper-speed version of the above design, as shown by ilmango in a video about potion sorting. Inputs and outputs work the same way as in the 1-wide design, but no slow-down for the item input stream is required.\nHopper clocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Hopper\"&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt;s are commonly used to create clocks and delay circuits. Since items can travel back and forth between two hoppers, this is an easy way to make a clock. It is more &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; intensive, however.\nThe looped &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; clock works by having an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; traveling in a \"loop\" between the four hoppers. Whenever the &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; detects the item in a hopper, it turns on. This clock can be adjusted by adding or removing hoppers and items.\nThe delayed &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; clock works by taking turns completely emptying each hopper. When the hopper on the left completely empties, the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; turns on and the other hopper begins emptying. Note that exactly 5 stacks of items must be used with this design. To decrease the clock speed, use fewer stackable items. \nItem counter.\nThis is a mechanism that outputs a short redstone signal for every item that goes through the &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;. The mechanism slows down the items moving through the dropper and the &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; above to make the outputs comfortable to use for counting mechanisms.\nThe output of this counter can be used in combination with a counting mechanism such as the &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt; command in a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "64289", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=64289", "title": "Tutorials/Horses", "text": "This tutorial describes how to measure &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; attributes and breed them.\nMeasuring.\nHealth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; can be determined by looking at the &lt;a href=\"heads-up%20display\"&gt;heads-up display&lt;/a&gt; (HUD.) The saddle icons replacing your hunger bar while riding a horse is the horse\u2019s health bar. One heart equals two health points. When you ride a horse that has an odd number of health points, the last health point isn\u2019t shown on the HUD. Sometimes, horses have an odd number of health points; one method you can check if the horse has an even or odd number of health points/hitpoints is by hitting the horse and mounting the horse to check the hitpoints. If the HUD shows one less health point lost in health than the attack damage to the player, after the player attacks it, either with or without tools, the horse has 1 more health point than shown in the HUD and thus has an odd number of health points. If the HUD shows the exact amount lost in health than the total attack damage to the player after the player attacks it, the horse has an even number of health and it has exactly the number of health points/hitpoints as shown in the HUD. The horse might regenerate one health point right after you attack it, so you might want to try again. Heal the horse to full health and attack it again to check again if you\u2019re correct in checking if the horse has an odd or even number of hitpoints. For example, if a horse appears to have 22 hitpoints and you attack it, if the horse has lost one fewer health point than the damage you inflicted to the horse, and if the horse didn\u2019t regenerate, then it means that the horse actually has 23 hitpoints.\nJump Strength.\nThe internal value for jump strength for horses ranges from 0.4 to 1.0, which turns out to be approximately 1.11 to 5.3 blocks. A device to measure this can be quite simple: build walls of increasing heights parallel to each other, 3 blocks apart. To test horse jump strength, simply jump over the shortest wall to arrive at the next wall, and continue jumping until you can no longer jump. The last wall you were able to jump over indicates your horses maximum jump strength. &lt;a href=\"Slabs\"&gt;Slabs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snow%20layer\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to create non-full block increments.\nSpeed.\nSpeed proves to be the most difficult attribute to measure. The internal value for horses ranges from .1125 to .3375. A device to measure this can be constructed with the delay on &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s, using repeater locking. Create a very long chain of repeaters. \nUse a piston to hold back the horse. Connect &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; such that the piston releases the horse at the same time as a pulse starts down the repeater chain. At the end of a certain amount of blocks (~45 or so), add &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s, which are usually more consistent than tripwire. When these pressure plates are activated, use a long string of redstone to lock every repeater in the chain. This will \"freeze\" the chain and the pulse that started at the beginning will be frozen in place. You can mark the repeater where the pulse is frozen with a block. \nKeep in mind that you may need repeaters to lengthen the signal enough to lock the entire repeater chain, which will introduce a delay. You can account for this delay by adjusting the delay of the repeaters used for locking. As long as all the repeaters lock at the exact same time, the device will work. \nAlso keep in mind that for the results to be consistent, you must be going perfectly straight every time. You can do this by opening F3 mode and looking at the \"facing\" label, which shows a numerical value for your camera angle. You can temporarily decrease your mouse sensitivity through the controls to align yourself perfectly. \nThis device cannot measure the horse's exact speed in blocks/second, but can accurately measure its speed relative to other horses. Aside from server lag, it is incredibly consistent and can be used for accurate comparisons.\nTo convert a horse's internal speed to blocks/second, multiply the internal value by 42.16. This differs from the usual conversion of 43.17 blocks/sec, because horses do not move at their full internal speed.\nBreeding difficulty.\nIn current versions of the game, breeding two horses creates a new horse by averaging the two parent horses and then adding random variance. As a result, unlike in older versions of the game, horse breeding is not biased to the average, so it is easier to breed horses with attributes farther away from the average. It is also therefore possible to breed the perfect horse.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.19.4\"&gt;Java Edition 1.19.4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.19.70\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.19.70&lt;/a&gt;, breeding two horses created a new horse by averaging the two parent horses with a randomly generated horse. An average/arithmetic mean will always be less than the highest number being averaged, unless all numbers are identical. \nBy this logic, a perfect horse can only be bred if the randomly selected horse is perfect, and both parent horses are perfect, in which case the average of the three perfect horses will be a perfect horse. By extension, without two perfect horses, a perfect horse cannot be bred. \nAfter 3.13 blocks jump, 11 hearts, or 9.71 blocks/second speed, any future breeding will have a higher chance of producing a worse child than a better one. Because the range of horses that are better than a given horse gets narrower as the horse gets better, the likelihood of breeding a horse in that range of better horses also gets linearly narrower as the horse gets better, and as a result, the actual number of breed attempts necessary to likely get a better horse increases hyperbolically, until a fully perfect horse is unattainable, as shown in the table.\nThis graph shows what jump strength a player should expect their best horse to have after repeatedly breeding their two best horses together up to 1,000 times. The blue line shows the average jump strength of the best horse and the chances of the horse's jump strength being within the red lines is 95%.\nOptimal Breeding Scheme.\nThe optimal breeding scheme is that you start with two parent horses and breed them, and if the foal is stronger than the weakest parent horse, replace the weakest parent horse with the foal. Each time a foal is produced counts as \"1\" breeding attempt, regardless of whether it replaces a parent or is discarded. \nThis breeding scheme proves difficult to model mathematically because probabilities cascade with every attempt, so the following tables show consistent experimental data over 420,000 trials per table. If both parents have the attribute listed in the \"Both parents,\" the following lists the number of foals produced before the target is reached). \nNote that since the maximum value is impossible to achieve via breeding, it is omitted.

{"id": "15632", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15632", "title": "Tutorials/Hourly clock", "text": "This page contains instructions for a clock that signals you every (Minecraft) hour.\nDescription.\nAn hourly clock is a redstone intensive device that makes some indication of when an in-game hour has passed. This clock is just an extension of the standard 4 clock, except that this is a 75- or 150-clock. Note that one in-game hour is equal to 50 seconds of real-time. Also, this program is best done with inventory editing, due to the amount of resources it would take to make all the components.\nSupplies.\nThe basic supplies needed are:\nConstruction.\nBasic circuit.\nThis clock is your standard \"clock\" circuit, except it has a delay of 75-150 ticks, instead of 4-5. To start the circuit, use one of your redstone torches and a block of your choice to set up an inverter. Once that is done set a repeater either in range of the inverter's torch or with a wire running from the inverter to it. Now you have some options.\n75-clock.\nA 75-clock has half the repeaters of a full circuit, and one more inverter for the signal telling you that an hour has passed. After the basic circuit is built, add 74 more repeaters to the chain and connect then end of the chain back to the inverter. then, before the inverter, have a wire branch off and lead to another inverter, which in turn leads to a note block, or a sequence of note blocks. The second inverter is needed for this reason: As the clock only has 75 repeaters instead of 150, the note blocks need to go off only once every 2 cycles. And, a clock circuit has 2 sequences. The first is a power up, in which the repeaters all turn on; the second is a power down, where the repeaters all turn off. This cycle repeats endlessly unless interrupted by a broken chain or a save and quit. Sleeping in a bed can cause clocks to get off-time. A reset system that loses very little time can be made using pistons.\n150-clock.\nA 150-clock is what this writer and builder considers a \"full circuit\", meaning it uses the max amount of repeaters needed. Set up the basic circuit from 4.1. Then put on a chain of 149 more repeaters. Then at the end of the circuit, make a wire branch off to one side, and attach 2 note blocks or sequences of note blocks. But, put an inverter before one of the note block sequences. As explained in 4.2, a \"clock\" circuit has 2 sequences, running in an endless cycle. So the inverter in front of one note block sequence makes it so that every 150 repeater run, on or off, powers a note block sequence. This method requires more materials and time, but is more rewarding when finished and more fun for showing off to friends or in videos.\nConfiguration.\nAs there are 3 repeaters required to time a second, and 50 seconds in a Minecraft hour, there need to be repeaters configured in some way to make 500 ticks delay (1 tick = 0.1 seconds).\n75-clock configuration.\nTo set this clock to the right delay, set 50 of the repeaters to 4 ticks, and 25 to 2 ticks (or 62 repeaters to 4 ticks and one to 2 ticks.) This creates 25 seconds delay and, with the inverter setup on the chime, will sound the signal once every 50 seconds.\nUsing a Hopper system.\nUsing a hopper clock with 128 items will result in an output being sent out every 1 in game hour. It takes approximately 50.02 seconds for 128 items to travel from one hopper into another. Using this method results in a more compacted design for an hourly clock configuration can be done in any way. The video below shows how using droppers and comparators to display the hour. \nChimes.\nThe chime is the part of the clock that tells you when an hour has passed. It is made of note blocks, and can be anything from a single note to a complex melody. A good idea is to build your chime under the floor of your base so that it is heard from inside home.\nCool Ideas.\nThese are just some other cool ideas for an hourly clock.\nSuper Complex Clock.\nMake a giant complex housing 12 hourly clocks. Have each one chime the number of the hour, and rig the circuits so that each chime goes off 2 times a day. A T Flip-Flop counter and 4-bit to hexadecimal converters can be used to save space.\nMultibase Clock.\nIf you want your clock to sound in all your bases, but don't want to build different clocks all over the map, it is possible to connect all your bases to the clock. This will mean more delay from repeaters needed to carry power the distance from clock to base, but you can just say that there are minute time zone differences across the map (or make every base have an equal delay). Then just build more chimes in your bases. The inverters can also be connected to different parts of your central clock to offset the delay caused by the repeaters.\nClock Tower with 7-segment display.\nWhile this requires a lot of extra work (as well as extra Redstone) this clock could tell the time over great distances - at least far greater than 48 blocks.\nTimed Stations.\nLink a clock of any time period to a powered rails controlling minecarts within a station, making minecarts leave at uniform intervals. Additionally, the station can be placed nearby a visible clock display to determine accurate timetables and tell players when the next carts will leave or arrive."}

Some theorized methods are also discussed, such as RNG manipulation and self-sustaining N-core designs.\nGrowth mechanics.\nNatural generation.\nHuge fungi generate naturally in only 2 biomes situated in the Nether (DIM-1); the warped forest, where you can find warped huge fungi, and the crimson forest, where you can find crimson huge fungi. Huge fungi generate naturally only in their respective biome.\nUnlike player grown huge fungi, naturally generated huge fungi have a 1/10 chance of growing with a 3x3 plus shape of stem blocks with a distribution of air and stem blocks in the corner of the plus shape, rather than the 1\u00d71 column of stem blocks that always generate with player grown variants. This increased trunk width does not increase the thickness of the surrounding wart block layers, but it does allow for a ring value of 4 which means that the bounding box of the leaves expands by another block. \nIf a player applies bone meal to a fungus, and if that fungus is directly above its respective nylium block (e.g. warped fungus on warped nylium), there is be a 40% chance for it to grow. Using bone meal on a fungus 4 times increases the chance to 87.04%, and 99.998% within 20 attempts.\nA fungus plant (the 'sapling' of huge fungi), does not grow by itself through random ticks, unlike traditional saplings.\nWhen a fungus grows, it doesn't check for blocks above or around it, or which dimension it\u2019s in, this allows for pistons to be situated adjacent to the trunk, allowing for extremely fast cycle speeds.\nA fungus does not grow if it is obscured by the height limit or if it is placed outside of the world.\nTo determine the height of a huge fungus, a random integer is picked between 4 and 13 [inclusive], then there is a 1/12 chance for that integer to be doubled. This integer is the height of the trunk in stem blocks, meaning that the tallest tree can be 27 blocks tall (as the top is covered in hat blocks) with a 1/120 chance of generating.\nNow the process of generating the hat of the farm is quite complex in comparison\nFirst of all a hat height (h) value is found using the same equation for the height of the tree. This value is later used to determine multiple other variables that we\u2019ll touch onto shortly\nThe first of which is the hat\u2019s height off the ground (i) which is found from taking the minimum value of either a random integer up to (1 + h/3) + 5, or h.\nThe height of the hat from bottom to top (j) is found by h - i\nThe ring value (l) at a specific height (k) is equal to 2 if k &lt; h \u2013 a random integer up to 3, otherwise it is equal to 1, also if i &gt; 8 and k &lt; j + 4 then l = 3. This statement allows for 1 3-wide layer of a huge fungus to form, which can occur only in trees that are at least 8 blocks off the ground. While it may look like some huge fungi have more than 1 layer of 3 wide growth, these additional layers are actually vines which are generated separately from the \u2018brim\u2019 (3 wide layer).\nThe height of each peak of a huge fungus is found by analyzing the value of a random integer up to 3, which was housed in the earlier equation used for calculating \u2018l\u2019.\nTo further our discussion on huge fungus generation we need to split it up into 4 distinct zones:\nInternal: redstone blocks\nExternal: white stained glass\nCorners: yellow stained glass\nVines: lime stained glass\nWe ignore vines for the time being, they are here just to illustrate where the bottom of the hat begins.\nThis truth table demonstrates the possible outcomes for a particular block\nDispenser grown.\nIf bone meal is placed inside of a dispenser, and then that dispenser is pointing into a fungus plant on its respective nylium block, then there is a 40% chance of it growing per attempt. Dispensers can be used to automatically grow the fungus plant, and up to 5 can surround a fungus plant, allowing for fungi to grow at 5hz on average.\nNote: There is no diminish in return with bone meal efficiency, and dispensers used.\nHarvesting methods.\nThere are a multitude of ways in which huge fungi can be farmed, here are some of the more common and technical methods.\nManual harvesting.\nDuring the early game where redstone resources are limited, certain manual harvesting methods are utilised. While it is recommended that a player gathers resources to make a farm, rather than spending that time manually farming, certain manual harvesting methods have arisen.\nNether exploration.\nCollecting huge fungi blocks in their own biomes is a great way to collect a sufficient amount of wood and decorative blocks early game.\nThe fastest way to use this method is to make an efficiency 5 netherite axe and hoe, then travel to the nether and fly around using an elytra until you come across a warped or crimson forest. In a crimson forest, be sure to bring warped fungus to repel hoglins (must be planted, with an area of effect of 15 blocks).\nAfter planting a fungus, build a 3x3 platform of gold blocks with a beacon on top for the haste 1 effect. Fly up from the beacon base and destroy the netherrack obstructing the beacon beam. The haste I effect reduce the mining time per stem block by 2gt. This also helps when mining wart blocks and shroomlights, as when combined with an efficiency III netherite or diamond hoe, you can mine each block in 1gt. Setting up and removing a 1 layer beacon in the nether takes on average 600gt, so this beacon method is effective only if you are mining more than 300 stem blocks, or if it is necessary for instant mining more than 38 blocks.\nOnce the beacon is set up, you can begin harvesting trees. Huge Fungi normally generate together in clumps. Climb to the top using twisting vines, and then mine from the top down. Be sure to use a hoe to mine the leaf blocks (wart blocks and shroomlights), and your axe to harvest the stems.\nTo marginally increase speed, carry with you a few shulker boxes of unbreaking 3, efficiency 5, gold axes to reduce the mining speed by 1gt per stem block.\nGreenhouse.\nPlace 2 nylium in a 3x3 grid pattern with 6 blocks in between each one. Then construct a water stream platform beneath it. Have the water stream funnel the items into a chest storage, connected by a hopper. To use the manual farm, place down a fungus on each nylium block, then grow the fungi using bone meal. Now climb to the top using ladders, a bubble column, scaffolding or vines, and mine out the huge fungi from the top down. After harvesting the huge fungi, collect any items that didn't drop into the water stream below.\nBlock chamber/storage.\nBuild a traditional semi-automatic huge fungi farm, and connect the block stream to a block chamber. When you would like to harvest the blocks, climb to the top of the storage and mine them out using haste 2 and an efficiency 5 netherite axe and hoe.\nSemi-automatic.\nSemi-automatic harvesting is when everything in a farm is self-sufficient except for the input.\nIn the case of semi-automatic huge fungi farms, this would be the placement of fungi plants and often, but not always, supplying it with bone meal.\nPositives.\nFast rates, inexpensive, lag friendly on small scales, produces every block from the tree (wart blocks, shroomlights and weeping vines included)\nNegatives.\nUsually quite block inefficient, consumes high amounts of bone meal although at an efficiency at least 12x that of playerless designs\nFungus farming.\nUsing mud, both the fastest and simplest automatic fungus farm design can be created as hoppers placed beneath the mud instantly pick up the items removing the need to pause the farm to collect them\nSelf-sustaining.\nOnce built, a Self-sustaining Huge Fungi Farm can run without player interaction as long as it is kept loaded.\nPositives.\nCan run in loaded chunks without the need for a player to plant any fungus, can generate a surplus of bone meal\nNegatives.\nSlow, more expensive to build, laggy, and limited (if any) wart blocks and shroomlights are produced, often unreliable.\nGrowing area.\nMax 5x5 area of nylium to grow fungus plants using bone meal.\nFlying machine.\nFlying Machine pushing into a TNT dropping zone.\nBlast chamber.\nDirectly Above, Piston column pushes away trunk, while TNT dupers blow up the huge fungus from above\nN-core.\nTheoretically, the fastest way to harvest huge fungi\nRNG Huge Fungus farming.\nManipulate RNG to generate a 9 fungus (the max possible per bonemeal) on a 5x5 platform of nylium, which all grow on the first bone meal attempt to produce the largest huge fungi possible (7x7x27)"}

{"id": "22735", "revid": "53068243", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22735", "title": "Tutorials/Hunger management", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; is a feature in Minecraft that requires the player to eat in order to survive. It does not affect the player in &lt;a href=\"spectator\"&gt;spectator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; modes, or on Peaceful difficulty on any game mode, and is represented by a bar next to the health bar. As this bar drains away, various unpleasant things happen:\nThere is also a hidden, secondary form of hunger called \"&lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Mechanics\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;\", which is always exhausted before hunger. Eating food will replenish various amounts of both hunger and saturation. \nThe depletion of saturation and hunger is managed by way of another hidden variable called \"exhaustion\". This variable allows accumulating small fractional costs until either the saturation or hunger gauge can be reduced by a full point.\nConserving energy.\nSeveral techniques can reduce your need for food:\nEffects of hunger.\nThere are three hunger variables you need to worry about: The visible hunger bar, and two hidden values which are called \"saturation\" and \"exhaustion\". Hunger and saturation range from 0 to 20 (hunger is shown as ), but saturation cannot exceed your hunger (for example, if you have hunger, you can have at most 17 saturation). Exhaustion ranges from 0 to 4. As you move about, fight, &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;, \"etc\", exhaustion accumulates. In order, common activities that will exhaust you the most are: Healing damage (most of a food point per health point), a \"sprint jump\", sprinting any distance, attacking monsters or receiving damage (from any source), and jumping. More specific values can be found in the table.\nWhen exhaustion reaches 4, it resets to 0, and saturation decreases by 1. When saturation reaches 0, the hunger bar will start to visibly ripple, and hunger starts to drain away in place of saturation. (As a result, a way to visualize saturation is to think of it as an \"extra hunger bar\" above your hunger bar, that gets deducted before hunger at the same speed.) When your hunger drops below , you stop &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; automatically. When it is at or below, you will be unable to sprint. Also, when your hunger drops to , you start to take &lt;a href=\"starvation\"&gt;starvation&lt;/a&gt; damage. On Easy mode, starvation damage will not lower you below , while on Normal mode, it can reduce you to . On Hard mode, starvation can kill you. \nWhile eating is essential to keep your health up, it is not always needed. On Easy and Normal modes, the health bar will stop decreasing before death, so if the player takes care not to take any further damage, they can continue playing normally. Obviously, this is much riskier in multiplayer servers with PvP (player vs player), as well as adventuring.\nWith the exception of s, s, s and , you cannot eat when your hunger is at max; when you do eat, each food item restores a specific amount of hunger and saturation. The following section will elaborate on the strategies on effective management of both hunger and saturation.\nFood.\nFood are a specific type of items that can be eaten by pressing the \"use\" button, when your hunger bar is not at maximum. Food restores both the hunger bar and saturation, with different foods filling different amounts of each. You can obtain food through &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, searching &lt;a href=\"chest%20loot\"&gt;naturally generated chests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;, and killing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Many foods can be &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;cooked (smelted)&lt;/a&gt; for better effect. Burning mobs is an easier method to obtain meat without the need of &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoods can be divided into five tiers, according to how much saturation they restore per hunger unit. They are known as nourishment values, and the saturation one gets from any food is defined as nourishment times hunger. Knowing this, there are roughly two ways to approach the issue of hunger and saturation. Players can either try to eat efficiently, meaning using as little food items as possible, or try to eat expediently, meaning to stave off hunger as fast as they can.\nThe efficiency approach requires the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to avoid wasting hunger or saturation. Meaning, never eat any food that would \"overfill\" the hunger bar, avoiding to waste saturation points by going over the limit (the hunger value after consuming the food). By doing this, one will use every piece of food to its maximum potential. However, one needs to use more time to tend to their hunger bar, and remember the current saturation value. Therefore, this is ill-suited for healing in emergencies, and should probably be done when safe and/or low on foodstuff.\nThe expediency approach, on the other hand, doesn't mind wasting a bit of the food here and there: Eat the most filling and nourishing food until full, and be done with it. If food supply is not an issue, if the player requires imminent healing, or if the player simply wants to save time, this is an appealing option.\nA few foods also have &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;special effects&lt;/a&gt;, mostly bad. While the can heal you, other foods can poison you (losing hit points), or give you food poisoning (draining your hunger bar). For these, there is , obtained by using a on a . While milk doesn't restore hunger or saturation, it does wipe away any status effects that the player currently has, so use it carefully. Another option are s, which only remove , and do have some food value.\nSupernatural.\nCrafted with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, these have a nourishment of 2.4.\nCooked food.\nThese have a nourishment of 1.6 \u2014 the most nourishing of the ordinary foods.\nNormal.\nThese have a nourishment of 1.2 \u2014 the staple foods, cheap and fairly nourishing.\nLow.\nThese have a nourishment of 0.6, these are useful for achieving a full bar of both hunger and saturation when the current hunger bar is almost empty, if eaten with foods of higher tier of nourishment.\nPoor.\nWith a nourishment value of 0.2, these foods will provide almost no saturation. They are basically snacks that will rarely ever overfill the saturation bar.\nEmergency measures.\nIf your hunger meter is dropping and you have \"no\" food in hand, there are a few emergency measures you can take, depending on available resources."}

Ice naturally occurs in snowy and cold &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, and ice farming relies on the freezing of water from an &lt;a href=\"Water%23Source_blocks\"&gt;infinite water source&lt;/a&gt;.\nConfiguration.\nAn ice farm consists of a large flat pan, open to the sky in an icy biome, which contains an infinite &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source. Two diagonally adjacent walls will have outgrowths protecting strategic water blocks from freezing, causing a fully mined-out farm to refill with fresh water source blocks. Using &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; sources to protect these blocks is not recommended, due to the melt/refreeze cycle this would cause. An ice farm's footprint is 3 layers deep, and however large you want the ice layer to be. The configuration for a 7x7 farm is shown below. (Note: If you want to make the farm larger than 7x7, make an X shape with the covered water sources.)\nMake sure not to allow &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s or other obstacles to overhang the farm, and keep light sources at a distance, otherwise, some or all of the farm's area will not freeze. Ice Is only able to form if the water being frozen is adjacent to a block. It is important to make sure that the edges of your farm have a non waterlogged blocks or are able to generate ice. Otherwise, your water will never freeze once youve removed all the ice. A usefull tip would be to place occasional blocks in the center of your farm, if you are making it in a large scale, to replenish the ice faster from the center as well as the sides it generates from.\nUse.\nTo harvest, stand in the ice pan, and mine ice blocks with a Silk Touch tool, taking care to not mine the dirt. The covered water source blocks will then spread to refill the farm, and you simply wade around to collect the harvested ice. &lt;a href=\"Boots\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Strider\"&gt;Depth Strider&lt;/a&gt; are useful for moving through the water faster.\nCrafting Packed Ice and Blue Ice Blocks.\nAn ice farm can be used to craft &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; blocks, by using the following crafting recipes:\nSpleef.\nA large ice farm can double as a self-resetting &lt;a href=\"spleef\"&gt;spleef&lt;/a&gt; arena. Not using Silk Touch tools creates a variant where the broken blocks might reform during play. Using Silk Touch creates a more conventional game, and also harvests the ice. In this case, the arena will not reset properly until all the ice is mined, or perhaps melted with a grid of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;s. A farm used for spleef should probably cover its water sources with an unbroken protective lip rather than alternating blocks, as they might snag players otherwise.\nOther Harvesting Methods.\nIce could theoretically be generated in the same way as &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; using two water source blocks, even to the extent that it could be &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;-driven and used to build self-repairing structures. However, ice freezes slowly enough that an absurdly long clock cycle or a &lt;a href=\"BUD\"&gt;BUD&lt;/a&gt; (Block Update Detector), such as an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;, would be needed. Either way, it would serve as a very impractical toy. You can also make it high in the air to freeze the water."}

However, with this special technique, you can create explosions even though you're in water!\nExplanation.\nThe reason that this works is that the TNT does not actually explode inside water, but inside the sand/gravel block. When the TNT is ignited, it becomes an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;, meaning another block such as sand or gravel can fall in and occupy its space. Normally when a TNT explodes underwater, the high &lt;a href=\"blast%20resistance\"&gt;blast resistance&lt;/a&gt; of water shields adjacent blocks from explosion, But when it explodes inside sand or gravel which has a low blast resistance, the explosion is no longer shielded and can destroy adjacent blocks.

{"id": "28207", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28207", "title": "Tutorials/Installing a snapshot", "text": "It is possible to play a future snapshot in Minecraft, as well as previous versions that have been released, and it is quite easy too. However, many people don't know how to use or install them. This tutorial shows you how to install and play any type of snapshot, development version, or previously released version that is available in the launcher, as well as snapshots that are no longer available in the launcher.\nAvailable in the launcher.\nTo play a snapshot, first, download the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20launcher\"&gt;Minecraft launcher&lt;/a&gt;. The download link is available at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//minecraft.net/download\"&gt;minecraft.net/download&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy default, you can choose and play release versions of \"Minecraft\", e.g. 1.14.x, 1.15.x, 1.16.x and so forth. Also available are the development snapshots for the upcoming release, or for the most recent release if snapshots haven't begun yet for an upcoming release. Usually, only the last snapshot in per week is available, except for the most recent week, in which they're usually all available. Keep in mind that the exact list of snapshots available may vary, as it is at the discretion of Mojang which snapshots are listed. Snapshots are newer versions that have not been released as an update and are still a work in progress. Players can view said snapshots as well.\nTo play a snapshot or previous version of Minecraft, go into the \"Installations\" tab and click the \"Snapshots\" option in the top-right corner.\nThis allows you to play both the latest release versions and development versions by switching profiles on the launcher. Keep in mind that \"Minecraft\" doesn't care about save data compatibility, so it is advised to use a temporary world when you test development builds (note that it is possible to enable snapshots without changing the game directory, however, separate game directories are a good practice to keep your worlds separated and prevent compatibility issues from destroying your maps).\nNo longer available in the launcher.\nEach time the launcher closes, it automatically removes snapshots from its \"Use version\" list that don't belong to its current set of snapshots, which, as explained above, is usually the most recent set of snapshots, and usually only the last one per week. Due to this, older snapshots become unavailable from that list over time, but the launcher can certainly still play them. Though the launcher's list is kept short, Mojang doesn't remove old snapshot files from the location on the web that the launcher uses. So here's how to do this:\nStep 1: Navigate to the specific snapshot page on this wiki, which can be accessed via the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20version%20history/Development%20versions\"&gt;snapshot history&lt;/a&gt; page, and download the client .jar and .json on the right-hand side of the page.\nNote: on most web browsers, the .jar file downloads automatically when opening the link. However, on most web browsers, clicking the link to the .json file will show the JSON's contents instead of automatically downloading it. If this is the case, right-click anywhere on the page and choose \"Save page as\" or something similar. It will automatically save it as a .json file.\nStep 2: Go to your codice_1 folder:\nStep 3: Create a folder with the same name as the snapshot, for instance \"12w15a\" or \"14w02a\".\nStep 4: Move the codice_5 and codice_6 files that you downloaded into that folder.\nStep 5: Rename both the codice_5 and codice_6 files to the same name as the snapshot (for example: 14w02a.jar and 14w02a.json).\nStep 6: Start the launcher, then follow the instructions from the previous section. You will be able to select the version you downloaded.\nCongratulations, you have installed a snapshot!"}

It involves clever uses of BUD-powered pistons.\nHow To Make One.\nThe most common instant repeater requires a pulse at least four redstone ticks long. It is made by having a redstone signal powering a block that powers a sticky piston on top of it, facing the direction of the rest of the signal. This sticky piston has a redstone block on its face. The block that is powered is also attached to a sticky piston, but it's facing the opposite direction and is diagonally below the redstone block, such that the block can power the top piston when the bottom piston is extended. The rest of the signal is powered when the redstone block is extended forward.\nIt works by BUD-powering the bottom piston. When the pulse is received, the top piston starts moving. This updates the bottom piston, causing it to retract at exactly the same time as the top one is extending, thus depowering the top piston. This 0-ticks the top piston. The redstone block is now powering the bottom piston, so it extends. The block on its face comes back to its original position, but the start of the redstone line is still powered. This powers the top piston, and retracts the redstone block, depowering the redstone line at the end and BUD-powering the bottom piston. In real time, it looks like the contraption does an \"inchworm.\" This produces pulses that are two redstone ticks long, which means that they can be chained together.\nUses.\nAny time a redstone signal needs to get somewhere instantly, an instant repeater can come in useful. Here is a common scenario:\nIf you want to make a zero-tick door and there's not enough signal strength use this.\nYou have several flying machines that all need to move at the same time, or else they will get stuck to each other and break. This situation can be resolved by starting them all up at exactly the same time, using redstone. Instead of using an ordinary repeater to keep the signal going (which adds 1 tick of delay, possibly breaking the machines), use an instant repeater to ensure that they stay synchronized."}

It was made in two different designs: one design that only worked when switching the input from on to off, and another that only worked when switching the input from off to on (this design didn't always work).\nThe First Logic Gates.\nTavirider was the first person to start making instant logic gates. He did this by making a clock, and the different variables were on, or pulsing. So he could make simple logic gates. Check out this video for more info.\nBasic Mechanics.\nThe Redstone Instant Repeater.\nThis new design of an instant repeater was released by SethBling via YouTube. It is somewhat compact, and it could repeat the signal instantly. It did not send pulses like the previous repeaters, so when the input is off the output is off. When the input is on, the output is on.\nInstant Logic Gates.\nNOT Gate (\u00ac).\nA device that inverts the input, as such it is also called an \"Inverter\" Gate. It is very similar to the repeater, just it has a few things switched around.\nOR Gate.\nA device where the output is on when at least one of the inputs are on. This is very simple. All you do is combine the two input lines.\nNOR Gate.\nA device where the output is off when at least one of the inputs are on. Almost the same as OR Gate, except here the player combined the lines before an inverter.\nAND Gate.\nA device that requires both inputs to be ON for the output to be ON. Basically an AND gate is an inverted signal hooked up to a NOR Gate. Easy to make and VERY big, but instant.\nNAND Gate.\nA device that requires both inputs to be ON for the output to be OFF. Basically an AND gate is an inverted signal hooked up to a NOR Gate, then into an inverter. Easy to make and VERY big, but instant.\nT Flip-Flop.\nA memory device that switches between on and off with each pulse. In simple terms, you can make a button work like a lever. Very compact design, 100% instant, but works on &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23falling%20edge\"&gt;falling edge&lt;/a&gt; of the input. To make it work on the rising edge, put an inverter before and after the T Flip-Flop."}

{"id": "109510", "revid": "37816397", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=109510", "title": "Tutorials/Iron golem farming", "text": "Iron golem farming uses &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Village%20mechanics\"&gt;village mechanics&lt;/a&gt; to produce &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"poppies\"&gt;poppies&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, an iron golem farm is a player-constructed village in which golems are spawned and then either killed immediately or moved to a holding cell outside the village boundary for later killing. Iron golem farming is preferable to other methods of iron farming from &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s due to a much higher chance of iron dropping and therefore much higher quantities of iron.\nJava Edition.\n, a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; can attempt to spawn an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; while not having a golem alive within the box of radius 16 blocks around the villager and more than 30 seconds has passed.\nAn &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; needs an available volume in which to spawn. There must be at least 3 transparent blocks above the spawning surface, and that surface must be solid and flat (but not a bottom slab).\nZombies and pillagers nearby increase the spawn rate of iron golems. If a zombie/pillager is seen by villagers, they panic and increase the rate of spawn attempts. Zombies are easier to use as scaring mobs than pillagers, as you'd need a disarmed pillager (one without crossbow) for the farm to work, although pillagers have a much larger range to scare villagers than zombies, also they don't burn in sunlight unlike zombies and won't hurt you if their crossbow breaks.\nNether portals can also be used to increase rates, since the iron golem cap instantly resets when it's teleported to the Nether. Aside portals, one can also construct a chute where the golems fall into after spawning, which clears the mob cap. This is more reliable than nether portals.\nBedrock Edition.\nSpawning requirements.\nVillages attempt to spawn iron golems around the village center when the following requirements are met:\nSimulation Distance.\nTo clarify, iron golems can spawn as long as the player is within simulation range of the village's boundaries; being near the village center is not necessary. Simulation distance remains consistent both horizontally and vertically. The formula for calculating simulation range is as follows:\nformula_1\nFrequency of Spawns.\nThere is a 1/700 chance of an iron golem spawn attempt during each game tick when these conditions are met. This averages to one spawn attempt every 35 seconds. However, the spawn attempt only succeeds in spawning a golem if the game finds a spawnable spot.\nSpawnable Space.\nTo search for a spawnable spot during a spawn attempt, the game checks 10 random X, Y, Z coordinates in the 16\u00d76\u00d716 volume around the village center. The spawn attempt succeeds if a chosen coordinate meets the following conditions:\nIf these conditions are met but there is a partial or transparent block at the chosen coordinate, then the iron golem may appear to spawn on top of the partial or transparent block. This gives the appearance that iron golems can spawn on top of normally non-spawnable blocks like bottom slabs, carpets, and glass.\nIron Harvesting Rate.\nNote that based on the search algorithm, at best only 98.3% of spawn attempts will succeed. Therefore, it is impossible to build a farm in which iron golems spawns occur on average every 35 seconds. Since iron golems drop 4 ingots on average, the highest possible average ingots per hour is 4 * 3600 / 35 * .983 = 404. Actual rates of farms typically fall in range of 240-400. (See Maximizing Rates below.)\nVillage center.\nA village center is the northwest bottom corner of a point-of-interest (POI) block, which can be a bed pillow, bell, or workstation. The village center always begins as the pillow of the first bed linked to a villager. It can shift when a villager links to a new POI or unlinks from a POI after three failed attempts to pathfind to it, or after removal of either the villager or the POI from the village. The game attempts to make the village center correspond roughly to the geometric center of all linked POI in a village, but there is randomness involved and shifts can seem erratic.\nControlling the village center is often the most difficult part of designing, building, and maintaining an iron golem farm. The center is important because it determines where structures must be built to spawn, contain, and transport the iron golems. Iron golems can spawn in a 16\u00d712\u00d716 volume around the village center point; that is, a spawning platform should extend 8 blocks in all horizontal directions from northwest bottom corner of the POI block, and can be in a vertical range from 5 blocks above the top to 6 blocks below the bottom of the POI block. For a chosen horizontal spawn location, the golem spawns on the highest valid surface within the spawn volume at that location.\nTo protect against center shifting and also capture all available iron golem spawn attempts, farm designs commonly cluster beds at the center of the farm and have the spawn platform(s) extend 8 blocks out from the furthest bed pillows in each direction.\nIt is best to avoid using bells in iron golem farms because villagers try to pathfind to bells at gathering time, fail, and then unlink from the bell, causing the village center to shift. A bell does \"not\" define a village center. The game also does not indicate which villager's bed defines the village center.\nFarm designs that do not allow villagers to access their beds may experience center-shifting and possibly lower spawning rates unless they prevent villagers from unlinking from the beds at night. To prevent a villager from unlinking, you can either place water on its feet, or prevent it from attempting to pathfind by surrounding it with blocks.\nMaximizing rates.\nThe rate of iron ingot production in an iron golem farm is determined by three factors: the number of spawnable blocks, the number of villagers, and the average lifetime of each iron golem. The most efficient farms achieve rates around 400 ingots/hour.\nThe maximum number of spawnable blocks in a farm is 512. This is achieved by two minimum 16\u00d716 solid block platforms centered horizontally at the village center, with one platform four blocks under the village center, and the other platform a block above the village center. In farms designed for maximum rates, the beds are usually arranged tightly around the horizontal center on the Y-level just below the upper spawn platform. This allows iron golems to be transported underneath the beds and ensures that the Y-level of the center does not shift. With 512 spawnable blocks, 98.3% of spawn attempts can succeed.\nIncreasing the number of villagers allows additional spawn attempts to succeed during the time it takes to transport and kill existing iron golems. In a farm using water to transport iron golems and lava blades to kill them, increasing the population from 10 to 20 increases rates by about 33%, and increasing the population from 20 to 30 increases rates by about 5%.\nThe average lifetime of iron golems depends on transport time and kill time. Most farms use water to transport and lava blades (lava suspended on collisionless blocks such as signs or open fence gates) to kill. It is also possible to use rail systems, although rail systems are likely slower than water. Other kill methods such as magma blocks, skeleton arrows, and trident killers are slower than lava. However, trident killers can kill faster than lava if the tridents are enchanted with Impaling V and the iron golems are kept in contact with water. Note that if you use a trident killer, you do not gain experience, and you cannot use &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;.\nSurvival mode build: Iron golem village.\nA village can be converted into an iron golem farm that requires no exotic materials, but patience and time to set up. It can be constructed early on in the game for an early source of iron, up to 200 ingots/hour with no optimization techniques; not the maximum rate but sufficient for any early-game iron needs.\nThe village functions normally and produces iron at the same time, without needing to transport, enslave, or imprison villagers. The villagers are free to roam and work, and every night they make their way over the bridges into the cobblestone bunker to sleep. The building has 20 beds in two floors, with a stairway between the floors and a path around the beds. \nThe farm requires some basic tools: a bucket for both water and lava, one hopper, a large amount of torches, and several stone or iron pickaxes. Collecting all the required building materials is time consuming: primarily wood, wool, and cobblestone. It is best to collect your materials far away from the village. Trying to gather all the materials too near the village risks attracting zombies that can kill the villagers. You can estimate the number of fences you need by walking around the village perimeter; it is likely to require at least 4 stacks of fences (with a few fence gates) to make the village escape-proof and entry-proof, and 3 stacks of torches for adequate lighting.\nAn L-shaped village works best, with the farm built in the crook of the \"L\" so that the beds are sufficiently near the villagers' job sites for the villagers to pathfind between their beds and their job sites. The biome should be reasonably flat, like &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst fence in the village and light it up, and add a few beds to encourage the villagers to breed while building the farm, which will take a while. Remove any high blocks near the outside of the fence, to prevent hostile mobs from entering the fenced-in area. Once the village is fenced in, you don't have to worry about villagers interfering with your work, which happens outside the fence in the crook of the \"L\". Proper lighting also prevents any hostile mobs from spawning in the village.\nPreparation matters. All it takes is one zombie to get into the community bedroom and you end up with a village full of zombie villagers. Moving the beds into the sleeping bunker to start the farm is the last step!\nConstruction involves building the sleeping bunker with two floors (and a stairway between them) with 10 beds on each floor, at least one doorway to a bridge that rises up high enough to fit an iron golem underneath (the screenshot shows a bunker with two bridges for easier pathfinding), and making 7-8 blocks of spawning area all around the bunker. The lowest part of the spawning platform should be less than 6 blocks below the top floor of the bunker; starting level with the lowest floor would be sufficient. The rest is just water management and building channels to guide the iron golems into a killing area, which requires a block of lava, a hopper, and a collection chest.\nHostile mobs cannot spawn inside the fenced-in village, but they are free to wander into the farm from outside the fence (or even spawn on top of the sleeping bunker), and get swept into the mob grinder underground. This happens seldom, but you may find an occasional bone, arrow, rotten flesh, and other odd items in the collection chest.\nVideos.\nBedrock Edition.\nThe Farm below can be further upgraded to a scale of your satisfaction.\nBelow is a variation of an Iron Farm with a Villager Trading Hall, a Villager Crop Farm, a Villager Breeder and a Villager Curer implemented."}
{"id": "85103", "revid": "51446746", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=85103", "title": "Tutorials/Island survival", "text": "An \"island\" in \"Minecraft\" is typically any collection of terrain that is above sea level, is not too large, and is surrounded by water on all sides. Islands often generate in relatively remote areas and are often cut off from the mainland. If a player happens to spawn on one of these, they may be faced with a major resource shortage.\nAn immediate option would be to simply create a new world, but for many players the challenge is appealing. \nKnow your environment.\nIslands often generate in remote areas. Often, no other land is visible, and the island you are on may host just one &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, or just a few trees. If the island has no trees and the &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Chest\"&gt;Bonus Chest&lt;/a&gt; option is turned off, you may want to start a new world, or try to find a different island, unless you want the challenge.\nWhen on an island, few to no &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s may be present. It may be worth keeping animals alive for their resources. For example:\nWhen on small island in a deep ocean, ironically, you don't have to worry much about monsters if the island is small enough to be within the minimum 24-block spawning range. Drowned may spawn in the ocean but they typically don't emerge from the water in a deep ocean. This is the situation with the \"Ocean Monument Ahead\" seed in the Bedrock Edition &lt;a href=\"seed%20picker\"&gt;seed picker&lt;/a&gt;. With larger islands, it is a good idea to light it up as soon as possible to prevent monsters from spawning on it.\nAs soon as you get the chance, look around and out to sea: are you on a solitary island or is the island you are on part of a larger group of islands, an island chain or archipelago?\nIf the former is the case, then you should focus on what the island you are on has to offer and try to establish yourself.\nIf the latter is the case, however, then it may (depending on resources, time and how far apart the islands are) be worth taking a look at what the other islands have to offer as well. They could contain what your island lacks that you need to survive.\nSurviving your first night.\nBefore doing anything else, go to the nearest tree and collect the wood. If it is the only tree on the island, harvest the leaves first, because they drop &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s that can be planted to get more wood. Plant the saplings immediately after harvesting the wood. This is vital for obtaining more wood and more saplings. Oak trees can even yield apples, which can be used as an early food source.\nIf the island has any flowers, try putting oak, mangrove or birch saplings next to a flower, to give the sapling a chance of growing with a &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;, which can be useful as a source of &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;. Trees that don't grow bee nests can be harvested again.\nBecause resources are low, craft only a minimal number of essential things.\nFood.\nWith good strategic resource management, there should be little fear of running out of food. To conserve energy the first few days, be conservative with moving around, and avoid sprinting and jumping altogether, if possible.\nFood from plant sources.\nWithout animals, there are ways to get food:\nFood from animals.\nIf there is a chicken on the island and you are not desperate for food, collect its &lt;a href=\"Egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; as they are laid. Each egg thrown has a chance of producing another chicken. This is one way to have a supply of chickens for food. &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Chicken\"&gt;Raw chicken&lt;/a&gt; does need cooking, however, as it can inflict &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28effect%29\"&gt;food poisoning&lt;/a&gt;.\nA sustainable food supply from animals requires breeding, and that requires farming, as described above. Once a producing farm is set up, however, eating the crop-based food is often a more efficient use of it. Animals are useful for other reasons, such as a source of &lt;a href=\"Milk%20Bucket\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; to remove Poison and other bad effects, or &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; for some armor.\nIf there are islands nearby, use some wood to build a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; to travel to other islands to find animals. An animal can be led into a boat by holding appropriate food (any type of seeds for &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;, wheat for &lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, and potatoes, carrots or beetroots for &lt;a href=\"Pig\"&gt;pigs&lt;/a&gt;).\nA &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; is useful for pulling an animal into a boat. Leads are easily obtained by killing the &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s that regularly spawn on or near the island. Because you have no emeralds, and there is no penalty for killing the trader, leads and llamas are the only things of value that a wandering trader can provide. They drop two leads when killed. These leads can be used to move animals.\nShelter/Housing.\nConstructing a shelter.\nAfter collecting wood to create planks, build a crafting table in a convenient place. A door and wooden pickaxe are the essential things required for now.\nIf the island has a steep slope, or wall of dirt anywhere, it is simplest just to dig a cave into it, and place a door at the entrance. If possible, have the entrance face east so that the sunrise is visible through the door.\nFor a shelter above ground, build a minimal one from dirt or sand, possibly only two blocks high inside, and place the door in the entrance. You'll eventually be mining anyway, so if you have enough materials, make room for a crafting table, a chest, and a mineshaft or stairway leading down.\nBe sure you have nothing overhanging the entrance (no tree leaves, no other blocks), otherwise zombies can gather by your door during the night and be protected from sunlight when daytime comes, trapping you in your shelter. Without any overhang for protection, zombies burn up after sunrise.\nEnter your shelter at sunset. Once you are in your shelter, start making some basic tools on your crafting table:\nIf you want to expand the shelter, simply dig down a few blocks and dig out rooms underground. Add ladders to the vertical shaft to get back up and add torches as necessary and as resources permit. Even if it is not needed, it is generally recommended for one to dig underground anyway so as to find &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; to make a furnace and to obtain another building material so as to avoid wasting wood. Make a stone &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, and optionally a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;, if you are in a position to start farming.\nOnce you are in a position to build an actual home base, note that islands often have limited space available. Therefore, you don't have much room to maneuver with if you build your house on the island itself, especially if it is a small island. A better approach is to build your base underground. Alternatively, you can build a platform on the water by placing a block on top of kelp to start the platform, then build your house from that starting point it and connect it to the island with a bridge.\nSleeping.\nIslands often have no &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, so if it is impractical to find a sheep on another nearby island and shear it for &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, you can still get wool by crafting it from four pieces of &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; obtained from killing &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. Once you have three &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, you can make a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; with three wooden planks.\nIt is advisable, however, to prioritize string to make a fishing rod for a reliable food supply before hunting down spiders to craft wool for a bed. It is often more efficient to find a sheep on another island. Occasionally a sheep may spawn on your island while you are away from it, or while you're mining deep underground.\nMining.\nTo make a compact mine, craft &lt;a href=\"ladders\"&gt;ladders&lt;/a&gt; with sticks, and start digging down. Optionally, you can make a staircase, so that you don't need ladders to get back up. To look for a cave, listen for the sounds of &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, and go toward the sound (it might be helpful if you turn subtitles on so it points out where the sound is coming from).\nOnce you find a cave, start mining. However, make sure that you have decent tools and weapons, plenty of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and optionally a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; before attempting to go through caves, as monsters spawn in them. This is more likely if the island has been lit up and you have kept the chunks loaded, so that more mobs spawn in underground spaces and do not despawn.\nMining on an island is similar to how it is in normal survival. However, it is recommended to mine deep down, so that you don't accidentally burst into the ocean. It is most necessary to find, in this order, &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; (which requires a diamond pickaxe). Once you have obsidian, flint, and iron, you can make a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpdate Aquatic.\nIf you are playing in \"Minecraft\" after &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt;, there is a chance that you might find a &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure%20chest\"&gt;buried treasure chest&lt;/a&gt; near or on the island you are on. If this happens, you can consider yourself quite lucky indeed as a shipwreck effectively solves all of the above three points (Crafting, Food and Shelter): the hull can be broken up and dismantled for wood, the ship often contains chests that oftentimes have food in them and the ship itself can be converted into an impromptu improvised house for surviving the initial nights. The shipwreck is also likely to contain a map that shows the path to a &lt;a href=\"Buried%20Treasure\"&gt;Buried Treasure&lt;/a&gt; Chest.\nCraft &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; and use it to collect some &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt;, then breed &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, which spawn on the beach. They lay &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s; make sure to protect them as the undead, stray wolves, and cats try to break it. When these eggs hatch, make sure to not let those baby turtles get to the ocean before growing up. The recommended strategy is to fence them in (during their egg stages). Now protect the baby turtles from zombies and skeletons. When those turtles grow, they drop &lt;a href=\"scutes\"&gt;scutes&lt;/a&gt;, an item used to craft &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;s, which is a useful helmet because it has the same protection as iron, lasts longer than iron, and allows you to breathe underwater longer.\nFinding a buried treasure chest on the island can be a boon for survival, because the chest often contains treasure such like iron and gold ingots, various types of fish, (in rare cases) iron swords and leather tunics , cake, TNT, potion of water breathing or regeneration, and &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Armor\"&gt;chain armor&lt;/a&gt;. Buried treasure chests are also guaranteed to contain a single &lt;a href=\"heart%20of%20the%20sea\"&gt;heart of the sea&lt;/a&gt; item, which is used alongside 8 nautilus shells to craft a &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;. Nautilus shells are drops from the &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, which are underwater zombie variants. They can also be caught as treasure from fishing. Buried Treasure is much rarer than shipwrecks and are also much harder to find, as they consist of only one block. However, if you find one (and are able to craft the conduit), you need to find some &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prismarine\"&gt;dark prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20bricks\"&gt;prismarine bricks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Lantern\"&gt;sea lanterns&lt;/a&gt; (all of which are found in &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Monument\"&gt;ocean monuments&lt;/a&gt;), and you could construct yourself a conduit and live underwater.\n&lt;a href=\"Underwater%20Ruins\"&gt;Underwater Ruins&lt;/a&gt; are another rare structure that has the potential to greatly benefit a player's survival game. They generate mostly underwater, although if you are lucky enough to find one that generated on land, you effectively have a half-done house. As an added bonus, underwater ruins also contain chests with loot and treasure. If you have access to a &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;, you could use an underwater ruin as a base. Beware, however, as underwater ruins may potentially be inhabited by drowned which can, in the worst-case scenario, spawn with &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s, granting them a lethal ranged attack. Drowned are extremely dangerous underwater because they have no distraction from a limited breath meter.\nIf your island is near or next to a warm ocean, you could see a &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt; which can be visible at night with &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s as a light source. Kelp does not generate in this biome and &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; may poison you when you get close to them.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt; spawn on the same island you are on (typically in the water). In island survival, however, because you likely have no emeralds, you can kill the trader for its &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s and its &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s. If you have found emeralds from shipwrecks or treasure chests, ruins, or mineshaft chests, you can purchase some useful things from the wandering trader. There is no penalty for killing one, and another eventually appears afterward.\nBesides beach and forest biomes, the plains biome likely exists on the island you live on. Even though you live on an isolated island, an &lt;a href=\"illager%20patrol\"&gt;illager patrol&lt;/a&gt; could still spawn on your island; watch out if you see them. If your island is small, the illagers sometimes spawn in the water, and you can easily pick them off with a bow and arrow, then swim out to collect their loot.\nExploring.\nOnce you have managed to set up a stable and reliable food- and tree farm and secured your basic necessities (housing and sleeping arrangements in some form), you can now begin to look outward and get on the business of exploring the greater world around you.\nStart by making sure you have the materials shown above (a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and other necessary building blocks). Now, you can place the boat and start traveling away from the island. Be careful near underwater ravines, as &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s give you oxygen, but these blocks may also break your boat and pull you down underwater.\nYou can also travel the ocean by swimming instead of using a boat. Swimming near a dolphin speeds up your swimming, and also you can dive to see if there is a ruin or shipwreck at the ocean floor. You can also explore underwater caverns, but &lt;a href=\"water%20breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; is required for exploring.\nWhile exploring the ocean, there is also a chance you might find a &lt;a href=\"monument\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt; and prismarine can be found, which is useful for your conduit. See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20a%20monument\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating a monument&lt;/a&gt; for more. Once the island is out of sight, you can start searching for other islands or the mainland.\nBeaches.\nIf you find a beach, try looking for &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;. If you find some, harvest it and then return to the home island and craft the sugar cane into &lt;a href=\"paper\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, then a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; (but save some sugarcane so you can farm it to get more). Then, travel in the same direction with your map, this time bringing a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;. Use the lead to bring &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s to the home island.\nWhile you are filling your map, be sure to &lt;a href=\"%23Islands\"&gt;stop by&lt;/a&gt; any islands you see, as they may house &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt; underneath them.\nIslands.\nIf you see another island, head for it immediately, light it up, and dig down. Chances are that there is a &lt;a href=\"generated%20structure\"&gt;generated structure&lt;/a&gt; underneath. \nIf you discover a generated structure, it is advisable to set up a second base of operations (a home away from home, so as to say), as many of the underground generated structures can generate quite large and take a long time to fully explore.\nIf there is nothing to be found there (not even &lt;a href=\"ores\"&gt;ores&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar jump&lt;/a&gt; back up, retrieving the ladders as you go. Then, travel the same distance from your home island as you were when you discovered the other island. In other words, your compass should face sideways.\nSince biomes in islands are mostly &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, there is a small chance to find plains village on islands that provide more resources. However, there's also a chance you can find an isolated &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt; on small islands. It is advised to take these on later, as they can be a base or source of resources.\nFrozen ocean.\nIf you didn't find any island, but frozen ocean or frozen deep ocean, there are also extra resources you can collect, such as &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s from snow blocks, and &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; (make sure to break the ice using a pickaxe with &lt;a href=\"silk%20touch\"&gt;silk touch&lt;/a&gt; enchantment). Despite kelp and seagrass not generated here, the surface is completely frozen (except frozen deep ocean), so you can walk on this biome. In rare cases, ruins and shipwreck can generate inside &lt;a href=\"iceberg\"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;s, providing a easy source of loot. Just make sure to have armor and weapons, as they provide areas for the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to spawn. &lt;a href=\"Polar%20bear\"&gt;Polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn during the day, which can be dangerous when near cubs, and &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s also spawn at night. Polar bears can drop fish and strays can drop bones, arrows, and sometimes tipped arrows.\nThe End.\nA game of \"Minecraft\" is never complete without a trip to the &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt;. If you have found a stronghold, use it. Otherwise, bring &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s of water breathing, throw an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt;, and travel in the direction that it went. After you have traveled a while, throw another, particularly if you see another island.\nIf the stronghold appears to be under a mushroom island, you must still use eyes of ender, as &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom islands&lt;/a&gt; are bigger than regular islands.\nIf the stronghold turns out to be underwater, drink a potion of water breathing and dig down. Use an efficiency-enchanted &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, and/or &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Affinity\"&gt;Aqua Affinity&lt;/a&gt; enchantment as mining underwater is slow. You can also place a block above your head after mining 3 blocks.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; and making air pockets is also possible.\nOnce you find a stronghold, it is a normal trip to the End (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/End%20survival\"&gt;Tutorials/End survival&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Ender%20dragon%20slaying\"&gt;Tutorials/Ender dragon slaying&lt;/a&gt;)."}

{"id": "79389", "revid": "32064309", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=79389", "title": "Tutorials/Item transportation", "text": "Item transportation is the automatic movement of &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s from one location to another. Item transportation is used frequently in combination with storage systems and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Hopper%23Item%20sorter\"&gt;item sorters&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefinitions.\nItem forms.\nItems can exist in two forms in the game: as an &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; slot or as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; floating around in the world. A &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; with a clock circuit is used to convert the former into the latter, while a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; can convert the latter into the former.\nThroughput and delay.\nAny pipeline has two measures for its \"speed\":\nTo use an internet analogy, would have a high throughput, but the delay would be high due to their flying speed. Similarly, a stack of items moving down a regular stream of water is fast in terms of throughput and slow in terms of delay.\nHorizontal transportation.\nOften, &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s need to be transported from one point to another. The easiest ways to do this are hopper lines and water streams.\nHopper lines.\nBy placing a line of &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s all pointing into each other, &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s can be transported at a throughput of 2.5 . This method is among the simplest to create, but is also somewhat &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; expensive at 5 ingots a hopper.\nOn large scale, hoppers have been known to create lag. To remedy this, some players place &lt;a href=\"container\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Composter\"&gt;composters&lt;/a&gt; on top of each hopper. This is to prevent the hoppers from attempting to search for entities with inventories above them, which then have to be checked for valid items to transfer, and/or item entities.\nWater streams.\nA less iron expensive method is the use of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; streams. This uses the mechanic of dropped &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s moving in flowing water streams. Using water also gets around the ips throughput problem, as items can be moved around in a full merged stack entity and many entities can travel at the same time. The delay is longer, however.\nSince water can only flow 7 blocks from the source, it is usually necessary to use multiple water sources. To handle the breaks, a &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; block and &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; can be used. When the items come out of one stream, they will slide across the ice to the next. The sign is necessary to prevent the second stream from flowing backwards. Placing the sign in place of the last water flow block instead of after it eliminates the need for packed ice. A number of other items can be used instead of a sign (which has a hitbox and can trap items): an upright slab or a closed trapdoor can let the items pass under; and a pressure plate can let items pass without any hit.\nWater flowing on packed ice blocks and blue ice block makes the items go faster, reducing the delay. (Ice works too, but one needs to carefully manage the light levels so it does not melt.)\nIt is a good idea to slow items down at some points so they can group into stack-sized entities and reduce server load. One way to do so is to use a &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt; in a free-air drop: this is simple and reliable, but uses a non-renewable resource. Other ways include timed trapdoors delaying item flow and sea pickles blocking items temporarily with its tiny hitbox. For enormous amounts of items, &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Shulker%20box%20storage\"&gt;a shulker box loader&lt;/a&gt; might be a better idea.\nVertical transportation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s are transported upwards, the mechanism is usually called an item elevator. These can be useful when it is necessary to move items from underground. Items can either be transported with containers, such as &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s, or in item form, such as through water.\nBubble elevator.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s, it is possible to transport &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s upward very quickly. To build one, just create an enclosed column of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; sources and place soul sand at the bottom. It is possible to create this without soul sand, however it will be much slower.\nDropper elevator.\n&lt;a href=\"Dropper\"&gt;Dropper&lt;/a&gt; elevators usually work by having a line of droppers pointing upwards. When the droppers are powered, &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s can travel upwards. The video demonstrates two of these designs. Note that the third design in the video is an outdated block elevator and may not work and that if it is running there will be a lot of lag and sound.\nBlock elevator.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s are glitched into blocks with a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;, they will float upwards until they get out of the blocks. The video demonstrates a design that uses this technique. Note that the second design is for a fast, silent dropper elevator and not a block elevator.\nThe same also happens if the items flow into fences at the base.\nDiagonal transportation.\nUsing pistons it is possible to move items horizontally as well as vertically."}

{"id": "100517", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=100517", "title": "Tutorials/Kelp farming", "text": "This tutorial seeks to explain common practices for farming &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;, a plant found naturally underwater.\nUses.\nWhen smelted and crafted into &lt;a href=\"dried%20kelp%20block\"&gt;dried kelp block&lt;/a&gt;s, kelp can be used to smelt items. One kelp block can smelt 20 items, so a single undried kelp ends up smelting items. This makes kelp useful as a renewable fuel source.\nSmelting kelp also grants 0.1 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. To put this into perspective, it would take about 3,060 smelted kelp to go from level 27 to level 30.\nIn addition, kelp can be &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composted&lt;/a&gt;, giving an average of 1 &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; per 23.33 kelp. Dried kelp works the same way, so it would be possible to smelt kelp for the &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, and then compost it.\nMechanics.\nKelp grows similar to &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;. One stem block can be placed underwater, and then it spontaneously grows upward until the top of the kelp is one block below the water surface. When kelp is planted or the plant above is broken, it sets a random age from 0 to 24, which determines the maximum height the kelp is able to reach. When kelp grows, the plant adds 1 to the age from below. A kelp plant stops growing at age 25. This means that a kelp plant can grow between 2 and 26 blocks tall.\nKelp has a 14% chance of growing each &lt;a href=\"tick%23block%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;. This means that there is a 50% chance for the kelp to grow in the first ticks, a 75% chance for it to grow within ticks, and a 25% chance for later growth. For information on random tick timings, see &lt;a href=\"tick%23block%20tick\"&gt;block tick&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used to speed up the growth of &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;. One bone meal grows kelp by one block.\nAdditionally, the maximum growth of a kelp plant may be reset to the current height of the plant, hindering any further growth. Not even bone meal can make a kelp plant grow again if the maximum height becomes reset to current height.\nExperimental testing.\nBased on testing, a 20\u00d720 square of kelp (400) down results in a rough 50% gain over the course of 1 minute, or about 600 kelp. This does not mean that half of the kelp grows 1 block; the random nature of the growth creates a negative logarithmic curve of how many plants reach certain heights. (L shaped curve)\nHere is the results from a 256 kelp test over a period of 1 real-life minute (1,200 ticks)\nAll kelp were made to be less than age 20 for the trial, so age did not matter as none grew to 6 tall.\nManual farming.\nKelp can be manually farmed by placing kelp underwater, waiting for it to grow, and breaking it. Usually you want to break the block above the bottom kelp plant so as to allow continued growth. If you do not need a large amount of kelp, such as several double chests filled, it is possible that harvesting naturally grown kelp in the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient.\nIt is important to note that kelp may not always grow to max height due to the random age value mentioned above. As such, it may be desirable to harvest kelp more frequently to allow it to constantly grow. , this age value can be checked by pressing F3.\nWhen harvesting kelp, you should swim down close to the base of the plants and sweep your view, breaking large amounts of kelp. Once you have broken a sufficient amount, swim to the surface to collect the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. Make sure to collect the items within 5 minutes before they despawn.\nHelpful equipment.\nKelp only grows underwater, which creates some difficulties when trying to harvest. The difficulties can be alleviated through the use of the right equipment, however.\nInfrastructure.\nTo help streamline the farming process, you can also build up the infrastructure within the farm itself.\nFor the farm itself, you should probably clear out a large area and cover it with kelp. Ideally, make the area at least 25 blocks deep to allow the kelp maximum growth.\nIt is also possible to automate collection by placing flowing water at the top, flowing into &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s. This can be tricky however, and the kelp must not be allowed to grow into the flowing water and break the stream.\nAutomatic farming.\nKelp can be automatically farmed by using pistons to break the second-to-bottom kelp block. Since kelp can vary in height from 2 blocks to 26 blocks, it is most efficient to have a chamber that can handle the maximum height.\nPiston design.\nIt is possible to create several kelp farms using the design shown in the schematic. For the design to work, there needs to be a way to trigger the piston. This can be done with either a &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, it could also be fired manually by the player.\n, an observer facing the bottom kelp plant detects when it grows. This can be used to fire the piston facing the second kelp block. It is also possible to have the observer above the piston. However, it is possible that the kelp grows to 2 block in height and never triggers the observer. This makes it necessary to also have a clock or manual way to reset the farm.\nFlying machine.\nIt is possible to use a flying machine to harvest large amounts of kelp all at once. This sort of design is more practical on a large scale as the kelp plants are all planted compactly next to each other.\nBone meal design.\nIt is possible to use &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; to accelerate plant growth. Since &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; does not break instantly, it is necessary to have a delay on how fast the farm runs. Otherwise, the kelp may grow before the rest is done breaking.\nReview Techniques.\nFizedi compares three techniques and determines the most efficient farm."}

It will also not work if the lava source is not immediately above the block in which the stalactite is attached or the stalactite itself is more than ten blocks high."}

See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Village%20mechanics\"&gt;Tutorials/Village mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt; for information on the current version.\nVideo explanation.\nBefore reading on, you may like to watch the following videos which explain the mechanics of breeding villagers. \nTerminology.\nA village is defined by several factors: the village center, radius, number of houses, population (number of villagers), population cap (max. number of villagers, based on housing), number of golems, and golem cap (based on population).\nA village needs at least one house and at least one villager in order to be a \"village\". A \"house\" is defined simply as a &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Door\"&gt;wooden door&lt;/a&gt; with an \"inside\" and an \"outside\" (see the next section for details). A village tries to maintain its population above 35% of the number of houses if there are at least two villagers.\nThe village center is the geometric center point, or \"average coordinates\" of all the doors. The village radius is the distance from this center point to the furthest door, or 32 blocks, whichever is greater. This means that the radius is always at least 32, no matter what, but it can be bigger if there are any houses further than 32 blocks from the center. The center point coordinates are truncated, resulting in a tendency towards .\nSymmetrical villages are easy to calculate the centers of, but for more complex villages, such as naturally generated villages, it's a good idea to give yourself a few blocks extra room. Try calculating from the position of the door closest to your build site. \nThe easiest way is to take the average of all coordinates of the doors in the village: \n(x.coordinate_door1 + x.coordinate_door2 + x.coordinate_door3 + ...)/ number-of-doors = x.coordinate_village-center\n(y.coordinate_door1 + y.coordinate_door2 + y.coordinate_door3 + ...)/ number-of-doors = y.coordinate_village-center\nHousing.\nA \"house\" is defined as a wooden door with an \"inside\" and an \"outside.\" The \"inside\" is the side which has more spaces covered by \"roof\" blocks than the other, within five spaces horizontally of the door in the two directions it faces. A \"roof\" block is an opaque block at any height that blocks direct sunlight from reaching the spaces below it.\nAnother way to put it would be to say that an \"outside\" space has a direct view of the sky, and so has a \"SL\" (sky light) value of 15. An \"inside\" space does not have a direct view of the sky (looking straight up) and a \"SL\" value of less than 15. The \"inside\" is the side which has more \"inside spaces\" than the \"outside\" (which, in turn, has more \"outside spaces\" than the \"inside.\") Technically, a sky light as low as 11 (but not lower) is allowed.\nA door is not counted as a house without a \"roof,\" or with the same number of covered spaces on either side.\nExample - The door is placed on the wooden planks. The game checks the spaces represented by the light blue wool, to see if they are covered by a \"roof\" block or not:\nThe simplest house looks something like this. Just a wooden door, with a dirt block on the ground next to it:\nNot much to look at, is it? But it fits the criteria. The dirt blocks the light from reaching the space below it, and so counts as a roof block. There is one \"inside\" space, covered by a roof block, on the right side of the image (represented by the red wool below) and zero on the left. Since one is more than zero, there are more covered spaces on one side of the door than there are on the other, and so the game counts this as a house:\nThe following are all examples of houses as well:\nIt doesn't matter what you build, except for what's directly above the colored wool. Anything to the sides of this can be whatever you want, or nothing at all:\nA door is two blocks tall, and this check is performed twice per door, if necessary. If the initial \"roof check\" (see Fig. 1) fails, then the bottom-most layer is ignored and the check is performed a second time, starting one layer higher. This time, only the spaces above the lime-green wool are checked for roof blocks:\nExample - For the door pictured below, the initial roof check finds there are two spaces covered by roof blocks on the left side, and two covered spaces on the right also. With the same number of covered spaces on each side, neither one can be designated the \"inside\" or the \"outside,\" and so the door is not counted as a house... yet, but we're not through yet, either:\nThen since the initial check failed, the bottom layer is ignored, and we perform the test again, this time checking for roof blocks only above (not level with) the green wool. This time, only the two spaces on the left-hand side of the image are covered. Since the \"roof check\" passed on this second try, the door counts as a house, and its \"inside\" is on the left where the more covered spaces are:\nIn the next example, the door passes the test on the initial first check. It has one covered space on the left side and two on the right. This makes it a house with the \"inside\" to the right. The second check would pass as well (with the \"inside\" on the left this time), but since the first one already passed, we don't even bother testing again. This door counts as a house, with the \"inside\" on the right:\nThe covered spaces don't have to be contiguous. The door below is a house, with the \"inside\" on the right, which has three covered spaces within the 5-space limit, while the left side has only two:\nThis next door has three covered spaces on each side, and is not a house:\nA house is initiated by a nearby villager. Without a villager nearby, it is not considered a \"house,\" just some blocks and a door:\nBut as soon as that villager shows up, it becomes a house (and a village):\nVillagers recognize a house within sixteen blocks along both horizontal axes, and up to three blocks above or five blocks below the level of the ground the villager is standing on:\nTransparent blocks.\nIt seems there are three kinds of &lt;a href=\"transparent\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; blocks. First, there are fully transparent blocks such as glass, torches, and fences. Then, there are what are called \"partially transparent\" blocks such as slabs, stairs, and leaves, which are treated as transparent by the rendering engine. Glowstone is also treated as transparent, although you cannot see through any part of it. Solid transparent blocks can be used as \"floor\" blocks in villages. Semi-transparent blocks still block light from passing through (at least partially, as is the case with leaves or water), so they're still somehow considered opaque to the lighting engine, which appears to be where it counts. These partially transparent blocks still block the sunlight, and count as roof blocks. Fully transparent blocks still do not count. Water and lava (both flowing and source blocks) are partially transparent, and count as roof blocks. Leaves, slabs, and stairs count as roof blocks.\nCancelling out.\nThere is a rumor going around that two doors facing within a certain distance of each other somehow cancel each other out, and neither one of them (or sometimes only one, depending on who you hear it from) count as \"houses.\" This is not true! It is nothing more than a misconception, a rumor, brought about by a misinterpretation.\nThe reason the doors on the left do not count as houses is not because they are facing each other, but rather because each one has exactly one space covered by a roof block on either side. So as you can see, it has nothing to do with the fact that they are facing each other!\nHere is an image that demonstrates the overlap between the areas checked for roof blocks by each of the two doors. The door on the left checks above the pink blocks, and the door on the right checks above the blue ones (but only in the center row that's inline with the doors, clearly). Purple blocks represent the area where the two zones overlap, and these spaces are checked by both doors:\nSince these doors both have the same number of covered spaces on either side, they don't have an \"inside\" or an \"outside,\" and therefore can't be called \"houses.\" However If you put additional blocks behind these (or just move them back by one space) then they are 6 blocks away from the far door, too far to be counted, but are still within range of the nearer door, creating the imbalance necessary to call them \"houses\":\nWith these additional blocks in place, the doors now are valid houses. This is my understanding, and the Village Info mod agrees!:\nTransporting villagers.\nThere are several ways to transport villagers, some quite tedious. \nMinecart technique.\nThe first and most well known technique is the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; technique, where you build a minecart track from the village to the end destination, and push the villagers one by one into a cart and push the cart to the destination. \nWater tunnel technique.\nThe second is more tedious but requires less resources, known as the water tunnel technique. Create a tunnel from one location to another, with no exits along the way (2\u00d72, for example), then grab two buckets of water. Use water to push them down the path a few blocks, then use the second bucket to push them further, grab the first water, and repeat.\nWith the revisions to the water mechanics introduced in 1.13, this is an effective technique: Place a water source block, followed by several empty blocks at the same level for the water to drain through, then place an ice block under the last waster flow block, then finish by capping it off with a pressure plate or a sign. Repeat the process until you reach your intended destination. (This works best when buried deep underground and while well lit to keep mobs from killing your villagers in transit. Otherwise, you need to build a cover over the area you're using to keep them safe.) Then, if you need to move them upwards, create an upwards bubble column elevator and lift the villagers to the proper location.\nBoat technique.\nA third technique is to transport villagers using a boat. As of PC version 1.9 mobs may enter boats, and players can enter the same boat and operate it while the mob sits in the back. This allows players to transport villagers over water, but also over land because as of 1.9.4 boats can be sailed on land (albeit very slowly). To move the boat upwards you have to create a bubble column.\nUsing fake houses.\nUsing the gathered information above in this wiki, there is an easier way to transport villagers, rather than pushing them in a minecart, boat or using the water tunnel. Firstly find a village, and destroy all wooden doors except one to gather the villagers there. Then you can move the villagers by creating fake houses. As long as these meet the house requirements, the villagers 'follow' the doors. The easiest way to do this is to place a door with 2 blocks stacked up behind it, removing the old door so that the villagers follow and continuing the process again and again.\nFor a visual representation, watch the following video from 1:20 to 3:33. \nUsing Nether portals.\nA final and potentially least tedious method of transporting villagers is the \"Nether Portal Method\". Most entities can travel through nether portals. Keep in mind that this strategy only works if no Nether portals have yet been constructed in the Nether (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20portals\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details). Create a portal in the location where you want the Villagers to be, i.e. close to your house. Then travel to the nearest Village (it must be within 1024 distance of the first portal) and build another portal there. You can either use a minecart or manually push the Villagers into the portal, transporting them to the Nether, but keep in mind that Villagers cannot be pushed up blocks. Thus it would be ideal to build the portal so that the bottom blocks are level to the ground. Enter the portal and push the villagers out of the portal in the Nether, then wait about 30 seconds. After the villagers undergo \"cooldown\", they can be pushed back through the portal and should exit from the first portal that you constructed.\nA few notes with this strategy. Once the villager has been transported through the portal, it is essentially impossible to return them to their village (but why would you want to do that, right?). However, while wandering they may accidentally reenter the portal, so it is a good idea to block off the portal by surrounding it with a fence.\nBreeding and population cap.\nVillagers breed without player intervention, but there must be at least two adult villagers who can reach each other. If you are starting a village from scratch, or recovering from zombie villagers and there are no villagers left (or only one), then you need to acquire more. The only ways to do that are:\nGiven a breeding pair, a village's population is maintained at 0.35 times the number of \"houses\" (defined above.) Specifically, villagers may mate if the current population (updated only once per second) is below 0.35 times the number of \"houses\" rounded down.\nResidents of a village that has not yet reached its population cap occasionally go into \"love mode,\" indicated by animated hearts above their head (only visible if you have particle effects enabled, but still works even when you can't see it working). Much like with farm animals, when two villagers are feeling \"romantic\" and can see each other, they pathfind towards the other and \"kiss\" for a few seconds, after which a third, smaller (\"baby\") villager spawns next to them. This new villager gets assigned a random profession (indicated by the style and color of its clothing), not necessarily the same as either parent.\nBecause popularity is stored per village, if the entire village is destroyed, any accumulated popularity, positive or negative, is also eliminated. This may be useful in synthetic village designs, such as when only one villager is kept in range of doors to maintain the existence of the village but is moved out of range in order to destroy the village, such as to stop infinite villager breeding.\nWillingness.\nVillagers must be \"willing\" in order to breed. After mating, they are longer willing and must be traded with again before becoming willing again.\nVillagers can become willing by the player trading with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. This does not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.\nVillagers can also become willing by having either 3 &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, 12 &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s 12 &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, or 12 &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s in their inventory. Farmer villagers throw harvested crops at villagers, allowing them to pick them up to obtain enough food to become willing.\nCuring zombie villagers.\nThere are two ways to cure an infected zombie villager. The first method requires you to travel to the &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; and collect at least two &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s, to craft a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;, and then to turn the blaze rods into &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; to operate the brewing stand (as of 1.9). Then you need to brew a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20weakness\"&gt;splash potion of weakness&lt;/a&gt;, and craft a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; (the \"ordinary\" one, that takes ingots to craft). When you find a zombie villager, toss the potion of weakness at it, and then right-click it with the golden apple. The zombie begins shaking for up to 5 minutes, then it turns into a villager of the corresponding profession and a random career.\nYes, there is another way, for Nether disabled servers, to give the zombie villager in question a potion of weakness, without having a brewing stand. You must get a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; and a zombie villager in the same proximity in order to do so. Witches sometimes throw a Splash Potion of Weakness (if a player is within 3 blocks), which you can use to your advantage, with a little work. This method is similar to getting a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; to kill a &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;, and as such tutorials on that should be followed in order to achieve the process. You will, however, need to have a golden apple ready this way too.\nAfter you've used the splash potion of weakness and the golden apple, the zombie makes a loud sizzling sound, emits orange swirly particles, and begins to shake violently. It takes a couple of minutes for them to convert, so go ahead and trap it somewhere, and make sure it doesn't burn in the sunlight, or hurt any nearby villagers. After a few minutes, the zombie villager turns into a regular villager, at which point you can let it out to roam the village or do whatever.\nFinding zombie villagers in the first place shouldn't be all that difficult. About every 20th zombie is a villager zombie, so it shouldn't take you too long to find two of them you can cure back into villagers and get the population booming by more...\"natural\" means. Additionally, when a villager is attacked by a zombie (any zombie) there is a chance (50% on normal difficulty, and 100% on hard) that they turn into a villager zombie instead of just being killed. There are also baby villager zombies, which are harder to trap, but can also be cured.\nZombie villagers are a great way to start an artificial village, because unlike villagers, zombie villagers follow the player long distances. Then when they arrive at the desired location they can be cured.\nBreeding indefinitely.\nThere is also a bug or glitch where the villagers can be coaxed to breed indefinitely without regard to the population cap.\nVillagers need to be inside a sphere (radius = village radius) around the village center in order to breed, but the village population counts only villagers that are inside a box (width, length = 2\u00d7 village radius, height: 8 [always!]) around the village center. So with a sphere that can grow to any size, and a box that's always only 8 high, it should be apparent that there are some zones only covered by the sphere (above and below the village center).\nYou can reproduce/abuse this behavior by building 6 houses on the ground level (enough to set the villager limit to 2), drop 2 (or more) villagers into a 6 blocks deep hole, and leave one villager at the top to keep the houses \"alive\". The villagers in the hole breed indefinitely, because they're not counted against the cap. As of Minecraft &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, you need to make the villagers willing to breed, by also giving them food (or give them a farm, a crop, with a farmer), or trading with them.\nIron golems.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s spawn near the center of a village if it has at least ten villagers and 21 houses. Additional houses beyond the 21st make no difference as far as golem spawning is concerned, although 29 would be needed to spawn ten villagers naturally. Additional villagers allow more golems to spawn, in increments of one golem for every ten extra villagers (so 0-9 villagers allows no golems to spawn, the cap is set at zero; 10-19 raises that cap to one, 20-29 raises it to two, etc.). This cap only limits the number of golems in a village at any one time; as soon as one is killed or leaves the village boundaries, a new one can spawn in its place immediately.\nThe golem spawning zone is a 16\u00d716\u00d76 area centered around the center point of the village. As long as all the conditions are met (10 villagers, 21 houses, golem cap not reached), then each game tick (1/20 of a second) there is a 1/7000 chance to try to spawn a golem. When a golem is to be spawned, up to ten attempts are made to spawn a golem. A random spot is chosen inside the spawning zone, and if that spot is above a solid-topped block with at least 2\u00d72\u00d74 space above it (including liquids\u2014golems can spawn in water, which is key to most iron farm designs\u2014and transparent blocks), then a golem is spawned there.\nThe average expected spawning rate, if the golems are killed or flushed outside the village boundary quickly enough so that the cap is never reached and new ones are able to spawn in their place immediately, is roughly 10 golems per hour. A higher cap doesn't increase this rate beyond reducing the amount of time that the cap is filled while the newly-spawned golem is killed or removed.\nZombie sieges.\nAt night, there is a chance that a zombie siege might occur. This is when a large number of zombies spawn in or near a village, attacking what villagers they can reach, crowding around and pounding on the doors of those they can't. On hard or hardcore mode, they can actually break down the wooden doors of the villagers' homes (this is true of all zombies, not just during sieges.) A zombie siege requires a village of at least 10 houses and at least 20 villagers. \nZombies in sieges ignore light levels and the 24-block minimum distance from the player, but other than that, behave absolutely normal (i.e., they do not spawn on glowstone or any other transparent or half block, need a 2\u00d71\u00d71 minimum space, etc.). They can also spawn INSIDE doors, making Iron Golem farms difficult to build on hard, as zombies beat down doors on hard (they'll attempt to beat them down on other difficulties, but not succeed). However, zombies won't spawn 128 blocks away from you, even though the siege is technically happening in the game code, so you're safe if you build it high up. You can make houses virtually zombie-proof simply by taking out one ground block from directly in front of the door, and, if necessary, rehanging the door such that the outside is \"smooth,\" i.e. the door's position on its ground block runs consistent with the outside wall. This is because zombies can only break the top half of a door, and if they have to jump, they can never get through."}

It relies on two &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit%23XOR%20Gate\"&gt;XOR gates&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit%23AND%20Gate\"&gt;AND gates&lt;/a&gt;, and one &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit%23OR%20Gate\"&gt;OR gate&lt;/a&gt;. With some thought, these gates can be compressed (as both AND and XOR gates already exist in the game, and an OR gate can simply be a redstone wire).\nA and B are the bit inputs and C' is the carry in. It produces a sum at S and a carry out at C. When full adder modules are tiled together C' and C will be connected, which allows the carry to propagate to the next module.\nThe half adder is nearly identical to the full adder, except the second XOR gate is removed and the output from the first XOR gate becomes S. There is no carry in (C'), but the carry out (C) circuit is still on top of the first XOR gate and provides a carry to the first full adder. Some ALUs will not use a half adder for the first bit, to support INCREMENT (allow a carry in on the first bit).\nIn-Line Adder.\nThis full adder is similar to the previous one, except for the fact that it is two wide and the inputs are aligned vertically. This design is great for minimizing horizontal space and can be built in-line with two redstone buses, eliminating the space required to expand a bus to reach the inputs of a wider full adder.\nVersion 2.\n\"Gates: XNOR (2), IMPLIES, NOT, OR, AND\" \n\"Size: 6\u00d712\u00d75 (including I/O spaces)\"\nThis adder will take 2 bits and a carried over bit (actually C, rather than C, a value held in the redstone in the bottom left corner on layer 1) and add them all together, producing a sum (S) bit and a carry (actually C rather than C).\nWhen using the gates above; mind the inputs and outputs. You may be wondering why there are so many inverted signals being used instead of the regular signal.\nThe adders shown here use XNOR gates rather than XOR gates because they are more compact, and as a result, implies gates must be used instead of AND gates, which also happen to be more compact.\nTherefore, for the most compact adder, inverse signals must be used. These adders are too complex to be easily deciphered with 2 layers per square, so each single layer has been drawn separately to ease the building process.\n\"Gates: XNOR, IMPLIES\"\n\"Size: 5\u00d74\u00d74\"\nThis adder will take 2 bits and add them together. The resulting bit will be the output of S (sum). If both bits are 1, there will be a carry over, and C will become 1 (C will become 0). This half adder can be modified to create a non inverted C output, but this configuration is used so that it can be implemented as the start of a chain of full adders.\nExtension:\nfor those new to advanced redstone like myself, it's easier to understand it like this: let's say output B (C) has a NOT gate that inverts the signal and it leads to an iron door or piston door etc. Output A (S) is connected to &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s controlling the floor. Let's say for sake of argument that there is 1\u00d71\u00d71 block NOT affected by the sticky pistons, this is the safety block. When you activate input A, both the door will open and the floor will drop, if you're standing on the safety block, then you will not fall. Input B will control only the floor, but if input A is on the input B will control them both. When both are on, input A will only affect the floor. This means if you are off the server and want no one in, leave A and B on, when they deactivate A, the floor will drop, but the door will stay closed, so if they know the secret, they still cannot get in.\nVersion 3.\n\"Size: 5\u00d76\u00d73\"\nCarry input and output are aligned to easily connect many of these modules in series.\nFast Adding.\nWhen building advanced digital circuits like computers and multipliers, the adders used must be as fast as possible to ensure maximum running speed. Simple adders have one fundamental speed problem which numerous adder designs try to correct to speed up. The issue is carry propagation delay: delay caused by the way adders borrow carries. We can see this when we do the problem 1111 + 0001:\n 1111\n 0001\n 1110\nThis is the first step of the addition process, XORing the two inputs. Because there were two 1s in the least significant bit, the AND gate activates and carries to the next bit:\n 1\n 1111\n 0001\n 1100\nBut here is the issue: You now need to borrow a carry again, because, in the two's place, there are two ones. This is done by ANDing the output of the first half-adder with the carry from the previous bit and this is a huge issue. Because, for the next bit, you AND the borrowed carry again, and again. Each AND gate takes 2 ticks, so, in order to calculate all of the carries that need to be added up in the final step, it takes 2 ticks times 4 bits, or 8 ticks.\nImagine you see the problem 999 + 1. You don't sit around thinking \"9 + 1 is 10, carry 1, so 9 + 1 is 10, carry the 1, so 9 + 1 is 10, so 1000.\" It's the same situation in an advanced circuit.\nReal electrical engineers and creative redstoners have designed circuits that calculate adder carries faster than this sequential method.\nIncidentally, adders that calculate carries one at a time in this fashion are called Ripple Carry adders.\nPiston Adders.\nOne of the simplest and most classic ways of solving the ripple carry problem is to use instant AND gates that use pistons. These adders are simple and fast, but are inconstant because they use pistons. When blocks are accidentally dropped, the entire circuit breaks. Pistons also have timing awkwardness that can be excruciatingly inconvenient when building an advanced circuit that relies heavily on timing.\nWhenever a carry is created, it is sent through the wire with the lever on it, and, instead of going through an AND gate, the piston retracts and the carry can move on to the next bit which adds no carry propagation delay at all (until the signal strength runs out).\nThis video shows a straightforward implementation of the logic. The design is large and spread out, so it's easy to see each individual part of the adder and the carry logic.\n4-bit Adder.\n\"Gates: XNOR (7), IMPLIES (4), NOT (4), OR (3), AND (3)\"\n\"Size: 23X12X5\"\nNote! The least significant digit (\"ones\" digit) is on the left of the diagram so that the progression from half adder to the full adders can be seen more clearly. Reverse the diagram if you want a conventional left to right input. \nThis adder will take 2, 4 bit numbers (A and B) and add them together, producing a sum (S) bit for each bit added and a carry (C) for the whole sum. The sum bits are in the same order as the input bits, which on the diagram means that the leftmost S output is the least significant digit of the answer. This is just an example of a string of adders; adders can be strung in this way to add bigger numbers as well.\nAlternate 4-bit Adder.\nThe same function but a different design with 4 full adders instead of 1 half adder and 3 full adders\nNOTE: switches are inputs A and B (top switch C input)\nSubtracting.\nSubtracting and adding are the same thing when reduced down to the idea that, for example, 3-2 = 3 + (-2) = 1. Since we already have the framework in place to add bits, it is fairly simple to subtract by just adding the negative bit. The problem lies in the representation of negative numbers. \nWe are all familiar with the elementary school concept of \"borrowing\" in subtraction from the next column like this:\n 5623\n - 128\nWe are not capable of taking 8 from three, so we \"borrow\" a 1 from the next decimal place to allow us to subtract 8 from 13 instead, resulting in 5\n 1\n 5623\n - 128\n 5\nComputers are not capable of assumptions, so when a computer needs to find a negative it does not (and cannot) put a negative sign in front of the input. It just subtracts from zero \"borrowing\" from the next column like so:\n 000000\n - 3\n -999997\nThis is the same in binary. Let us, for example use a 4 bit binary number for the example:\n 1 11 111 1111\n 0000 0000 0000 0000\n -0011 -0011 -0011 -0011\n - 1 - 01 - 101 -1101\nWe could repeat this forever, but that would be useless. This is about what a 4 bit register does: it truncates after 4 bits worth of data. So after we truncate the number (which I kindly did for you in the example, otherwise the number would have an infinite number of 1's to the left). Thanks to this little perk, we can do whatever we want to the 0's after the four of them, including (which will prove to be fantastically useful later) adding a single 1 in front of them.\n 10000\n -0011\n 1101 &lt;-- NOTE: This number is positive! Success!\nRemember how we said that our redstone had no special way of designating a negative from a positive? We just created a way. If the most significant (first) bit of a number is 1 that means that it is a negative number. This fantastic perk of binary numbers is a theorem called \"Two's Complement\".\nFormally, Two's Complement is defined as:\nThe negative of a number b with bit length n is equal to 2n+1 \u2212 b\nEssentially what this is saying is that \u2212b is just the inversion of b (exchange 1's for 0's and 0's for 1's) plus 1.\nWhat we have done is turn the first bit into a \"negative sign\" if it is on, but if you have been reading this you realize it is not that simple. Numbers that have a negative sign like this are commonly referred to as signed integers. Numbers like in a normal adder, where two's compliment is not taken into effect are called unsigned integers. Unsigned integers can go to a higher value, but cannot go below zero where as signed integers can only go half as high, but they can go equally as far below zero. This means that the two numbers have the same range, it is just in a different location like so (this is with an 8 bit number):\n Unsigned: 0-255\n Signed -128-127\nIt should be noted that some strange effects can take place when using the lowest signed value (in this case -128) so this should be avoided.\nNow that we have a positive way of representing our negative numbers it is very trivial to implement this into an adder. Currently our adder solves\n A + B\nWe want it to solve\n A \u2212 B\nor\n A + (\u2212B)\nTherefore, if we enter the two's complement of B, our adder becomes a subtractor. This is easily implemented by using the Carry-in bit of the least significant (first) bit as the \"+1\" and then all that is left is to invert B.\nThere is one important thing to note when implementing this. Because it is possible to get a two's complement number out, when subtracting the most significant digit must be inverted. This is usually the Carry out of the last adder.\nThis can all be implemented into an adder like so:\nA control bit is added to the circuit such that when it is on, the unit subtracts, and when it is off the unit adds. After this, add XOR gates between the control bit and each B input. Route the output of each XOR to the B input of each adder. Finally, to make the unit Two's compliment compatible, a final XOR gate must be added between the control bit and the carry out of the most significant bit.\nThis is the simplest way to implement negatives and subtraction in a CPU, as it will add gracefully and store well in registers. If this is to be implemented in a calculator, simply subtract 1 from the output and then invert all the outputs except the most significant one. The most significant bit will be on if the number is negative.\nIn order to make a subtracter, simply invert one of the binary inputs (the 1st or 2nd number). If the number is negative, the answer comes out inverted. In real computers, the first bit (also called the sign) decides whether the number is positive or negative, if you include this (applying the same inverting rule) you can detect whether the number is negative, or if it is just a big number.\nLogic units.\nIn circuits, it might be useful to have a logic unit that will, based on the input, decide which output is to be chosen. Such a unit can then be used for more complex circuits, such as an ALU.\nThis is an example of a 2-bit logic unit that will have four states depending on the input.\nThe outputs are in top row, with 11, 00, 01, 10 order (input order: first first, bottom second).\nThis is another example of a simplified version using Gray codes. The output appears at the torches at the end of the top rows. This design can be extended to any number of bits, but practical limitations due to timing considerations restrict the use of more than a byte or so. The outputs are triggered by the inputs 11, 01, 00, 10, respectively.\nArithmetic logic unit.\nThe Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is the central part of the CPU. It does calculations and logical processing and then passes this information to a register. The ALU, on basis of the input, selects a specific function, performs it, and then gives the result.\nThe ALU shown below is a 1-bit ALU with the functions: ADD, AND, XOR. It takes the A and B inputs and then performs the selected functions. Read about the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Advanced%20redstone%20circuits%234%20Bit%20Adder\"&gt;adders&lt;/a&gt; to see how the ADD function works.\nXOR and AND are basic functions that are explained on the &lt;a href=\"logic%20circuit\"&gt;logic circuit&lt;/a&gt;s page.\nThere can be more functions added to an ALU, like multiplication, division, OR, NAND... etc. These functions could, with some modifications, be added to this 1 bit ALU.\nThis 1-bit ALU can be linked to each other to create an as many bit ALU as possible.\nJust like adders you need to connect the Carry out (Cout) to the Carry in (Cin) of the next ALU"}

The following is a list of the differences between the two farms:\nMagma cube spawner trap.\nDisabling.\nThere is always a magma cube &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; in each bastion remnant of the treasure room type. It is located close to the bottom of the large room, above a lava pool, guarding the ultimate treasure: a pile of gold blocks, and a chest. Most players would just easily disable the spawner by breaking it, as magma cubes spawn at any light level, torches won't do anything, and it takes a lot of time and blocks to fill up the entire 9\u00d73x9 spawning area, enough time for the local piglins, piglin brutes and magma cubes to tear you into pieces. However, there exist a simple way to disable a magma cube spawner entirely and reliably, using as little as 9 blocks.\nThis disabling grid makes use of the mechanic that a magma cube, no matter large, medium or small, checks for the space requirements of a small magma cube before it spawns. Since a large magma cube is slightly wider than 2 blocks, there is no horizontal space within the 9\u00d73x9 area for it to fit in. Also, a spawner can only spawn a mob's \"feet\" at 3 heights: one block below the spawner, same height as the spawner, or one block above the spawner. No matter which layer it chooses, even the lowest layer, since a large magma cube is slightly taller than 2 blocks, its \"head\" will slightly intersect with at least one of the solid blocks, cancelling the spawn attempt.

Having nice floors can help with the appearance of a house greatly. Additionally, floors can give players a certain \"feel\" to the house; for example, using different colors of wool may make them think of the house as happy and colorful, while a mix on &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; with fire on it may make give them a sinister and foreboding feeling of the house.\nFancy and polished floors are usually achieved best by alternating two different blocks. This can be &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polished%20andesite\"&gt;polished andesite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"polished%20granite\"&gt;polished granite&lt;/a&gt;, black &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; and white concrete, or more. Brighter floors that look happier are usually achieved with different colors of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, such as red, yellow, orange, and lime.\nThe exact types of flooring to put in your house is up to you. However, read through this tutorial for some suggestions on certain floors that may look nice for your house.\nFloor textures.\nThe requirements listed below are calculated for a 5 x 5 floor. The grids show sizes for many types of floors, often including a 6 x 6.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Wood\"&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Planks\"&gt;Wood Planks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWood is one of the most common materials used for floors in Minecraft, as well as floors in real life. Different combinations of wood logs and wood planks can give houses different styles. The advantage of wood is that trees are both very common and fully renewable.\nHorizontal Wood Logs.\nRequirements: 18 wood planks, 18 logs &lt;br&gt;\nThis design has a fancy and polished look. It is somewhat spareful, but not as spareful as if it were made with solely wood planks. The wood logs are hard to orient, but this can be solved by placing the wood planks first and then the logs. Place the wood logs on the back and front sides of the wood planks, to get them to face the correct direction.&lt;br&gt;\nVertical Wood Logs.\nRequirements: 18 wood planks, 18 logs &lt;br&gt;\nThis design requires the exact same materials as the previous. It is not as fancy as it would be if using horizontal wood logs, but it's easier to orient.&lt;br&gt;\nDifferently Oriented Wood Logs.\nRequirements: 36 logs &lt;br&gt;\nThis design has a detailed and polished feel to it. However, it requires lots of wood, and it is hard to orient the logs. The easiest way to orient the logs is to place all of the vertical logs first and then the horizontal ones.\nWith Granite, Andesite, or Diorite.\nGranite, andesite, and diorite, were added in 1.8 for building. These three types of stone, when un-polished, can give a floor an old, eroding feel to it, while using combinations of the polished versions of granite, andesite, and diorite, can result in a tile-like floor.\nTile-like Floor.\nRequirements: 18 &lt;a href=\"polished%20andesite\"&gt;polished andesite&lt;/a&gt;, 18 &lt;a href=\"polished%20diorite\"&gt;polished diorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nThis design with alternating polished andesite and diorite is great for a tiled floor, such as for a kitchen or a bathroom.\nEroding Floor.\nRequirements: 16 &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, 9 &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nThis type of floor does not look fancy or polished, but it is great for an old floor that looks like its eroding away. It is basically a floor of andesite with diorite placed randomly throughout. Note that this grid is for a 5 x 5 floor, unlike the others, which were for a 6 x 6.\nWith Wool or Concrete.\nWool and concrete can be used to brighten up floors a bit, and make them colorful. Most colors of wool are fully renewable, and the ingredients to craft concrete are fairly common. Use wool for a more detailed-looking floor, and concrete for a more polished floor.\nPattern 1.\nThis wool or concrete pattern is more complicated than any pattern so far. The way its designed is easiest on a square floor, but can be accommodated. If you don't want to worry about accommodating to a non-square rectangular floor, make this pattern in the center of the floor and surround it with another simpler pattern.\nUsing blue, lime, and yellow wool or concrete\nRequirements: 12 blue &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, 9 lime wool or concrete, 4 yellow wool or concrete\nThis floor pattern is nice and colorful. It can be built with concrete or wool. There are 2 grids below. The first one shows how a 5 x 5 floor would use this pattern with concrete, and the second one shows how a 6 x 6 floor would use this pattern with wool.\n&lt;br&gt;\nYou can also switch up the different colors of wool. For example, you can change the yellow wool to lime, the lime to blue, and the blue to yellow if desired.\nUsing cyan, green, and light blue wool or concrete\nRequirements: 12 cyan wool or concrete, 9 green wool or concrete, 4 light blue wool or concrete\nThis pattern gives a floor aquamarine water feel to it, while still keeping it colorful. As with the previous pattern, the first grid shows a 5 x 5 floor using this pattern, with concrete, and the second grid shows a 6 x 6 floor using this pattern, with wool.\n&lt;br&gt;\nPattern 2.\nRequirements: 13 &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; A, 12 concrete B\nThis pattern is perhaps the simplest of the 3 wool/concrete patterns. It involves just alternating two colors of concrete for every block. Because this pattern is simple and is nearly the same for any size of flooring, there is only one grid showing how to make this pattern, and it is for a 5 x 5 floor. This specific example uses black and white concrete:\nPattern 3.\n\"Note: The requirements here are for a 7 x 7 floor, rather than a 5 x 5 floor.\"\nRequirements: 24 red &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, 16 yellow wool, 8 green wool, 1 blue wool\nYou can use this rainbow-like pattern to make a very colorful floor. Although it looks the best for at least a 7 x 7, it can be accommodated to smaller sizes. For bigger sizes, you can add more colors, such as orange and purple. The first grid here shows how you can use this rainbow flooring for a 7 x 7 floor, and the second grid for a 12 x 12 floor.\n&lt;br&gt;\nAlso, if you want, you can reverse the order of the rainbow colors, so that the red wool is in the middle, and the blue or purple is on the outside.\nPattern 4.\nThis is a simple yet a symmetrical, abstract and a cool design.\nWith Glazed Terracotta.\n&lt;a href=\"Glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;Glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt; is great when used to highlight certain parts of a floor, specifically in a castle or royal house. What makes glazed terracotta unique from other blocks, is that different textures and colors are shown throughout the block, unlike most blocks, which are one color throughout. Lime glazed terracotta is great for a royal-looking floor, while red glazed terracotta is great for a fancy carpet. Orange-glazed terracotta is great for a beach-hut floor, or the floor for a party place.\nOne option for glazed terracotta is to substitute the blocks in the wool/concrete patterns for glazed terracotta, to give it a more fancy feel. Here is an example of using glazed terracotta for the wool/concrete pattern 1:\nWith Glass.\nGlass will not just make a nice floor, but also useful in combat and bases, since mobs won't spawn on glass. Here is a simple design:\nGlass shatter mat\nFloors for Rooms.\nIf you are making a house and have plenty of materials at hand, you will probably have multiple rooms. Certain types of floors fit perfectly with a certain style of room, while others don't. Here is a list of rooms you will probably have in your house (specifically if you're in survival), and what type of floor would go best with them (note: not all of them have been mentioned):\nFoyer/Living room\nYour foyer is the room when you first walk into the house, and many players make it their living room. Using the &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; pattern 1 with blue/lime/yellow wool, or a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Glazed%20terracotta%20patterns\"&gt;glazed terracotta pattern&lt;/a&gt;, would look great to get a visitor's attention. You can also surround the wool/&lt;a href=\"glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt; with either plain &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt; or with horizontal &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; logs and wood planks (see the first image in \"Gallery\" for an example).\nKitchen/Smelting room/Dining room\nThe place where your smelting and managing food is done would look best with the tile-like floor, consisting of &lt;a href=\"polished%20andesite\"&gt;polished andesite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"polished%20granite\"&gt;polished granite&lt;/a&gt;. Also, for a less subtle flooring, use the concrete pattern 1, with black and white concrete. If you have a separate kitchen and smelting room, use the tile-like floor for the kitchen, and for the smelting room, use (a) block(s) of your choice, or you could use the tile-like floor or black/white concrete floor for the smelting room as well.\nBedroom\nYour bedroom is a room where you should make the floor your own. You can use whichever block is your favorite, or use one that fits your playing style. Additionally, you can also theme your bedroom. For example, if you're making your bedroom a water/ice theme, use the wool pattern 1 with cyan/green/light blue wool, or just &lt;a href=\"dark%20prismarine\"&gt;dark prismarine&lt;/a&gt;. It's all up to you.\nCrafting room\nAlthough many players make the &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; room part of their bedroom, living room, or smelting room, while others have none at all, some players with bigger houses may have a separate crafting room. A crafting room looks great with any of the combinations of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt;, or if you don't care about a fancy crafting room and want to use minimal wood, only use wood planks.\nStorage room\nFor a storage room, a lot of the floor design is up to you, similar to a bedroom. If you have an above-ground storage room and you want it to look nice, try using wood, wood planks, or &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;. If your storage room is in the basement, and you want the floor to not look quite as nice for a realistic basement look, use &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, or for an even more worn down look, the eroding floor design, with &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, many players make their storage room part of their bedroom.\nNote that just because one type of flooring for a room is recommended, it does NOT mean that you must use that floor for every house you build. The flooring for your own house is completely up to you - these floorings are just suggestions."}

It's perfect if all you want is a little surface of water. Note: that the deeper the lake, the less practical it is to dig it that way.\nHow To: Deep Lake w/ Ease.\nYou can make a lake any depth with ease! All you do is dig out your lake. (i.e. 6 blocks deep and also a rise near the edges) Then you do 1 layer of dirt where you want the water level to be. Fully cover the lake with the one block high layer and fill/overlap with water. (Make sure water becomes fully still/settled!) Grab a diamond shovel and with ease you dig up the top and only layer of dirt as your lake fills with water. You can also add to an already made lake like this, and just add 1 layer of dirt blocks at water lvl and watch as the waterfall extends over your extended lake. Once again you dig out the layer of dirt once you've gotten the water to settle.\nHow To.\nFirst, dig a one block deep hole and fill it with water. The size of the hole is irrelevant, as is its shape. You're already almost done, make sure there are no currents ruining your fun and then dig one block deeper. The springs of the first layer will fill whatever is under it.\nIf you listened, you should already be done, but let's say you want a three blocks deep lake. You dig again, however you should note that under water you do everything at a slower pace. The bigger and deeper your pool, the more it will be a pain to dig.\nDeep Pool.\nWhat you need to understand about water is that it can't create springs if there is no block under the would-be spring. That's the reason why lakes don't fill themselves when one infinite spring is placed up-stream. However, water floats as of now in &lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt;, and if there's a block between two floating springs, a new spring will be created. That is the basis of this technique. Both versions are viable, but this version is the most efficient block wise.\nHow To.\nThe deep pool needs more preparations. First you need to dig your pool. Make sure there are no holes in the walls where water won't be directly above, this will cause currents and the point of all this is not to get currents\nSecondly, set up rows at the first layer of your lake, one block large, two blocks deep (the length is determined by your pool) and separated by two blocks of nothing.\n = walls, = rows (or blocks you'll need to Destroy), = nothing, = water\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Seen from above, the walls are as deep as your pool needs to be but the rows are two blocks deep\"\nNext, place springs of water all along the sides of the rows. You're ready for the next step if you have a layer of calm water separated by rows of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; or whatever you choose to use.\n\"The will become water in this schema\"\nFinally, destroy the rows from the upper section down. This is important, if there's no block under, the new water spring won't form.\n\"Here seen from the side\"\n\"With the upper row gone, a water spring is formed\"\n\"The top are in fact water springs, the rest is water coming from those\"\nNow you are done! Enjoy your lake! Notice that the schemas only represents the pattern you need to replicate, the size of the pool doesn't matter. As demonstrated in the schema, you don't need the side of your lake to be even, you just need to make sure every row you make is surrounded by at least two springs of water.\nDeep Pool 2.\nThis new version is a mash up of the two techniques above. The two versions are viable, however some may find this one more simple. \nHow To.\nFirst, dig your lake just like before. Make sure there's no hole without a water source above it directly and you're set to go.\n&lt;br&gt;= rows (or blocks you'll need to Destroy), = nothing (later it will be the water), or = walls\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\"This is just a plain example of what the lake should looks like from the side.\"\nNow, add a layer of blocks (dirt is best). The purpose of this layer is to receive a pool easily filled. It doesn't need to must not be thicker than one block, you're just making your life harder if you do.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Notice the placement of the layer of . It is in only to stand out from the walls. This layer must cover all of your lake.\"\nFinally, fill the one block deep pool you're supposed to have at the top with water, make sure it's all smooth and currents-less, then destroy the layer supporting it. If all was done right, you should be done!\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Notice the that have turned into , this is your layer of springs, all that is left is to eliminate the layer under it. The lake will fill itself afterward.\"\nNote that this schema is only an example, the size of your pool doesn't matter (except for the work you'll need to do).\nPure Lake.\nSo you want a lake filled with springs for whatever reasons? As always, I'm here to help. This is the best way I figured myself, if you believe you can share a better technique I invite you to do so in the discussion page.\nNote; you should never apply any technique to the bottom of your lake if it's flat and full, just fill it with buckets, the self-replicating nature of the water make it easier on a flat surface.\nBottom up.\nAlright, as you probably know, we can't stack water springs on top of each other\u2014they float. They need to be placed against a solid block first.\nFirst step is, as always, dig your hole the way you want your lake. As always, make sure it's perfect and ready to receive water. Next, fill the bottom of this hole with water, this should be the easy part.\nNow the harder part, which really is only time taking. Make a grid above your first level of water. It must surround one big square made of \"at most\" 4 squares of planned water.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Illustration of what your grid should looks like.\"\nWhen your grid is perfect, you can start filling up. Start by placing water on the inside of the square \"(where the is on the schema above)\". When you're done with that part, replace every block in your grid by a spring of water. There's no particular way to do it that is best, but you must make sure to never, ever, isolate a block. You always want every block to be relied to another block so that you can put a springs in its place. If you goof, refer to the \"there are current\" section. \nNow, to finish your lake you just need to recreate the grid at every layer until you reach the desired size for your pool.\nNote, I said \"at most\" because, if you make a 3x3 square, one block will be out of reach for you to place a water spring. The shape of the grid can be modified to fit the shape of your pool if it's not a square, however, make sure you have a block to place a spring everywhere you need it.\nTop Down.\nThis way works better if you don't actually have a lake yet\u2014in fact if you do, you'll need to fill most of it in with dirt, except for the top layer. (If you don't have a lake or valley at all, you instead dig out the top layer, or at least a 2-block wide outline, 1 block deep.) Go around the edge of your one-block deep depression, and place water in an alternating pattern, like one color of a checkerboard. You should only need to go a couple of squares in\u2014that is, every other space at the edge, and the alternating spaces just inside them\u2014before the water springs multiply to fill your space. If you dug the two-block-outline, at this point you should dig out the interior and let the springs multiply over the whole area. Check for any missing springs and fill them. \nThen, you dig out the next layer of your lake, or a 2-block outline. Again, place springs, but make sure to put them against the new floor. Again, finish digging out the second level of the lake, and let the springs multiply. Repeat for as many layers as you want\u2014for deeper bottoms, you may need help to stay down there long enough to dig. Placing temporary doors is a \"low-tech\" solution, but can destroy springs\u2014to fix that, on your way up, replace the door with two blocks of sand or dirt (plus one if you mined the block beneath it), then mine them from the top down. If you have a helmet with Respiration and/or Aqua Affinity, that can help a lot with deeper lakes. A potion of Night Vision can make it easier to see what you're doing.\nCreative Mode or Silk Touch enchantments Only.\nFill your lake with ice blocks. Place Glowstone blocks on top of the ice every two blocks away. Let the ice melt. Since ice blocks under water blocks turn to water, you only need to melt the top layer. Finally, destroy your glowstone blocks.\nIce is obtainable in survival mode with use of the silk touch enchantment on any tool.\n\"There are currents!\".\nNOTE: A current means there is no spring at the location it is pointing, so when we say \"fill the current\" we really mean \"fill the empty block causing the current\". \n&lt;br&gt;If there are currents, it's alright, you can fix it rather easily. Depending on the kind of lake you've made and the placement of the current, you should either:\n1) Make a line of blocks at the water level and reach the current. When that is done, place a spring on the side to stop the current. Unfortunately, you will need to replace every spring you've eliminated by placing blocks. If you don't want to go through this hassle, you can place the line of blocks one level deeper and reach the current from below. A new spring will be created automatically above the new base you just created. Destroy the line and you're done.\n2) If the pool isn't too deep, you can place a column of blocks that goes under the current, the water will automatically create a new spring to replace the missing one. \n3) If it's an under water current, it means there's a hole in the wall or a stray block is blocking the water above this point. If it's a hole, fill it with either a spring of water or a block according to your preferences/plans. if it's a stray block, destroy it to allow the passage of water or if you want to keep a block there, fill the hole under it with water.\nSwimming in a Lake.\nSadly, there is a con to making lakes this way: while it definitively takes less time, the way the springs are placed will create a downward current. Swimming up in an artificial lake will take a lot more time because of that, however you can fix it by two ways: \nFirst, you can actually fill the hole you made with springs. This will take some time depending of the size of your lake but it will be far easier to swim. I added a sub section with more info to do that in a faster way. See \"Pure Lake\". \nSecond, you can place one or more collumns of springs. While it will still look like a uniform lake, you will have access at a couple of sweet spots to swim up faster. The downside is that if your lake is a little too deep, you'll be dependent of those to swim up. However it will be very useful if you know exactly where you'll need to surface every time.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"The represents only the springs. While the top layer of springs will drop a downward current, the column of springs on the right will have no downward current, thus it won't slow you if you swim upward.\"\nTaking Water From a Lake.\nThe water you see in your lake is superficial, what this means is that, contrarily to a regular pool of water one-block-deep, springs won't auto-regenerate. There's a set number of springs in the top layer of the lake, and if you fill your bucket with one of those, that spring won't be replaced naturally, you'll need to do it yourself by referring to the \"There are currents!\" section above.\nIf you want your lake to give you water forever, you can always fill the bottom layer with water, at this level, the water will regenerate eternally but you'll need to dive to get a new bucket of water.\nIf your lake is too deep or you don't want to dive every time, you can either dig a one block deep line that will go around your lake or build a new pool beside your existing one for your buckets need.\nAlternatively, you can dig a 3x1 hole and fill it with water. You will be able to infinitely take water from the middle block. Also, you can make it 3x2 (or 2x2) and take water from all blocks."}
{"id": "25599", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25599", "title": "Tutorials/Managing slimes in superflat mode", "text": "On &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; maps, &lt;a href=\"Slime\"&gt;slimes&lt;/a&gt; spawn in enormous numbers, and dealing with them can become extremely tedious. Three main tricks are commonly used to handle them, although the first two are outdated methods. The first of these are to build walls or fences around areas you wish to keep slime-free. Fences would stop all slimes as well as any other mobs, or spaced columns of dirt two blocks high with a one-block gap between each will keep out medium and large slimes while still permitting all other mobs (and the harmless tiny slimes) to pass through. The second common trick is to build a slime pit or a 'slime cage' that traps any slime that blunders into it, thereby controlling the problem by coralling the slimes into known locations. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20golems\"&gt;Iron golems&lt;/a&gt; will attract slimes, so adding an iron golem to the slime cage will drastically increase the catch (fencing the iron golem in via fences will prevent it from killing the slimes).\nFinally, there is a third method for versions 1.9 and up. This version uses a clock with a command block.&lt;br&gt;\nIf no slimes at all are desired, then the world can simply be generated with a surface y level above 40, which will stop the slime spawns. For details, see &lt;a href=\"Custom%20world%20preset%23Super_Flat\"&gt;how to create&lt;/a&gt; custom world generation presets.\nSlime pit (Outdated).\nThis slime pit is 5\u00d75\u00d73, and has been dug down to bedrock and given a one-block 'lip'. The lip ensures slimes already in the pit don't sometimes push new arrivals away before they can fall in. Recommended size is about 7\u00d77. 4\u00d74 is about the minimum practical size because otherwise larger slimes arriving at an angle won't fall in. Rather than making one enormous pit, it's usually better to make several medium-sized pits in different areas.\nSlime cage (Outdated).\nThis simple slime cage made of dirt blocks traps small and large slimes but not any other mob type. Note the one-block 'steps' that allow slimes to climb into the cage, but not back out again. Their only escape is to be destroyed or to despawn. If you want to use a slime cage to help keep an area slime-free, put the steps on the inside, then any slime that does appear inside can find its way out, but not back in again.\nThe key idea behind both trap types is to ensure the slimes are trapped rather than killed; once enough slimes are trapped, the mob spawn rate in that area is greatly reduced and new mobs\u00a0\u2014 slime or not\u00a0\u2014 will largely stop spawning. When you want to do some mob farming, simply move 128+ meters away from the slime pit, at which point all the slimes in it will despawn and mobs of all types will then start reappearing elsewhere as they normally would. A good tip is to do this either shortly before nightfall or shortly before dawn to maximize the number of farmable non-slime mobs that appear. By this method you can roughly control the numbers of mobs appearing in an area by luring more or fewer slimes into your slime pits.\nOne minor tip is to ensure your slime pits are dug out of earshot of the areas you spend the most time in, otherwise the sound of dozens of constantly-jumping slimes can also become very wearing.\nNote that given the large area covered by a typical NPC village, if you enclose an entire village inside a single wall, it's highly probable that there will be at least one slime-spawning chunk inside the village. You may wish to place blocks allowing slimes to exit certain areas and not re-enter them in order to keep their numbers manageable.\nUsing snowballs the player can push a slime away from the village or other area, though this is most practical in creative mode. Slimes may also be pushed into lava pits.\nMoat (Outdated).\nA moat uses the same principle as a slime pit, but it takes advantage of the fact that slimes cannot swim. For simply stopping slimes, a one-block deep moat will freeze them in their tracks, but it will only drown the smallest ones. To kill all kinds of slimes, make it three blocks wide and three blocks deep. A water moat has the advantage that it forms a complete barrier against slimes, but is completely harmless to the player and other mobs. Dry moats will capture other mobs and fail to kill the slimes. Moats are also easy to build and look nice. In 1.13 it is possible to use magma blocks to pull slimes and all other mobs down using bubble columns. If there are a lot of nearby villages, the player might be able to fill the moat with lava to kill mobs of all kinds although the only downside is that it destroys the items they drop and experience orbs unless they use hoppers.\nCommand block auto-killer (Creative with cheats only).\nThis simple trick can be achieved by using a repeating &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; with the setting always active on. In the command block, use this simple command: or (The second command stops slimeball drops by teleporting the slimes into the void)\nThe player can also type the following commands directly into the chatbox: (This method will make it so no mobs (including slimes) will spawn in the world)\nTurning on Peaceful Mode.\nOne alternative method is to turn monsters on 'peaceful' mode. This, however, prevents all hostile mobs from spawning, as well as other various in-game effects (such as starvation). \nJava: \nVisit the game menu and change the Difficulty box near the top-right corner by clicking on it. Note: this only works if the difficulty is not locked. \nBedrock: \nPause, go to options, and then find the 'game' tab. You should be able to change it from there. \nOn both, though, you can do \nUsing the MobSpawning Gamerule.\nThe best option if you want to keep peaceful off, but still keep the mobs away, is to use '/gamerule doMobSpawning false'. Though this does have a downside, even peaceful mobs won't spawn, they also won't despawn. Meaning any mobs already in the world are unaffected. Spawners are immune to this gamerule, meaning they can be used to continue having mobs spawn, without the ones you don't want.\nThis can either be set at the beginning of a java world, in the newer 'gamerules' window when creating a world, or can be changed midgame if your cheats are turned on.\nTo turn this on, either open your chat, or hit the slash key, dependent on what your keybinds are set to. Then type in; '/gamerule doMobSpawning false' and hit enter.\nIn bedrock, it's a world setting. Simply open your world settings, scroll to the box that says 'Mob Spawning' and turn it off."}
{"id": "138095", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=138095", "title": "Tutorials/Manhunt", "text": "A Manhunt is a twist on \"Minecraft\" speedrunning. Rather than trying to beat the clock, players become either a runner or a hunter; runners have to stay alive and &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;beat the game&lt;/a&gt; while a variable amount of hunters hunt the runner down and try to kill them.\nThe first known \"Minecraft\" Manhunt video is named \"Minecraft Manhunt #1\", created by a YouTuber named Dastro on the 27th of September 2014. Since then, content creators such as have blown up and popularised the idea. There are other variants of this which include multiple players chasing the runner, random item drops, etc.\nNOTE: Not all manhunt videos are legitimate, meaning you won't truly get an idea of an actual manhunt just from watching YouTube videos, since some are intentionally scripted.\nThis page will give you some tips on how to set up the manhunt, how to survive as a runner, and how to kill the runner as a hunter.\nSetting up.\nInvite 2-4 friends (recommended for manhunts, but you can invite more). Tell them the plan and how it's going to be, and tell them that its a manhunt. Make sure they know how to do a manhunt, and then you can start and say start when ready. Also, if you want a tracking compass you need to use 3 commands to set up tracking compasses. First, \n/execute at (put runner name here) run setworldspawn ~ ~ ~. Make sure to use a repeating command block and set it to always active. This makes it so the world spawn is constantly being set to the speedrunner, and compasses always point to the world spawn. Second, /gamerule commandBlockOutput false this simply prevents the spamming of the coordinates the speedrunner is at in chat. Last, /forceload add ~ ~ this forceloads the chunk the command block is in so it won't stop setting the world spawn. This also has to be a repeating command block set to always active. Also, have the hunters set their spawns in a bed at spawn. Since the world spawn is constantly being set to the runner, the hunters will spawn right behind the runner if they die, so they need to set their spawns.\nAs the runner.\nAs the runner, you need to start by getting as far away from the hunter(s) as fast as you can because even if you kill them once near the beginning of the challenge, they will respawn immediately and could come to attack you again. You are not allowed to respawn under any circumstances, even if you are in a duo; if one dies it turns into a solo run.\nAfter you get away at the start, look for a cave and take about 36 iron (24 for full iron armor, 3 for pickaxe, 3 for axe, 1 for shield, 1 for flint and steel, 1 for shovel and 3 for a bucket) and if you find some, attempt to locate some diamonds.\nRemember that a hunter could be around any corner. When being chased by a hunter, never stop moving, and use boats whenever possible. If you stop you might give the hunter a chance to kill you.\nWhen going into the Nether, make sure to take a lot of food because you might be staying there searching for a fortress for a long time and never stop running (command blocked compasses work in 1.16 in the nether).\nRemember to avoid \"clutching\" unless absolutely necessary. An inopportune clutch could end your run.\nAlso if you have low health, you should not stop to eat/heal, you can do it if one or all of the hunters get stuck. Get at least 20 (or more) eyes of ender since the hunters will attempt to get the eye when thrown. If you're in a 1v2 or more hunters manhunt, one hunter will join you attempting to get the eye back and the other can kill you easily since you're not moving (lava or flint and steel). So, after knowing the stronghold's direction, don't attempt to get the eye back, sprint straight away. In the end, shoot the crystals one at a time, don't be greedy (if the hunters are also in the end) since a second of stopping will cost the whole manhunt.\nAs a/the hunter.\nYour goal is to kill the runner. You are able to respawn, so even if you get killed by the runner, you still have a chance. Try to get full iron armor and tools as soon as possible, yet try to stay near the runner's general vicinity. Usually, you'll have a compass that points in the direction of the runner. Remember to use that to your advantage. If you have a group of hunters, try to have one of you collecting resources and materials that can be used later. The other part of the group should trail the runner and try to stop them from progressing. Just remember to kill the runner before they kill the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. \nTips and tricks as a hunter\nAI/Bot Hunter.\nA variant of Manhunt created by User &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.planetminecraft.com/member/kyleong/\"&gt;kyleong on PlanetMinecraft&lt;/a&gt; involves AI (Artificial Intelligence). This variant uses a &lt;a href=\"Data%20Pack\"&gt;Data Pack&lt;/a&gt; that creates a fake player model with an Armor Stand and Armor. This variant is great for players who don\u2019t have the ability to play on a server or can\u2019t play online.\nGameplay.\nPlays Exactly like a Human Man-hunter where this hunter can bridge, block pile, mine, and attack the player when close enough. The player has a 60 second grace period upon starting the game and will receive it again when killed for a new game. The player will also receive a 30 second grace period when entering or changing dimensions. The difficulty of the hunter will increase as time progresses and will receive more abilities as well. Abilities such as stronger armor, tools, weapons, ability to create potions, and others."}
{"id": "138096", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=138096", "title": "Tutorials/Manhunt/Tricks and Traps", "text": "Whether you're a hunter or a runner, tricks and traps can be very helpful in achieving your goal.\nTricks for Both Sides.\n1) Potions\nEasily one of the strategies with the most potential and effect, and also one of the least situational, Potions are a surefire way of getting an advantage over the other side. Many potions are in the game, and a lot of the ingredients are not so hard to get, especially when you need to visit places like the Nether or a cave anyways. Since brewing potions requires blaze rods, this is a strategy for late game, however it is pretty easy to collect 2 or 3 extra blaze rods when you need at least 7 anyways. A lot of potions have useful effects. Some of the more useful ones are:\n&lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt;\nTricks for Runners to Use.\n1) Towering\nThis may seem simple and obvious, but if you are in low health or need to smelt or craft, this could be a game saver. Being this high in the air gives you an advantage over the hunter, as to reach you they have to either tower up to you and risk you hitting them off or have an ender pearl. However, if they have a bow they could knock you off at long range, so I would suggest placing blocks behind you as a sort of makeshift railing. This could also be used to knock hunters off the tower and have them take fall damage. For example, in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/channel/UCTkXRDQl0luXxVQrRQvWS6w\"&gt;Dream's&lt;/a&gt; recent &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR7klyFU_6xM\"&gt;Survivalist vs. 3 Hitmen video,&lt;/a&gt; he lures Sapnap and GeorgeNotFound onto a bridge made of leaves, and uses his shears to break the blocks under them and send them plummeting to the ground many blocks below. In another video, Dream uses a fishing rod to pull his friends off their towers as well. Overall towering is an easy-to-implement plan that gives you an advantage. The only downside is that this strategy is basically a beacon to the hunters, and may not be the best plan for a more sneaky runner who wants to avoid PvP at all costs. Also, unless you can kill the hunters, you are going to have to get past them eventually. Personally, I would recommend practicing your MLG skills before using towers.\n2) Trapped Portal\nA great diversion later game, You can literally booby-trap your portal by surrounding it in cobble (Leave a block on each side of the portal) then placing lava on top, so it flows over the portal. Wait for a Hunter to enter the portal, and punch him into the lava, While you won't get his stuff, you certainly impact the hunters adversely, You can also prevent them from leaving the Nether Portal (One side is blocked with Obsidian, so they can't mine it), and when they enter, attack, They \"cant\" attack you while inside a portal block, Only if they are on the right edge (The one nearest to you, Or on the side they want to mine out from, As they can't mine either), can they attack you, And that's difficult to do, as your keeping them from getting to the right side of the portal, Later, in the End, if your sufficiently far from them you can practically stop them from following you, Simply note the area you appeared in, If over the Void, place Lava around and 4 blocks over the portal, And mine your blocks, It's easier if your under ground, Same thing, Cover the entire spawn pad with lava, Then you have freedom from the hunters, as there \"is\" no way out of that without Ender Pearls, (You can trap them further by creating a second layer of Lava a short distance away with blocks to stop the pearl)\n3) Ambushes\nWhile the Hunters are hot on your trail, you can ambush them with all sorts of environmental glitches, One of the most treacherous is the thin Gravel bits over Lava in the Nether, They often generate only one block thick, You can while running over it, simply place a block, If they are on the plateau, they'll fall in the lava, If not, then they have to build across, However, be careful \"they\" don't do it to you. You can also, if you can get one, use sponges to ruin the hunters water clutches, You can leap into a pool of water nearby, (After towering), Then, when they jump into the pool after you, you can place the sponge into the pool, drying it up, dooming them to falling onto the dry ground, Just be careful not to choose too big a pool, as then your sponge won't dry it all, Also, with a simple block clutch, you can place a few buckets of Lava, If your fast enough, they will be stuck up on their pillars, while you are able to make some distance\n4) Distance\nEasily one of the most useful things you could have in the game, this strategy requires some work. The hunters are sure to chase you, and the terrain, mobs, and other factors could cause you to lose your lead. You will need to use certain tricks and items to cover as much distance as possible, as quickly as possible. Remember that hunters can use these strategies as well. The only reason I put these in the 'runner' section is that it is far more beneficial for the runner than for the hunters. Some strategies to speed up or slow down hunters include using boats or dolphins to cross oceans, water to slow the hunters down, lava and flint and steel to light the hunters on fire, blocks to make the terrain more unpredictable, or give you a bridge over shallow pools of water, terrain generation, potions (specifically speed, splash potion of slowness, or splash potion of poison) and ender pearls. Nether travel is a very good and fast option as well, but will only work if you have enough obsidian to make another nether portal farther away, or can trade with the Piglins to get enough obsidian.\n5) MLGs\nThere are a lot of ways to get the hunters off your tail using MLGs. And when you are just starting, these might come in handy. So you start your manhunt game and come across a village. You will want to turn all their hay bales into bread, right? But hold on one second! Keep at least one of those hay bales with you. Hay bales reduce 80% of most fall damage. So if you don't have a water bucket, or aren't very good at using them to save your life, hay bales will almost 100% save your life from most heights. At least, at the cost of a couple of hearts of damage...\nOne of Dream's most useful tools in manhunt is his boats. Whether he is rowing away in the water or literally gliding with this vehicle, it's one of his most valuable assets. My favorite way he has used boats to help him escape is by gliding by repeatedly getting out of the boat and going back in the boat repeatedly. This allows the boat to stall in the air for a few seconds while covering some distance. so Dream basically figured out a way to fly with a boat. This also counts as an MLG. Some other ways to MLG include sweet berries, cobwebs, horses and donkeys, llamas, striders, vines and ladders, slow falling potions, and more!\nIf you're especially skilled and a hunter is above you, you can steal the item mid-jump and use it for yourself. This is a \"banzai MLG\", which is coined from , where a jumper throws their parachute out the plane, waits, then jumps after it.&lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzai_skydiving\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n6) Knowing the Hunter\nIn Manhunt, knowing your hunter(s) gives you a huge advantage. For example, if you know that you are better at parkour than your friend, try to lure them into a place that will mess up their movement. Or if you know that you are better at PvP than they are you can try to lure them into fighting you 1 on 1. In addition knowing your hunters could let you predict what kind of strategies or traps they could use in advance.\n7) Mind Games\nYou can easily confuse the hunter(s) with mind games. There are different types of mind games that can be used. You can go to the Nether and let them see you earn the advancement, and go out of the nether immediately to gives the hunters the illusion you're still in the Nether. you can make a false cobblestone trail, although that would take some time, so make sure the hunters aren't near you. You could smelt cobblestone to make stone and dig down when they see you, then dig to the side, fill where you are with stone, and they'll think you're still digging. The possibilities are endless.\n8)Pufferfish trap\nThis trap is used for pushing the hunters into the void or the trap. If you get close to the pufferfish (one block radius) you will be poisoned and will be knocked back one block. First, find a suitable spot, or build one. It should be two blocks wide and there should be a wall covering the water block the pufferfish is in. Next, lure the hunters to the trap. MAKE SURE you place the pufferfish at the spot after you past it. The hunters will get knocked off the island and into the void/ your lava\nTricks for Hunters to Use.\n1) Trapping the portals\nAs a Hunter, one of the worst things you can do is let the runner use portals. In order to beat the game, the runner has to visit both the Nether (to collect blaze rods) and the end (to beat the dragon and thus win the game). However, this can be difficult to stop as the runner is going to be bent on reaching the portals. Nether portals are hard to stop players from making, as lava pools are fairly common around the world, but if you use a water bucket you can turn the lava into obsidian and make it much harder for the runner to make the portal. If you are in the nether you could use beds or TNT to break the portal or kill the runner when they come through.\n2) Be aware\nDon't just chase after the runner without a plan. You always want to make sure you maximize your chances of winning a fight by being aware of your surroundings and the runner. If the runner is smart they could have a plan or trap waiting to kill you, so be cautious when giving chase, and don't rush anything. There will always be another chance to kill the runner later, so don't take unnecessary risks. It is always important to know when the right time to give a full on chase is.\n3) Get good loot, and have extras\nOnce the runner has advanced far in the game, It will be important that you have more loot than them. This is because if you lose a fight to the runner late game, the runner will have all your loot and you will have no way to recover, leaving you helpless as the runner finishes the game. It is suggested that you have a chest or a specified hunter carrying gear similar in strength to what you had when you died. That way, if you die, you will be able to get right back in the game immediately without frantically having to mine all over again. It is worth it to do this in the early game rather than later, because the runner will be staying in relatively the same place also gathering resources, so you won't lose ground.\n4) Place beds\nThis may seem obvious but placing beds regularly to reset your respawn point is critical. This allows you respawn in the vicinity of the runner over and over no matter how many times you die. You may not have any loot, (unless you have that chest or another hunter carrying extras) but at least you won't respawn half a world away from the hunter. Be sure your bed is out of reach or properly hidden from the runner. If it's destroyed your respawn point will be set back to world-spawn and not the previous bed you placed, possibly leaving you hundreds or thousands of blocks away.\n5) Disguise\nThis might be a boring strategy if you are eager to fight the hunters, but it might be very helpful in the stronghold. You see, strongholds are hard to navigate. It is really hard to find the portal room. You can make this harder for the speedrunner by using a silk touch pickaxe or smelting cobblestone to make regular stone. Then, collect some bricks from the walls of the stronghold. Go to the entrance and place down the bricks. Make sure to alternate the types of bricks, making it look indistinguishable than a regular brick wall. And then, put stone behind the walls, usually 2 or 3 layers. That way even if the speedrunner gets suspicious and dig into the walls, they will find stone instead of a portal room. \n6) Practice!\nPracticing is crucial for manhunts. You might need to use a different mechanic or game strategy each time or the hunters will get wise and catch on. You might've used the \"run away\" strategy, but even if you got away the first time, there are almost endless amounts of variables in a minecraft manhunt. So you need to swap strategies each time. The best way to determine which strategy is the best strategy is practice."}

{"id": "28192", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28192", "title": "Tutorials/Mapping", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Map\"&gt;map page&lt;/a&gt; explains how to craft maps and how they automatically draw themselves as you move through the world. That page also explains maps' limitations and pitfalls. For example, crafting a batch of maps all at once (using shift-click) is generally not helpful because they'll all be duplicates of one another.\nMap sets.\nWhen crafting sets of maps, there are two approaches. The first is to travel well outside the current map's edge before crafting a new map, which will conserve map-crafting resources and keep confusingly redundant map space to a minimum. The other method is to deliberately ensure an overlap so that it's easier to find the same landmarks on multiple maps.\nThe zoom-levels introduced in the Pretty Scary Update make the 'overlap' technique of little benefit on any map at zoom level 0 (none) through 3, because an overview map at the next zoom level 'stitches' the maps together.\nMap basics.\nRegardless of which technique is used, it's helpful to be systematic in the order you craft the maps. For example, you might make Map #0 (prior to the Pretty Scary Update this was designated \"map_0\") at the center of the area you want to cover. When maps are crafted (eight paper surrounding a compass) they are initially \"Empty Maps\" (data value 395). Holding an empty map and right clicking with it will activate it (data value 358) and draw the current terrain to a radius of 100-120 blocks. The map will be centered on a block that is a multiple of 128 on the x &amp; z axis and will cover an area of 128\u00d7128 blocks. Thus, if you are at or near the center block, a zoom-level 0 map is nearly complete when crafted from an empty map. \nIf you want to keep that map, you should duplicate it at that point by placing it and an \"Empty Map\" on your crafting area or table. If one of those is then placed in the center of a crafting table and surrounded by eight paper, a zoom-level 1 map is crafted. This map will cover an area 256\u00d7256 blocks and would be labeled \"Map #1\" (assuming no other maps were created in the meantime).\nThis \"zoom-out\" step can be repeated three more times with each resultant map, yielding Map #2 (512\u00d7512), Map #3 (1024\u00d71024), and Map #4 (2048\u00d72048).\nMapping step-by-step.\nTo start, move to a spot within 64 blocks of 0,0 (x and z coordinates should each be between -64 and 64) and activate an Empty Map (Map #0). Duplicate it and use the duplicate to craft a zoom-level 1 (Map #1). Use Map #1 to create a zoom-level 2 map (Map #2), and use that to craft a zoom-level 3 map (Map #3). Duplicate Map #3 and use one to craft a zoom-level 4 map (Map #4) which will provide you with an overview map. This zoom-level 4 map will provide you with a good general orientation\u2014there is a lot of territory to explore within a 2048\u00d72048-block area. \nTo create a set of zoom-level 3 maps which will better show structures you should then move north to a spot approximately (within 64 blocks) of 0,y,1024. Here, craft a new zoom-level 0 map (Map #5) from an Empty Map. Zoom it out to a zoom-level 3 map (Map #8) which will be retained. Then travel east to a spot within 64 blocks of 1024,y,1024. Craft a zoom-level 0 map (Map #9) and zoom out to a zoom-level 3 map (Map #12) which will be retained. Continuing clockwise, you would proceed south repeat the craft-and-zoom process at:\nYou will now have nine zoom-level 3 maps which cover completely the territory shown by the zoom-level 4 overview map. The set of 9 zoom-level 3 maps actually cover 512 blocks beyond the zoom-level 4 map. Each will be centered on the border of the zoom-level 4 map (and four of which will be centered on the corners of the level-4 map). You can, of course, retain any of the intermediate maps by duplicating them before you zoom them. If you don't duplicate before zooming, you won't be able to obtain them again without using server commands (e.g., \"/give &lt;player&gt; 358 1 &lt;map#&gt;\", where \"358\" is the data value for a map and 1 is the number of maps to give) or inventory editors.\nTrack maps' relative positions.\nIt's helpful to keep track of the relative positions of the maps. A useful method of displaying the map set is to craft 10 &lt;a href=\"Item%20Frames\"&gt;Item Frames&lt;/a&gt; and place them on a wall in a 3-by-3 square with the tenth atop or beside the square. Place the zoom-level 4 overview in the tenth item frame. Place the nine maps in their appropriate positions in the 3\u00d73 square. A sign can be added which identifies the origin and perhaps the corner coordinates. You could also duplicate any of these which you wish to carry with you while fully exploring an area. Information added to one copy will be automatically updated to all other copies. (Note that crafting a second map of the same area\u2014not duplicating, but crafting anew\u2014will create a map that is NOT linked to the original version, and it will thus NOT be updated even though it covers exactly the same area.)\nIn the illustration, the sign provides the map # of each of the maps shown. Map #127 is the center map. Map #185 is the map to the north, #189 to the right of that, and the numbering continues clockwise.\nAs another option, use a chest, and store the maps in slots in the chest that correspond with their in-world positions. If you use this trick, be careful to put them back in the right place once done with them.\nYou could also craft a Book &amp; Quill (data value 386) in which you can write descriptions of what the map-set covers. This is a useful place to make notes of interesting spots found on those maps. That Book &amp; Quill can be placed in an item frame next to the map set.\nAnother trick is to name maps on an anvil. You can name a map for its center or its position relative to other maps, i.e. (0,0) at the origin of your mapping, (0,1) one map east of the origin.\nAvoiding overlaps.\nThis section applies to pre-1.8 games. See the following section on the bountiful update for versions 1.8 and above. \nFollowing the Pretty Scary Update, zoom-level 0 maps will not overlap\u2014they are created with each center 128 blocks from each other center. Since the center-most map has an origin of 0,y,0, each zoom-level 0 map has an x-coordinate and z-coordinate which are each a multiple of 128. All maps created within 64 blocks of a particular pre-defined center will be identical.\nHigher zoom-level maps \"can\" overlap one another because they can be crafted from zoom-level 0 maps that are centered only 128 blocks from each other. A zoom-level 1 map, for example, covers 256\u00d7256 blocks. So if you create a zoom-level 1 map from a zoom-level 0 map centered on (128,y,128)--which would cover a square bounded by the points (64,y,64)-(192,y,64)-(192,y,192)-(64,y,192)--the zoom-level 1 map will cover a square bounded by the points (0,y,0)-(256,y,0)-(256,y,256)-(0,y,256). The zoom-level 0 map adjacent (to the east) would be centered at (256,y,128) and described by the four points (192,y,64)-(320,y,64)-(320,y,192)-(192,y,192). A zoom-level 1 map crafted from this second zoom-level 0 map would be described by the points (128,y,0)-(384,y,0)-(384,y,256)-(128,y,256). The left half of this second zoom-level 1 map will overlap the right half of the first zoom-level 1 map. The illustration on the right \"may\" help.\nTo keep zoom-level 1 maps from overlapping, ensure that each is built from a zoom-level zero with x- and z-coordinates that are multiples of 256. To keep zoom-level 2 maps from overlapping, build them from zoom-level 0 maps with x/z coordinates that are multiples of 512. Zoom-level 3 maps should only be crafted from zoom-level 0 maps centered on x/z coordinates that are multiples of 1024; and zoom-level 4 maps should be crafted from zoom-level 0 maps with x/z coordinates that are multiples of 2048.\nTip: Mark the center of maps by placing a sign labeled it with the map number, and light it up or mark it in some way so that it's easier to find again. Additionally, craft a duplicate map and place it in a frame at that spot. The map (or its duplicate) will display with a green pointer shown at the location of the item frame.\nTip: Surface lava pools make good landmarks as they show up as red dots on zoomed-out maps. The higher the zoom-level, however, the larger the pool must be before it shows up. You can, of course, make your own lava pool, just be sure it is open to the sky. To be safe, you can cover the lava pools with glass to keep players, mobs, and drops from falling in.\nTip: While attempting to create a new map adjacent to an existing map, make sure to move 10-15 blocks beyond what appears to be the border of the existing map before creating the new map. There a band where the player marker seems off the map, but it's still technically inside the mapped area. Creating a new map just after crossing the \"border\" of the current map frequently results in the same map.\nTip: The &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Time-Saving%20Tips%23Maps\"&gt;Time-Saving Tips&lt;/a&gt; page has some extra suggestions for making mapping quicker and safer.\nChanges in Bountiful Update.\nAs of Minecraft 1.8 the mapping system changed considerably. Overlapping maps are no longer possible to create at all. Each zoom level of maps has a grid that all maps now align to. The top left corner of each map now aligns to the (x,z) coordinate (-64, -64) +- (m,n)*size. Where m and n are any integer numbers and size is the map size (128 for zoom level 0, up to 2048 for zoom level 4). The most notable change is that maps no longer zoom out from the center as in version 1.7 but snap to the grid.\nAssuming one wants to make maps which cover the origin (0,0) and surrounding area, 4 maps are required. Follow these steps:\nThis will create 4 perfectly aligned maps covering the origin with the least amount of traveling.\nThe map numbers will cover the area clockwise from \"top left\" (i.e. NW-NE-SE-SW)."}

Officially, \"Minecraft\" uses the , and each block is considered to be 1 . When you measure long distances, it's easier to count if you mark the terrain with a space of 4 blocks between each marked block. The first marker represents a zero. Every second marker (ignoring the zero-mark) is then a 10-meter mark. Make a distinguished mark at the 21st marker to represent a hundred (100), because the first marker block represents zero (0). Use a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; to mark larger numbers to save time and resources.\n(ZERO) 1 2 3 4 (MARK) 1 2 3 4 (10 METERS) 1 2 3 4 (MARK) 1 2 3 4 (20 METERS) ...\nIf you wish to know distance in miles, you can arbitrarily decide that each block is 1 cubic yard. Then 1 mile is exactly 1760 yards. Otherwise, keeping the \"official\" metric units, because one mile converts to 1609.3 meters, it is practical to consider a mile to be 1610 blocks long. Use the metric method (4 block spacing between). Make 161 x 10th meter marks. Use a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; to mark larger numbers to save time and resources.\nViewing exact coordinates in-game.\nBedrock Edition.\n you can turn on the \"View coordinates\" switch in your game settings. This isn't a cheat, so doing this doesn't affect your ability to earn &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s, and it makes distance measuring quite easy. It is also a great aid to keep from getting lost if you don't have a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Java Edition\".\n, if you press F3, the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; shows your present location in &lt;a href=\"Map%23Coordinates%20and%20Cardinal%20Directions\"&gt;X, Y and Z coordinates&lt;/a&gt;. Measuring distances between two locations or waypoints is as easy as subtraction, if you walk in a cardinal direction. Otherwise you must make use of the Pythagorean theorem to compute the distance. This is not strictly in-game, but it makes a drastic difference in gameplay, avoiding a lot of frustrated wandering. Note that the X and Z coordinates are horizontal and can be positive or negative (the &lt;a href=\"spawn%20point\"&gt;spawn point&lt;/a&gt; is fairly close to 0, 0), but the Y coordinate represents your altitude, and Y=-64 is the bedrock floor of the game world.\nRelative to green line.\nThis method is much faster and requires no building, though may not be 100% accurate. After going into the debug screen, the crosshairs are replaced with 3 colored lines. Take the length of a line running perpendicular to a block edge or face (e.g., the green line when looking at the top of a block). If one normal sized block is the same height as the green line, the player is standing about 60 blocks away from it. 1.5 blocks means 95 blocks away, 2 blocks long means 130 blocks away etc.\nHumans and mobs can also be used for measurement. Pressing F3 + B shows hitboxes. If the green line is as high as a player hitbox, he is about 125 blocks away.\nWith this, observable distances can be measured very quickly. However, aiming upward or downward shrinks the line and that has to be accounted for if one measure distances far above or below him.\nThe crosshair or the blue and red line can of course also be used, but as the crosshair is slightly transparent and the blue/red line changes with the X-Axis, they are obviously not recommended unless you're playing before 1.8 or are trying to measure distances at a 90\u00b0 angle above or below you, respectively.\nCalculating coordinates of distant locations.\nCalculate a distant object's X and Z coordinates using the tilt angle in the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; by estimating the target's elevation from a vantage point significantly higher or lower in elevation. Typically you would pillar up about 50 to 60 blocks, or climb a tall mountain, and use the direction and downward tilt angle of the target with your coordinates to calculate first the horizontal distance to the target, then the X and Z coordinates of the target based on that distance and direction.\nPointing at the target, using &lt;a href=\"Options%23Options\"&gt;FOV&lt;/a&gt; 30 or a &lt;a href=\"spyglass\"&gt;spyglass&lt;/a&gt; for greatest accuracy, and the debug screen on, divide the difference in elevation by the tangent of the tilt angle. If you are on a high mountaintop at Y=137 and you see an &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Geode\"&gt;Amethyst Geode&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;, you can estimate it is at &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;, or Y=63. The debug screen says you are at codice_1 and two lines below that, you are looking at a target codice_2. Your tilt angle is 21.9\u00b0 and your rotation is 360 - 136.2 = 223.8\u00b0, converting from \"Minecraft\"'s -180\u00b0/+180\u00b0 notation to conventional 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 notation. The elevation difference, \u2206Y, is 137 - 63 = 74. Find the distance by dividing \u2206Y by the tangent of the tilt angle: 74 \u00f7 tan (21.9) = 74 \u00f7 0.402 = 184.08 blocks.\nYour vector to the geode is 184 blocks facing the direction -136.2, or 223.8\u00b0. To find the coordinate components of this vector, multiply the distance times the sine of the direction for the \u2206X, adding that to your X position, and multiply the distance times the cosine of the direction for the \u2206Z, adding that to your Z position. The geode's \u2206X is 184.08 \u2219 sin (223.8) = 184.08 \u2219 -0.692 = -127.41. Subtract this from your X, so -743.349 - (-127.41) = 615.93. The \u2206Z is 184.08 \u2219 cos (223.8) = 184.08 \u2219 -0.723 = -132.86. Add this to your Z, 540.144 + (-132.86) = 540.144 - 132.86 = 407.28.\nIf you're confused whether to add or subtract for your X and Z values, use the debug screen for a sanity check, and note again \"Facing: north (toward negative Z)\". The target's Z is somewhat \"less\" than your Z value of 540, hinting that you want to subtract 132 from 540 to get 407. If you turn a little to the right, you can verify the target is \"east\" of you, \"toward positive X\", so you're looking for a number greater than (i.e. less negative than) your X position of -743, so you want to subtract \"negative\" 127 from -723, which is -734 + 127 = -615.\nKeep in mind that small errors can be magnified at great distances. Each one block error in your estimate of the target block's elevation can cause errors of several blocks in the X and Y coordinates, though generally for things you can see within 20 to 30 chunks, it's close enough that you can see the target when you get there.\nConserving markers.\nIf the measurement is being taken above ground, and lighting the entire path is not necessary, place the markers as above. When 100 m is reached, the 10 m markers can be removed and reused for the next 100 m run. This allows for the path to be constructed without having to count 100 blocks at a time, while still allowing the markers on the completed path to be easily followed without using too much material.\nVolume and surface area.\nThe formula for the volume of a cube is s3, where s stands for the measurement of one of the cube's side. Since each side of a normal \"Minecraft\" block is 1 meter, this would equal 13, which would result in 1 m3. This works the same for yards, or any other unit of length. So do the rest of these comments.\nThe formula for the sa of a cube is 6s2, where s stands for the measurement of one of the cube's side. Since each side of a normal individual \"Minecraft\" block is 1 meter, this would equal 6\u00d712, which would equal 6\u00d71, which would result in 6m2. \nAs you make something bigger in all directions, its surface area increases faster than its length, but not as fast as its volume. The surface area tells you how many blocks you'll need for the outer walls, but your interior furnishings probably increase according to the volume. Of course, shape matters: An 8\u00d78\u00d71 layer of dirt corresponds to a stack of 64 dirt blocks, but so does a 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube, or a 2\u00d72\u00d716 trench or shaft.\nUsing the Euclidean distance formula.\nSometimes the need arises in which you need to measure distances that don't align with the X or Z axes, which is easy to do with a little algebra. The formula for Euclidean distance (in two dimensions), where \"d\" is the distance:\nWhere:\nExample.\nSuppose the F3 debug screen shows the following at Location 1:\n XYZ: -35.313 / 68.00000 / 97.489\nThese numbers are coordinates in meters. At Location 2, it shows:\n XYZ: 76.793 / 43.00000 / -5.113\nUsually, the decimal points can be truncated (ignored), as usually you don't want to cloud your results with where you happen to be standing within each block. In two-dimensional (map) coordinates, we also ignore the elevation (Y value). Hence, those two screens give us the following coordinates:\n x1, z1 = -35, 97\n x2, z2 = 76, -5\nNow we simply plug those numbers in to the distance formula, above: \nConsidering horizontal (map) distance only, the two locations are 150.75 m apart.\nEuclidean distance in 3 dimensions (including elevation).\nThe above calculation is correct if you want the \"map\" distance between two points (i.e., only the north\u2013south (z) and East/West (x) distance). But if you wish to include the elevation (y) in the distance calculation as well, that's very easy to do: Simply add the y coordinates to the above distance formula:\nReferencing the above debug screens again, our 3-dimensional coordinates are as follows:\n x1, y1, z1 = -35, 68, 97\n x2, y2, z2 = 76, 43, -5\nAgain, solving for \"d\": \nWith the elevation considered, the two locations are 152.8 m apart. Note that, in this example, including the 25 m elevation resulted in a difference of about 2 m (2 blocks).\nSimple distance formula.\nIf you only need the length of a straight line of blocks, there is a simpler formula, not too unlike the Euclidean formula.\nformula_7\nWhere:\nUnlike with the Euclidean formula, this formula only requires values from one axis, giving you the distance of a single-block-wide line."}

These systems are built from simple components and normally involve some kind of user input, such as breaking a torch, which generates some kind of result, like a door being revealed. Mechanisms can range from simple switches that open and close doors from a safe distance, to complex devices such as combination locks that prevent intruders from entering your fort.\nComponents.\nThese are the basic, modular parts that can be combined to form any complex mechanism. Please note that individual items in the game are not considered components. Also, not all of these components have to be used when making a mechanism.\nRedstone components.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Circuit\"&gt;redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt; for an overview of simple components and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Advanced%20redstone%20circuits\"&gt;advanced redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt; for more complicated redstone mechanisms.\nMechanisms.\nMechanisms are useful devices made from the combination of components. Here are some examples:\nMinecart storage system.\nThis is a storage system that allows a user to call a minecart and return them.\nPotion dispenser.\nFor this device, you can stand on a pressure plate and make splash potions shoot out of a dispenser. See the following steps for how to make it:\nSee the following video for a better demonstration:\nVending machine.\nThis is a customizable vending machine that is relatively easy to make. Unfortunately, it does require a lot of iron.\nNotes:\nHidden floor staircase.\nThis is fairly easy to make. Below the floorboard's blocks, you put a face-up &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; that is powered when off, done by a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;, and then the next block in the floor has a double-piston extender, also powered when off, and then a triple piston extender, and so on, so when the sticky pistons are powered off, then the blocks will be pulled down into a staircase. \nHidden wall staircase.\nThis design features a hidden staircase in the wall, revealed by triggering a redstone signal in some way, such as interacting with a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;. There are many ways of making this. Look at the following videos for some examples:\nRapid pit bomber.\nTo make this design, make a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; attached to a redstone clock mechanism and hopper to feed it items. In front of the dispenser, place a &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20redstone\"&gt;block of redstone&lt;/a&gt; and fill a chest above the hopper with &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20TNT\"&gt;minecart with TNT&lt;/a&gt;. This will rapidly dispense those TNT minecarts onto a powered rail and into a massive crater of their own. It can even tunnel down to bedrock given enough carts.\nProgrammable item store.\nThis is a system that will let you program what items you want to sell, how many you will give, what you want to be paid and how many of those to be paid. It will lock when it's empty. This is a very compact system that is also tile-able. \nTwo wire control.\nWith a lot of repeaters and AND-gates it is possible to control multiple outputs with only two wires. It can be very tricky to get the timing right. You need a pulse generator in both wires to get a pulse with a defined length and in most cases, the output pulse needs to be made longer. As shown in this video you have a top wire and a bottom wire with repeater. On one side you have repeater between the &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s on the top wire and none (or as needed) in the bottom wire. On the other side none (or as needed) on the top wire and matching repeater (to the other top side) on the bottom one. between which you place AND-gates (matching the &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s). The idea is that the signals only meet at one AND gate at the same time.\nVideo tutorial: \nExample use:\nPiston doors.\n1x2 flush with the wall piston door. Fitting in a 2x4x4 space.\n1x2 Hidden Piston Door\nThese \"Jeb doors\" can also be referred to as flush-inset &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; doors. Here is an example of one of these, with a redstone torch key system added on. Once broken down, it's not extremely difficult to build.\nFor an easy &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; door with no &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s:\nPiston One-Way Elevators.\n5x4.\nThis design allows one to get a great view on the surroundings and enables you to connect and stop on any floor you want. The video also contains horizontal &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; transport.\n4x4.\n or \nThis design is even more compact than the previous one; however, it blocks sight. It's great for building elevators in shafts. Note: you need to set the pistons to 3 instead of 2. The first is still to be set on 4.\nPiston Two-Way Elevators.\nTwo-way elevators can be built, but they are slower and much more complex than the previous ones. They also require a lot more space and resources.\nThe two-way elevator can be built the following way:\nThe engine shown below of this text uses wool between the pistons and the fence gates/trapdoors. However, instead of wool any other block can be put there, as long as pistons can push it. \nThe schematics for the wiring assuming that you know how to make a 1 tick long impulse. A 1 tick long impulse can be obtained using a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Circuits%23Pulse_Limiters\"&gt;pulse limiter&lt;/a&gt;. In both of the schematics, empty squares represent air blocks, and repeaters all have the minimum delay possible. \nA screenshot of an implementation of this design:\nAlso, see this video for a larger two-way elevator:\nCompact block swapper.\nThis is a quick video tutorial on how to make a compact block swapper.\nBank system.\nThis is a simple bank system using powered rails, which should be helpful for Minecrafters less experienced with redstone. \nDetecting redstone placement.\nThis silent BUD switch design updates not only when there is an update going on adjacent to it, but also updates when there is redstone wire placed 1 block away from the BUD switch.\nOne-Way Redstone Pulse.\nThis is intended to be used in narrow passageways. Since a piston takes 1 tick to extend, you can make a tiny &lt;a href=\"monostable%20circuit\"&gt;monostable circuit&lt;/a&gt; that is activated by a pressure plate. Then, place a sticky piston with a block attached one block away from the monostable circuit, in which the sticky piston is connected to another pressure plate, one block away from the other. Then connect the blocks on the bottom layers with repeaters.\nThe output is the block that is pushed by the sticky piston. The output is on when a player walks from one pressure plate to the other, but only in one direction.\nIn the diagram, it looks like this (the inputs are below pressure plates):\nSelf-destructing mechanisms.\nSelf-destruct mechanisms are useful when destroying critical buildings or creating secret areas.\nRedstone False-3D Lighting Monitor.\nThis is the False3D Monitor, if you place a second row of &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s above the first row you can produce 2x2 pixels. To complete the look of the monitor, you need to place &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; in front of the sticky pistons to determine what color the pixels are, example: &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;. This happens because when the sticky piston pushes the \"pixel block\" and then the shading and the 3D cause the pixel to be visible by the player(s). This can generally be used for any purpose regarding visuals, it can also be used for a mob trap if used properly. And there you have it.\nRedstone lamp floor.\nA redstone wired sequence of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;s to mimic the lighting of a working floor. It is pretty easy and very good looking. \nNether Basalt Bridge Builder.\nA compact \"flying\" machine to make a thin basalt bridge across a lava lake."}

Although they are mostly self-explanatory, some things may need explaining. If you need help navigating the menu, simply find the appropriate section of this tutorial.\nThere are two major menu groups in \"Minecraft: Java Edition\": the Main Menu and the Pause Menu.\nMain Menu.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Main%20menu\"&gt;Main Menu&lt;/a&gt;\" is what you first see when you enter the game. It appears with a moving panorama of a world beneath the group of buttons, the version number at the bottom left, as well as shows the game's logo with a &lt;a href=\"splash\"&gt;splash&lt;/a&gt; to its bottom-right. This menu allows you to choose which game type to play as well as access \"&lt;a href=\"Realms\"&gt;Realms&lt;/a&gt;\", the game &lt;a href=\"Options\"&gt;Options&lt;/a&gt;, or quit the game.\nSingleplayer.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Singleplayer\"&gt;Singleplayer&lt;/a&gt;\" button, located at the top of the group of buttons on the main menu, leads you to the screen as shown at the right. At the top of the screen, there is a space where you can search for any of your currently created worlds. In this menu, you can view, edit, and play all of your Singleplayer &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s. If you don't have any worlds, the game will direct you to the Create New World scene.\nIn the example at the right, there are two different worlds. Each world has its own section in the list, which contains the following information:\nAlso found below the worlds list is a group of buttons which are explained below:\nCreating a New World.\nAs mentioned earlier, creating a new world will take you to another screen which allows you to change the settings of the world to be made.\nMore World Options.\nSet presets for the superflat world to generate.\nCustomize how the buffet world will generate.\nMultiplayer.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;\" button, found below the Singleplayer button, takes you to the Multiplayer Menu which lets you join servers with other players, whether online or nearby. It appears with a list of known servers which you may connect to. When you first log in, the message \"Scanning for games on your local network\" will appear, meaning it is scanning for nearby servers which have been opened to LAN via the &lt;a href=\"%23Pause%20Menu\"&gt;Pause Menu&lt;/a&gt;. You will also find several buttons on the bottom of the interface.\nIn order to add servers to your server list, you will need to use the \"Add Server\" button, which takes you to a new menu where you can add a server by entering its name and address.\nMinecraft Realms.\nThe third button on the main menu is labeled \"Minecraft Realms.\" This button will take you to the \"Homepage\" of Realms. Here you can perform all of the basic actions associated with Realms, which are as follows:\nThe majority of these functions can be carried out by clicking on a Realm and using the button group at the bottom of the screen. Invitations can be accessed via the envelope next to the Realms logo. The \"What is Realms?\" link in the upper right hand corner takes you to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//minecraft.net/realms\"&gt;Realms website&lt;/a&gt; where you can learn more about the program.\nThere is a distinct difference between the server list in the &lt;a href=\"%23Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; screen and the Realms list. Here you can see all of the basic information about the Realm you may need. The exact layout is shown here:\nInvitations.\nInvitations can be accepted or declined via the envelope next to the Realms logo. If you have an invitation, you will see a little number dancing on the envelope. If the little number is instead a \"!!!\", then it means that you have more than five invitations.\nIf you hover over the envelope, a tooltip will appear. It will either say \"No pending invitations!\" or \"Pending invitations!\" If you click on this when you have some invitations, it will take you to a screen where you can accept or decline various invites.\nThe example as shown at the right is a list of any and all Realms you have been invited to. The operations here are simple: You simply click on an item and you can either accept the invitation or decline it.\nOnce you have been invited to a Realm and accepted it the Realm will appear on your Realm list. At any time you can click on that Realm and click the \"Leave Realm\" button, which will uninvite you from that Realm until such time as you are invited again.\nIf you decline an invite your name is taken back off the invited list of that Realm, but keep in mind that the owner can re-invite you at any time. If you are getting spammed with an invite from a particular person and you don't want to see them again, email the &lt;a href=\"mailto%3Arealms%40mojang.com\"&gt;support address&lt;/a&gt; and they may be able to help.\nRealm Configuration.\nThe owner of a Realm has the ability to configure their Realm from inside \"minecraft:java edition\". To access the configuration screen, you simply click on your Realm and click the \"Configure\" button.\nFrom this screen, you can completely manage your Realm and its players. Written below is a detailed walkthrough of everything you can do to manage your Realm.\nExpired Realms.\nAfter your subscription for a Realm expires, it is transferred to expired status. Many things in the interface change, as seen in the pictures below. Your server status indicator turns red, and when hovered over displays the message \"Expired Server\". It will remain like this, as far as anyone knows, indefinitely. You can extend the Realm when it is in this state to keep the same server."}

If you wish to have separate directories (e.g., for other machines: Minecraft/Linux, Minecraft/Windows, Minecraft/Toaster, etc.), then you should create them on Dropbox and change the instructions here as needed. This guide also will only sync your saved game files, not any .jar customizations (such as mods) or texture packs. If you don't know what those are, then you're probably safe. Note also that you should be careful only to play on one machine (as server) at a time using the shared save folder, otherwise you risk corrupting your saved worlds. (This warning is applicable if, for example, you and your friend share a save directory from different machines. It is unlikely to be a problem if you are only using the machines yourself.)\nDownload and Install Dropbox.\nThe first step is to download Dropbox. Dropbox is a nifty little tool that automatically syncs content to their servers and allows you to access it both online and through a client on your PC. The good thing about Dropbox is that it is cross-platform, plus available on the web and web-enabled smartphones. (Note: you can also use another cloud storage program that has a downloadable client [folder that syncs to the web], such as Google Drive, etc.)\nGo to https://www.dropbox.com. You get 2GB for free automatically.\nOnce you have installed Dropbox, you'll need to know where the Dropbox folder is:\nWhichever operating system you are using, Dropbox has very good documentation and can assist you in finding help: http://www.dropbox.com/help\nCopy your Minecraft saved data to your Dropbox folder.\nNext, we will need to make a copy of your Minecraft saved game data on the cloud Dropbox server. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be copying the codice_5 folder from the codice_6 folder into a folder called codice_7 inside your Dropbox folder. You can store it elsewhere in your Dropbox if you choose.\nWindows.\nOn Windows, your Minecraft data folder is in your application data folder. You can access this by holding Windows+R or hitting Start &gt; Run and then typing codice_8 in the box. This will open your minecraft folder. Copy the folder named codice_5 to the desired location in your Dropbox. In this tutorial, we will be creating a folder called codice_7 in the main Dropbox folder and storing the saves folder inside that.\nOnce these files are done copying, navigate back up to your codice_6 folder, and rename the saves folder to codice_12. This step ensures that you 1) Have a backup of your files in case of a catastrophe, and 2) allows us to make the symbolic link to the correct location in a later step.\nMacOS.\nIn MacOS, the Minecraft data folder is located in your Username &gt; Library &gt; Application Support folder. You can get here quickly by opening Finder \u2192 Go \u2192 Go To Folder \u2192 type codice_13. For future reference, it's best to make an alias for this folder and copy it to your desktop.\nNow, copy the saves folder to the desired location in your Dropbox. It is a good idea to rename the original saves folder (in your codice_14 Application Support folder) to codice_12, to be saved as a backup in case something goes haywire. It also allows us to make the symbolic link to the correct location in a later step.\nLinux.\nIn Linux, your Minecraft data folder is located in your user home folder. However, it may be hidden from view. If you are using a GUI, ensure that you choose View &gt; Show Hidden Files.\nCopy the contents of the save folder to your Dropbox. As mentioned above, in this tutorial we create a folder inside the dropbox called codice_7 to store the saves folder in.\nOnce the copy is complete, rename the saves folder to codice_12.\nIf you're command line savvy, here are the above steps in command line format.\ncodice_18\nCreate the Symbolic Links.\nThis is the final step that will allow users to use the cloud versions of their files.\nMacOS.\nIf you moved your Dropbox to something other than the default location you\u2019ll need to modify that first path.\nLinux.\n\"In order to link any additional computers you wish to play on, you just need to follow these steps - install Dropbox, and create the symbolic links.

{"id": "3870", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3870", "title": "Tutorials/Minecart booster", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Minecart\"&gt;Minecart&lt;/a&gt;s behave in a unique manner when running alongside one another - they accelerate rapidly. This effect is used to create boosters. A booster consists of a short track with another minecart placed next to the track you want to boost. The two tracks must have one or more blocks of contact. When your minecart is next to the other cart, they will both accelerate. There is a maximum speed (8\u00a0m/s, 1 block = 1 meter), but the internal value from which speed is derived is not capped, allowing the cart to maintain the maximum speed for much longer than it would normally be able to. However, if a minecart is repeatedly accelerated this way for a long period of time, it may suddenly stop, most likely due to an integer overflow resetting the value to zero. To avoid this, make sure that no cart is continuously being boosted over a long period of time.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0v5cAFYouWY%23t%3D4m52s\"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt; of two boosters in a loop. The first booster loop is continuously working, which will eventually cause the cart to stop. The second booster loop provides a pause by stopping every cart, every iteration. This creates a more reliable system.\nBoosting Principle.\nDo take note that the methods above are not the only configurations that can be used to boost a minecart. Instead, rely on the following principle when designing booster systems:\nLauncher types.\nLaunchers are boosters that are activated with a button.\nNew-style door launchers.\nThis launcher is an improvement over the classic door launchers. A door properly placed above a block will prevent a minecart from passing through the block only when it's opened.\nClassic door launchers.\nThis launcher uses a ladder in order to hold a minecart in place. Opening a door will release the minecart onto the track below it.\nThe minecart sits on a door, which is wired to a button or other mechanism using &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;. When the door is momentarily opened, the minecart drops onto a section of slanted track next to the minecart to be boosted.\nA ladder piece is necessary to keep the minecart in place.\nNOTE: In laggy multiplayer conditions, the booster cart will occasionally have trouble resetting itself properly. To help the booster cart get back up the hill with sufficient speed to get into its correct position on top of the door, an additional uphill auto-reset booster (see above) can be placed on the far side of the mechanism from the main track.\nPowered Rail launchers.\nThis launcher is similar in function to a door launcher, but uses a Powered Rail to launch the booster cart and is much simpler in design. The player presses a button to power the rail and launch the booster cart, which then turns around and stops on the unpowered rail ready to be used again.\nBooster types.\nTwo-way corner manual-reset.\nThis example demonstrates a two-way manual reset booster. The booster only requires a manual reset should you want to go the same direction twice. It is an excellent solution for those who prefer to have minimal alterations made to their terrain.\nOne-way up-downhill manual-reset.\nThis allows you to boost minecarts up or down a hill. Note that you must already be moving to reach the booster while travelling uphill.\nOne-way auto-reset (south-west rule).\nThese are two possible configurations for one-way resetting boosters based on the &lt;a href=\"Rails%23South-west%20Rule\"&gt;south-west rule&lt;/a&gt;. The one on the left is a south\u2192north booster, and the one on the right is a west\u2192east booster. \nOne-way auto-reset (based on inclination).\nThis booster uses a raised auto-reset loop, so that it can be built in any direction. The booster minecart will go through the loop and fall onto the inclined track, going back to the starting position.\nOne-way auto-reset (reduced reset loop).\nThis booster is just like the previous booster but only requires three tracks for the auto-reset loop. It takes a couple more steps. \nFirst build the tracks like this. In order to bend the third track around so that it resets, you need to add a block above the track like this.\nThen place a track on top of the block. That will bend the third track into its proper placement. \nThe last step is to remove the block.\nOne-way auto-reset (leveled and omnidirectional).\nThis booster uses a simple loop that throws the cart back onto the track, since the track is angled it hops onto the track and continues in a straight line, ignoring the S-W rule that applies when running into perpendicular tracks.\nTwo-way auto-reset.\nHere is an example of a two-way resetting booster that is direction-independent (its cardinal direction doesn't matter):\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUXJsrvghosU\"&gt;Video demonstration&lt;/a&gt;\nTwo-way corner auto-reset.\nAn example of a two-way booster for corners that auto-resets.\nTwo-way auto-reset compact design.\nHere is an example of a two-way resetting booster that is direction-independent. This design is a little more compact. \nTwo-way auto-reset efficient design.\nHere is yet another two-way gravity powered auto-reseting booster - the lower cart pictured (the booster) sits in the center of a symmetrical section of track, and will always come to rest at that point. This may be the most efficient when it comes to amount of iron that is needed to make it. This design was made by alfadark on Reddit.\nIt should be noted that this design requires time to settle after each use and it may only propel users a few blocks. This design should not be used on heavily used tracks or on multi-player.\nUphill auto-reset booster.\nThis is a simple, compact and effective way of going uphill. It won't boost you downhill, but gravity will handle things for you there.\nAn other version, only to extend the distance your minecart is able to cover.\nBooster in turns.\nThere are two ways to make your booster keep working even if you need to make a turn. Follow the picture below to make one, but there are two restrictions on its usage:\nThe second way to still have a booster work after a turn:\nunlike the one above this one will work for any number of turns.\nIt is 5x5x4 and uses only 16 pieces of track.\nAuto-Start booster.\nGetting a minecart going initially can be tricky and requires good timing to place the cart, push off, and jump in. This setup simplifies the process by giving the cart a boost from a dead stop. This is a useful configuration to have at stations in a minecart network.\nThe outer loop cart, once started, is repeatedly boosted by the inner cart, which simply travels back and forth along its short track. The outer loop cart in turn can be used to boost a stationary cart placed next to the corners. Just wait for the outer loop cart to pass, place your cart, get in, and when the outer loop cart loops around again your cart will get a boost.\nUnfortunately, the loop cart can bug out after a while, which while easily fixed, is still annoying.\nThe following design of an auto-start holding station attempts to rectify the infinite loop bug encountered in the above design. Place carts 1 and 3 in their initial positions as shown, then drop cart 2 into its initial position from above to start the perpetual motion.\nCart 1 is a simple uphill booster used to force cart 2 back to its initial position. Cart 2 actually drives the rider's cart (cart 3). Point 4 is a position for a switch that will allow cart 3 to exit the loop. The rider can then enter at any point after point 4. Point 5 shows the return track for Cart 3. The rider can exit at any time before point 5 or after point 4 safely (cart 3 will likely go around its full track again, so this design is inefficient for long tracks).\nAfter cart 3 has left the holding station, cart 2 will always move just far enough from its initial position to reach cart 1, boosting it uphill. Both return to their initial positions, stopping each iteration, allowing for perpetual motion without infinite momentum.\nDouble Booster.\nThis is a way that you can put two carts into one, which is believed to more than double the distance you can get out of your booster.\nIn order to make the double booster, you need to put a block, then a piece of track (may require two tracks in order to align the cart correctly) above the cart to be doubled and place a cart on that track. \nNext remove the block. This will drop the first cart into the second, merging them. At least, until they fall off the track. \nYou can also ride \"them\" and they'll move nearly forever if there is no dead end. It also moves slower off track and can move through water.\nHere is another way to create the double booster. The carts will collide and merge partially, creating the same effect as the double booster explained above. This version, however, can be used automatically since there is no need dig any blocks. Using this method you can also merge more that two carts, but the results will usually be more or less unstable.\nSpin Booster.\nThis is a simple principle, it involves 4 minecart tracks, and 2 minecarts. You put the 4 tracks in a circle, and then place 1 minecart on a track in that circle, and place the other one opposite. Then, put your track for transport next to it. When a minecart is pushed into it, it boosts it. PLEASE NOTE the minecarts sometimes have to be replaced.\nAnother method of Spin Boosting is to use 8 minecart tracks and 5 minecarts. This is easier to determine the direction the booster will take effect.\nThis method should be avoided in multiplayer as it creates high amounts of lag.\nSpin boosters still work in modern versions of the game, but generally require more carts and don't provide as large of a boost.\nTriple Booster.\nPossibly the simplest booster (recommended for long, level tracks) only requires a single track and three minecarts. Line the carts up on the track and push the rear one into the other two repeatedly, and at least two of the carts will lock together and boost each other continuously until they reach their destination. This is a bug that seems to have to do with the carts hitting each other, so this may take a few attempts. As such, it's recommended to make the rear cart a &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Minecart\"&gt;Powered Minecart&lt;/a&gt; and start it with a few coal, then jump in the front cart so you don't get left behind. The powered cart will knock into the other two until the bug kicks in.\nC-Booster.\nThe C-Booster, also known as the collision booster, is a relatively small booster that produces max speed and momentum instantly, allowing fast uphill travel and instant speed. To make one, dig two trenches in the ground, both one block deep, two blocks wide, and 1 block in length. These trenches/lines must be parallel. Place minecart tracks inside them, then link them together in the area in the center by placing a line of track. Cover the trenches with any block, and place two minecarts per line of track. You should now have four closely compacted minecarts. If another minecart directly approaches it and bumps into a minecart inside the C-Booster, it will instantly accelerate in the opposite direction at max speed and max momentum.\nThe direction of the boost may change randomly.\nCredit goes to Moosety on the Minecraft forums for the discovery of this booster.\nReverse Double-V Booster.\nThis booster is a booster where you get blasted out the same way you come in very powerfully. It is auto-resetting.\nMultiplayer Tips.\nCertain types of boosters should be avoided in multiplayer, as they can cause lag or may work unreliably."}

Images below do not always show a space-saving design, but rather one that makes all components immediately visible.\nAbsolute basics.\nMinecarts.\nThe following are the most important properties of minecarts.\nRails.\nPlease see the individual pages for each type of rail for information on their properties and basic usage:\nThe rest of this page discusses the use of these components in building tracks and rail transport systems.\nBest practices for laying tracks.\nThe performance of a rail line is affected by the way the track is placed. \"Turning next to a wall\" (see below) or having hills to climb adversely affect the speed of a cart, and so its distance traveled.\nSome YouTube videos suggested that diagonal track might offer better performance than straight runs; this has not been proven to be the case. Another distance trial track was constructed with a length of 300 blocks. Carts with no rider travel the same distance as on the straight track, about 18 blocks before they stop, and a cart with a player riding can make it to the end of the track. The interaction with blocks next to the track seems to be a little stronger with carts on a diagonal track. With lampposts placed only every 10 blocks along the track an unmanned cart could cover only 12 blocks, and with a player riding just over 180 blocks, a significant reduction.\nWhat the tests have confirmed is the increase in speed. On each curved track, a cart effectively moves 2 blocks, thus its maximum speed is 11.314 m/s, an improvement over the maximum of 8 m/s on a straight track.\nA minecart with no rider, at full speed, can climb 10 blocks on unpowered, upward sloping rail. This suggests that powered track is needed at this height only to keep a cart climbing. However, the cart slows so much that it can reach only another 5 blocks high with 2 lengths of powered track starting at 9 blocks high. Further testing showed the minimum number of powered blocks to keep the cart climbing well is 3 powered rails every 6 blocks starting at 9 blocks high, at the cost of a strong reduction in speed. To maintain speed in a climb, a ratio of 5:4, powered versus regular rail segments, is a good compromise for decent speed at a reasonable cost, starting with 2 powered rails on the flat before the upward slope to be sure the cart starts the climb at maximum speed.\nIf construction cost is no object one can of course use powered rails all the way to the top to get the best possible performance.\nCarts with a rider, or chest carts, have more momentum and so climb higher than one that is unloaded. With a rider, a cart can climb at least 24 blocks before needed powered rails to go higher.\nRunning a track next to a wall makes no difference to the speed of progress, but an adjacent one-block-high wall significantly slows down a cart if the cart is pointed at the wall while entering a turn or \"diagonal\" section.\nPowered rails.\nBehavior.\n&lt;a href=\"Powered%20rails\"&gt;Powered rails&lt;/a&gt; may be activated by &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; to turn them \"on\" which makes them able to add momentum to carts already moving over them. When unpowered they are \"off\" and strongly reduce the momentum of a cart passing over them.\nNote that a minecart placed on an active powered rail cannot move as it has no motion for the powered rail to add to. Once the cart is pushed, its rider uses a forward or backward move, or a block placed at one of its ends, the cart's direction of motion is set and the powered rail can affect it.\nIf a cart is placed on an inactive powered rail that is sloped the braking effect is strong enough to keep it stationary against \"gravity\". if the powered rail is then turned on gravity is enough to start the cart rolling downhill, which then causes the rail to affect the cart's momentum. \nA rail that is \"off\" slows carts passing over it as if by friction. A single inactive rail is enough to completely halt a cart in most cases. Carts that are loaded and/or at full speed cannot be stopped by just one block, but two \"off\" rails can stop it. On a long downslope, a stretch of three inactive rails are required to be sure of halting a speeding, loaded cart.\nPowering.\nPower can be transmitted to the rail from any of the six adjacent positions (above, below, or any side) in the same way redstone is powered.\nPowered rails propagate power to each other if they are adjacent and part of the same track, for up to 9 blocks from the power source (1 being powered directly which is propagated to 8 adjacent rails). They also receive power from any adjacent &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt;s (when a cart passes over it), even if they are not part of the same track (which follows from the rules above).\nBecause the detector rail powers attached rails, it could be used to activate power rails only when necessary:\nIn practice, it is far more efficient to have powered rails constantly active using other means:\nMomentum.\nThe speed of a cart which is boosted using Powered Rails is calculated to be at the maximum of 8 m/s, however, the cart maintains an internal \"momentum\" value that keeps the cart at the maximum speed of 8 m/s until the excess momentum is depleted.\nA single powered rail on the flat ground against a stop block gives an occupied cart enough momentum to travel 80 rail tiles on a flat surface, or 8 tiles for an unoccupied cart. Tests show that putting several powered rails in a row has observable diminishing returns with each additional powered rail on how much farther a cart travels. This implies that the momentum gained is smaller if the cart's speed is faster and vice versa.\nTests show that climbing slopes impact momentum severely, thus the cart speed plummets fast. However, if there is enough surplus momentum, carts easily travel up slopes. Conversely, carts traveling down slopes gain momentum. Downward sloped powered rails add both the momentum from the rails and the momentum from going downhill to your cart.\nClimbing slopes.\nLaunching from rest via four powered rails, an occupied cart has enough momentum to climb a 1/1 slope 10 blocks high without further boosting and then travel horizontally at a very slow speed for at least a dozen blocks before coming to a stop. Such a cart does not have enough momentum to climb an 11 block high slope. An empty cart in a similar setup can climb only 5 blocks and then travel a few blocks horizontally.\nWhen minecarts travel upslope without having sufficient stored momentum, a powered rail is needed 1 every 4 blocks to sustain movement all the way to the top of the slope, Alternatively, 2 every 8 blocks are somewhat easier to supply power to (note that this doesn't seem to be working as of patch 1.14.4, and may require additional testing) However, note this is a worst-case scenario where there is no momentum to start with.\nIf working with empty carts (for instance, a storage cart transport system), 1 powered every 2 blocks is necessary to sustain the movement. To minimize powering requirements, 2 powered followed by 2 unpowered can also be used (analogous to loaded player-carrying carts). \nWhen traveling up a slope at full speed (8 m/s) one powered rail is sufficient to maintain full speed for two blocks high, meaning that alternating between powered and unpowered rails maintains full speed up a slope. Consecutive powered rails on a slope adds more momentum, so eight powered rails can be followed by 8 normal rails to maintain full speed while traveling up the slope. Less momentum is gained by each consecutive rail as the strip gets longer.\nOptimal use.\nA test was conducted by building straight tracks 2000 blocks long on level ground with different intervals of powered rails. The time to travel the full 2 km length on a player/mob occupied minecart was recorded with each interval. The following table lists the results:\nThe time to travel the full 2 km length is different for all the other minecart type, requiring more powered rails to reach the top speed of 8 m/s. The following table lists the data collected: . Note that the optimal rail spacing for a fully loaded cart differs, see the original reference for details.\nThree powered rails in a row on flat terrain is sufficient to boost all minecart types from rest to the maximum speed of 8 m/s.\nThereafter, the optimal spacing of powered rails on a level track is to use 1 every 38 blocks for occupied carts (that is, a repeating pattern of 1 powered rail followed by 37 normal rails, then another powered rail, and so on) which maintains a constant minecart speed of 7.97 m/s. If gold is in short supply, it is possible to use powered rails with more space between them at the cost of reduced overall speed (see above). If you definitely must have the full 8 m/s you should place a powered rail on a level track 1 every 34 blocks for occupied carts.\nFor all other (utility) minecart types, the optimal spacing of powered rails on a level track is to use 1 every 27 blocks for \"empty\" utility carts (1 powered rail followed by 26 normal rails). A full utility minecart requires much more at 1 every 6 blocks.\nAn optimal use requires the synchronization of minecart movement and powered rail placement; moving a powered rail a single block forward or back along a track can make a significant difference. This is because the momentum of a minecart is increased \"per tick\" (=1/20 of a second) the cart spends on a powered rail (by 0.9 m/s for occupied carts). When a cart travels at the maximum 8 m/s on a straight track, it alternately spends either 2 or 3 ticks on each block. For optimal placement, the powered rail must be put where the cart spends 3 ticks, otherwise, one-third of the boost is wasted.\nA diagonal track is a track that consists of the pattern 'left corner' attached to a 'right corner' attached to a 'left corner' and so on. When minecarts travel on a diagonal track, the camera is held steady in the diagonal direction and the minecart visually travels diagonally along the track as well. The speed limit of minecarts is actually 8 m/s \"per cardinal axis\", thus when traveling on 2D tracks, the cart travels 8 m/s in both cardinal directions of travel to result in a net vector of about 11.3 m/s or the square root of 128. With a 3D track, you travel as fast as 13.85 m/s or the square root of 192.\nBecause of this difference, there is also a difference between the optimal spacing of powered rails when used on a 2D track when compared to straight travel on flat terrain. You need powered rail every 53.7225 (rounded to 54) curved rail. This can be worked out through ratios, comparing 8m/s for 38 rails (the optimal distance for straight rails) to 11.31m/s to work out the value of 53.7225. Therefore for a combination of straight and curved, a curved rail is equivalent to 0.707 of a straight rail. To maintain maximum speed, you must keep the value under 38. For example one combination could be 31 straight rails with 10 curved rails as this is the equivalent of 38 straight rails.\nThere is also a difference in unmanned (empty) or storage minecarts, so a shorter interval is needed if these carts are expected on the track. The optimal pattern to make storage minecarts move quickly is 3:1 (1 powered rail every 4th block). Compared to shorter intervals, the reduction in speed is minimal. The widest possible interval seems to be 8:1 (power every 9th block) -- any longer, and the minecart does not reliably reach its destination. In practice, 7:1 may be better, as an 8:1 pattern will have empty carts coming nearly to a stop between the powered rails, and will fail given any interference whatsoever.\nUsage of detector rails.\nA &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt; can power 4 adjacent blocks and 2 blocks below it when a minecart, occupied or empty, is on it. This makes it possible to activate powered rails inline without &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es or wiring. \nA detector can be used to activate adjacent powered rails. However, if the detector is used to activate more than two or three (depending on approach speed) powered rails, the rails deactivate before the minecart reaches them, bringing the cart to an immediate stop.\nOne-way powered rail lines can be created by placing a detector rail before a powered rail. This way, occupied carts are boosted only if they are traveling the proper direction. Carts going the \"wrong\" way come to a stop because the powered rail is inactive.\nAlthough inefficient, A two-way rail line can be created by placing detector rails on either side of the powered rail.\nAlternately, placing powered and detector rails on a 1\u00d71 slope does not propel a cart more than 3 blocks upward if there is not enough initial momentum. The cart loses too much speed on the incline, meaning it can't make it from the detector rail to the powered rail before the powered rail returns to the \"off\" state. If the cart is in a train of two or more carts, the last cart in the train becomes stuck instead.\nA detector rail could also be used to activate an event based on a cart's location. For example, a fail-safe can be created to release a stopped cart in order to prevent a collision with an arriving cart. The arriving cart passes over a detector rail, activating a powered rail that boosts the resting cart away.\nAdditional properties.\nCurved power rails exist in only the case where the final direction is toward the east (with the powered rail appearing in the north-south orientation), or in a T-junction where one path faces east along a north/south track. It is possible to make a one-way curved railway using power rails, but not a bi-directional one.\nWhen placing rails, &lt;a href=\"Rail\"&gt;regular rails&lt;/a&gt; prefer to curve toward the powered rail. In cases such as these, the &lt;a href=\"south-west%20rule\"&gt;south-west rule&lt;/a&gt; applies.\nA cart reverses direction when it collides with an object (wall, single block, player, other carts) while traveling on a powered rail. It does not reverse direction if it collides with a translucent block, such as &lt;a href=\"stone%20slab\"&gt;stone slab&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;. If a track including powered rails is bordered by blocks acting as \"buffers\", the cart continues back and forth along the track indefinitely. Having carts interact with each other on a short track designed this way can be used to chain multiple carts together as a \"train\". Once aligned, they all move together at relatively the same speed. \nHow far the charge passes down adjacent rails is independent of the length of redstone wire. Even if the rails are connected to a redstone torch by 15 blocks of redstone dust, the 8 adjacent rails still receive power despite the fact that they should be out of range for the torch.\nParts of a simple system.\nPowered rail mechanisms.\nStop points.\nIt is possible to make points in your track where a cart is stopped and then jumpstarted again by player input. This can be useful for creating checkpoints to certain sites of interest in your world. This can be done by using two powered track pieces on a one-block incline, by having the first powered track piece going down, with the second powered track piece at the bottom and a button placed alongside the second powered track piece, so that the button is directly above the track.\nWhen the cart comes to this point, it stops on the incline, allowing the cart to use gravity to start the boost when the button is pushed. Players can then either stay in the cart and carry on to the next stop, or leave the cart at the station for themselves/other players to use later.\nA \"two-way\" stop can be made by combining two of the normal stops with a &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt; in between. This pauses a minecart traveling in either direction and allow them to be restarted by pressing a button. \nStarting boost.\nTo create a simple initial boost device using 2 &lt;a href=\"powered%20rails\"&gt;powered rails&lt;/a&gt;, dig a hole 1 block deep and 2 blocks long. Place the powered rails inside the trench, connect one end to the track that you wish the minecart to exit. Finally, place the minecart on the powered rail. Once power is applied to the rail, the minecart is boosted out.\nWhen one end of a powered rail has a solid block placed next to it a stationary cart on it gets accelerated away from the block. There are two common ways to exploit this behavior:\n\"Whirligig\" cyclical minecart accelerator.\nWith simple switching, a minecart can be temporarily diverted into a small loop of powered rails and left there to accelerate. After a delay, which can be achieved with either repeaters or a hopper timer, a second switch can be activated to set the minecart loose down the track. Using this method, with fairly modest delays (in the range of 10-20 seconds) a set of four powered rails can be used to propel a minecart at full speed for several hundred blocks, thus vastly exceeding the efficiency of placing powered rails along the track.\nLauncher.\nLaunchers, stations or exits all refer to a point in the system where a rider can safely enter or exit a minecart. They generally use a button to launch the cart.\nThis first design uses a button, a few powered rails, a bit of redstone wire, and a redstone torch. The button powers the powered rail which launches the cart away from the solid block behind it. In this style of launcher, it is important for an incoming minecart to make it all the way up to the back block so it can easily be launched again.\nThis second design is essentially the same as the first. A &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; replaces the solid block behind the last powered rail. The dispenser launches the minecart just like the solid block, but creates a convenient place to store extra minecarts. To activate, use the button behind the dispenser to cause a minecart to pop onto the rail, ready for use.\nRider detection.\nPlayers may want to detect whether a cart contains a player, because empty carts can clog a rail system. This is referred to as rider detection.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tripwire%20Hook\"&gt;trip wire&lt;/a&gt; based design is quick to set up and reliably detects a player. However, it doesn't detect some non-player mobs, specifically 'short' &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; (wolves, spiders, pigs, etc.).\nTo build, a tripwire is attached to hooks one block above the track. Two blocks further is a junction which is set by default to turn empty carts back to the station. An empty minecart does not trigger the tripwire, so it is sent back. An occupied minecart crossing a tripwire sends a short pulse to the junction and continue along the rest of the track.\nDepending on orientation, the signal may need to be inverted with a redstone torch. The torch adds a minor delay, but this shouldn't affect the results. This design assumes the minecart is moving at top speed. If your minecart is moving slower than that, you can either add delay to the wire using repeaters or increase the speed of the minecart with a booster just before the tripwire.\nAnother method to check for a rider is to take advantage of the change in the speed of the cart, as an empty cart slows down more quickly. In this design, a minecart creates a pulse when it passes the detector rail. If the minecart is empty, it gets to the turn just as the signal does and be sent back. If the minecart has a rider, it gets to the turn before the signal and be able to continue on. This design requires the track to be set by default to let the cart through.\nEmpty carts.\nWhen an empty cart is detected, generally it's a good idea to send it into an overflowing pile. An overflow pile is a drop of two or more blocks with a rail at the bottom. When carts are boosted into the hole, they snap to the track, regardless of how many carts are already on the track. This pile should be placed where the carts can be collected, either close to a station or in a maintenance area. It is important to boost carts to full speed just before they are dropped to ensure they don't become stuck on the end of the track and eventually back up the system.\nAnother variant of this method is to replace the rail at the bottom with a cactus, thus destroying minecarts that fall in. Placement of a hopper next to the sand on which the cactus is placed then allows saving of at least some of the carts.\nA &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; loaded with &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;s break minecart entities, dropping them as items. Placing a detector rail above a hopper, with the dispenser facing the detector rail, collects minecarts as items, which can then be stored in a chest or routed to a cart dispenser.\nBoosters.\nBoosters are a method used to prevent carts from slowing to a stop on a track. Because carts eventually slow to a halt on level track, and very quick turn around on regular rail track while uphill-bound, boosters are a method of assuring one's cart keeps moving. Boosters accelerate carts to a terminal velocity of 8\u00a0m/s, as they use powered rails, and help effectively counter the forces of friction and gravity on the acceleration of the cart. \nBoosters are simply a single powered segment of powered rail, powered through detector rails, redstone torches or levers next to them. Refer to the diagrams to the right. \nPlayers generally keep the distance between boosters uniform, although these distances vary by player. One common, and according to many, the most efficient, distribution of powered rails is to place powered rail every 38 blocks on level ground. An easy way to place a lot of track using this count without needing to keep track of each rail is by dividing the rails into stacks of 37, as shown on the right. Approximately 1 out of every 3 rails must be powered to travel uphill due to gravity.\nJunction.\nStations often have one line leading to one destination. Multiple destinations require multiple lines. A junction is a fork in the track where the rider can select which destination they wish to visit.\nThis design uses a lever to switch the track. The powered rail becomes powered after a preset delay. The detector rail starts the delay. In this design, the lever always points toward the selected destination regardless of direction.\nA junction that has multiple destinations can be set up by expanding the junctions. In the design to the right, the rider is given much more time to select their destination than a two-way junction. They can select any destination by first selecting left or right, then forward or backward. This design doesn't scale well but can be used in sequence to create any number of destinations.\nMultiple destination selector.\nThere are many, many styles of minecart destination selectors. Most are modular, meaning they can be extended to include more destinations. An RS-NOR latch array is often used to select a destination as these latches have a designated reset line (as opposed to a t-flip flop which has only one input).\nThis design was selected for its simplicity and for its ability to be expanded with relative ease. One of the buttons on the selection panel is a designated reset line since additional input doesn't clear the previous selection; that is to say, a player can select more than one destination with this design (although a launched minecart takes the left-most of the selected destinations).\n by CNB\nThe following design is heavily influenced by the previous but uses a different RS-NOR latch design involving pistons. It has a reset integrated in the selection such that a new input clears the previous one. By removing the designated reset line of the previous version, it allows for an additional station in a similar amount of space.\nPiston bolt.\nThis consists of a lot of curved tracks and many pistons. The pistons push the minecart extremely quickly down the line.\nTroubleshooting.\nWhen a track system isn't working properly, it can be difficult to fix for someone unfamiliar with redstone and rails.\nCommon solutions include:\nSearching on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/\"&gt;minecraft forums&lt;/a&gt; can help. If you need to create a new post, be sure to include the direction you're working (the F number), as directionality can be a factor in the design."}

There is combat in the context of &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, however it is not gratuitous killing and not at all graphic (certain server mods or command block contraptions may make players emit particles like broken &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; to represent blood - these, however, are not common on most servers). There is also a &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, so younger players do not have to encounter enemies apart from &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; (which only attack if provoked) and, to a lesser extent, villager-made &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s.

There you have an option to turn off your chat, you will see no member talk, and you cannot talk. However, it is recommended that you instead set it to \"Commands only\", as completely switching off chat will prevent the usage of useful commands such as /home.\nTechnical ability.\n\"Minecraft\" can be easily set up by a parent for their child to play.

However, it can be dangerous and time-consuming if not done well. Below are some tips provided by the community for performing this underground work.\nMining layers.\nDue to being the safest layers to mine where all &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s exist in reasonable quantities (especially diamond), layer 10 to 15 are usually considered the best area in which to start mining. The single best layer for mining is highly debated and is not agreed on. Using the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; (F3) (&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; exclusive) or coordinates (&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; setting) is the easiest way to find the player's altitude. The player can also look for lava pools, all air between Y=-63 and -55 are turned to lava during world generation. (Mining at this layer ensures that the floor remains intact if they pour water). The player can even find and stand on the uppermost layer of bedrock, then climb up 6 blocks. Once they have located their desired layer, they can begin mining using one of the techniques listed below.\nPreparing to mine.\nIt is helpful to bring &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;weapons,&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;. The player may want to bring a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; if they are spending several days underground, so they do not have to go back to their house to sleep. One must also make sure to bring two or more stacks of sticks, as they can quickly be crafted into a pickaxe, torch, sword, etc. if one is in dire need of one. A clock is also very helpful because you can tell when it is daytime so that you can safely return to the surface. Also, if the player has spare iron, it's recommended to bring iron pickaxes instead of stone pickaxes as they mine faster and have higher durability. If the player is looking for obsidian, then they need to have a diamond pickaxe. If you are mining in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt;, it is often good to bring a few &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, as well as all the previous things, other than a bed (Because beds explode in the nether). Also it is a good idea to know the coordinates of your portal, so that you don't get lost. Another good thing to bring to the nether is a piece of gold armor, as that will keep the &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt; from attacking. \nGetting lost in a cave without food may result in starvation. Without a weapon, the player will be defenseless from the large number of mobs that spawn in the darkness underground. A shield is also a good way to protect yourself in the dark.\nSome good weapons are a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, as these provide the best attack or the best durability. Swords have less attack than a trident, but much more durability, a bow is very good for range, and has a good durability, but as you are in a closed area, it may not be as good, and a trident can be both ranged and melee with a lot of attack power.\nIf players are prone to losing the way back or simply want to be more safe, try marking their path with torches or another unique block, such as signs, wood planks or wool. This also helps them to recover their items if they die. Carving out a safe room containing furnaces, a crafting table, a bed and a chest might be well worth their time. If they spend lots of time underground, they may want to bring resources for a more sophisticated base with.\nLava is highly dangerous and becomes quite common on lower levels, so remember to bring two water buckets when mining. Two buckets allow the player to create an infinite water source to replenish their water supply. Dig a 2\u00d72 hole and place water in two opposing corners and now they have infinite water. This can also be done by placing water at both ends of a 3\u00d71 hole. This can help the player get to ores above lava. Just place the water next to the lava source, and the water will convert the lava blocks on top of the pool to obsidian. In the nether, this will not work, as you cannot place water, so it is a good idea to make a fire resistance potion, as that will negate all fire damage, and as there are many lava pockets hidden in the wall, as well as giant lava seas, it will help.\nArmor is essential for reducing the damage taken by hostile mobs and lava.\nThere are three basic ways to start off the mine, though they can be combined:\nCave mining.\nAlso known as \"cave hunting\", \"caving\", or \"spelunking\", cave mining is simply the practice of exploring caves and extracting the ores found on its walls, floors and ceilings. Exploring a large cave system almost always results in finding large quantities of ore, though players probably will find bigger blobs of ore unexposed, because cave generation sometimes cuts off the blob generation. Cave mining has a high return on investment, yielding more ore per unit time and requiring fewer tools (less &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; is lost mining stone, dirt, and gravel) than other approaches.\nOn the other hand, cave mining is also quite dangerous. Unexplored caves are dark and tend to contain many hostile &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; are necessities. The player should carry a large supply of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es to light up the cave to prevent hostile mobs from spawning. If accessible, potions of night vision can be a good alternative to torches as they can light up the entire cave, but they are also unstackable and can be quite costly earlier on. Large cave systems can become confusing and dangerous. Special attention must be paid to navigation, lest one quickly gets lost. Moving through a cave too quickly makes it easy to miss unlit passages around the player where monsters can come out, and increases the chance of falling into a hole. This becomes extremely dangerous when the player is stuck in there and encounters mobs. Players can also fall into a lava pool which will result not only in death but in all of their items being destroyed in the lava. All air blocks are converted to lava during generation below Y=-55. Because of these factors, players usually carefully explore and light a cave before extracting ores. Another disadvantage to cave mining is that when ores generate exposed in a cave, they have a 50% chance of the generation being cancelled. Therefore, the ore amount per chunk is lower in chunks where there is a big cave.\nThe &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; article contains tips on dealing with large cave systems, while the Navigation tutorial has &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Navigation%23Underground%20Navigation\"&gt;a section on caverns&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is a good idea to carry a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Caves often contain random lava flows, and cave areas below level 10 are filled with large lava pools. A bucket of water serves as both a fire extinguisher, if the player fall in; and as a way to form &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; surfaces over lava pools (pour water onto a solid block adjacent to a lava pool; do not stand between that spot and the lava). If the monsters are too much trouble, the player can also go to options and change the difficulty to \"peaceful\" to prevent mobs from spawning. However, the player could still die from lava, so don't forget that water bucket.\nCaves often contain dead-end passages and shafts, or masses of gravel and dirt blocking the way. Many of these dead ends are actually thin barriers that, if removed, reveal continuing passages, sometimes into entire adjacent cave systems. 'Drifting' is a term for simply searching for adjacent caves by digging beyond apparent dead ends. Drifting can be effective in finding &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s if there are mob sounds audible at a dead end. Once players can make &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, those can also help detect nearby caves, even through rock: Set one up facing against a wall, and power it with a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;. If there's an open space within 12 blocks ahead of the piston, it will push a hole into the wall.\nMineshafts.\n&lt;a href=\"Mineshaft\"&gt;Mineshaft&lt;/a&gt; structures are often found intersecting caves, but the player may well stumble into one of these while mining their own tunnels. Dealing with them is similar to ordinary cave mining, but resources are more plentiful, especially log and &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; obtained from shears and swords (from &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s). The string can also be crafted into &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; for markers. The special hazards here are that it's easier to get lost in mineshaft tunnels: they look dangerously similar, and pre-placed torches make it harder to know which places they have already explored. An idea for not getting lost in a mineshaft is to place torches only on the left side of the wall, so that when returning, the torches will always be on the right. Mineshafts can contain &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s which are rather difficult to reach and destroy. Often, there can be more than one in a small area, so even if the player destroys a monster spawner, be alert of the possibility of more monster spawners being in the area. There can be two, three or (very rarely) even four cave spider monster spawners within 16 blocks (or less) of one another, but usually, there is at most one monster spawner in any given area. If a cave spider is encountered, make sure to quickly place a torch before it becomes hostile, and if it already is hostile, place a water bucket so that they will be pushed back by the flowing water, making it easier to kill. Build a 2 block tall pillar so you can attack the cave spiders while they are climbing up the pole, keeping them at bay and keeping yourself from taking damage.\nSince supports of tunnels are made out of &lt;a href=\"plank\"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt;s and fences, the need to surface due to wood shortage is also lower. Fences can be used to block off potentially dangerous areas such as cave spider monster spawners. In addition, mineshafts contain broken sections of &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20chest\"&gt;minecart with chest&lt;/a&gt;s with loot. These rails can be reassembled into complete tracks for transporting loot. One method to avoid getting lost is simply to remove everything (supports, rails etc.) from the tunnel, leaving only a plain 3\u00d73 tunnel. This makes it much easier to recall where the player has been, although it takes quite a bit longer (and uses lots of axes). Signs and other markers are also very helpful here.\nCaves under sand.\nIf players are mining in an area with sand or gravel, like a desert &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, they can break the sand or gravel blocks and see if any others fall. If any does fall, they know there is something beneath. This can be rather dangerous if blocks fall beneath players, but they can place ladders or dig their way out. If done during the day, hostile mobs will mostly burn or go neutral in the sun, but as always, watch out for creepers. Also, the fallen sand or gravel can cover ores. Another event is that it is possible that there is lava under the sand. This is most common under mountains. There could also be a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; under the sand, so be prepared to fight or retreat.\nShaft Mining.\nAlso known as \"Vertical Mining\", \"Strip Mining\", or \"Shafting\", Shaft Mining consists of digging the player's own tunnels to expose hidden resources. The usual warning for digging applies: Watch out for uncorking lava or water or for digging into a deep drop or inhabited cavern. While doing this, make sure to be careful as the player might remove a block holding back lava or separating them from a drop or hostile mobs.\nThe best way to mine is to dig 3 blocks forward and dig 5 blocks to either side. Alternatively, you can get 2 trapdoors and use the dive mining method.\nSimple Mine Shaft.\nA simple mineshaft is a 3-by-3 or 4-by-4 shaft that has a ladder on the side. The player can build several bases in the middle by making a glass floor and expanding the resulting room. The following diagrams show what one looks like:\nStaircases.\nThe advantage of a staircase is that the player can always trivially climb back up, without need to place ladders. Crafting some of the harvested stone into &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; makes getting down and up even easier without jumping, though they need to carve out an extra block of headroom. Any such staircase drops at most 1 block for each 3 blocks excavated (without the headroom). There are several sorts possible:\nStraight Staircases.\nA straight staircase heads \"down\", but also \"over\". This may or may not be useful \u2014 with a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;, the player might learn about more of the surface they are going \u2018\u2019under\u2019\u2019, but if they need to dig their way back up a different way, they may come out in unknown territory. Also, a long staircase from their base may take them out of chunk-update range from their base, or at least far enough out that further exploration \"will\" take them out of range. Then their crops won't grow and so forth while they are mining. All of these can be 1, 2, or even 3 blocks wide.\nThe most basic strategy is to mine in a straight line at a 45\u00b0 angle downwards, moving one block across for every block down. If the player dig out four blocks above each step instead of three, climbing back up is easier, since they won't \"hit their head\" with each jump up the steps. Placing a torch every fifth block helps the player keeping track of their elevation, and maintain a decent light level.\nAlternatively, the player can dig diagonally. Face a corner, and imagine that the corner block is the missing block of a 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube. Now dig that cube. Repeat, adding torches at every step. This takes more effort for each level dropped, but exposes more blocks along the way.\nThey can also dig a shallower stair, two blocks ahead for each block down. This takes the player even farther away horizontally, but makes it much easier to run minecart trains up the stair.\nSpiral.\nSpiral staircases are slightly more complicated since they have frequent turns, but have the advantage of leading straight down, thus staying in the same chunk. This gives the player a more targeted dig, and can often reach bedrock quicker and more safely than straight staircases.\n2\u00d72 Spiral Staircase.\nStarting from a flat floor, dig one block ahead of the player, then dig 2 blocks down to the right of that. Then move forward into the first place they have dug, turn right to face the second step, and to its right dig \"3\" blocks down from the floor. The fourth step puts them below their original floor \u2014 leave the floor block to become a ceiling, and dig the three blocks below it down to the new step. Continue with this pattern, note that each turn of the stair becomes the ceiling for the next turn. This design drops 4 layers per full turn, but if they run into gravel, players need to place dirt or cobblestone to replace it for the stairway. Turning right forms a clockwise spiral, they can of course go the other way for a counter-clockwise stair.\n3\u00d73 Spiral Staircase.\nOne design is a 3\u00d73 horizontal grid. By digging one block down at a time, and moving around the perimeter of the 3\u00d73 area, they leave enough head room as they move down the staircase. They can also add stair blocks to this setup as well. They can optionally leave the central column for a barrier, or mine it out to place ladders for speedy transit. Instead of ladders, they could use a waterfall, but they had have to place that after \"finishing\" the stair (dig an extra pit beneath the bottom of the column to prevent flooding). Players will also have to dodge out of the water column occasionally to breathe. For a long stair, the player will need 2 or 3 blocks deep water. Alternatively, they can remove the central column of the staircase when players finish, and flood the bottom so they can jump to it and save time going down.\nThe basic design drops 8 layers per full turn. They \"could\" build this as a shallower stair (4 layers per turn) for minecarts, but minecarts have trouble with the corners anyway, because of the rock around them. \n4\u00d74 Spiral Staircase.\nThe 4\u00d74 spiral staircase aims to expose as many blocks with the smallest spiral width. It is efficient because it exposes 20 blocks and misses 0 in the central column per layer, while the 5\u00d75 spiral exposes 28 and misses 1 block per layer. Players can dig a 4\u00d74 square and dig one block down as they move around the perimeter. Unfortunately, the 4\u00d74 design does not have a central column that can effectively act as a water column, but 1 or 2 columns can be broken to accommodate ladders. \n5\u00d75 Spiral Staircase.\nThis is similar to the 3\u00d73, except that players dig out the edge of a 5 by 5 grid. The center column is cleared, acting as a supply of light on the way down. The middle acts as a safety barrier, and the outer ring has the staircase itself. The middle can also be hollowed (digging straight down should be safe so long as the player didn't find any caves or lava pools as they have made the staircase) out and a ladder or waterfall can be placed in it, with openings at different levels to allow for quick and easy access. Note that climbing ladders does not deplete hunger, unlike walking and jumping used to travel the outer ring. Swimming does deplete hunger, but since they have less distance to travel, they still come out ahead.\nThis design drops the player 16 layers each full turn, and provides an exploratory dig over a wider region. At the same time, it has a bigger chance to miss things in-between the spirals.\nAdditional Staircases\nWith a shaft of 4\u00d74 or more, two staircases on opposite sides of the shaft going in the same clockwise direction can be added, allowing horizontal 'satellite shafts' to be added on each flight of stairs on opposite sides if the shaft, allowing for extremely efficient and exhaustive mining, and in shafts of 5\u00d75 or more, a staircase can be added on every side of the shaft for an even more productive mine.\nRoom Spiral.\nThis is variation of the spiral which consists of a spiral of 5\u00d75 rooms leading down. Simply dig a straight staircase down for a short while, then dig out a 5\u00d75 room and add a torch or two. Turn right or left, and dig another staircase for a short while, and dig out another 5\u00d75 room, add a torch, and so on. Remember to always turn the same way. This method allows players to find a large number of ores. If they hit bedrock, don't worry, go back up to the first room and turn the opposite direction this time. It is very helpful if players want to avoid lava and such. It also has the tendency to open up underground caves, which are always well-stocked with ores and gems. Just remember to be careful of monsters, so always bring a sword when using this method.\nSteep Diagonal.\nIf one wishes to mine straight down, but needs to get up and down quickly, a steep diagonal staircase is useful. This method resembles a straight 1x2 staircase that has been folded onto itself for space efficiency. To achieve this, simply place stair blocks in a descending 1x2 pattern, with each one leading into the next. Repeat these units, descending 2 blocks every time until the desired length is reached.\nTo ascend, center yourself with the middle halves of the stair blocks and tap A and D alternatively. To descend, center yourself and walk forward. If a clearance of 2 blocks is left above the highest stair in a unit, one may fall to each successive unit without taking fall damage.\nVertical shaft mining.\nVertical shafts are mined vertical tunnels used to gain access to underground mining sites. They can be of any width starting from 2\u00d71 blocks,or 1x1. Don't forget to keep a water bucket and a stack of blocks in your hotbar, to deal with lava quickly.\n1\u00d71.\nAlso known as \"Digging straight down\". While there is a 62% chance of reaching bedrock and a 27% of landing in a cave, the player has a small chance of falling into dangerous places like lava (8%) or ravines (3%) (100 tests) (percentages from a video Mumbo Jumbo produced). If you absolutely must be the crazy one, try this: Put a bed and a chest at the top. Sleep in the bed, and put everything from their inventory into the chest except for pickaxes, ladders, a stack each of gravel and cobblestone, and perhaps some torches. Dig down until the player dies or reaches their target depth, placing ladders above the player as they go. Every 5 levels or so, cut a 2-block high foothold opposite the ladder. If they fell into a cavern and survived, pillar jump back to the hole the player fell out of, and/or build a cobble pillar in front of players, and put ladders on that. If they fall into a cavern and die, the footholds might let them break the ladders below it so they can drop gravel for a pillar, and perhaps retrieve any ore they have found on the way down, but be watch out for the hostile mobs. If the player fell into lava, they can forget about the ore, but perhaps they can drop water to quench the lava.\nIt is possible to do this method safely, but it is very time-consuming. It's the same as before, except hold to cling to the ladder while mining straight down. This way, if they mine into a pit or lava, they won't fall into it unless they unhold ( won't let the player move down the ladder, but makes the mining speed slower). If the player does find a cave, they can climb up a little bit, remove the last ladder the player put down, and put a bucket of water there instead. Now they can swim down, and if there was lava under the player, it will turn into obsidian, and will be harmless. They can also dig 1 deep and 2 wide alcoves in the side, giving them a place to put a torch, rest, and most importantly dig the hole deeper as far as they can reach \"without\" having to hold onto the ladder.\nNote that mining \"upward\" in a 1\u00d71 shaft can actually be safer, \"if\" the player are placing ladders as they go up. Lava will be blocked by the ladder, which can't burn (and even if it could, there's no place for a fire block to appear).\n1\u00d72.\nEven simpler variant.\nThis method is fast and secure, as you can see hazards in advance and avoid them due to the fact that you can't fall off blocks in sneak mode. It also requires very little in the way of player input, making it quasi-semiautomatic. To ascend simply pillar up using the copious amounts of stone you have no doubt amassed in the course of your tunneling. Word of warning: this method consumes about 80 percent of the durability of a stone pickaxe. Be sure to bring wood to make a crafting table and sticks to craft a replacement.\n1\u00d73.\nSimilar to 1\u00d72, but players have more room to place torches, ladders, or footholds in case they fall off the ladder. They will also get more warning of gravel masses, caverns, or lava, and an extra block of room to deal with them. This is relatively safe, and is a good way to start a mine from the base.\nThe more common version runs the ladders down the middle of the wide side, that is put blocks to break the fall on both sides every few levels, and at their mining levels, but another way to do it is to put ladders on one end, and put a waterfall on the other. They can then put a few blocks in the middle to prevent falls, but leave plenty of spaces to pop out of the waterfall for a breath.\n2\u00d72.\nThe player want to excavate one level at a time, placing ladders down one corner of the block. This technique is relatively safe.\nVertical mineshaft with water drop.\nA vertical mine shaft can be built quickly and allows safe, fast access to the deepest regions of the map. To descend to the bottom, simply walk into the shaft. The player will pass over the ascent shaft, fall into the descent shaft, and land in the water pit. To ascend, climb the ladder and hop out.\nThis guide describes the construction of a vertical mine shaft with the following properties:\nDrawbacks:\nMaterials:\nThe &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; requirements amount to approximately 60 blocks of log.\nConstruction.\nOverview\nDetails\nFirst, gather and manufacture the materials. Be sure to fill the buckets with water. The shaft will be constructed to the side of an existing room. Start by excavating a 3-block deep alcove. If the top of the shaft is above ground, it should be surrounded by fences or walls with only one entrance on a narrow side. Place one torch in the end of the alcove as illustrated.\nNext, a 3-block wide pit will be dug all the way down to the bedrock. Do not dig out the block the player are standing on. Dig out a 3-high by 2-wide section, then hop down into it and dig out the 3-high column that the player were standing on. Place torches on both sides (ascent and descent) at regular intervals, excavating 1 block to place them in. In the ascent shaft, torches should be placed in the wide sides so they don't interfere with the ladder. In the descent shaft, torches should be place in the narrow side, primarily so that the player can keep track of which side is ascent and which is descent.\nBe careful when digging out any blocks beside the player. Lateral breaches into lava pools or monster caves can be hazardous. Be ready to plug the hole, or hop up and throw blocks down so the player can escape upwards. Also, be sure that the 3\u00d72 section hasn't opened into a cavern before players hop down. Keep the pit well-lit. When players reach the bedrock level, make a 3-deep pit on the descent side. Fill in the middle and ascent sides as needed, as in the screenshot.\nIn the middle of the shaft, cut a side shaft. Due to the fact that the landing pit must be 3 deep, they may want to stairstep downward a few blocks in this shaft. Next, dig out a utility room. Cut a 3\u00d71 horizontal trough in this room for water. Empty each bucket into the end of this trough. The water should fill it in and become still.\nFill the buckets again from the center of the water trough. Use the water to fill the pit at the bottom of the descent shaft. Be sure that the pit is 3 deep, and each block is filled with water.\nNow it's time to place the ladders and to fill in the center of the shaft. Stand in the ascent shaft and face away from the descent shaft. Place ladders on the wall in front of the player and climb. Build the ladder all the way to the top.\nDescend to the bottom again using the ladder. Be careful, because the center of the shaft is not filled in yet, and it's possible to fall to their death. Once at the bottom, stand in the middle of the shaft and fill it with blocks. Hop upward and place blocks beneath themselves. When they reach the top, leave the central pillar 1 block below the surface (see screenshot). Leaving it 1 block lower allows players to enter the descent shaft simply by walking in.\nAlternate landing\nInstead of a 3-block deep water landing pit, if players place two blocks of water at the bottom of the shaft in the ceiling of their utility room at the bottom and \"hold it in place\" with a sign on the wall below the shaft, it will break their fall as they fall through it and they will land without damage on the bottom of their utility room area.\nFast 1\u00d72 shaft with little resource.\nOne of the fastest ways to descend in the game is indeed falling, but climbing &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s is not a fast method of upward transport at all. You may be thinking, having a &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt; would be fast, but unfortunately you won't get that one block of soul sand without going to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, which you might access by obtaining the very &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; you gather deep underground. Luckily, there is a fast method of upward transport that you have access to without much resources at all: sprint swimming and jumping at the same time. &lt;a href=\"Sprint-swimming\"&gt;Sprint swimming&lt;/a&gt; is already fast, and if you hold down , and at the same time while looking directly upwards, the effects add up, and you can rise at a speed of 6.98 m/s, 3 times the speed of climbing up ladders, even in a downward flowing column of water. So based on this mechanic, here I present to you the least resource-intensive 1\u00d72 vertical shaft design for early game.\nProcedure.\nFirst, dig a 1 by 2 pit in the ground. place a sign in one of the spaces attached to the side, and the water in the other space. \nSecond, stand in the pit between the water and the sign, and start digging below the water. When you reach the limit of your reach, start digging on the other side (below the sign). Remember to always keep the hole at least one block deeper below the water than below the sign, so that the water does not flow sideways and push you away from the optimal spot. You can stand slightly towards the side with air, while still touching the water, so that you can breathe.\nIf you hit a cave, it's okay. With the safety offered by the 1\u00d72 technique and the water, you won't take fall damage. Just block the cave off, to make your shaft clean and shielded. If you hit an underground lava lake, the water will turn it into obsidian, but if you are not at your preferred y-level yet, you will have to abandon this shaft and dig a new one. But hey, you can keep this shaft so that you can grab some obsidian in the future!\nWhen you reach the designated y-level, first make sure where you want the floor of your mine to be. Now count 3 blocks up from the floor, and place a sign on the wall in the column with air (i.e. below the first sign). Then, place the third sign next to it on the wall, right in the middle of the water column. Now the water will be blocked, and will flow sideways over the second sign. When you are finished, you should have 3 blocks of clearance between the floor and the water, and you can see water above both signs. Now you are basically done with the shaft, and can expand your mine however you like.\nAscension &amp; Descension.\nTo go up the shaft, stand below the water column, look straight up and hold . Right as you reach the peak of your jump, your head will be slightly touching the water (the player is 1.8 blocks tall, and can jump 1.25 blocks off the ground, which means the top of their head will reach a height of 3.05 blocks, overlapping the 4th block space from the ground.) Continue to hold jump, and you will start rising up the water column. After your head is submerged and the air meter (the bubbles) starts showing up, press , and at the same time (the same three keys you press when you are sprint-jumping over land). Now you will ascend rapidly in the water column, at a speed much faster than climbing up ladders, and just slightly slower than going up a soul sand bubble column. While you are ascending, you can slightly move sideways and expose your head to the air, so you can replenish your oxygen while keep sprint-swimming. If you fall off the water column, there is no danger, as you will just fall into the flowing water beneath.\nTo go down the shaft, simply walk into the air column under the first sign. You will drop straight into the flowing water beneath and take no fall damage at all.\nHorizontal Mining (or Resource Mining/Stratifying).\nSafety.\nHorizontal mining is not as dangerous as vertical. But there are some similar suggestions. Carry a water bucket and some blocks of some disposable, \"non flammable\" material (e.g. sand, gravel, cobblestone) somewhere on the player's hotbar. A block can be used to quickly plug the leakage in cases of lava, and water can be poured over source lava to turn it into obsidian, as well as to put out fires. (Flowing lava will usually turn to cobblestone, occasionally stone, if the water is a source block.)\nTerms and Definitions.\nMain shaft/access shaft: a 1\u00d72 or 2\u00d72 tunnel use accessing other tunnels.\nEfficiency: how many ores the player gets for the amount of effort they put into the mine, or how many ores and cobblestone they dig to find them.\nThoroughness: how many of the ores the player extract per chunk.\nThe tradeoff: a mine can be made more thorough at the price of efficiency, or vice versa.\nLayout: the top-down view of the mine.\nBranch: the tunnels dug purely to gather ores.\nBranch-length: how many blocks the player dig their branches out. One recommendation is to measure a length with the durability of a stone pickaxe.\nSpacing: how far apart the branches are.\nCompletely Thorough: a mine that reveals 4 new blocks dug, and reveals every block within a chunk, is completely thorough.\nTiering: \"stacking\" one branch mine on top of another, in order to obtain a much greater degree of thoroughness without sacrificing too much efficiency.\nEfficiency vs Thoroughness.\nEfficiency in \"Minecraft\" mining is defined as how many ore blocks the player mines, relative to the time spent reaching them. Thoroughness is the percentage of the ores a player has extracted from a given chunk. Efficiency is approximated by blocks revealed per blocks mined, while thoroughness is approximated by blocks revealed per blocks in a chunk. Since both include \"blocks revealed\", they are often confused.\nIf we assume that all ores spawn in 2\u00d72\u00d72 cubes or larger, then there is no need to reveal every block. Mining three spaces wide, with four blocks between each shaft will be completely thorough. If we assume that 90% of ores are 2\u00d72\u00d72, but 10% are 1\u00d71\u00d71; while obtaining 100% unitary thoroughness then requires a spacing of 3 and a tiering distance of 2, the original mine (the 3-space 4-tiering) maintains a thoroughness of 98%. The 100% thorough mine requires mining twice as much stone while only increasing the total yield by 2%, resulting in half the efficiency.\nIn order to give an actual number for efficiency, we can use efficiency=100\u00d7(number of ores collected / number of blocks mined)-or, equivalently,\n%efficiency = (number of ores collected/number of blocks mined)\nSeveral assumptions must be made:\nIn Minecraft these assumptions are essentially true, though there is some distortion since diamonds only spawn once per chunk.\nSo we reach the crux of the argument; tunnel spacing. In the traditional \"efficient\" mining methods, tunnels are spaced close together in order to \"observe\" the maximum number of blocks possible, therefore removing all of the ore from an area. So, let's consider a spacing of 1; that is one tunnel separated by one block from another tunnel. During the digging of the first tunnel, several ore bodies are encountered. This tunnel has a high efficiency (in fact, the maximum efficiency possible, as we shall see later). The second tunnel has a very low efficiency because almost all of the ore bodies it encounters have already been removed by the first tunnel. This causes the efficiency of the mining operation to plummet. A spacing of 1 is incredibly inefficient. Now we move to a spacing of 2. This is a spacing that a lot of people use because it leads to 100% observed blocks in a single layer. However, with a spacing of 2, the second tunnel still encounters several ore bodies that have already been removed, so it is also quite inefficient. We can go on like this; as long as the second tunnel has a \"chance\" of encountering ore bodies which have already been removed by the adjacent tunnel, it will have a less than maximum efficiency. It follows that the most efficient way to mine is to place the second tunnel far enough away from the adjacent tunnel that there is \"no chance of encountering ores that have already been removed\".\nThe problem has been modeled in using a 2D slice of a real Minecraft level and a virtual mining procedure. The model mines a 1 block wide tunnel through the 2D layer and removes all diamonds it encounters, just like a real player would do. The model is limited to diamonds but the principle applies to all ores. It repeats the mining for different tunnel spacings, from 1 to 10. The model then records how many diamonds were mined for each case, how many blocks were removed, and calculates the efficiency of each spacing. A simple graph is produced:\nThe results indicate what is expected \u2014 that when tunnels are close together they are not efficient because the miner will encounter diamonds which were already removed by the adjacent tunnel(s). A good efficiency is reached at a spacing of around 6 blocks (that is, 6 solid blocks left in-between the tunnels). At this spacing, efficiency is about 0.017, corresponding to 1.7% of blocks removed being a diamond. At this spacing, the tunnels effectively become independent of each other and so, statistically speaking, the chance of encountering an ore are maximized because there is no chance the ore has been removed by an adjacent tunnel.(true independence would need spacings more than a chunk) Above a spacing of 6, efficiency does not increase greatly because ore collection rate is simply a function of the distribution of ores within the level. Note: in the above graph, efficiency appears to drop-off at a spacing of 10. This is simply a limitation of the size of the level used to model the process, resulting in a large error at high spacings. If a larger level were used, the line would smoothly approach a maximum efficiency but never quite reach it.\nIn summary:\nBranch Mining.\nBranch mining consists of mining out side tunnels from an access shaft to expose as many blocks as possible with a minimum of blocks removed.\nCreating a Branch Mine is simple. First, dig deep underground until 0-16 blocks above the bottom level. To keep track of this, press or type , and the Y-coordinate tells the vertical level the player character is currently at (It is best to mine at level 11 because it is easier to deal with lava lakes on that height). Upon reaching the desired level, begin to dig at least 20 blocks into a wall to create a shaft. Come out of the shaft, move at least 3 blocks to the left or right, and do the same again, digging 20 blocks into the wall. Each shaft made will almost always contain a resource block ranging from &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; to even &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a tradeoff between the spacing chosen between each branch of the mine. A spacing of 2 blocks per branch means that players will end up exposing almost every block, but at the cost of a lot of work. A spacing of 5 blocks per branch will give them a wider area covered but there is the possibility of missing some blobs, especially &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; which can appear in blobs of less than 4 blocks. Using the diagram titled \"More compact 3-Space branch mine\" (open the \"Offsetting mine levels\" collapsible to see it) leaves no ores hidden, however requires them mine more stone. It is recommended to use this method if they don't mind mining a bit extra and really need the gold, redstone, diamond, iron, and coal.\nLayout 1.\nThe trade-off for spacing can be minimized by making a branch mine a level above and below the first branch mine that is offset from it. (This is a side view) For example:\nLayout 2.\nAnother option is the \"per-chunk branch mine.\" This is a 2 space branch mine, but is constructed over the space of a single &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;, and is capable of ensuring that every ore deposit is found, while still only mining around 45% of the chunk's stone. For the initial shaft to bedrock for this mine, a 1\u00d72 shaft will fit lengthwise in the central corridor. Also, considering in most cases each chunk have one diamond ore blob, if their only priority is diamonds, they can place the top most branches at level 14 &amp; 15 and dig branches from top to bottom until they strike a diamond blob and then skip the rest of the chunk. \nLayout 3.\nAntennae layout\nAn effective technique if players want to find rare resources with minimal effort. It is basically mining down to any level, usually to bedrock, and then mining outwards to the sides, much like a tree with a trunk and branches.\nThis method is based on the relatively low probability of desirable blocks being created without any neighbors, so it will occasionally miss small or narrow ore deposits that fall entirely between the branches, but it covers ground faster, so players will usually get more ore for their time. If the player would rather be sure of 100% coverage, simply place the tunnels closer together. It is also meant to be done quickly.\nDiagram:\n X = Tunnel \"Trunk\"\n B = Branch\n S = Staircase\n Y = Outpost (for supplies, etc.)\n - = (Optional) 1\u00d71 block tunnel\n B-------B B-------B\n B B B B\n B B B B\n B B B B\n B B B B\n B B B B\n B B YYY B B\n X X X X X X X X X X X X X YYY X X X X X X X X X X X X\n B B YYY B B\n B B S B B\n B B S B B\n B B S B B\n B B S B B\n B-------B S B-------B\nEach branch can be any length, but about 32 blocks long is a good length to begin with, as it can be measured with the durability of a stone pickaxe.\nLayout 4.\nPinwheel Mining System.\nThe Pinwheel Mining layout:\nThe Pinwheel Mining layout is designed to cover large squares of land, over long periods of time.\nAs always, the player can use any spacing; a spacing of three provides both reasonable efficiency and reasonable thoroughness.\nThis layout can compete with the phoenix mine in terms of efficiency, and is easier to modify if necessary, but it does require a lot of time for each trip.\nLayout 5.\nRoom and fork layout\nDiagram (dirt: tunnels, stair blocks: a staircase):\nBy utilizing this variant properly, players can uncover all the blocks in quite a large area, and the mineral yields are quite high. Having the stairs 2 blocks wide allows for thorough strip mining as they can be strip mined around. Also, a good length for each tunnel is 20 blocks long.\nLayout 6.\nBranch mining with \"pokeholes\".\nA branch mine with pokeholes is a variation on a traditional branch mine, but designed to have a better blocks-revealed to blocks-mined ratio. Like a traditional branch mine, branch mines with pokeholes have several parallel 2\u00d71 shafts that branch out of a main trunk shaft. However, they are much further apart than in a branch mine (11 blocks as opposed to 3). The reason for this is that as player dig the 2\u00d71 shafts, every 4th block forward they have go, they dig a 1\u00d71 hole to the left and the right, revealing many previously hidden blocks. This technique used to be called \"feather mining\", but after &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlXVo_Q6ZozE\"&gt;xisumavoid's&lt;/a&gt; video covering this method, it's more commonly known as \"branch mining with poke holes\", or simply \"pokehole mining\". The mine got its old name from its feather-like shape when viewed in a cave map or with an x-ray &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiered Branch Mining.\nTiered branch mining is the art of stacking shaft mines on top of one another.\nIf the player decide to stack their mineshafts, however, they should use an odd-spacing, or they will get inefficiency and blind spots.\nFor instance, the following tiering has the advantage of being very thorough, while finding any 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of valuable ore. It has the disadvantage of missing some of the smaller blobs, though it doesn't miss as many as players might expect it yields somewhere between 80 and 90% of the ores in a region.\n (mine at y=15, y=11, and y=7)\n oxoooxoooxooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n ooooooooooooo\n ooooooooooooo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n ooooooooooooo\n ooooooooooooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n ooooooooooooo\n ooooooooooooo\n (bedrock begins.)\n (x=branch, o=stone)\nThis is a good mine for single player if the player can't stand the mere possibility of leaving 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of diamonds just below or above their initial mineshaft and this will find them.\nThe next one has a tiering distance of 3, and is noticeably less thorough, but it finds at least 90% of the diamonds in a chunk:\n oooxoooxoooxo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n ooooooooooooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n ooooooooooooo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n ooooooooooooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n (bedrock begins)\nThis is a good mine for somewhat crowded multiplayer, where thoroughness is actually worth something.\nShould the player be willing to sacrifice efficiency in exchange for revealing every last block, players can use a tiering distance of 2:\n oooxoooxoooxo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n oooxoooxoooxo\n oxoooxoooxooo\n oxoooxoooxooo\nThis particular tiering, however, is not only inefficient, but requires one of the access methods shown in the pictures-either an 8 tall, 2-3 wide tunnel with staircases as shown in the gray picture, or with one access shaft for 2 sets of layers. This should be used only in ridiculously crowded multiplayer servers, when what matters is finding that one redstone blob that got missed by all the random-miners.\nHowever, nearly any spacing and layout can be used with a given tiering distance, as it is fairly thorough, only slightly less efficient than a straight shaft, and it can be transformed into nearly any level of thoroughness without wasting effort.\nNearly any layout, spacing, and branch-length can be combined with any tiering distance, though doing it with a phoenix mine on the compact spacing is \"not\" recommend for anyone who gets headaches easily.\nWindmill mining.\nWindmill mining is an efficient mining technique invented by a Japanese Minecrafter &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/channel/UCWb4ODBhJGQowx48TBcpW4g\"&gt;\u3066\u308a\u3043&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced like Terry).\nPros:\nPreparation.\nDescend to the level you wish to start mining based on the ore you wish to find. This is the start point denoted by the grass block.\nDig a 1\u00d72 tunnel of 4 blocks long from the start point, then put a mark there denoted by the gold block.\n\"Don't make it 1\u00d73. That will only reduce the efficiency.\"\nTurn right, dig 4 blocks, then put another mark denoted by the redstone block.\nTurn left, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.\nTurn right return to the previous mark, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.\nDig 4 blocks put another mark.\nTurn left, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.\nTurn back, return to the previous mark, dig 4 blocks, then put a mark.\nDig 4 blocks and put another mark.\nRepeat the previous step.\nRepeat the previous step but while the player are doing so, they will reach the mark they have put before.

Now they have completed their second lap. Repeat the entire steps until they are satisfied.\nSpeed Mining.\nSpeed mining is a mining technique in which a player randomly mines out a 50 block radius around them. Stone can be instantly broken by using an Efficiency V diamond or netherite pickaxe while under the effects of Haste II from a beacon, allowing the player to quickly clear out a large area. It is at first expensive, but pays off quickly. It is suggested that the player to do this at diamond level.\nTo save inventory space and avoid having to smelt cobblestone into stone, the player can use a Silk Touch pickaxe to mine and collect ores, then use a Fortune III pick to mine the ores.\nSimple Strip Mining.\nThis technique is to take off the top 6 layers of a mountain completely. Continue until the mountain is entirely flat. TNT is useful for the first 5 layers, since the explosion will destroy grass and dirt for the most part.\nDiagram:\n Key: A = Air\n B = Block\n L = Ground Level\nStep 1: \n A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B\nFirst 5 layers are gone when the player started mining.\nNext couple steps are as shown:\n A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B\n A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A\n B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B\nThis time-consuming method is a useful tool for when they need minerals or a flat area.\nQuarry mining.\nQuarry mining is very similar to strip mining, sharing the prospect of taking all resources within an area. These mining methods are used very common in Minecraft. The difference between quarrying and strip mining is that the process of quarrying involves a large rectangular or square strip, continually mined downwards with a staircase running along the side. This method got its name by its similarity to real world quarry sites. Quarries are typically ceased when a large cave is discovered (This does not directly stop the excavation, it just makes it difficult to continue), the miner abandons the quarry for another project, or &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; is reached. A way to deal with large caves is to block the cave with Creeper-resistant materials, like obsidian. One can place a (powered) rail in a spiral, to allow ease of access.\nThe construction of a quarry is as follows:\nReally reckless miners have been known to make huge quarries, some giant ones are 50\u00d750, 64\u00d764 and 80\u00d780, yielding a staggering 2200 stacks of cobblestone/stone. To put that in perspective, that many cobblestone blocks in a tower would be a whopping 140,800 meters tall, or an unrealistic 170 times the height of the Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest building on earth. These will take a couple weeks of 24/7 gameplay, given their size, but the stone payoff is gigantic.\nExample:\n Key: - = Air\n B = Stone block\n S = Staircase\nTop of mine:\n BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\n BS----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B\n BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\nNext few levels down:\n BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n BS----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B BS----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n B-----------------------------B B-----------------------------B\n BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\nAlthough the yielded amount of cobblestone, dirt, sand, coal, iron, and to some extent gold, will be enormous, and the possibility of lava is very high, this is not the best method for mining diamond and lapis lazuli, because they're found only at the bottom of the map. (Note: Diamonds and lapis lazuli can be mined using this method, but due to their rarity, the placement of the quarry along with its size will determine the amount.) This type of mining is suggested for getting large amounts of cobblestone, iron and coal. Besides the ability to gain large amounts of resources, this type of mining may expose many caves for further exploration and mining.\nQuarries may also offer some non-resource related benefits, such as keeping the area clean and fresh (not ruining the nature), as well as serving as a handy trap.\nWarning: Be extremely careful around this type of mine, as a fall will surely be fatal, unless there is 1 level of water at the bottom. In order to prevent mobs from spawning, the shaft should also be well-lit.\nOnce a quarry is finished, there will remain a large, deep hole. There are many ways to utilize a spent quarry, but some choices are as follows:\nDue to the open nature of a quarry, many players choose to build an intricate base floating in the quarry, and then fill in the unused space with &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;. If done correctly, an underground base will be undetectable from the surface, especially when grass grows on the surface above it. For extra stealth, consider planting trees in the open area. A player might deter miners by placing a large &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; lake over the base. This will also decrease hostile mob spawns around the base.\nWhen a quarry is complete, the area can be filled with a structure such as a skyscraper or a tall building. This may be preferable to building at sea level, as the lower starting height may allow for larger structures within standard height limits.\nThese are made by the same method as an underground base, except the open area is filled with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; from artificial springs, lakes, rivers, etc. For additional effect, a lot of players build underwater bases from &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; blocks, and build airlocks for extra stealth. Most quarries are square or rectangular, so it is hard to disguise an underwater base as a natural lake or pond, but with a little bit of work, they can be made to look like a natural body of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a quarry is finished, the large area mined out can make a perfect space for creating a large multi-level grinder.\nTunnel-mining.\nThis involves digging a long tunnel. The player will need a lot of planks (for sticks), and optimally, crafting tables, chests, and furnaces. The simplest tunnel is 2 high by 1 wide (1 high by 1 wide using suffocation prevention with &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s), but the wider and higher the tunnel, the more cobblestone they get per chunk, the more they have explored (they will not gather cobblestone any faster, also they will get less ores). Dig at about level 50 if under land; 40 if underwater; or 11 if for precious ores such as diamonds. The player may want to use the cobblestone to seal off caves already explored. This is like a quarry \u2014 but more useful since less resources are spent going through the dirt/sand layer, and it can also be used in conjunction with minecart tracks to go from one base to another. A 4\u00d73 tunnel that is 1800 blocks long will yield as much as an 18\u00d718 quarry to bedrock, though arguably safer as they won't hit the lava layer, and it will yield more diamond/redstone if at layer 12, as well as the fact that falling in is completely non-lethal.\nA 2\u00d71 shaft is probably the highest-yielding way of mining for ores that is. Mathematically, a 2\u00d71 shaft reveals 8 blocks for every 2 blocks mined forward, so the basic premise of this system is that digging little 10-block deep side shafts off of their main tunnel, as in branch mining, does not yield any more ores than digging straight as their yield will be highest if they simply keep moving forward and mine endlessly instead of stopping a 2\u00d71 shaft will also lead them into plenty of caves, which could be good or bad depending on how they have feel about those. A good strategy for cave run-ins is to make a quick run-down and nab any visible ores, then find their shaft and keep moving. If they don't want to walk all the way back home after digging this, just dig in a \"U\" shape until a little less than half of their pick is used up, move 8 blocks to the side, and go back. The 2 biggest problems with this kind of mining are: A. It takes a lot of torches, though their coal yield is way higher than the amount they have spend on torches, and B. They have covered a lot of distance, therefore their chances of having lava run-ins are pretty high.\nA variation on this kind of tunnel-mining is to drill a finger tunnel into the stone for 20 blocks, placing torches as they go; retrieve any ore found; then recover the torches as players exit, plunging the tunnel back into darkness; then block up the entrance to the finger tunnel with just two blocks of surplus cobble. By leaving the finger tunnel unlit, and unfilled in, it's true that monsters may spawn later, but they are trapped in the walled-off tunnel. Be careful not to mine back into the same area later and also, there is a low chance that monstrous noise might become disconcerting later.\nMulti-mining.\nThe name fits any combined mine such as the following:\nQuarry-Branch Mine.\nThis involves digging a quarry and adding ledges every few blocks down around the outside while digging. The sides of the quarry have to be a certain length, for example with a two-space branch mine, the player need each side to be 3n+1 blocks long. The result will vaguely resemble a shopping mall atrium with one massive open space and then a bunch of \"shelves\". Then, dig the shafts to at least 20 blocks for a ton of ores, including quite a few diamonds (about 3 blobs) down on the lower levels. For a 10\u00d710 quarry, they will get about 150 stacks of cobblestone, while for larger mines (e.g., 40\u00d740), they will get around 2000 stacks, handy for massive building projects.\nQuarry-Cave Mining.\nDig a quarry down to under Y-level 25, and attempt to unearth a cave. If they did, they can explore that cave. Many of the deeper caves have no surface entrance, and being able to expose a cave that is otherwise sealed to the outside world through a quarry can garner them both large amounts of cobblestone, dirt, and gravel, as well as the rewards of mining out a deep cave. If they don't want to hold on to the stone that is excavated, they can use it to fill in dead ends, allowing them to navigate the remainder of the cave more easily.\nQuarry-Drop Shaft Mining.\nThis involves basic quarry technique but in small squares. First, the player decide how large they want the mine to be. For example, a make a 3 by 3 hole then go over 1 block and repeat for a 2 by 2 square quarry. Also this allows for maximum ore exposure. But they would need at least a 3 by 3 squares, going all the way to the bedrock layer.\nWarning: This can be very dangerous, as they can run into hidden caves, dungeons, lava pools, and mineshafts.\nMass Mining.\nFor those who favor mining in a straight path but try to not make it very long. Once they have reach the bedrock level, go up a few blocks and start mining and make it a large corridor. If the player reaches a cave, continue to make the large corridor and secure the cave. This will give the player large stores of cobblestone and more of a chance of finding lava. Find ores that are nearby that would be hidden if the player did another technique and did not get lost in their mine. This a very basic technique yet a tiring way of mining. It is suggested to use a diamond pickaxe with max efficiency enchantment and unbreaking enchantment so that the pickaxe doesn't break during the process and also consumes less time compared to using a non-enchanted stone pickaxe.\nSpecial techniques.\nTNT mining.\nTNT mining is dangerous. If you must do it, you can use the 3-in method: First find a solid &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; wall, mine 3 blocks inward, then place 1 block of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; on the third hollowed out space. Once placed with flint and steel in hand, they right-click it with the flint and steel and back up a few steps and \"quickly\" block off the front of the hole with one block of stone. The explosion should create a perfect 3\u00d73\u00d73 hole. Repeat as desired.\nA much faster but risky technique is mining in a small alcove, filling it with multiple units of TNT, and igniting it, creating a fairly large cavern. While this variation uncovers a large number of blocks at once, the explosion can let a large amount of lava leak in, making the cave hard to access and burning any drops created by the explosion.\nTNT is expensive to manufacture (requiring 4 &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and 5 &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; to make 1 TNT), thus another mining technique to maximize the use of each TNT is to dig a 2\u00d71 tunnel 4-5 blocks into the wall, then at head height mine 2-4 blocks (depending on desired size of hole) to their front, right, left, up and down. Place 1 block of dirt to act as a stand for the TNT to explode in the middle. The explosion should create a roughly spherical shaped hole averaging 8 blocks in diameter. This method destroys more blocks per TNT but requires more use from the pickaxe in order to carve the space around the TNT. Since this only creates a single explosion unlike the previous technique, the items dropped from the broken blocks will survive.\nThis is one of the best ways to get ancient debris, because of it being blast resistant. this will reveal many lava pockets, so it is a good idea to keep a few fire resistance potions on you, you can also use beds, as they explode in the nether when used, but this creates a much larger and more dangerous explosion, as well as setting many of the surrounding blocks on fire.\nSilverfish Mining.\nThe player can use &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; to clear a lot of stone away to reveal the valuable stuff. To do this, get a bunch of silverfish in a hole, and position themselves above the hole. Most of the silverfish will go into the stone, but make sure there are at least some left visible. While standing above the leftover silverfish, throw a splash potion of poison, then a splash potion of regeneration immediately after. Every time the poison hurts the silverfish, it will call any nearby silverfish out of the stone, then it will get healed by the regeneration potion, so it can keep getting hurt instead of being pinned at 1 health. Soon, all of the silverfish will come out of the stone, and they can kill them at this point, then mine all of the minerals left behind.\nThe easiest way to transfer silverfish to different places is by leading them through the Nether. The player can do this by putting a nether portal by a silverfish monster spawner, however they will need a path of blocks they can't enter, and another portal for players, farther away with a different exit. After luring a batch of silverfish through their portal, they go through theirs. The player will have made walls and a trail in advance. The walls and trail contain the silverfish, but lets the player see and follow them without being able to reach them. Two levels with a glass walkway for them above their path can do this, just make sure they can't reach the player's level (and none of the blocks are stone they can enter). Also, they may need to see the player once without glass, so they know where they are. Then lead them to a third portal leading to their mine, and \"voila\", the player have transported them to where they want to mine at.\nWither Mining.\nAnother way to get many resources acquired from mining very quickly without having to use up tools or TNT, is to use the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. The wither, unlike most other mobs, has the ability to break any block that can be mined by the player. In addition, if a block is destroyed by the black or blue skulls of the wither, it will drop itself (see &lt;a href=\"Explosion\"&gt;Explosion&lt;/a&gt; for more details). However, be very careful when attempting to mine by using the wither when in Survival mode, as the wither has many defenses, and is able to deal a great amount of damage to the player. So, make sure to either have high quality weapons and armor, or make the wither mine so that it is impossible for the wither to attack the player.\nPiston Mining.\nPiston mining is a technique for safely extracting small amounts of valuable ores, usually diamonds, and for inserting 'windows' into potentially dangerous spots.\nThis mining method is only practical for collecting very small amounts of ore, but it can be useful for collecting diamonds from dangerous spots or when players suspect a natural hazard is nearby and they want to locate it precisely.\nNether mining.\nMining in the Nether can be very profitable, because of netherite and nether quartz that can't be found elsewhere, as well as nether gold ore being abundant. However, the Nether is far more dangerous than the Overworld, and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt; is extremely rare.\nNeeded equipment.\nAs the nether is an extremely dangerous place, you will need a lot of good equipment, because this will make the endeavor a lot more profitable and safer. The list is in no specific order of importance.\nMining nether quartz and gold.\nExploration.\nWhen searching for nether quartz and gold, a good way to find a large amount is to just explore, as you wander the nether, you will come across lots of exposed nether quartz and gold ore, you can then mine it. This method is both fast and interesting, but also more dangerous, as compared to mining underground, there will be many hostile mobs, and it will be more likely to fall into lava pits. It is also almost impossible for netherite to generate exposed to air, so it cannot be found this way.\nStrip / Branch mining.\nThis type of mining can be done at any level, and will mostly get you the same amount of quartz and gold, but this method is a lot more bland, but safer, and can get you ancient debris. This method is done similarly to in the overworld, but is more dangerous as you will run into many little lava pockets.The best way to prevent this is carry a bucket right next to your pickaxe since you can only run into source blocks(if you\u2019re in java, you\u2019ll be able to put it in your offhand).\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Debris\"&gt;Ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncient debris is used to make netherite. When ancient debris is smelted in a furnace or blast furnace, it becomes netherite scrap. 4 netherite scrap and 4 gold ingots can then be crafted into one netherite ingot.\nStrip / Branch mining.\nThis method can be used for netherite, and if you are looking for netherite, it is best to do so between y=8 and y=22 as there is a higher concentration of ancient debris between these levels. The method is similar to in the Overworld, but because netherrack is easier to break than stone, it can be instant-mined. This allows for the player to maintain sprint while mining, making the process much faster than in the Overworld. However, the method is also somewhat dangerous, as one will run into many pockets of lava - for this reason, the player should have high-tier armor, possibly with &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"potions%20of%20fire%20resistance\"&gt;potions of fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nTNT mining.\nTNT mining is considered to be one of the best methods for finding ancient debris. Netherrack has a very low blast resistance, which means that TNT mining exposes more area in Nether than in Overworld, while ancient debris, unlike the ores found in Overworld, can't be blown up.\nIn TNT mining, a tunnel is created around y=15. Once the player has gone far enough, or ran out of TNT, they will go back along the tunnel, placing TNT on the floor every 5 blocks (that is, with 4 blocks between each one), until they get to the beginning, where they will light up the TNT, causing a chain reaction. In the resulting tunnel, there should be exposed ancient debris left intact by the explosions, that can be mined out.\nSimilarly to branch mining, this method will expose a lot of lava, which will often flow and fill large areas. However, the lava is easily avoided, and won't burn up the ancient debris. TNT mining is also a very expensive method, because for one stack of TNT, 5 stacks of gunpowder and 4 stacks of sand are needed.\nA better method is to build world eaters. They are enormous bombing flying machine that will destroy everything under them. However, ancient debris are blast-proof, so a world eater will destroy everything and reveal ancient debris.\nBed mining.\nWhen a player tries to sleep in the Nether, the bed blows up. Bed mining is similar to TNT mining but instead of TNT, it uses this mechanic. While it has the same pros as TNT mining, beds have a larger explosion than TNT, but most importantly, they are less expensive, which makes them a very popular choice of method for finding ancient debris.\nBeds do have the problem of having no fuse time before exploding, making it very likely for the player to take some damage.Furthermore, beds blowing up do not cause nearby beds to explode, meaning each one has to be manually blown up. Beds are also not stackable, which limits the maximum length of mining sessions considerably. This is partially negated by instead carrying wool and planks with you, which are crafted into beds as you go.\nAesthetic Mines.\nThis section is for mines that focus more on aesthetics rather than efficiency.\nVertical design.\nDesign.\nThis design consists of a Hub and a Push leading into another Hub.\nKey:\n B - Block\n _ - Air\nHub:\nTop view:\n BBBBBBB\n BB___BB\n B_____B\n B_____B\n B_____B\n BB___BB\n BBBBBBB\nSide view:\n BBBBBBB\n BB___BB\n BB___BB\n B_____B\n B_____B\n B_____B\n BBBBBBB\nEach push is basically the design behind it (The side view) dropped a square repeated several times, the amount is dependent on the miner but an even number is preferred due to torch placement. (Discussed later)\nThe central hub (The first hub made in the mine) will have 4 pushes in each of the cardinal directions, eventually, if players are in need of ores they may choose to go down in one direction until the player have what they need. It is recommended to check the Y-coordinate about now, they may want a push length that will allow them to get to their Y-coordinate value as close as they can to 12. (Lava spawns in caves at 10, and their Y-coordinate is up 2 for the positioning of their head) After the player's decided on the length and finished a push, make another Hub in the same size as above. Continue until they reach the last of their hubs, and they should end it before they hit the bedrock layer, otherwise it won't be very nice looking.\nTorch Placement.\nTorch placement is simple in this design. The player will have 8 &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es in each hub, on both sides of the bottom of the corners. If the player want, they may add a torch to the center floor to add more light, but it is enough to prevent mobs spawning as it is now.\nFor every push, put two &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es on every other left and right hangs.\nConnections.\nAfter players finished all of the cardinal pushes, they will be wondering what next to do, considering the amount they have mined, they may want a place to store away items, connections are great for this.\nEach connection is a hub formed by two of the cardinal branches intersecting, meaning if players went to the first north hub down, they would have to mine one push or hub to the left and connect to it from the first west hub down by pushing right. It's the same as the hub but it leaves two walls with nothing to do, if the player try to continue with them, they will get intersections that are hard to make aesthetic unless the player are looking for a large open mine, or a maze mine. Instead, the player can use it for chests, and it works well for its purpose.\nVery hard to describe with letters, so here's a picture instead:\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//i528.photobucket.com/albums/dd325/clc02/NewBitmapImage-3.png\"&gt;Picture&lt;/a&gt;\nContinuations.\nAfter the cardinal directions are done, players have their as many connections as they care for, continue adding onto their bottom hubs, only with straight pushes. The bottom hubs will branch in all directions except backwards, unless the player are going with an open or mine variation, and each of those hubs may spread in the same direction so long as it's not backwards for the original hub. If they positioned well in the first central hub and push size, they will be scraping a long in a fairly wide tunnel along the same height the player find diamonds. It's easy sailing from here on.\nVariations.\nCentral hub is under an area of flat ground, dig three deep holes where &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es will go, ladders go on the bottom and top, torches in the middle, players go above the hub as normal only there will be a 2 high gap under the hangs on this first hub to allow for the ladders as a way up. The player will need the ladders to go all the way down, and such won't have a place for a torch. They can circumvent this by putting them on the middle of part left over at the top of the next section, the lighting is the same and players won't need an extra torch to prevent mobs spawning. This also works particularly well if they want to replace the top with glass.\nSame as original, only every connection made splits off in all four directions. It goes up with a 1 wide path in the center in all four directions and the both of the two wide paths go down until they merge, which is when it can do so without getting rid of the upward patch.\nThere are two variations, one where players will go up when they make a connection, so they will have a stack of hubs in all directions, another where they only dig down in the connections, where they intersect their build the 1 central path down to the hub. The latter is more efficient as all of it will eventually lead to the bottom and therefore be mining ore.\nThis is the same as an Open Mine except player's down path is one wide, not their up path. Same two variations, same correlation in efficiency.\nPlayers can replace the &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es in the center of the hubs with a piece of glass and lava under it and it gives only one light less, providing that they placed them at all. They can change it for a 3\u00d73 if they feel so inclined and have enough lava.\nThis combines the Central Drop Shaft and optionally the Open and Maze Mine Connections. It requires close tallies if they don't want to combine them though.\nAt the hub, mine down the same as if they were going to make a Central drop Shaft, but continue until they are on the same level as their next hub, depends on the size of their push, like a 8 push would be 8 blocks down. After they reach the bottom, make another hub in the same style as a Central Drop Shaft. This will require more ladders, so it's not a very good idea if players are short on log, but it allows a certain maze quality.\nThere are two places where they can put the ladders, but the two per corner type of the Central Drop Shaft style is preferred, however the other style uses less ladders.\nThe player mine their shafts in the blocks directly north/south/east/west of the center so that they have 4 shafts all the way to the next hub, this require 5 blocks to hang down from the hub, some like it, others don't.\nTwo variations on top of that, they may use the drop shaft for all hubs, thus any hub with a hub above will be able to ascend, or they can only use the shafts for the central hub, adding 'terraces' to their mine.\nAfter players get down to the bottom level, they may continue to stretch out and connect with the original push/hubs. Once they connectted, they may use the open style, leaving 1 wide path up or the maze, leaving 2\u00d72 wide up.\nOther Aesthetic Mine Ideas.\nCentral Mine.\nThe player should change the rail-torch-rail combination to &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt; combination every 34 blocks.\nPlayers will have a central rail system with smaller hallways for pedestrian traffic. On interesting locations, players should add some kind of rail station with access to the rail.\nRandom Mining.\nMining randomly is very simple: dig, dig, dig wherever and however the player just happen to feel like digging at the moment.\nVery simple, and potentially the most rewarding type of mining around: the player can find dungeons, massive cave networks, and maybe the hostile mob base.\nHowever, it is also potentially the least rewarding; it's possible to miss all the ores, as this method offers little consistency.\nRandom mining can very well be the most dangerous method. The player can get lost, mine their way into lava and thus lose their items, into a ravine, into a skeleton monster spawner with 5 skeletons, or even into their own 40 block drop. Alternatively, they could embarrass themselves by mining straight up into a patch of gravel or sand, or flood their mine by digging into the ocean.\nThat being said, there is one major benefit to random mining; it will confuse potential griefers. Surrounding a main base with all kinds of twisty passages is a viable option, though it won't ultimately stop a determined griefer from finding the player or their base. This was the most used technique in Pocket Edition, before the cave generation.\nSpace/Portion Mining.\nNot to be confused with Strip Mining; however, this does involve a similar method.\nRoom Mining.\nThis form of mining involves someone to make a hall way and then make a small opening in the wall. From there, one must simply dig out a portion of the block to create a space. This method is repeated many times down the hall on either side to create rooms for various purposes, while finding several ores and valued materials in the process. This method is useful for the creation of houses, barns, indoor-gardens, storages, and in the creation of hard-to-find/secret places as it offers a variety of places one may go to in order to find something, but they may likely give up in the process unless they are determined.\nTunnel Mining.\nThis is highly similar to Room Mining, except that instead of building rooms, the player build tunnels. However, this takes much longer to do and tunnels are usually much larger than rooms. Because of this, Tunnel Mining is lesser to be used as the tunnels take up many tools in the process of making them as well as the mining process may dig into a body of water and flood the tunnel. However, if the player wants to make an artificial river for boats, this may not be a problem. Despite the fact that they may yield many resources, players may use up several pickaxes or shovels in the process of making them as well as &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es to light up the tunnel. Players may get bored of doing this and may abandon the tunnels while still in the process of making them. Some may not consider beginning construction on future tunnels due to lost supplies and the tunnel not being rewarding enough to continue. This method is useful for making minecart subways, large indoor-gardens, art galleries, tree farms, boat rivers, large barn(s), mazes, doing construction on vertical and horizontal structures, constructing strip mines, and secret/hard-to-find areas by making tunnels that seem to go nowhere.\nClear Mining/Safe Mining.\nThe general purpose of Clear Mining (or Safe Mining, whichever one may prefer to call it) is a variation of Box Mining and other simple techniques. A player first finds a suitable area, preferably one block above the bedrock layer so that the player can easily obtain diamonds and other rare minerals. The player must also have at least 5 to 6 stone picks, one iron pick for rare minerals such as gold, and 3-4 shovels for gravel. A sword is optional depending on the players preferred difficulty settings. Once the player has found a suitable and deep area that they are confident in they may either begin or set up a small chamber near the area to store minerals and construct tools to further their mining. To begin, make a simple 1 block wide and 2 blocks high that spans roughly 8-10 blocks in length. Once this has begun, the player then uses their stone picks to mine directly in front of them where their tunnel ends, \"but\", there is a catch. The player does not move once they make their initial 8-10 block tunnel, and mines only the above block of the two block height making a small box, 4 blocks long. Once the player makes a half tunnel 4 blocks long, the turn to their left or right and do the same; not breaking any of the blocks below the first block. (When it is done the concept is much more simple) After the player makes a reversed \"T\" shape, then the player can start to mine out the remaining areas \"around\" the tunnels, only using their reach length to clear away stone and any materials. Once the player has maxed out their reach length, they will be in small \"box\" that reduces risks of being suffocated by gravel or possibly lava. The player then should have a clear area, and then mines out the remaining second blocks, still avoiding the \"edges\" of the safety box. Once all materials are mined, the player can then break the box and gather the resources in one quick run. Once the player is done in this, there will of course be small \"edges\" that they not reach, and these should be mined out making a \"clear\" box. To further the effectiveness of this strategy, one may then place &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es in the \"frontal\" corners of the area and repeat the process on each side, however this time, rotating their view to clear away \"all\" areas of their reach, so long as they are away from their initial entrance tunnel. The end result should be a very fast, resourceful, and safer approach to mining at bedrock. However, mobs may spawn in areas of the mine that are poorly lit, and lava is a factor, along with tediousness, so the player must make a commitment to a clear mine, leaving when satisfied with their bounty of materials. Like parenthesized above, this strategy is best played out rather than explained.\nAmphitheater Mining.\nStart with a basic U-shaped mine, and make an \"amphitheater\" down the levels until the player have a one-block space. Then, make a doorway ahead to make another amphitheater mine. This is very useful, and the player can even make it decorative by adding staircases as stairs or chairs.\nWanderer mining.\nThis is a simple mining technique, but isn't used much because of the risk of getting lost. Start by making a staircase down until the player reach the &lt;a href=\"ore%23Availability\"&gt;level where the desired ore is most commonly found&lt;/a&gt;, and begin mining. Occasionally change directions and make multiple branches. If there is a rise, plow through it. If there is a fall, bridge it with cobblestone. The point is to cover as much area without changing their Y-coordinate.\nPerfectionist Mining.\nThis form of mining is relatively simple. Find or make a cave. When the player found ores, dig it out. Then, measure the longest side of the ore. Turn the small hole into a perfect cube and they will probably find more ores.\nShovel Mining.\nSimply create a staircase to the desired depth and make a tunnel to find pockets of dirt or gravel. With a shovel, mine all dirt/gravel and search the created cave. It is very similar to caving, except they are making their own cave. This technique is very useful on older server where all caves had been explored. The advantage is that players don't need to spend too many resources on tools, because they mainly use shovels, a cheap and reasonably fast tool. On the other hand, yields are smaller than from caving or strip mining.\nWorst Case Scenarios.\nIf the player falls into &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, do not panic; \"swim upward\" to get out, then try to get far away from the lava and to water if they can. This way even if they die, their items won't be destroyed by the lava. If they need to heal, eat &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s or drink some Potions of &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; and hide in a corner/away from &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure they use a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; if they have one. If the player know they are going to die anyway, press and (and also press together if the or button has other functions) to take a screenshot of their coordinates. If they are burning to death, trapped, close to the lava, stand in a corner and encase themselves in a dirt or other hand breakable shell. Once they die, their items will be contained safely in the shell.\nIf they are trapped in blocks and are suffocating, try to dig looking downwards. This could assist them in getting out of the trapped pit.\nIf they are fighting and are going to die, press then .\nWhatever happens, they should look back upon what they did, and analyze how they died, and what they could do to improve.\nIf their pickaxe breaks and they have stumbled into a cave and they have lost their way, the only option is to punch their way out and this could take a while. If there are any nearby mineshafts, check them out, they can use planks to make a crafting table and tools or there might be a spare iron pickaxe floating around.\nIf they can, get an ender chest and start to put in their stuff from the most expensive/important to the cheapest/least valuable. When they spawn back to their house, put another ender chest and take out their stuff.\nBest Case Scenario.\nShould the player happen to accumulate a large amount of resources, such as, perhaps, 2 stacks of &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; and 10 &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, they may be tempted to delve further into the cavern. Resist this urge and return to their base to empty their loot. Dumping off their goodies instead of trying to explore longer may help in the long run, and will reduce the chance of losing their loot. Having a bed at the base of their mine is also helpful; if the player dies, they will spawn at the base of their mine, hopefully surrounded by their chests full of goodies.\nIf possible, carry an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; with the player to store their valuable resources, or put down a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; where they are at, put their loot in it, and write down the coordinates of the chest. They can come back to the chest later. Find the current coordinates by or .\nSafety.\nWhen going for a mining trip, make sure that the player take proper precautions to not die because of sand or gravel. Use their best judgement and be careful when digging. When going mining, after they are finished and they make their way back, try to go out the way they came. That way, players know they are safe and there is no risk of lava, water, gravel, or sand falling on them and killing them. Digging a new shaft to escape the underground could result in sand falling on them when it turns out they dug their exit below a desert biome, or they could be drowned when the entire ocean floods their exit shaft. If players do get lost, they can dig up in a stairs pattern so that sand and gravel won't kill players and they won't be drowned if water comes through. If gravel does happen to fall on them, do not panic and immediately hold down the left mouse button to dig the gravel out. This will save themselves from suffocating.\nStairs pattern: A=Airspace B=Block\n A\n AB\n AB\n AB\n AB\nNever take valuable items when going mining. The player don't want to delve into dangerous caves while carrying tons of iron and diamonds, for if they lose them while mining, they will be sorry. Carry more supplies for longer trips, but don't carry more than they can afford to lose to lava. Normally, they will want to use stone pickaxe for economy, but carry at least one iron pick for advanced ores (gold, redstone, and of course diamond). If they have tons of iron and are impatient, they might use iron pickaxe in general, but while those \"are\" faster, they only last twice as long (block-wise) as stone tools, and they will be going through a lot of pickaxe regardless. Take a diamond pickaxe if they want to be fast and efficient for its durability, or to collect some obsidian. Make sure to bring a sword, or at the very least, a bow and some arrows.\nSupplies to bring while mining: Crafting table, furnace, sticks, cobblestone, water bucket, picks, swords, food, armor and fishing rod.\nMine Defense.\nOne method for defending a mine is a tunnel collapse system. This essentially has the miner press a button to retract sticky pistons in the walls, pulling torches off the walls. These torches are supporting sand or gravel in the roof, preventing it from falling. When the sticky pistons retract, the torches are no longer attached to the walls, and so they disappear. This allows the sand or gravel to fall, blocking off the tunnel. This can be used in a network style mine to block off the assaulted tunnels while still allowing movement past the blockages. It can also be used to trap assaulting mobs in a \"Quarantine Area\" and prevent them getting loose in the mine."}

This is because fossils are only found in certain layers and &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, and are usually bigger than blobs.\nUsage.\nFor most players, the primary use of fossils is as a source of &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;s. This can be especially useful if playing on Peaceful difficulty, as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s won't be able to spawn, meaning that bones are much harder to acquire. Fossils also generate &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;, although if you want to find coal ore, it is much easier to just look in a cave. However, if you do come across a fossil and mine it for the bone blocks, it's worth it to mine the coal ore. &lt;a href=\"Coal\"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful, as it can be used to make &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, or used as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBone blocks are often highly sought after for building, thanks to their unique texture. Bone blocks also cause &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s placed on top of them to produce a xylophone sound. One of the most common uses for bone blocks is that they may be crafted into &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. Anything that can be dyed, including &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass%20pane\"&gt;stained glass pane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"firework%20star\"&gt;firework star&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"candle\"&gt;candle&lt;/a&gt;s, can be dyed white with white dye, which is made from bone meal and certain flowers. In addition, white dye can be combined with other &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s to make secondary dyes, including gray, light gray, light blue, lime, magenta, and pink. The bone meal itself may also be used to grow &lt;a href=\"crop\"&gt;crop&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, or create &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s if used on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFinding the right place to mine.\nThe most important thing when trying to find fossils, is to mine in the right biome. Here is a list of the biomes that fossils can spawn in:\n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20fossil\"&gt;Nether fossil&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen finding a spot to mine, it's also recommended to mine in a larger biome, so that you have more room in the biome you're in. For example, if you find a swamp or desert biome but it's only 1 chunk wide, that's only 1 chunk of mining space, and it is very unlikely that a fossil will generate in that 1 chunk.\nFinding fossils.\nOnce you find a spot to mine, it's time to start searching for fossils. You can do this by either caving or mining. Note that fossils will only generate 15 - 24 blocks below the surface, so make sure to always look here.\nBy caving.\nCaving has nearly the same advantages and disadvantages as it does when mining ores. Caves have lots of exposed surfaces, which saves you a lot of time and tools by mining. However, it is very likely that caves will be either shallower or deeper than fossils generate, and it is also likely that the cave may lead out of the biome you are mining in. \nWhen caving, always be on the lookout for a bone block, as many times only 1 block will be exposed. Also, if you are in the correct Y coordinates (about Y = 40 - 49, a bit lower for land below sea level, and a bit higher for land above sea level), mine as much coal ore as possible, as it is possible that it is part of a fossil. This particularly goes for if you only see one coal ore, as more than one coal usually do not generate next to each other in fossils.\nBy mining.\nMining rather than caving can be useful if you don't want to deal with the &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s in a cave, want to collect lots of cobblestone while finding fossils, or want to make sure you are on the exact Y-coordinates for fossils.\nBranch mining.\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%23Branch%20Mining\"&gt;Branch mining&lt;/a&gt; is a good way to mine when looking for fossils. Try to find a flat section of a swamp or desert biome. A flat section allows for branch mining without having to dig up or down. This is because where fossils are found in the ground does not depend on the Y-coordinate, but rather on how far beneath the ground it is. Once you've found a suitable area, dig down about 20 blocks and start branch mining.\nThe basic branch mining mechanics here are the same as &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%23Layout%202\"&gt;layout 2&lt;/a&gt; for the branch mining mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining\"&gt;Tutorials/Mining&lt;/a&gt;. However, the tunnels feeding off of the long tunnel should be 6 - 8 blocks from each other, which could also be said as having 5 - 7 blocks in between them. For the best overall efficiency, make the tunnels with 6 blocks in between them, or 7 blocks from each other. There is only one type of fossil that generates smaller than this. All other fossils are at least 5 blocks wide on every side, making them able to be seen in tunnels that have 6 blocks in between them. If you want to make sure you get every fossil, make your branch mine tunnels with 4 blocks in between, or 5 blocks from each other. However, although you will see every single fossil there is this way, it is inefficient.\nOther mining types.\nOther types of mining, including &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%23Simple%20Strip%20Mining\"&gt;strip mining&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%23Speed%20Mining\"&gt;speed mining&lt;/a&gt;, should usually be performed in the same way they would if looking for ores. However, note that they must be performed 15 - 24 blocks below the surface, as those are the only layers that fossils can generate in. &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%23TNT%20mining\"&gt;TNT mining&lt;/a&gt; can also be used, and is often faster than digging with a tool, but doing this method risks damaging and/or destroying fossils.\nObtaining.\nOnce a fossil is found, dig all around it to make sure there is nothing dangerous. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; is the main concern when mining, and lava does not usually generate so high up in the world. Once the fossil is excavated, you may want to take a screenshot of it, as fossils are rather rare, and you may not encounter one again for a long time. Then, start mining the fossil. You can mine both the bone blocks and coal ore with any type of &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, but if you use your hands, it will drop nothing but if for some reason bone blocks goes great for your build then you can make a base in side or around the fossil."}

{"id": "5787", "revid": "36156286", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5787", "title": "Tutorials/Mob farm", "text": "Mob farms are structures built to acquire mob drops more easily and in larger numbers. They usually consist of two components: a large, dark room to spawn mobs, which are funneled into a central location, and a mob grinder to kill them quickly and efficiently.\nLocations.\nThe purpose for the farm is to provide a large area that is a viable &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Mob%20spawning\"&gt;spawn position&lt;/a&gt; for the intended targets, and to kill the mobs quickly. Due to the rules Minecraft applies to spawning mobs, this makes the choice of a location for the mob farm a difficult problem.\nFarms placed on the surface can provide good drop rates during the day, when it is one of the few spots of dark ground, but has a sharp drop in effectiveness during nighttime, when the entire surface is dark enough to support mob spawning.\nFarms built underground have a time-independent drop rate, and remain within your personal spawn range for hostiles when you go mining, but their effectiveness depends on the amount of unlit caverns in your vicinity, which provide alternative places for mobs to spawn.\nFarms floating high in the sky can achieve the best spawn rates during the day and night and you are far away from caves, as they represent the only viable spawn ground. However, building one in survival is rather dangerous, and due to their height they stop working completely when you descend underground to mine resources. To produce loot, you must stay at the height of the farm.\nFarms constructed under an ocean can provide the best during day and night, as the ocean limits the viable spawn locations to open areas underground except for &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, which spawn underwater. You can also locate your base below it to ensure that you are always close enough to spawn monsters. \n&lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; worlds provide higher spawn rates than other worlds, as the missing air pockets underground reduce the amount of dark places.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; is difficult to farm, as water evaporates and most mobs are immune to fire. This reduces the amount of functioning farm designs considerably. One could try to funnel the mobs through &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Portal\"&gt;Nether Portal&lt;/a&gt;s to circumvent the restrictions.\nDrops.\nWhat a mob farm produces depends on location and the type of grinder used to kill the mobs. Automatic killing prevents certain drops and &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, but is safer as the player is not required to be near the mobs. The following is a table of mobs that can be effectively farmed and their usual and player-caused drops. Player-caused drops and experience can be obtained only when the monster is killed directly by &lt;a href=\"the%20player\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; or a tamed wolf.\nNote that zombie, skeleton, and creeper heads drop only if killed by a charged creeper. Wither skeletons, however, have a small chance to drop theirs no matter the cause of death, but still always drop them when killed via charged creeper.\nDesigns.\nWhen planning a mob farm, one should consider the size of the spawnable area. The maximum spawnable area depends on where one plans to be in relation to the farm. If you plan to be directly beneath the center of the farm, waiting for the items, then the radius in which mobs can spawn can be used to calculate the maximum size of the spawnable area: \n \"floor\"( \"sqrt\"(Spawn Radius^2 - (Spawn Floor Height - Collection Floor Height)^2 )) = Spawnable Area\n the spawn radius is 128 blocks. the spawn radius is roughly 96 blocks for simulation distances &gt; 4. For simulation distance 4 the spawn radius is 44 blocks.\nIn practice, however, it is rarely worthwhile to fill the maximum spawnable area with a single farm that delivers mobs to central location. For example, if you plan to spend your time in a less defined position, it might be easier to repeat a simple design several times, ensuring that at least some areas are in the spawn range while limiting complexity. Moreover, transporting mobs long distances for killing makes a farm less efficient because of caps that limit spawning based on the number of mobs already in the loaded areas around the player. The impact of caps is especially important , which has caps that limit population densities as well as a global cap that counts mobs around every player loaded in the world.\nIf you are making a room that relies on darkness to spawn mobs, cave sounds and bats are good signs that your spawner is dark enough to let hostile mobs spawn.\nSpawning tower.\nOne of the most popular overworld designs for a general mob farm is based on a tower of spawning pads that are periodically flushed with water to push the mobs off so that they die from fall damage. The water comes from a central pillar of dispensers and observers that cascade a clock signal between platforms. This type of farm is known for its high production rates, simplicity, reliability, and ease of build.\nStarting in 1.19.3, mobs no longer spawn on scaffolding. In this case, just build the spawning platforms with top slabs instead of scaffolding. The central signal tower of observers, dispensers, scaffolding blocks remains the same.\nUsing observer blocks.\nThe designs shown in the YouTube videos above are somewhat resource intensive, but this design requires only the following materials: \nIn addition to being inexpensive, it is also easier to build. \nThe design uses three different layers that are repeated with a redstone clock added to the top layer.\nThe layers are as follows:\nFor layer one, the blocks must hold all of the water, so go out seven blocks in each direction, then fill in diagonally.\nOptionally, you can surround these blocks with signs to prevent spiders from climbing up. However, this would be a large amount of work for little benefit.\nThis mechanism can cascade downward through quasi-connectivity. When the top dispenser is triggered the observer see the state change and signals down to the air gap above the dispenser below, activating it through quasi-connectivity.\nThis cascades down through all of the layers (make as many as you like, but anywhere between 3 and 10 should be plenty).\nTo start this cascade, the topmost dispenser needs to be activated. It is recommended to do so using an &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Clock%20circuit/hopper%20clock\"&gt;Ethonian hopper clock&lt;/a&gt; with about ten items in it. You can trigger the topmost observer using the redstone output from one of the emplacement the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20block\"&gt;redstone block&lt;/a&gt; could be in the clock.\nIt is also recommended to make the layer on which you place the clock bigger than the other the hide the layers under from the sun, and to place torchs on it to prevent mob spawn.\nSinkhole.\nThe easiest possible design consists of a large, empty area of simple shape, with one or more holes in the ground for the mobs to drop through. The edge of each hole has to be lined with opened &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"gate\"&gt;gate&lt;/a&gt;s to trick the Mob AI into believing the hole to be solid ground. Trapdoors can also be controlled with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, so one could shut off the farm by closing the holes remotely.\nThe whole room is closed by a roof to create a minimal light level. A roof height of 3 allows Endermen to spawn, while a roof height of 1 would restrict the farm to spiders.\nSinkhole farms have limited effectiveness, as the chance for a mob to wander into a hole is small, and zero when the player is so far away that the mobs freeze. But they can be built quickly and cheaply, and works in the Nether (unlike other designs requiring water because you can't place water in the Nether).\nCanal-style.\nTo improve the chances of a mob falling into the holes, one can add channels filled with flowing water, leading to the central hole. The channels are lined with open trapdoors to trick the mobs into falling in, and the water transports them into the grinders. Such a design requires a bit of planning to ensure that there is no stationary water in which the mobs might get stuck, reducing effectiveness.\nBecause the system uses water to transport mobs, it cannot capture Endermen, which teleport away when touching water. Therefore, the roof of the cavern should be 2 blocks above the ground to prevent griefing of your farm by Endermen taking blocks.\nCompact canal design.\n An easily-built design can be made in a 20\u00d720 area, using eight water source blocks to fill the channels, which are exactly eight blocks long so that the water stops exactly at the edges of the central hole. The design can be easily stacked or placed next to each other to increase the effectiveness. This design can be made even smaller as shown in the video (14\u00d714 area). Shrinking the design can be done by using signs to cut off the water flow at the edge of the sinkhole, forcing the mobs to fall into the central hole.\nMinimal canal design.\n If there is not enough space for larger designs, this might be used. Its small size of 10x10 or 20x20 (inner area) makes it able to be incorporated into larger construction projects without trouble. It uses four water source blocks, one in each corner, with the water flowing around 3x3 squares of building material to the central hole. The parts of the water between the wall and the blocks is closed over to provide more spawning area.\nLarge chamber fully automatic design.\nThis is a large farm that requires significant resources. It has 6 spawn chambers in each building, and redstone controlling it. It outputs 4 waves of average 10-15 mobs every 16 or so seconds.\nWater pans.\nIf you have mobs coming in from multiple sources, you may need a water pan (a.k.a. water tray) to collect mobs from a large area to a central dropshaft. \nA basic 9\u00d79 (not counting the walls) water tray works well for zombie or skeleton spawners, or when gathering together the output of several dark areas. Simply put water sources at the corners of the square, and they flow to drop the mobs into a hole in the central square. For spiders or iron golems, you must expand this to 10\u00d710, which allows for a 2\u00d72 hole in the middle (for spiders, you must also line the chute with glass).\nFor a few cases (notably Overworld gold farms), a 27\u00d727 water tray (counting the walls!), with two levels, may be needed. Start with a classic 9x9 pan surrounding the drop chute. Move up a level to surround it with the rest of the large pan \u2014 slabs or blocks suffice for most of it (put real blocks at the boundary, so you can place water on them), but the outer ring should be a 25\u00d725 square of fences on the same level (that is, you'd have a half-step up from the outer pan to the fences). Surround this with the 27\u00d727 outer wall. The inner pan gets a water source at each corner, which should send the flow in to surround the hole. For the outer pan, water sources go every other block on top of the fences (place them against the outer wall), but \"not\" in a complete ring. Place the sources every other space along two opposite walls; the water should flow exactly to the edge of the inner pan. Now, if you fill in the entirety of the other walls, you get extra water sources forming from the corners, and your current becomes a sheet of mostly-still water. For the other two walls, put only five sources each covering the middle \u2014 that is, one at the midpoint, and two on each side (still every other space). This sends the water flow to the other edges of the inner pan.\nThe large pan could also be expanded to 28\u00d728 with a 10\u00d710 inner pan, but this requires some experimentation.\nActive mob displacement.\nThe Canal-Style System still suffers from the mobs freezing when outside a certain range around your character , and from the limitations of low population density caps . Active Systems can correct that problem. One example is using Redstone and Dispensers filled with a Water bucket to flood the spawning grounds repeatedly, flushing all mobs into the channels to be transported to the grinders. Thus, the farm provides area for the mobs to spawn in, but does not rely on mob movement to get them into the grinder. Using this, one can omit the trapdoors needed for the other, passive designs.\n placing water on top of scaffolding provides an efficient means of active transport. Land mobs spawn with their feet inside of the scaffolding and their heads inside of the flowing water. The mobs are then immediately transported to a drop chute or other killing area. Spiders and baby mobs present a challenge for water-on-scaffolding designs because they spawn entirely inside of the scaffolding and cannot be moved by the water until they randomly climb/jump. Several methods have been invented to deal with this: buttons placed every-other block in every-other row prevents spiders from spawning at all; villagers can be used to lure baby zombies (see below); snow golems can be used to knock mobs upward and into the flowing water; or cascading water down a funnel-shaped spawn floor can be used to pull babies and spiders into the water flow at every block.\nOther designs.\nInstead of using water to transport mobs, there are various other methods to make them move toward the grinder, each of which may work better with certain mobs but with other tradeoffs.\nTransporting mobs.\nAfter collecting the mobs from the farm, it might be beneficial to transport them to a different location before grinding them, so that you can access the items more easily while remaining at a close-to optimal position for the spawning of your farms.\nHorizontal transportation.\nHorizontal Transportation can be done easily using flowing water, with a drop of 1 block vertically for every 8 block traveled horizontally. Build a tunnel with a height of 3 blocks and a width equal to the size of your gathering holes (usually 2). Mine forward to a length of 8 Blocks, so that water placed at the start ends exactly at the drop. Repeat, but one block lower, so that the mobs fall from one funnel part to the next. Mine out the roof at the higher level for 2 or 3 more blocks to prevent spider clinging to the walls from clogging up the funnel. \n Alternatively, one can use a cactus to grind the spiders immediately. To do this, make the first funnel part only 7 blocks long and place one water source block instead of two. Place a sand block and a cactus on top on the same side as the source block. To place the cactus, you have to mine out the block next to it. To ensure the water flow on the next part, mine out the wall block next to the sand and add the water sources there and next to the sand, where there would usually be one.\nDownward transportation.\nTransporting mobs and items downward is trivial, simply let them drop down a chute with a water brake at the bottom. Or omit the water brake when you want the mobs to die from fall damage.\nUpward transportation.\nUpward transportation uses the fact that nearly all mobs attempt to swim in water, moving upward. Therefore, to get the mobs moving upward, one must provide a column of water with enough air holes to prevent them from drowning. This can be done by arranging signs or ladders and water source blocks in the following vertical configuration: \nThis can be repeated indefinitely in any direction for a mob elevator. When arriving at the right height, flowing water on top of the topmost ladder is enough to dislodge them. \n&lt;a href=\"Slime\"&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;s do not swim in versions prior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to separate them from other mobs.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.5.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.5.0&lt;/a&gt;, a block of soul sand can be placed at the bottom of a column of water source blocks to force entities quickly upward, while also supplying air for long distances. If soul sand is not used, undead mobs can be separated from the others because they do not swim upward.\nGrinding.\nThe last part of a mob farm is to kill the gathered mobs and collect their items. This can be done in different ways, using the variety of damage available in Minecraft, like falling, suffocating, drowning, burning, sunlight (for undead), touching cacti, simply player-applied damage from weapons or lava. \nPassive systems do not change to kill the mobs, they rely on constantly available damage sources. Traditional mob grinders used \"Lava Blades\" and \"Drowning Traps\" while newer models use magma blocks to kill mobs above the minecart/hopper retrieval system.\nActive systems have to change configuration to actually kill mobs, usually in the form of redstone devices. The most known might be the \"Piston Grinder\", which applies suffocation damage by pushing an opaque block into the head of the mob. While possibly faster than passive systems in killing, active systems usually have a limited capacity, and higher amounts of mobs might clog or even jam the system. The \"Minecart Grinder\" uses Minecarts to carry the mobs into one block high space, suffocating them. This method can jam up too, but is fairly amusing. You could also use lava to burn mobs. Make sure to have hoppers below so you get the loot before the loot burns automatically.\nXP farms are systems that capture and soften up the mobs, but rely on the player to deliver the killing blow, so that the rare drops and experience can be gathered. An example would be a nearly-lethal falling height, which would reduce the majority of mobs to half a heart, easily killed even without a weapon. However, such systems are only as good as the player using them, and in constant danger of being destroyed by creepers if not built out of obsidian, or if the player is out of sight of the creeper, in which case it does not explode. Also on bedrock edition one can make a piston push a trident back and forth for AFK xp. \n&lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;Hoppers&lt;/a&gt; make it easy to collect the dropped items, even without player involvement. This makes fully automatic mob farms possible where the loot is deposited into a chest for easy accessibility."}

Mob grinders can be used to kill many mobs while simultaneously collecting all dropped items at a convenient location.\nMost mob grinders are specific to certain categories of mobs. Some grinders work only with tall mobs such as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, but don't work with shorter mobs such as &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. Other grinders work with both tall and short mobs, but don't work with mobs which are immune to fire &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of these mob grinders do not produce &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;s or other &lt;a href=\"Drops%23Rare%20drops\"&gt;rare drops&lt;/a&gt; as the mob deaths do not meet certain conditions. It is possible that these grinders can be built in a particular way which would make it easy to fulfill these conditions, however. Anyway, the mobs drop experience only if killed by the player, not by automated means.\nCommon grinders.\nThe following are some of the most common styles of mob grinders.\nFall damage grinder.\nFall damage is one of the simplest and quickest methods of mob grinding. This method is often done in combination with a mob farm where the mobs are forced into water streams and can easily be dropped from a lethal height. Some mobs are immune to fall damage. These include &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, and flying mobs such as &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe most important aspect of a fall damage grinder is the drop height. Different mobs need to be dropped different distances in order to kill them. Most common hostile mobs can be killed with a 24-block drop, although &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es require 30 blocks. Some mobs such as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s can occasionally spawn with &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; boots or armor that can change the required distance. Because of this, it is often better to make the drop further than necessary.\nOn the other hand, it is often desirable to kill the mobs manually in order to obtain &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and other exclusive drops. By dropping the mobs slightly lower than the minimum death height, it possible to make most mobs end up with health points, so you can kill them with one hit. , it is not possible to bring zombies to half a heart, even with a combination of falling and suffocation, because zombies have natural armor points. If you wish to use your fist rather than a tool to kill the mobs, a &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; may provide the extra damage necessary to kill zombies and mobs with armor in a single hit. However, stone swords are cheap and plentiful, and you can also use tools (such as &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s) dropped by the zombies.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s can be tricky to deal with as they can grab the walls and reduce fall damage. To kill spiders, a minimum of a 2\u00d72 pit is necessary. You may want to dig the pit deeper than the required 19 blocks in case a spider does brush the wall at some point in its descent.\nTips:\nMagma blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Magma%20block\"&gt;Magma block&lt;/a&gt;s are a simple method of mob grinding. When mobs walk on a magma blocks, they are dealt &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Magma_block\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; every second. This means an unarmored &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; dies in about 20 seconds. To avoid being damaged while building, you should obtain &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt; boots, drink a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; potion, or just crouch.\nAlthough magma blocks do not destroy items, collecting the items can be a little tricky. There are generally two options for item collection: Use water streams to wash items off the magma blocks or use &lt;a href=\"hopper%20minecart\"&gt;hopper minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. Water streams have the downside of negating any fall damage and potentially causing the mobs to bob up and down, taking damage only some of the time. Running hopper minecarts on rails underneath the magma can solve both of these problems but is more expensive.\nNot all mobs can be easily killed by magma blocks. &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; mobs, such as &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s are not affected by fire damage, so magma blocks are not useful as a nether grinder. Magma blocks are also ineffective against &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es as they drink fire resistance potions negating damage. &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s can also be tricky as they may climb walls and cause issues.\nWither roses.\nWither roses can be used in a similar manner to magma blocks and sweet berries to kill mobs. Wither roses placed on top of soul sand allow items to sink into soul sand blocks and be picked up by hoppers directly below, avoiding having to use hopper minecarts to pick up items through full blocks.\nWither roses deal the same damage as magma blocks and sweet berries: 1 heart per second. (Also applies the wither effect)\nLava grinders.\nIf you have a &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;, a lava grinder is often the simplest and most practical grinder, particularly for iron golems or mob farms that are not high up above the ground.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; is good at dealing damage, it also tends to destroy &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. The loss of items can be avoided by suspending the lava on a sign and pushing the mobs into it. When a mob dies, its items then fall below the lava and into the hopper. This type of grinder is often called a \"lava blade.\"\nAnother variant is a pool of lava that the mob falls into, with the lava being suspended above a space that the drops fall into.\nLava grinders are typically ineffective against baby zombies, because even if they fall through a pool of lava, they often survive, and they can fit in the one-block space under the lava being suspended by the signs. It is a good idea to put a &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; between the hopper and your collection room (a fence over a chest does not prevent the chest from opening). Then, if a baby zombie happens to be waiting on the other side, you can easily kill it.\nInstead of pushing mobs into the lava, it is also possible to douse them using a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;. During the short period of time in the lava, the mobs catch fire and are weakened until a player can easily kill them with one or two hits.\nCampfire killer.\nA campfire killer has advantages over both a lava grinder (above) and a trident killer (below). A &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; does not destroy items like lava can. A campfire can kill nearly any mobs including baby zombies that would normally fit in a space under lava. While it does not bestow experience on players like a trident killer, a campfire killer is much cheaper and simpler to construct, requiring only water, a sign, a hopper, a chest, a glass block, and a campfire. A campfire requires only wood to make the crafting ingredients. It is an excellent choice for early-game farms.\nIn the figure on the right, a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; (or a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;) is used to stop the water flow. The water pushes the mob onto the campfire. A &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; placed directly underneath a campfire pulls in any items dropped. The hoppers feed into a collection chest. The glass block traps mobs in the campfire space, and glass is useful for viewing the mob being killed. The half-block gap between the glass and the campfire allows for safe manual killing if needed (which gains experience for the player).\nAlthough a campfire damages mobs slowly, it works reasonably well on any mob without fire resistance. Most hostile mobs (&lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; variants, &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.) die in less than 10 seconds in a campfire. A campfire kills an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; in about 50 seconds. A campfire killer does not work well on &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, because they give themselves potions of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt;. A witch can survive indefinitely in a campfire, so if a witch gets stuck in this trap, it should be killed manually.\nIf you have Soul Sand available, you can make soul campfires instead. These kill twice as fast as regular campfires, and give off less light, which usually makes them a better choice than a normal campfire.\nTrident killer.\nProjectiles that can be picked up again by the player after lodging in a block (i.e. &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tridents\"&gt;tridents&lt;/a&gt;) also have the ability to hit mobs if they are moved after becoming lodged. The total number of hits a projectile can inflict before becoming inert and impossible to retrieve depends on its type and the piercing enchantment: a normal arrow can hit one mob; arrows shot by piercing-enchanted crossbows can hit (enchantment level + 1) mobs; and tridents can hit an infinite number of mobs. Hits inflicted by moving the projectile after it has been lodged in a block count as hits for the player who launched the projectile, even hours later and/or while the player is no longer nearby. Such hits cause the the mob to drop &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and player-kill loot as long as the player who launched the projectile is loaded somewhere in the world. In addition, the loot dropped is subject to the &lt;a href=\"looting\"&gt;looting&lt;/a&gt; buff if the player holds a looting sword in the main hand at the time the kill occurs.\nTrident killers make use of these mechanics to produce a completely automatic method of killing mobs and making them drop experience and other player exclusive loot. They work by throwing a trident into a mechanism that uses a piston to push the trident into mobs and a clock circuit to power the piston on and off.\nTrident killers provide a way to get large amounts of player-kill loot and experience from a farm without the need for repetitive clicking and travel between different kill locations. Many &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; mob farms are much less productive than their &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; counterparts due to differences in the spawning algorithms. Moreover, since Bedrock Edition does not have the &lt;a href=\"sweep%20attack\"&gt;sweep attack&lt;/a&gt; it can be difficult to kill large quantities of mobs manually with a sword. Players may therefore wish to enhance the effectiveness of their farms by limiting the distance mobs must travel before being killed, and by using the looting enchantment while still killing mobs automatically. Trident killers make this possible. They allow for remote player kills in small, separated modules of a farm, and they allow the player to get the looting buff on those kills. On top of these beneifts, tridents in trident killers never despawn. Tridents decrease in durability only when they are thrown. Because the trident is thrown only once, a trident killer can run indefinitely without needing to be supplemented with additional tridents.\nBecause tridents cannot be crafted or found in chests, they must be obtained by hunting &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; or by building an . Only one trident is needed for a trident killer, even one that is nearly worn-out.\nPiston grinder.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, it is possible to push blocks into mobs so that they suffocate. In the shown example design, a piston pushes a mob underneath a sticky piston holding a block. The sticky piston extends at the same time to \"smash\" the mob and cause it to die from suffocation at points per second. The water used to push the mobs can also be used to wash the items to a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; for item collection. This setup works only for tall mobs, but the same principle can be used for smaller mobs as well.\nThe downside to this trap is the slow rates of kills, since each mob needs about 10 seconds of suffocation before it dies. This problem can be fixed by having a row of pistons push together at once, suffocating multiple mobs in every smash. Another downside is the inability to handle spiders. You must find another way to sort out spiders, such as a &lt;a href=\"%23cactus%20choke\"&gt;cactus choke&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiming is important for this trap to work efficiently. For single mob smashes, a loop of at least 30 repeaters set at maximum are needed, giving 12 seconds per loop. With this setup, turn on the loop for a little more than 10 seconds to ensure they die, and have the loop off for the rest, giving 10 second kills and 2 second load times. For a full row of 8 pistons, the load time is approximately 6 seconds, meaning the loop needs to have 40 repeaters giving a 16-second loop. Load time for a stream of 8 blocks long and 2 blocks wide, with pistons on both sides, is about 8 seconds. This amounts to at least 48 repeaters.\nAlternative grinders.\nThese grinders are not as commonly used and may be somewhat unusual. They can still be useful in some situations, however.\nEntity cramming grinder.\nIt is possible to kill mobs using &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Suffocation\"&gt;entity cramming&lt;/a&gt;. When there are more entities sharing a hitbox than the value set in the Entity cramming threshold setting (default 24), if they cannot be pushed apart, they start to take damage. This grinder deals damage per second, quickly killing mobs such as skeletons and zombies after about 2 seconds of exposure. Because this trap deals suffocation damage, it works with all mobs, including those which are immune to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, such as wither skeletons.\nTo make the grinder, first dig a 1\u00d71 pit at least two blocks deep so mobs cannot jump out. As mobs fall into the hole, their number will eventually accumulate to the point where they pass the cramming threshold and start taking damage. Collect the items with hoppers or hopper minecarts, as with any other grinder. When the farm is turned off and the density of mobs in the hole isn't high enough, they remain stuck in the chamber, but they can be finished off with a sword.\nNo experience is gained from this farm, aside from killing the leftover mobs manually. However, it is cheap, simple, easy to build, and can kill almost anything. Just don't fall in.\nCactus choke.\nThis cactus choke kills &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, solving potential spider size/jump/climbing issues. It is a simple design, relying on the spider's 2\u00d72 size. The grinder stops all spiders at a bottleneck, where the water-conveyor narrows from 2 blocks wide to 1 block. A cactus is placed on the side, on top of a sand block, where spiders run into it. This grinder works well, but the cactus can destroy some of the loot.\nSunlight grinder.\nIt is possible to burn &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s with sunlight as an effective way of dealing damage and separating &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s. This can also be done with monster spawners. To build a sunlight grinder, simply make a room with a &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or a hollow ceiling. Although it is easy to build, this grinder has several downsides:\nMob arena.\nStrictly speaking, this is not a mob grinder, but has a similar outcome and is a fun way of using the mobs spawned from a mob farm. The mobs are collected in chambers and can be slowly released into an arena to fight against players.\nThe concept is simple, 2 tall buildings, with about 15 rooms inside, that have holes at all corners, and water around the sides to push anything that goes to the side into the hole at the corner. Then once the mobs fall down, they are trapped in a simple holding area until a lever is pulled to let pistons open so that the mobs can fall out.\nAnvil smasher.\nIt is possible to grind mobs by smashing them with an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. To start, the mobs should be contained in a small 1\u00d71 chamber with an open ceiling. Next you should have a tall pillar on one wall chamber which you can climb and drop an anvil from. If dropped from a sufficient height, all mobs should be instantly slaughtered. You can then collect the drops with a hopper or just by entering the chamber. You may wish to place a torch or sign at the bottom of the chamber to break the anvil and prevent it from being damaged. It would then be possible to automatically transport the items and anvil back up to the top using some sort of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Item%20transportation%23Vertical%20transportation\"&gt;vertical item transportation&lt;/a&gt;.\nSweet berry bush.\n&lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Berry%20Bush\"&gt;Sweet Berry Bushes&lt;/a&gt; deal damage to mobs (except foxes) as they move through the bushes. Sweet Berries result in a slow grinder as they deal damage only when the mob moves. Sweet berries can be placed only on top of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;.\nFloor-suffocation grinder.\nThis grinder involves surrounding a 4x4 pit with pistons, one block above the floor of the pit. Have mobs pushed into the pit, and attach the pistons to a loop or a lever so that the pistons quickly go on and off, causing the entities inside the pit to fall into the floor and suffocate. This requires that there is a one-block tall space beneath the floor of the pit, so that the mobs can fall. This kills extremely quickly. \nItem collection.\nYou may want to collect items automatically after the mobs have been killed. Any easty way to do this is to place a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; at the end of your water flow or wherever your items drop out. A double &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; can then be placed under or next to the hopper to contain the items. If there is a large area where the items can land, you may need multiple hoppers, or manage water flows to move items into a single destination hopper.\nFor more complicated designs, you can also use &lt;a href=\"hopper%20minecart\"&gt;hopper minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. Hopper minecarts can pick up items through solid blocks, so you can easily run a rail line underneath the blocks where items rest. Rail lines are often useful as an alternative to many hoppers or in combination with magma rock grinders"}
{"id": "214057", "revid": "36156286", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=214057", "title": "Tutorials/Mob switch", "text": "Mob spawning can be irritating and dangerous; however, with the creation of a mob switch, you can disable mob spawning in a certain area without lighting anything up, or covering everything in slabs. , mob spawning can even be disabled in an entire dimension with the help of chunk loading. Without further ado, let's look into the mechanics of how to create one in your world or server!\n\"Java Edition\".\nBasic mechanics.\nIn \"Minecraft\", there is a global &lt;a href=\"mob%20cap\"&gt;mob cap&lt;/a&gt; for each \"&lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;\": in a singleplayer world, the mob cap for hostile mobs is at 70, meaning there can only be 70 hostile mobs loaded in a dimension, and no more hostile mobs may spawn until enough mobs despawn or die, so that number gets below 70; this is to ensure that the world is not flooded with mobs. On multiplayer servers, the mob cap increases by 70 for each player online, unless it is altered through &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe basic premise of a mob switch is to keep a certain number of hostile mobs loaded in the world, so that the game fails to spawn more hostile mobs. This mechanic can already be demonstrated by passive mobs: In a singleplayer world, the mob cap for passive mobs is 10, but normally there are way more than 10 animals within the player's render distance, meaning it is practically impossible for passive mobs to spawn naturally after a chunk has been loaded. Passive mobs in \"Java Edition\" don't despawn, but count towards the mob cap, meaning their presence acts as a natural \"mob switch\" for passive mobs.\nUnlike passive mobs, it is very difficult to create or find a hostile mob that doesn't despawn, but also counts towards the mob cap. This is because mobs no longer count toward the mob cap if they are marked persistent. The most common way to prevent a mob from despawning is to use a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; on a mob, but doing so removes the mob from the mob cap, and therefore cannot be used in a mob switch. Similarly, a mob may pick up an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; or enter a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;, all of which prevents it from despawning but also removes it from the mob cap. Only a few hostile mobs are exempt from this rule: for more information, see the &lt;a href=\"%23Choice%20of%20mob\"&gt;\"Choice of mob\"&lt;/a&gt; section.\nNote that the mob switch is specific to each \"dimension\", depending on the dimension that the mobs are stored in. Mob switches can be built in both the Overworld and the Nether, but because there is no practical means to load chunks permanently in the End, a mob switch cannot be created in the End.\nOptions for chunk loading.\nSpawn chunks.\nThe spawn chunks is a 23x23-chunk area around the world spawn point, where the chunks are constantly loaded as long as the player is in the Overworld, or at all times on multiplayer servers. If enough persistent mobs are placed in the &lt;a href=\"spawn%20chunk\"&gt;spawn chunk&lt;/a&gt;s, mobs are prevented from spawning elsewhere in the Overworld. \nThe best place to store mobs in Overworld is on the edge of the spawn chunks, so that mobs can be moved in and out of the spawn chunks, turning the mob switch on or off. On the image to the right, the mobs need to be stored in the light blue colored chunks, and moved into the gray colored chunks to turn the mob switch off.\nNether portals.\nAnother alternative to the spawn chunks is loading the area with &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s. This section will not describe how nether portal chunk loaders work; for more information, please see the article above.\nThe best place to store the mobs used in the mob switch is on the border of the 7x7-chunk loaded area: When mobs are placed in the 3x3 chunks centered on the portal, their AI is constantly loaded, which adds a lot of lag to the server. When they are stored in the outermost ring of chunks in the 7x7-chunk area, their AI is no longer processed, but they still count towards the mob cap.\nTo turn the mob switch off, simply turn off the chunk loader. The mobs will be unloaded, and hostile mobs are again able to spawn in the dimension they are located in.\nChoice of mob.\nAs mentioned above, most hostile mobs are removed from the mob cap once they are marked persistent, meaning they can't be used for the mob switch. However, some mobs are an exception to this rule, and can therefore be used in a mob switch. They are &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s.\nZombie villager.\nNormally, zombie villagers despawn like other hostile mobs do. However, due to the bug , zombie villagers that have been traded with do not despawn, but count towards the mob cap.\nTo build such a mob switch, you will need a villager breeder, a &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block, and a zombie to zombify the villagers. Make sure to put blocks over the head of zombie villagers, so they do not burn in the sun (unless they are stored in water). \nA zombie villager mob switch usually consists of a large room to contain at least 70 zombie villagers. If built around the spawn chunks, there needs to be a system that pushes the zombie villagers in and out of the spawn chunks; water is usually the best method, as zombie villagers don't drown unlike normal zombies, and the water additionally prevents them from burning in the sun. Once the first zombie villager is put into the holding chamber, it is typically faster to move more villagers directly into the holding chamber, so that they can be zombified by the zombie villagers already there.\nShulker.\nShulkers are special in that they count towards the hostile mob cap, but do not despawn naturally. This makes them perfect for mob switches. A shulker-based mob switch usually consists of a large chamber where at least 70 shulkers are stored, enclosed on all sides so they do not see nearby players.\nTo set up a shulker mob switch, one has to transport at least one shulker from the End to the Overworld, transport them to the location where the mob switch will be built, and duplicate them in a shulker farm. More information about transporting and duplicating shulkers can be obtained from the shulker farming tutorial mentioned above.\nAs with other mobs used in mob switches, make sure not to name tag the shulkers, or keep them in boats or minecarts when the mob switch is finished.\nWarden.\nWardens are another type of mob that counts toward the hostile mob cap, but can be prevented from despawning. The way to do so is to constantly distract them: when a warden does not detect any vibrations, it despawns after one minute; however, when a vibration is detected nearby, the warden refreshes its despawn timer, and will not despawn for another minute. This behavior can be utilized to create a mob switch.\nA warden-based mob switch typically involves a warden farm that produces wardens, a way to transport the warden away so new wardens may spawn, and a holding chamber where a vibration source (such as a &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;) is constantly triggered to distract the wardens and keep them from despawning. The wardens can then be loaded with a nether portal chunk loader. For more information on creating a warden farm, see the warden farm tutorial mentioned above.\nAn essential component of a warden-based mob switch is a way to remotely turn off the vibration source and kill the wardens, if the player wishes to get rid of the wardens and repurpose the area for something else. It also ensures that if something goes wrong in the building process, the player can safely remove the wardens and rebuild the mob switch without risking getting killed by wardens.\nLazy mob switch.\nThis variant of a mob switch is unique, since it uses silverfish, which was a fairly useless and annoying mob because of their ability to hide in blocks. This means that this version requires a stronghold.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\n\"Bedrock Edition\".\nUnlike in \"Java Edition\", there is not a global mob cap in \"Bedrock Edition\", and it is not possible to load chunks permanently, meaning a global mob switch cannot be created. However, by trapping a certain amount of mobs in an area, the local mob cap can be filled, preventing more mobs from spawning nearby."}

As there are different variants of some blocks, block states are used to link these with the corresponding models. Each model and each block state has its own file, which is of the codice_1 format. Even the icons used in the inventory are defined in these files.\nFile path.\nIn JSON files of models and block states, the resource location in the form of codice_2 (the codice_3 namespace can be omitted) is used to represent the local file path. See also &lt;a href=\"Resource_location%23Locating_contents_in_packs\"&gt;Resource_location#Locating_contents_in_packs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn these files, the path corresponding to the resource location codice_2 is codice_5, where the path can contain subfolders separated by codice_6, such as codice_7 (codice_8 and codice_9 are folders, codice_10 is the real file name).\nThe object specified by a resource location and its corresponding object type and suffix are as follows:\nBlock states.\nThere are several different variants of some blocks (like &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be open or closed), hence each block has its own &lt;a href=\"block%20state\"&gt;block state&lt;/a&gt; file, which lists all its existing variants and links them to their corresponding models. Blocks can also be composed of several different models at the same time, called \"multipart\". The models are then used depending on the block states of the block.\nThese files are stored in the following folder: codice_11. The files are used directly based on their filename, thus a block state file with another name than the existing ones does not affect any block.\nExample: Wall Torch.\nThe wall &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; has several variants: It can be placed at a wall facing in four different directions. This example is taken from the file codice_30, which can be found at codice_31.\n \"variants\": {\n \"facing=east\": { \"model\": \"block/wall_torch\" },\n \"facing=south\": { \"model\": \"block/wall_torch\", \"y\": 90 },\n \"facing=west\": { \"model\": \"block/wall_torch\", \"y\": 180 },\nA torch can be placed on all four sides of a block and therefore needs four different variants, one for each side. These are called codice_32, codice_33, codice_34 and codice_35. All four variants use codice_36 as their model, which is rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees around the codice_37 axis to align with the different sides of the block they are placed on.\nExample: Grass Block.\nThe &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; has two variants, whereby the first one holds four different models. This example is taken from the file codice_38, which can be found at codice_31.\n \"variants\": {\n \"snowy=false\": [\n { \"model\": \"block/grass_block\" },\n { \"model\": \"block/grass_block\", \"y\": 90 },\n { \"model\": \"block/grass_block\", \"y\": 180 },\nThe non-snow-covered grass block (codice_40) holds four models, which all use the same block model, but each one is rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees. As there are four models and the codice_41-tag is not used for any of them, each one has a chance of 25% to be used every time a block is placed.\nExample: Oak Fence.\nThe oak fence uses the codice_42 format. This example is taken from codice_43 in codice_31.\n \"multipart\": [\n { \"apply\": { \"model\": \"block/oak_fence_post\" }},\n { \"when\": { \"north\": \"true\" },\n { \"when\": { \"east\": \"true\" },\n { \"when\": { \"south\": \"true\" },\n { \"when\": { \"west\": \"true\" },\n ]\nWhile the first model, the fence post, is always used, the other models are used only if certain conditions are met. Here the sides of the fence are applied only if there is another adjacent block next to this one. As there is just one model for the post and another one for all the sides of the fence, which then is rotated by increments of 90 degrees, the amount of models needed for all the different possible set-ups of fences can be reduced to two. Compared to the five models and 16 variants used in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, this is a rather big improvement.\nExample: Redstone Wire.\nThe &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; wire model uses the codice_42 format. This example is taken from codice_46 in codice_31\n \"multipart\": [\n { \"when\": { \"OR\": [\n {\"north\": \"none\", \"east\": \"none\", \"south\": \"none\", \"west\": \"none\"},\n {\"north\": \"side|up\", \"east\": \"side|up\" },\n {\"east\": \"side|up\", \"south\": \"side|up\" },\n {\"south\": \"side|up\", \"west\": \"side|up\"},\n { \"when\": { \"OR\": [\n { \"north\": \"side|up\" },\n { \"when\": { \"OR\": [\n { \"south\": \"side|up\" },\n { \"when\": { \"OR\": [\n { \"east\": \"side|up\" },\n { \"when\": { \"OR\": [\n { \"west\": \"side|up\" },\n { \"when\": { \"north\": \"up\" },\n { \"when\": { \"east\": \"up\" },\n { \"when\": { \"south\": \"up\" },\n { \"when\": { \"west\": \"up\" },\n ]\nThis model is dynamically created. With the first condition, it is determining cases where the codice_48 model should be added, which requires either all of the four sides being set to \"none\", or any two sides that form a corner both being set either to codice_49 or codice_50.\nThe last case tests only one condition, which asks if codice_51 is set to codice_52, and if so it applies the model codice_53.\nBlock models.\nThe folder codice_54 holds the model files for all the specified variants. The names of the files can be changed, but must always correspond with the names used in the variant files.\nExample: Standing Torch.\nFor simplicity, this example describes only the standing &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, which is defined in the files codice_105 and codice_106 stored in the folder codice_107. \n \"ambientocclusion\": false,\n \"textures\": {\n \"particle\": \"#torch\"\n \"elements\": [\n { \"from\": [ 7, 0, 7 ],\n \"to\": [ 9, 10, 9 ],\n \"shade\": false,\n \"faces\": {\n \"down\": { \"uv\": [ 7, 13, 9, 15 ], \"texture\": \"#torch\" },\n },\n { \"from\": [ 7, 0, 0 ],\n \"to\": [ 9, 16, 16 ],\n \"shade\": false,\n \"faces\": {\n \"west\": { \"uv\": [ 0, 0, 16, 16 ], \"texture\": \"#torch\" },\n },\n { \"from\": [ 0, 0, 7 ],\n \"to\": [ 16, 16, 9 ],\n \"shade\": false,\n \"faces\": {\n \"north\": { \"uv\": [ 0, 0, 16, 16 ], \"texture\": \"#torch\" },\nThis file is used to create the model of the torch, which is used for the normal, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"soul%20fire%20torch\"&gt;soul fire torch&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, the codice_56 tag is used to create three elements or cuboids. Only two faces of each cuboid are rendered, as only two faces of each one have been specified. codice_109 is used to determine the area where the texture is used. The texture variable codice_110 is used for the particles and the cuboids and has not yet been defined.\n \"parent\": \"block/template_torch\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"torch\": \"block/torch\"\nThis file represents the model of the normal standing torch. It loads the model of previously defined standing torch with the help of codice_55 and inherits all the properties of the file codice_106. As this file is used only for the normal torch, the texture can now be specified. The texturecodice_113 is now assigned to the texture variable codice_113 (in form of a &lt;a href=\"%23File%20path\"&gt;resource location&lt;/a&gt;) and therefore is used for the previously loaded model and its particles, as specified in the other file.\nExample: Any Block.\nThis example describes the fundamental structure of most normal blocks in \"Minecraft\". All these &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s use the same basic model and apply their texture to it, as already described in the example above. This model is defined in the file codice_115, which can be found in the folder codice_107.\n \"elements\": [\n \"from\": [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n \"to\": [ 16, 16, 16 ],\n \"faces\": {\n \"down\": { \"texture\": \"#down\", \"cullface\": \"down\" },\n \"up\": { \"texture\": \"#up\", \"cullface\": \"up\" },\n \"north\": { \"texture\": \"#north\", \"cullface\": \"north\" },\n \"south\": { \"texture\": \"#south\", \"cullface\": \"south\" },\n \"west\": { \"texture\": \"#west\", \"cullface\": \"west\" },\nFeatures that have already been described above are not discussed further. The use of codice_117 prevents the bottom face of the block from being rendered, if there is another adjacent block underneath it. The same applies to all the other faces of the block.\nExample: Sapling.\nThis example describes the fundamental structure used by all &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, without assigning a specific texture. The model is specified in codice_118, the texture would e.g. be assigned in codice_119. Both files are stored in the folder codice_107.\n \"ambientocclusion\": false,\n \"textures\": {\n \"particle\": \"#cross\"\n \"elements\": [\n \"from\": [ 0.8, 0, 8 ],\n \"to\": [ 15.2, 16, 8 ],\n \"rotation\": { \"origin\": [ 8, 8, 8 ], \"axis\": \"y\", \"angle\": 45, \"rescale\": true },\n \"shade\": false,\n \"faces\": {\n \"north\": { \"uv\": [ 0, 0, 16, 16 ], \"texture\": \"#cross\" },\n },\n \"from\": [ 8, 0, 0.8 ],\n \"to\": [ 8, 16, 15.2 ],\n \"rotation\": { \"origin\": [ 8, 8, 8 ], \"axis\": \"y\", \"angle\": 45, \"rescale\": true },\n \"shade\": false,\n \"faces\": {\n \"west\": { \"uv\": [ 0, 0, 16, 16 ], \"texture\": \"#cross\" },\nTo create the usual shape of the &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, both elements are being rotated by 45 degrees. Therefore, the origin and the axis of rotation are set to the specified values, the angle is set to 45 degrees and codice_121 is set to codice_15. The latter causes the model to be scaled on the axes it has not been rotated on by 1 + 1 / (cos(angle) - 1), so that it takes up the same space as it did before rotating it (see comparison images). \nExamples: Condensing multiple textures into one file.\nUsing the codice_109 compound, textures can be read from one file and parts of the file can be used for each side of the block. codice_109 doesn't take the pixels of the file, it instead takes percentages of the file in terms of 16; for example taking the top half of a file uses codice_125: from the coordinates ([0% of 16], [0% of 16]) \u2013 (0,0) \u2013 which is the top-left pixel, and ends at ([100% of 16], [50% of 16]) \u2013 (16,8), which is the middle-right pixel. Because this works in percentages, resizing an image from 16\u00d716 to 32\u00d732, 64\u00d764, etc., does not require changing the model file.\nIn this example, a &lt;a href=\"fletching%20table\"&gt;fletching table&lt;/a&gt; is used (see image) with combined textures (in this example, saved as codice_126): the top 16\u00d716 pixels (if each of the textures are 32\u00d732, etc., then the top 32\u00d732, etc., textures are taken using the same code) textures the top of the block, the center 16\u00d716 textures the front and back, and the bottom 16\u00d716 textures the other sides. The bottom texture is codice_127. For three textures, this code can be used:\n \"parent\": \"block/cube\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"particle\": \"block/fletching_table\",\n \"all\": \"block/fletching_table\",\n \"bottom\": \"block/birch_planks\"\n \"elements\": [\n \"from\": [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n \"to\": [ 16, 16, 16 ],\n \"faces\": {\n \"down\": { \"texture\": \"#bottom\", \"cullface\": \"down\" },\n \"up\": { \"uv\": [0,0, 16,5.34], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"up\" },\n \"north\": { \"uv\": [0,5.35, 16,10.66], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"north\" },\n \"south\": { \"uv\": [0,5.35, 16,10.66], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"south\" },\n \"west\": { \"uv\": [0,10.67, 16,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"west\" },\nIn this example, only two textures are condensed into one file, in this case for a &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;. For two textures, this code can be used:\n \"parent\": \"block/cube\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"particle\": \"block/bone_block\",\n \"all\": \"block/bone_block\"\n \"elements\": [\n \"from\": [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n \"to\": [ 16, 16, 16 ],\n \"faces\": {\n \"down\": { \"uv\": [0,0, 16,8], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"down\" },\n \"up\": { \"uv\": [0,0, 16,8], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"up\" },\n \"north\": { \"uv\": [0,8, 16,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"north\" },\n \"south\": { \"uv\": [0,8, 16,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"south\" },\n \"west\": { \"uv\": [0,8, 16,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"west\" },\nIn this example, four textures are condensed into one file, in this case for a &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;. For four textures, this code can be used:\n \"parent\": \"block/cube\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"particle\": \"block/barrel\",\n \"all\": \"block/barrel\"\n \"elements\": [\n \"from\": [ 0, 0, 0 ],\n \"to\": [ 16, 16, 16 ],\n \"faces\": {\n \"down\": { \"uv\": [8,8, 16,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"down\" },\n \"up\": { \"uv\": [8,0, 16,8], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"up\" },\n \"north\": { \"uv\": [0,8, 8,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"north\" },\n \"south\": { \"uv\": [0,8, 8,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"south\" },\n \"west\": { \"uv\": [0,8, 8,16], \"texture\": \"#all\", \"cullface\": \"west\" },\nItem models.\nAs &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s do not have different variants, there is no need to specify them. The folder codice_128 contains all the model files. The names of the files are hardcoded and should not be changed.\nSimple example: 2D beds.\nThis example replaces the bed item render with the textures currently found and formerly found , such as . This file should be placed in the folder with the name \"\":\n \"parent\": \"item/generated\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"layer0\": \"item/red_bed\"\nIn this example, the is set to , which means that this item model is a flat texture. In the tag, is set to the texture set for this item; in this case, the texture is called and is found in the folder. The \"\" can be changed out for all other colors of bed, but each must be put in a separate JSON file (e.g., , etc.). There must be item texture files (which is what is requesting) for beds found in the folder; these textures can be found below:\nRename the above files to (keep the file extension ) and place them inside the folder. Make sure to match the reference to the name of the item texture.\nItem predicates.\nSome &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s support additional predicates for model overrides. Below is a full list of available predicates.\nExample: Torch.\nThis example describes the &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; as an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;. The model can be found in the codice_105, which is stored in the folder codice_217.\n \"parent\": \"item/generated\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"layer0\": \"block/torch\"\n \"display\": {\n \"thirdperson_righthand\": {\n \"rotation\": [ -90, 0, 0 ],\n \"translation\": [ 0, 1, -3 ],\n \"scale\": [ 0.55, 0.55, 0.55 ]\n \"firstperson_lefthand\": {\n \"rotation\": [ 0, -135, 25 ],\n \"translation\": [ 0, 4, 2 ],\n \"scale\": [ 1.7, 1.7, 1.7 ],\n \"scale\": [ 0.9, 0.9, 0.9 ]\nThe codice_55-tag uses codice_59, so that the game uses the standard model of the torch, which has been generated out of the 2D graphic used for the item icon. The icon is specified with the codice_220-tag and the texture, that has already been used for the block model, is used for the icon as well. As there is just one layer hard coded for the torch, there cannot be any more layers added. Furthermore, the display properties for the torch are specified, so that it displays correctly in every possible situation. The torch cannot be placed on a players head and uses the specified icon in the inventory, so there is no need to adjust the model for these situations. To line the model up with the players left or right hand in first and third person view, the model needs to be rotated, moved and scaled, which is done for each of the two situation separately.\nExample: Fishing Rod.\nThis example describes the &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt;. The model can be found in the codice_221, which is stored in the folder codice_217.\n \"parent\": \"item/handheld_rod\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"layer0\": \"item/fishing_rod_uncast\"\n \"overrides\": [\n \"predicate\": {\n \"cast\": 1\n \"model\": \"item/fishing_rod_cast\"\n ]\nIn this model, the normal model is overridden if the fishing rod is cast, causing it to instead display the model codice_223"}

{"id": "7556", "revid": "36156286", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7556", "title": "Tutorials/Monster spawner traps", "text": "Monster spawner traps are a type of mob farm that uses a &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;. They employ the monster spawners found in &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s as a source of &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. The purpose of these traps is to create an infinite source of items that can be gathered in an efficient way from the mobs spawned by the monster spawner. Two general goals of these traps are to keep the player safe and to allow the mobs to spawn.\nFinding dungeons.\nDungeons are found when tunneling or exploring caves and &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s. They appear to spawn in random places, but almost always underground, usually at the Y=30 to Y=60 range. Finding dungeons without mods, cheats, or external programs is mostly attributed to luck and some know-how. While exploring, some tricks can be used to help detect dungeons. Gravity blocks like sand and gravel in a neat square may cover a monster spawner and is easily visible in deserts if spawned near the surface. Hearing or seeing a group of single-type mobs while caving could mean a monster spawner is nearby. Lastly, mossy cobblestone or normal cobblestone naturally spawning away from lava, is a dungeon, unless it is in a &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biome, where it can also be a &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonster spawners can be neutralized by placing torches to light up any dark areas around the monster spawner. With the exception of &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners, a single torch placed on the monster spawner is sufficient to disable it. Because blazes can spawn up to light level 11, multiple torches (light level 14) are required to neutralize a blaze monster spawner. There are six different mobs that can spawn. They are separated into two categories: the two-block high tall mobs - zombies, skeletons, and blazes - and the one block high short mobs - spiders, cave spiders, and silverfish. Similar variants such as the zombie villager are not included in this list.\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners can be generated in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es, and can be trapped to collect &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s and mass amounts of experience. Blaze monster spawners are the most dangerous to trap because of the height of the structure and the additional danger of lava. One must be well-prepared to contain this type of monster spawner, lest they might die from heights, lava, the blazes, or even external mobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Silverfish\"&gt;Silverfish&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners can be found in the portal room of a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. However, silverfish don't drop anything and are bothersome unless properly trapped. You may choose to simply break the monster spawner, unless you want to create a silverfish trap near an entrance to your base. Silverfish have some advantages: they are the easiest hostile mob to kill.\nNormal &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners are one of the easiest to trap, as they cannot fit through a 1 wide hole, so you can dig through the side and place a torch on the monster spawner without fear of getting hurt.\n&lt;a href=\"Cave%20spider\"&gt;Cave spider&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners are hard to trap since you will get &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt; on normal or higher difficulty, novice and intermediate players may be better off breaking or disabling these as soon as possible. These monster spawners are generated more often than other types, and some may even generate within 20 blocks of one another, which can be leveraged into an efficient farm. Because cave spiders can fit through 1\u00d71 spaces and between slabs, it is possible to make small, simple, and efficient grinders, although the difficulty in containing cave spiders can lead to spiders leaking out and/or poisoning the players.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners are also a bit tricky, as the monster spawner may spawn baby zombies, which are a 1\u00d71 mob, making proper containment essential, (particularly on harder difficulties). The zombies may spawn other zombies nearby to \"help\", making area security a priority, and the monster spawner may also spawn &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villagers\"&gt;zombie villagers&lt;/a&gt; which makes adding in some manner of player-controlled sorting mechanism a consideration. On that note, however, zombie monster spawners can prove to be one of the most lucrative to trap, as the variety of items it can drop is extensive, and potentially limitless if you factor in the added option to use it to generate Villagers, which can then, in turn, be traded with, themselves \"farmed\", or used to make &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; farms.\nSimple farms.\nThe three most common types of monster spawner are for &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. In each case, it's fairly trivial to set them up so that you can attack the monsters without retaliation, forming a simple farm for XP and their drops. Sometimes &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners can be treated similarly, but this is more hazardous. Proceed as follows:\nA bit of a special case: if you found a dungeon on &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20field%20shore\"&gt;mushroom field shore&lt;/a&gt; biomes, congratulations! Proceed as usual, but without worry about creepers or other stray monsters intruding, making it easier to make a farm without little distraction from mobs.\nThe Front.\nThe setup at the front will vary according to which monster you are farming:\nKilling mechanism.\nAny standard &lt;a href=\"mob%20grinder\"&gt;mob grinder&lt;/a&gt; can be connected to a dungeon. However, the purpose of this device is for players who are currently low on materials and can't yet build &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20Farm\"&gt;something larger&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; can be used to collect the items into a chest.\nLava blade traps.\nA lava blade trap consists of using &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; underneath the monster spawner and funneling these into a single line. At this point, the mob should find themselves approaching a sign at ground level and a 'lava blade' above it which flows over the top of the &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;, but no further. This allows the mob to drop items at their feet for your collection. A tutorial can be found here:\nTimed lava dispenser.\nA variant to the classic lava blade, the timed lava dispenser can be used to damage a zombie or skeleton to the point where one hit can kill it, allowing the player to get advanced drops and XP.\nThe timing in the repeaters will have to be adjusted depending on the mob type.\nDrowning traps.\nDrowning traps employ &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to drown the hostile mobs. Mobs and items float in water. In this example, the dungeon is a 5\u00d75 spider monster spawner, since drowning traps don't work on zombies and skeletons.\nTake out the torches and enclose the dungeon. Use signs to hold up water.\nZombies and skeletons will sink instead of float, and will not drown. This new feature provides other opportunities, however; for example, &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Drowned%20farming\"&gt;harvesting drowned in Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; is a source of &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlease note that the below tutorial is slightly imperfect; the glass panes have air spaces, sometimes letting the mobs survive. Use glass blocks instead, to prevent this.\nPlease note that you must fill up the column using source blocks, not just one at the top.\nFlow trap.\nThis trap is highly recommended. It's effective and safe on all mobs, except blazes, since you need water. Disable the monster spawner, and then make a 10\u00d710 room around the monster spawner. On one side, place water on every block. On the opposite side, make a one-block deep trench extending along the side opposite the water. Light up the trench well. The holes have to be next to water. Now, get plenty of food, a few chests, and two or three swords. Remove the torches and let mobs spawn. The water will bring them to you, and you can shoot them and hit them. Also, make a room to eat and heal in safety, just in case you didn't build the trap thoroughly. With this trap, you can go for hours in one go, and gain a massive amount of experience levels and items at minimum risk. The trap system is built in a way where you can easily leave when you want, with almost no creepers or non-monster-spawner mobs popping up.\nIf the monster spawner is a spider, make these adjustments:\nSunlight based traps.\nThis type only applies to &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners. Sunlight-based traps are made by placing water below a monster spawner. This water will flow from one side to another. Where the water stops, dig a pit a few levels down. This will drop the mobs into the pit. To finish, make sure that the pit is open to sunlight. This sunlight will burn the mobs alive. An example of this can be found here: .\nPotion-based trap.\nThis is a fairly expensive and hard-to-make trap, so it's not recommended.\nFirst: Light up the room to prevent mobs from spawning.\nSecond: On top, dig out 2 blocks from the monster spawner room top without breaking the monster spawner roof.\nThird: Place the wires and dispensers like shown:\n DWWWWWD X - Roof Block\n XXXWXXX W - Wires\n XXXWXXX D - Dispenser looking in the monster spawner room\n XXXLXXX L - Lever, button or even a redstone clock, whatever you want to power\n XXXWXXX the dispensers up!\n XXXWXXX\n DWWWWWD \nFourth: Put inside the dispensers:\nHARMING POTIONS: Used to damage spiders.\nHEALING POTIONS: Used to damage skeletons and zombies.\nPOISON POTIONS: Used to weaken any mob that is not undead.\nFifth and last, but not least: Take the lights out, get up, and when you hear the mob noises, push the lever/to activate clock/ whatever you used to power it up.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt; traps.\nIn this trap an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; is used to kill the monsters for you. To make it, simply make an iron golem in the dungeon and watch it kill for you. However, the iron golem will eventually die (especially if more than 1 mob is spawned), so you'll have to replace it with another, or link it to an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolf&lt;/a&gt; traps.\nSimilarly to the Iron Golem trap, have tamed wolves kill mobs for you. However, this only works for skeleton dungeons, as wolves will only automatically target skeletons. Additionally, as wolves have much less health than golems, you'll need to either have many wolves available, or weaken the skeletons beforehand (i.e. a large fall). The benefit of wolf traps over golem traps is that kills from tamed wolves can produce experience and extra loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;Cactus&lt;/a&gt; traps.\nThe following cactus trap is designed for spiders. It has a chance of destroying the items, but this is an inherent issue with cacti (this can also incorporate a small cactus farm by placing a block 2 blocks above the cacti).\nFall damage.\nFall damage onto hoppers is another option for killing mobs and collecting items automatically.\n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt; traps.\nThis trap only works with zombies. Both rooms in this design must be very dark. The zombies will try to get the villagers, they will fall through a hole, and if the room was high enough, kill themselves in doing so!\n&lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt; traps.\nOne way to make a blaze farm is to box in the monster spawner, so that the blazes can't fly away. Leave a space at the blazes foot level and stand so that your eye level is at that space. That way the blazes can't hit you (mostly), but you can hit them. This is also a pretty good experience farm since each blaze drops twice as much xp as other mobs with its health. Be warned, however, that sometimes blazes will spawn outside the box so it is advised that one box themselves in as well.\nAlternatively, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Blaze%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Blaze farming&lt;/a&gt; for video tutorials.\nA note on lava.\nLava can quickly kill mobs and can be suspended on either a ladder or a sign. To suspend the lava, create a 3-long channel then put a sign or ladder on the last block. Lava spreads three blocks away from the source, so the last section of the lava will be left suspended on the sign or ladder.\nLava generates light, which can lower the spawn rate in the dungeon unless placed far away; however the increased turnover of mobs may compensate for this.\n\"Johnny\" Vindicator Trap.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.11\"&gt;Java Edition 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, you can use an anvil, nametag and a vindicator to make a monster monster spawner trap.\nFirst, you need to find a monster spawner, then you need to make a wall with a door to make no monsters to leave the trap, then lure a vindicator to inside the trap.\nThen you go to your anvil and rename the nametag to \"Johnny\", then right-click the vindicator with the name tag. After it is renamed, the vindicator will attack any other mob except other illagers.\nIt's recommended to put more vindicators inside the trap. and also it's recommended to heal your vindicator using Potions of Healing.\nMagma trap.\nMagma blocks can be placed around the monster spawner as a floor, allowing mobs to spawn and then killing them. Items can be collected via minecart with hopper running below the floor, or with water leading to hoppers, making the trap fully automatic.\nOther.\nTraps that use unusual methods, such as huge pits, fall into this category.\nNote: Using a slab of cobble, planks, or sandstone in murder holes will prevent creepers and skeletons from seeing you, then you can retrieve items without breaking blocks, place the slab on top of where the mobs would usually stand.\nNote: Water mob elevators no longer work on zombies or skeletons, as they now walk along the bottom of water. They will still rise up bubble columns created by soul sand, but the challenge is getting them to enter the column.\nPit trap.\nFor this method, you must dig a pit that reaches far under the dungeon. Depending on the height (at least 23 blocks), the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; will die on impact, as long as there aren't any blocks of water at the bottom and the mob has weak enough or no armor. However, this method takes a long time to make and only works for monster spawners near or above the surface. Alternatively, you can build an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Water%20elevator\"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt; for the mobs using alternating water and signs to bring the mobs 23 or more blocks higher, and then drop them 23 or more blocks in order to kill them (or you can do 22 blocks if being used for an XP farm). Keep in mind that skeletons and zombies can randomly spawn with armor, which can be enchanted randomly. This can be remedied by placing a platform of magma blocks at the bottom.\nExperience trap.\nFor this trap, you need to dig a large pit 22 blocks deep under the dungeon, or make a water elevator taking them upwards so you can stay near the monster monster spawner. Go to the bottom of the pit and place water in a fashion so that it should flow towards a wall. Then make a room where the water is flowing. This is where you will stay while finishing off the mobs. Make the room so that it has a one-block hole where you can see the mob drop zone. Hopefully, mobs should spawn, fall down the pit and survive with half a heart, get pushed towards you by the water current, and get killed by a single hit. If you like, you can bring food along as your hunger will deplete over time. This should provide normal as well as rare mob drops and experience levels, making it quite useful. Another technique is to leave your player by the dungeon for a couple of hours, overnight is suggested, and there will be at least a hundred monsters waiting to be harvested. Keep in mind that the maxEntityCramming gamerule can limit the output.\nEfficient pit + experience trap (by Epiiik).\nBegin digging upwards in a 1\u00d72 fashion for 24 blocks. To get up, place signs on the long-faced wall (your left/right) in a zig-zag pattern going up while placing water blocks in between the signs. The first sign should be placed as furthest, lowest space possible. Stop placing signs after the 23rd level. The last water block should be against the wall furthest away from the mob monster spawner on the 24th level. \nOn the 25-24 block levels, dig a 1\u00d72 hole for seven blocks in the direction the mob monster spawner. On the seventh block in, dig one block downwards. Dig in the forward direction for eight more blocks (again, 1\u00d72). You should notice the water block placed on the 24th level should stop where the path drops by one block. Place a water block against the wall of the drop. Notice how this water block stops 1 block short of the path.\nDig further for two block and begin to dig downwards in a 1\u00d71 fashion for 22 blocks, Face the direction of the mob monster spawner and dig another 1\u00d72 hole one block deep. Dig down one and fill the top level with one block so that you can only see through one block of the pit you just created (if you are using a skeleton monster spawner, you need to stand one block away from this hole so that the skeletons cannot shoot you). You are now standing at the loot point. Now that the almost-dead mobs are depositing into your 1\u00d71 hole, simply attack them with any item to gain their loot and experience! You may use TNT + water to do splash damage to kill all mobs at once at the risk of lag spikes. Splash potions of Healing also work, as they do damage to most hostile mobs.\nNote: you must have 2 block tall non-exploding mobs to do this or the mob either destroys or escapes from the trap.\nUseful tips on this design by Duck//Marvin: When you make the opening in the spawn chamber for the mobs to exit, make it 3 blocks high and place a sign or slab at the top. This lets the mobs into the elevator more easily and prevents water spillage from the elevator. Also, making the transport corridors at the top 3 blocks tall instead of 2 allows the mobs to be transported faster as they do not hit the ceiling when they try to swim and get stuck.\nAlternative layout.\nAn alternative layout with a smaller footprint takes advantage of the fact that a player must be within 16 blocks of a monster spawner for it to activate, but that monster spawners only check 9 blocks vertically for spawned mobs. Build the trap as above, except instead of being off to the side, the killing floor is 4-16 squares directly above the monster monster spawner. This requires less material, less x,z space and less precision in construction, though is 3-15 blocks taller.\nTo construct the trap this way, build a 9\u00d75\u00d79 room around the monster monster spawner with flowing water leading the mobs into a corner. Build a water ladder in this corner going 26-38 blocks upwards as measured from the top of the monster monster spawner. At the top of the ladder, direct the mobs a couple blocks in any direction with water, and into a 22 block drop chute. At the bottom of the drop chute, create a platform 1 block lower, with a 1x1 \"window\" into the chute through which you can strike the mobs safely from the platform.\nAnother experience trap (by AlexxShadenk777).\nFirstly it should be noted that this was made with a zombie monster spawner in mind. Basically you just make a balcony of sorts and wail on the zombies as they approach you while being unable to hit you.\nSeal the zombie monster spawner in a 5\u00d75\u00d75 chamber, naturally, you want it to stay in the center of the chamber at the lowest height. Outside of the chamber make a platform that is 2 blocks high that surrounds the outer wall, and while standing on this platform, punch a wide hole in the corner of the chamber 1 block above the platform. Remove the corner block so you can stand in the corner while the zombies practically funnel toward you. They'll be able to push you, but not hit you at all, so you're free to smack them on the head with your weapon of choice.\nNaturally the rotten meat they drop will remain inside the chamber, but the experience points will hover toward you. If for some reason, the points end up too far just walk around the chamber to their nearest corner.\nOptional: lead some tamed wolves into the chamber before sealing it!\nExperience trap.\nRecollect the torch and stand where the end of the tunnel is.\nIf done correctly you can slay the mobs and get experience and rare drops from mobs.\nHumanoid monster monster spawner xp trap (by HeofShadow).\nThis type of monster spawner is made for Humanoid type monster monster spawners (skeletons, zombies, and in some cases zombie pigmen), but can be modified for a spider monster spawner. First disable the monster monster spawner and areas around it with Torches so Mobs do not spawn and disrupt the creation of the trap. Now make a room 17 blocks wide by 9 blocks long and anywhere from 4-7 blocks high, with the monster spawner being in the rough center and 1-2 blocks above the ground. Now dig out the bottom row 1 down everywhere except the center, which should be dug down around 7 blocks. Place a water source block on each end of this dug out area and it should stop just before the center. Now place water source blocks at the top so that it should stop before running into the dug out area. Remove the torches so that the mobs start spawning, and go down so that you are at eye level with where the center area was dug down 7 blocks. Make it so you can only see the mobs feet on one side, and on the other use a slab to make it so you can just see the top of its head. This allows good use of both swords And bows (Also, some servers give bonus damage for Headshots).\nS-bend design.\nThis type of trap allows a one-hit kill on zombies and skeletons; however, the drops and the experience are farther away.\nExpand the floor so that there are two blocks of air below the monster spawner, and the walls so that the room is 9\u00d79. Dig four blocks down on the block directly below the monster spawner and place water source blocks in each corner.\nDig one block north and two blocks south (three blocks tall for each direction), then go towards the south end, and make an access shaft. At the north end, dig a shaft, 30 blocks deep, and three pointing west. At the bottom, make a small room and light it up. Place ladders on the west end, and make an access shaft to the top of the ladders. Place blocks to the east of the ladders, except for the bottom few.\nPlace two bottom slabs on the block south to that directly below the monster spawner, and place trapdoors liberally (zombies and skeletons can climb ladders). Optionally, place hoppers at the bottom of the collection room.\nMultiple monster spawners of the same species.\nTo maintain maximum efficiency a trap must take on an increased complexity in keeping mobs separated or moving quickly when dealing with multiple monster spawners of the same species. Minecraft first checks within the 17 wide by 17 long by 9 high area with the monster spawner in the center (or 8\u00d78\u00d74 radius from the monster spawner) for mobs of the same species as the monster spawner. If there are fewer than 6 mobs of the same species in the checking zone, it will spawn a mob within half the distance of the checking radius. This means that with two monster spawners of the same species near to each other, there will be a zone that mobs will count for both monster spawners and severely impact the spawn rates. It would be a wise idea to work out where these checking zones overlap and ensure that mobs being funneled to the trap do not enter that zone and/or leave the overlapped/checking area as quickly as possible to maintain peak monster monster spawner output."}
{"id": "12665", "revid": "41445157", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12665", "title": "Tutorials/Morse code", "text": "Morse code is a method of transmitting information in a series of dots and dashes. A dot is a short &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; pulse, a dash is a long pulse. Dashes are approximately three times as long as dots. In Minecraft, there aren't any specific uses for creating a communication device, but it can be an interesting experiment.\nIntroduction.\nFor Morse code to be able to be sent and received in Minecraft, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuits\"&gt;redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt; will be required. There are two main gates for first decoding the signal - an &lt;a href=\"AND%20gate\"&gt;AND gate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuits%23RS%20NOR%20latch\"&gt;RS-NOR latch&lt;/a&gt;. It's recommended that you read up on those and get familiar with them before proceeding. There are three main sections of this - the Sender, which will create the signal required, a Decoder, which turns the signal into a series of lights indicating the dots and the dashes, and finally a Translator, which can be connected to turn that information into a single light representing the letter sent.\nThe Sender.\nThis is the simplest of the three sections - all that needs to be achieved from this is something that can later be decoded into either a dot or a dash. To do this, you will need to make the signal for a dash longer than that of the signal for a dot. This can be achieved by using what has become known as &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Pulse%20Circuit\"&gt;'Monostable Circuits'&lt;/a&gt;; which are easy to produce due to &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s. As repeaters can also be set on a delay, you can use this to increase the time take for the message to be sent through the wire. . This will be used for the dash and the reset option, which will be created later. The dot doesn't require any delay or extension as it can be detected by the fact that it hasn't been increased.\nThe Decoder.\nNow, after the 'Sender', this is going to be much more complicated. What you want to be able to do here is a system to be able to understand the dots and the dashes and convert that into a light display. To explain this, it's best if just explain from the image.\nHere you can see one section of the decoding system. The initial decoder doesn't require the first AND gate and instead comes straight from the input 'I'. When the first input comes through it will be sent into a length detecting and gate 'B' or the repeater and gate, if the signal is long enough it will be able to pass through this and gate and then power the rs-nor 'C', which will then allow the Q for dash to be on. If the length of the signal is not long enough to pass through 'B' it will then not activate the Rs-nor, instead it will just go where the signal also goes which is round to the next 'C^', rs-nor which once switched will send a signal round to 'B' therefore not allowing any more signals to pass through. When this happens the power from the 3rd input of the 3 input 'and' gate 'B' will go to the Q(dot). If the power for the dash is on then it will over ride the dot turning it off, if it's on otherwise if the dash had been activated and then the signal goes through the dot would also be on, so you will need to make the dot turn off when dash is on, you can do this as shown, feeding the power back into the Q dot.\nYou will notice that at 'B' there is four repeaters delaying the message to the 3rd input this is because you need to allow time, if it\u2019s there, for the dash to pass through and then block the gate so it can no longer be affected by any other impulse. The rs-nor 'C^' which activates the 3rd input also goes into another and gate which when the next impulse comes through will allow the signal to pass and go the same process again as before.\nThat about does it for the decoder.\nTo build the reseter, you need to just place redstone torches under all the rs-nors and then have a repeater 'and' gate the requires more than a dash would and set up a button for that, it is would recommended to use a delay after the gate as well to make sure that no other things will change when you send the reset through the system. Also remember that you want the lights to be OFF, default and then turn on when you want to reset.\nThe Translator.\nThis works almost the same as any normal decoder system that uses redstone repeaters. As mentioned before, the repeaters have the ability to pass power into a block, this is what you will exploit in your translator. \nTo get all the different signals to the translator you will need to choose a position, it is suggested to position it somewhere to the side of your decoder, but you need to remember which light means which. To keep the lines from interfering with each other, it is best to put the lines of wire on alternate levels (create bridges). Remember to check your wires to make sure that the signal does not exceed 16 blocks. Now the first stage is to get all the signals together. To do this you use repeaters, which has the unique ability to prevent signal interference.\nIf you have done decoding before, you might have noticed that the signal is the wrong way round as you inverted it when you got it to the repeaters, so you might be thinking didn't you will need to invert them then before you got to the repeaters, well the answer is no unlike most signals Morse code has lots of lapping over like A and E, E is dot and A is dot dash, as you can see the E is contained within the A for this reason, you will need to be able to define the requirements more, to do this you will in the end have basically have two and gates for each letter, but it will explained more of later.\nTo start, you will want to create a line of repeaters all the way along, remember if you haven\u2019t sent a signal through your system, or you've reset it which it will be mentioned at the end, then all your repeaters right now should be on, if there not then you need to go back and check, first of all check that you've reset them and then check your wiring to the translator. If you have got them all on, then it should be good, so far. After your line of repeaters you're going to want to create a line of any block, it is suggested to use sandstone or mossy cobble for mine but it's personal, it won't affect the wiring. Now continue this on so that you have 26 lines of blocks, the number of letters in the English alphabet. So, now you can kind of see your translator taking shape now to make the process easier for yourself later, it is suggested to place redstone torches all the way along the blocks on every row, you'll understand later. That took some time didn't it; be warned that there\u2019s going to be a couple of tasks like that in this tutorial. Once you've got all your redstone torches set-up you want to place a row of blocks above everyone pulse two extra blocks on the end that you want the final signal. By now, your rows should look something like this.\nNow that you've got the repeaters and the lights set up, you want to place wire all along the top of your blocks to the end and then place a torch coming down the side facing where the input came from. As you can see, it has been moved this signal down, inverted it, and then put it to a light which will show the letter.\nThis is the first and gate down. As well as being able to power the block and the wires next to that block, it also powers the wire under nether, you can use this feature to be able to create the next and gate; sort of, but before then, you are going to go through and program the first and gate, now as you have already placed all the torches it is now quite easy to program in, basically you want to pull up your Morse code showing you the different signals and then remove the torch that is it meant to be, remember that it will go in pairs, dash dot, dash dot, dash dot and so on, so to program in A which is dot dash you need to remove the 2nd and the 3rd torch. It is very important to make sure you get the right end display. Although, it can always be done at the end, or with the next step, which is to create the second and gate, this will in the end mean that the signal will only be on when all the criteria is full filled, to stop any of the incorrect lights showing. Now, to do this you are going to want to remember where the gaps are in the torches, for example, by giving the gaps all numbers and writing down which ones are empty. It is suggested to do this row by row. Create a trench directly underneath the torches two deep, and now for everything\ngap that you had place a block and a redstone wire on to it and feed the redstone wire overall of them to the opposite end of the torches away from where your display is. This is what 'A' would look like underneath, now you want to get this message up to the top layer of your row, where the redstone wire is. You do this using vertical wiring and then feeding a wire to connect them both up, like this.\nOnce this is all connected up to each one, you're complete you should now go test your system for any mistakes."}

In order to do that, press the windows key and \"R\" together to open run, from there you can type in \"%appdata%\\\" and click the .minecraft folder (copy %appdata%\\ and paste it in run). It will be a good idea to pin the .minecraft folder to Quick Access in File Explorer so you can access it more easily.\nNext, you need two worlds to move the structure you want from one world to another. This requires a structure block, which means you need to have cheats on in that world. If you don't have cheats on, you need click \"esc\" and click \"Open to LAN\" to turn on cheats. Type codice_1 in the chat to get the structure block. Next, put the structure block at the north-west corner of your build (a good way to find out the north of your world is to set the time to night and make sure the sun is on your left and the moon is on your right), open it by right-clicking the block, left-click the \"DATA\" button on the bottom-left until the structure block enters Save Mode, and type in the X, Y, and Z sizes of your structure (you can also detect the structure size if you do not want to type in the sizes so you can use coordinates instead by clicking \"alt\", \"fn\", and \"f3\" together). The bounding box should show up (if you have \"Show Bounding Box\" on in the structure block) around your structure (or the size you typed in earlier) to see your accuracy of the size. If it is wrong, retype the size until you get the right size for your structure. If you want to save &lt;a href=\"Item%20Frame\"&gt;item frames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;boats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Painting\"&gt;paintings&lt;/a&gt;, or other &lt;a href=\"Entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; in your structure, you need to turn \"Include Entities\" to \"on\" in the structure block.\nAfter the size is right, type in a structure name for your structure (capital letters don't work), in this case, we will use a structure called \"battle_tank\". After you finished renaming your structure, click the \"SAVE\" button at the bottom right (the bottom left \"SAVE\" button switches the mode) to save your structure. You do not need to copy a structure in the other world you're moving your structure to.\nExit the current Minecraft world you're copying the structure from and enter your other world you're moving the structure to. Save another blank structure (you can type \"a\" as the name) to make sure that the \"generated\" folder will pop up in that world folder when you need it later.\nAfter that, you need to click \"saves\" inside the .minecraft folder to see all of your worlds. Click on the world folder inside saves you're moving the structure from and enter that folder. You will see a folder named \"generated\" inside that world folder you just copied your structure from.\nClick on that \"generated\" folder, and open the next couple of folders inside the \"generated\" folder (\"minecraft\" and \"structures\") until you find yourself in the \"structures\" folder, where all of your structures from that world are stored in NBT files.\nRight click the file you want to move (in this case, we will click \"battle_tank\", but you have to right click your file) and go to your other world that you have opened a while ago and want to move the structure to that world. Same as the previous world, find the \"generated\" folder in that folder and keep on entering the subfolders until you enter the \"structures\" folder inside that world. If you cannot find the \"generated\" folder, you need have at least one structure copied using a structure block in that world or else that folder won't pop up. Once you entered the \"structures\" folder, paste the NBT File into that folder. \nNow, go to your Minecraft world (the world you want to move the structure to) and place down a structure block (make sure you use /&lt;a href=\"Commands/give\"&gt;give&lt;/a&gt; to get it first) and go into load mode by clicking the bottom left \"DATA\" button until it says \"LOAD\". Type in the structure name you saved your structure as earlier (in this case, we'll type in \"battle_tank\" but you need to type in your structure name), click \"LOAD\", (same as earlier, click the \"LOAD\" on the bottom-right since bottom-left changes the mode) and it should show the bounding box around your structure.

In factions servers, players team up to dominate the map. This can lead to some epic fights, as well as much fun. However, players that are new or are simply uninformed can be quite befuddled by the different play-style as it adds several new mechanics. Often, people with end-game gear dominate the spawn point, all blocks within a 10,000 block radius of spawn are inhabited, and most of the resources within a 20,000-block radius are stripped bare. With the right knowledge, and a little bit of luck, though, it is possible to lead your faction to rule the map.\nA significant portion of this guide also applies to anarchy servers, although in that case be aware that they will have far more hostile environments and players on top of the widespread use of hacked clients, non-existent claiming system (if someone wants your land, they'll just take it from you or grief it into oblivion), and near-total lack of rules.\nPart I. Getting Started on a PvP/Factions Server.\nMultiplayer servers often have custom commands or items in order to facilitate the functions that they offer, so it's important to research the commands that the server or its plugin use. This can be done online by looking up the command list, or you can use codice_1 to check the commands in-game. The following paragraphs are using popular examples of commands that accomplish common functions, so they should be accurate for the most part, but they may not match up 100%. \nBe sure to inform yourself of any plugins or mods in use by the server. These can change up the gameplay drastically, so they're worth you familiarising yourself with them and reading up on them before joining.\nStarting out.\n&lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;: 60\u2013120 seconds\nHead to the server spawn using , then type in (or , or ) to get yourself teleported to a random spot in the wilderness. Input the command to check if there are any other factions nearby. If so, move away as far as you can, at least until they disappear from the faction map. Secondly, use to look at the top three factions and take note of their membership and numbers. The numbers represent land claimed, current power, and max power. If the current power is 0 or negative, then you can claim their land. If the land claimed is 0, then they have no territory (though they still probably have some gear). This is not necessary for where or how far you want to go, but such information is always handy. Most servers also give players a set of stone tools (although some give far more than that) to start with. If you do not have anything, then type or . If that doesn't have any effect, then or might work. Remember to use /help to easily find out the commands the server uses.\nAlso, check in on what plugins are in use on the server by doing codice_2. If you do not have permission, ask a high ranking staff member or the owner. Different mechanics, such as a guns plugin or a steel mod, can greatly change the worth of resources, and you should double-check it before making a plan of what to do or where to settle.\nFind out about the largest factions (normally the top 4 or 5 on the faction list) and who is fighting who. Typically there will be a large conflict between the two largest factions, or a smaller faction that is fighting an alliance of other factions. This information will prove useful later when you need to make allies, enemies, raid, and conquer.\nOn the road again....\nTime: 30\u201360 minutes\nOnce you have information on the factions, as well as your set of starting tools, head out and find a good location for your base. As long as you have a stable amount of food, sprinting won't be much of a problem. As you hike, make sure to do all of the following:\nChoosing a Location.\nTime: 5 seconds - 1 hour\nOnce you have reached a safe distance, it might be worth it to keep traveling depending on where you are and what you want to do. \nThere are a few recommended setups you can go with listed below. Dinky wooden houses that you might build on singleplayer worlds or co-operative &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; servers won't cut it in the savage world of Factions PvP (player vs player), and many a newcomer has been destroyed because of their lack of knowledge on proper base building. You have to be stealthy and fortified. Read the list below and see which one appeals to you and your location the most:\nTotal time spent in Part I: 31 minutes to 3 hours\nPart II: Bases.\nIt is suggested that you make a base that blends with the environment to prevent it from being found easily. Underground bases accomplish this the most effectively, but certain kinds of blocks can be used to make your base a little bit less apparent, e.g. snowy blocks for snowy biomes; grass, dirt, and stone for most \"green\" biomes...\nSpending time on making a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Piston%20uses/Full%20Jeb%20door\"&gt;piston door&lt;/a&gt; can help, as it makes the entrance to your base much less apparent, making it harder for people to just stride in, and can sometimes even make your base close to invisible.\nI. The Aboveground Castle.\nPlanning.\nTime: 0\u20135 minutes in \"Minecraft\", 5\u201315 minutes offscreen\nTerraforming.\nTime: 3-5 hours\nNo matter what your plan is, you're going to need flat land, and lots of it. Stone shovels are the best tool for clearing out tons of dirt, since they're quick, cheap, and easily replaceable. Likewise, stone pickaxes are best for the odd clump of stone. First, dig out the perimeter of your base, then start digging in. Keep a lookout for hostile mobs or even other players that have tailed you - extreme distance is a good defense, but it's not infallible. Also, make sure to plant those saplings, and use some &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt; to grow them quicker if you have any bones. By the time this is done, you should have a ton of dirt leftover. If the server also has a shop plugin, great - all that dirt you dug up is probably worth a couple of diamonds. If not, then keep it on hand just in case. You never know when a cheap, unburnable, gravity-defying filler material will be useful. In addition, a lot of dirt gives you a potential advantage with the ability to create massive farms.\nPhysical Defenses.\nTime: 1 hour\nYou've got your area\u2014now it's time to secure it. There's three types of defenses: Active, Passive, and Hybrid. Active defenses actively try to kill any threats posed. This could be people in your faction defending against the attacking enemy, landmines, fall traps, arrow dispensers, etc. They are usually activated when a threat is within range and lay dormant when they are not. Passive defenses attempt to stop potential threats before they become threats. These usually are obstacles rather than deadly things. This might include iron doors, cobwebs, walls, stacks of gravel, and the location of your base if it is somewhere hard to get to. Sometimes active and passive defenses come together to form Hybrid defenses, which are, as you might have guessed, a combination of active and passive defense. This could be lava inside a wall to flow out when someone tries to dig through, checkerboarded holes with landmines inside, and many other creative combinations. When designing your defenses, strive to have mostly hybrid defenses, and have a good balance of active and passive defenses. A base with fully passive defenses will eventually be gotten through, and if your base has only active defenses it will be so easy to get into that the attrition of enemies will eventually exhaust your active defenses. This isn't to say that \"all\" your defenses should be hybrid, but \"most\" of them should be.\nIn addition, there are many ways you can use redstone contraptions to protect entrances to your bases.\nHere are a few pointers on defenses:\nGetting Ready For the Rest of Forever.\nTime: ???\nAt this point, you've gotten past the limits of this guide. Your adventure to be the top dog is up to you now. If you still don't know where to go, then some suggested steps are:\nTotal time spent in part II: 2-8.5 hours\nTotal time spent in total: 2.5-11.5 hours\nII. The Flying Base.\nSo, you want your base high in the sky. Well, there are some pros and cons to this idea.\nPROS\nCONS\nPicking a Spot.\nSelecting a spot for this is hard. As previously stated, don't make this thing in an extreme hills or jungle biome. If it's high enough over an ocean, plains, desert, etc... then it will take a while to notice and often be obscured by clouds. If it's over an extreme hills or jungle, anyone getting materials from a tree or climbing a mountain will look up and see your precious base sitting there. You don't want that. Instead, build it over a valley or a plain or desert. That should help disguise your place. Another idea is to build it over a plains forest, because most players will travel beneath the trees and will not notice the great big shadow on them. Don't build it over forests, though, if the trees are too tall or if they're too sparse, as players could notice the shadow or be high enough to see your base, and don't build it if the trees are too dense because most advanced players will travel above them to avoid monsters and hiding players, and it's a lot easier to walk on, and ultimately see your base.\nGetting Up There.\nThis is pretty hard. You want to get up in the sky. You don't want anyone to know you're in the sky. Your only real option is to pillar up there. But how will you get down? The answer: sethomes.\nMost, if not all factions/PvP servers, allow you to set a \"home\" that you can return to at any time. If this is one of those servers, you can skip the portals and instead type /sethome (or /f sethome to set your whole faction's home), and /home (or /f home) to return to the exact point you used /sethome (or /f sethome) at. Set your home up in the base, and then have a pool of water to fall into right below your base. Then, when you want to get up, just type /home! \nIf you don't have /f home or /sethome, never fear....\nThe answer for you? &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether transport&lt;/a&gt;!\nFirst, get enough obsidian and/or molding supplies to make two portals. Next, make sure there's no one in a 100-block radius of your soon-to-be base. Then, pillar up about two hundred blocks: not really necessary, but it's a nice height. Sure, you can't really see the ground, but people will need a LOT of dirt to get up there. After that, make a Nether portal up there. You then want to go about sixty-four blocks away from your location. Make another portal. Go through it, and back in the Overworld, cover it up using dirt or something to make a convincing, small hill. Go back through your portal and make a walkway to easily get between your portals. You may wish to disguise it later, but it's fine for now. Go back through your sky portal and you'll end up on top of your pillar. \nAnother good method: Place a torch in an 8-block pit, place cobblestone above the pit, place TNT by the cobble, and put a WOODEN button on the TNT. Build a gravel pillar up. Once you can almost not see the ground, shoot the button and quickly place a cobblestone below you. You should be on a block of cobble 40 blocks in the sky. Repeat until you are at your desired height.\nOnce you're on top of your pillar with your preferred method of transport in place, build a few blocks off, smash your pillar, and make a small platform.\nBuilding of the base.\nNow you've got a platform. You've got to build off from it to make your base. There are basically two approaches to this:\nYou may want to make a sort of (safety net) above and/or below the platform. This way, if TNT lands on the roof, then it will take extra TNT to get to the actual platform. The one underneath prevents you from falling and dying every time you walk along without paying attention to the terrain.\nAnother way to prevent getting your base all blown up is to add a liquid shield, preferably water, which is infinite. TNT doesn't destroy blocks while submerged, and water is much easier to obtain than high-end materials like obsidian. However, plugins may change this, and hybrid cannons may become an issue.\nWhichever you choose, this kind of base is good because it protects you from your foes BEFORE they see you. Of course, it has weaknesses in the fact that it is tricky to set up in the first place and can be somewhat hard to defend, depending on how you build it.\nTo make it easier, build murder holes (holes in the floor or ceiling that you can shoot arrows though). You may also want to build a few \"outposts\" around 50 blocks from the ground. That way, you can kill enemies easily. Beware though; if you build outposts, then it's a dead giveaway that there is a sky base somewhere around, so only build them if you have at least 2 chunks of land in each direction claimed and aren't worried about stealth.\nYou want to consider whether you value the looks of your base over its defensive capacity. Of course, if you're a gifted architect, you could try both, but remember that construction is difficult.\nAdd defenses. Build smart, so that anyone trying to ender pearl in will either hit a vertical wall and fall to their death, or land on the roof in a layer of lava. Space out some glass to let a bit of light through, which may help to hide your shadow. Another thing you can do to help disguise your shadow is to build the floor out of glass. Using this is a triple victory, as it is cool to look down on the ground, it hides your shadow, and you can see any enemies pillaring up. Build the lowermost deck in a ring shape so that there is no \"blind spot\" under your base.\nGetting Ready For the Rest of Forever.\nTime: 5 seconds - Infinte\nAt this point, you've gotten past the limits of this guide. Your adventure to be the top dog is up to you now. If you still don't know where to go, then some suggested steps are:\nIII. The Massive Cave Base.\nFor a video example of a massive cave base, check the embedded video below:\nKeep in mind, this base was made on a server that has explosive damage and ender pearls disabled.\nPROS\nCONS\nConstruction.\nThe first thing to do is deciding where do you want to build your base. The best location would be an ocean, far away from the shore, but beware, as people can drop their render distances to glitch inside. Once you have located a good spot, create an airshaft and start digging down. You usually want to build the base at layers 10-20 so you can mine for diamonds easily. Get ready for LOTS of spare cobblestone, and you will eventually run into &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, and if you're lucky, &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;.\nNOTE: Be sure to get as MUCH obsidian as possible, if you encase your base in obsidian, there is no need for an ocean. It is also in some ways better than an ocean due to the render distance glitch and hybrid cannons.\nFirst part: the core/main base.\nOnce you are at a good depth, it's time to begin digging out the base. Don't start tunneling just yet! Dig out a square (4 blocks of height are recommended) big enough to contain all the basic rooms of the base (crafting room, enchanting room, forge, furnace room, storage room, and others). 25x25 should be more than enough, though you can expand it as you wish. Build walls and start decorating the basic rooms.\nSecond part: the outer ring/add-ons.\nOnce your main base is established, then you can begin tunneling and expanding. What will you make a tunnel to is your choice. It can be a &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; farm (same design for &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt; farms), a &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; farm, a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20grinder\"&gt;mob grinder&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%20techniques\"&gt;mine or quarry&lt;/a&gt;, it's up to you. Just keep in mind that you'll need to claim everything that you expand into or else other players can get into your base.\nThird part: secret rooms/basements.\nThis step is optional but recommended. It's a good idea to have a secret door that leads to a basement located at an even lower depth than your main base. There you can keep a secret storage room to stash your valuable resources in (be sure to leave some of your iron/gold/diamonds in the main base. If enemies break into your base and find no resources, they'll probably figure out there's a secret room), and also a library to store &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; containing information on enemies and their bases.\nGetting Ready For the Rest of Forever.\nTime: ???\nIf all is done correctly, you'll have an underground fortress deep below, don't put it in the ocean, as people can use a low render distance to glitch into your base, instead, make a water wall, with hybrid defenses. Be sure to cover the air-shaft used to access the base, or disguise it to make it look natural, hiding the trapdoor. This can seem like paranoia but it's always good to have more stealth and safety. Your base will take a very long time to be found even if enemies are hunting you relentlessly.\nAt this point, you've gotten past the limits of this guide. Your adventure to be the top dog is up to you now. If you still don't know where to go, then some suggested steps are:\nHow to secure your chests.\nThe underground cave is the easiest to secure chests with. Probably the best way to protect your vault is doing the following:\n1. Make many vaults- To steal your loot, they have to aim a TNT cannon to your chests (if you have it claimed). If you have many vaults it will take them a lot of TNT to get everything, and most players will give up. Make fake vaults with empty chests too.\n2. Make the richest vault in the middle- Again, the only way to steal from chests is to TNT cannon them from afar. The furthest they have to build the cannon, the more TNT they will need, The less their chances to hit are.\n3. Protect the vault with obsidian and water blocks- Some servers have a plugin that allows 3 TNTs to destroy an obsidian block. This means you need more defense. Water prevents TNT from damaging blocks, so a wall made of obsidian with water in front of it is very secure.\n4. Anti-hybrid defenses- Even the secure base wall described above is crack-able. A cannon shooting both sand and TNT will allow the TNT to blow inside the sand block, and that causes damage. To counter that you can make upside down stairs, instead of a straight wall, with water going down all the way. That way the sand will fall down and the TNT will not blow.\n5. Keep improving- No base is completely unable to be raided. Even the anti-hybrid quadra thick obsidian water lava base. If someone finds a way and raids you, evolve. Block this path they found. Keep doing that, and eventually, you will have an almost unable to be raided base. Keep in mind that the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; boss can penetrate all blocks EVEN obsidian and water (with blue skulls, and spawn and death explosion and dash attack in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;) making the only cheap defense regenerating cobblestone walls, but hybrid cannons can penetrate those, so it will be hard to wither proof your base.\nIV: Underwater base.\nPROS\nCONS\nMaterials: fist, dry sponges, pickaxe (stone minimum) and torches if too far from the surface, (optional: pistons, buttons, redstone)\nBuilding the base: First, obtain some sponges. Either raid them from an &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;, buy them from the shop, or steal them from another person. Then, go find an ocean. A really big ocean. Then, go to the bottom and place down three sugar cane in a stack. You'll be able to breathe when standing in the sugar cane. Begin building your base above ground under the water. Don't worry about draining it yet, just build what you want it to be. Go ahead and build more space than you think you'll need so that you won't have to expand and flood your base again. Once you have it completely built and sealed from the outside water, take those sponges and use them to drain out the inside of your base. You now have an underwater base!\nTo get out, you'll either have to use:\nAn ocean monument can make a good underwater base. All you need to do is to clear out the water using sponges, eliminate all three elder guardians and you got yourself an easy base! Most people won't bother to check all the monuments because there are quite a few. Also, the guardians that spawn outside the ocean monument can act as a good shield against most basic players. However, certain players may try to enter due to the 8 gold blocks in the treasure room, which you should have already removed by this point. If you hear Guardians being damaged when you are not killing them, it is likely some players are trying the approach the monument. Shoot at them with bows to try and keep them away, and the combination of the guardians' beams, your arrows, and their drowning will either kill them or damage them enough that they will stay away.\nIf you do decide to build a base inside a monument, it is advised to place a massive roof (60x60) above the entire area (Preferably made of glass, and at block limit level 256 so to be less noticeable), so that the guardians spawn more often to defend you. Flooding any nearby caves in at least a 100x100 area will also help this.\nIf you \"really\" don't want your base to be defeated, you can choose to have no entrance, block up all the entrances and reinforce the weaker walls with 3 layers of obsidian, \"leave the elder guardians there\", and enter only using /home or nether portals. This method is possibly the most effective out of all the bases, as it takes multiple days for even an experienced group of players to remove enough water for TNT to be an issue (if they don't remove enough water, the water will flood any area they attempt to blow up, undoing most of their work), and mining 3 layers of obsidian under the effects of mining fatigue III will take over \"thirty hours\" using a \"&lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Pickaxe\"&gt;Diamond Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;\" (257 hours using bare fists). This is just to destroy enough obsidian to fit a player through. Even with Efficiency V and Aqua Affinity, mining through will still take 1.5 hours. Nobody will bother to do this, especially when they're drowning underwater with a crowd of guardians firing lasers at them. Also, slab the entire area around your base, so that players cannot take breathing spaces by placing doors everywhere, and slabs don't clear enough water for players to breathe.\nUnderwater bases are great as they are entirely submerged into water, if any players want to grief it they have to either:\nV: Nether base.\nConstruction.\nFirst of all, you're going to need a way into the nether. Get enough obsidian/molding supplies to make a portal, then make and hide one (generally underground). Be sure to claim this chunk! Then /f sethome next to it, and head on through. If it's a good enough place for you, keep going. If you're in a bad place (i.e. over a lava lake), then you should probably head back to the overworld and move your portal elsewhere. From here, there are three ways to go about your base (keep in mind that all the defenses in the world won't save you if your portal is in your base).\nTraditional.\nHollow out an area in a wall, big enough for however big you'd like your base to be (but keep spaces smaller than 4x4x4 if you don't want ghasts to spawn), then line it with cobble or obsidian. Afterward, skip to the next step.\nStolen fortress.\nHead to the nearest nether fortress and begin by walling off any corridors leading from the area you want your base to be. Then make sure any place you \"don't\" want blazes and skeletons spawning to have a light level of 15 (most easily done by covering the floor with jack-o-lanterns). It would be advisable to undergo obsidian padding. When you're done, move to the next step (after you've raided everything in the fort).\nUnder-Lava Fortress.\nBuilt mostly like an underwater base (see above), however, fire resistance potions are best used in place of water breathing potions (for obvious reasons), and you will be moving MUCH more slowly. However, when you're finally done, it's near invisible, and most players will give up trying to reach it. Naturally, it's much easier to have each player use /sethome in the base after using /tp to reach you than having everyone swim down and wasting precious resources doing so. You should also note that most servers will let you use /spawn in the nether, so you can leave. As an extra precaution, have an emergency potion of fire resistance for every member of the faction, in case of a leak. Be sure to have \"no wood or wool \"inside any part of your base (in 1.9 this becomes less of an issue due to splash water bottles). When you're done, proceed to the next step.\nNethertop Base.\nPenetrating the top bedrock of the Nether will give you a very large, flat plain of bedrock(with the occasional mushroom) to work with. Also, as the top of the nether can only be penetrated by the most skilled players, stealth is completely optional. Build a normal, overworld above-land stronghold on top of this bedrock and light up your area (mobs usually won't spawn on bedrock, but they'll start appearing once you start building something else). If possible, elevate the base 1 block from the bedrock surface so that anyone attempting to pop above the bedrock directly under your base will succeed (and suffocate), and use a Fire Resistance potion and lava to build TNT-proof walls. Exit can usually be achieved with a Nether portal or /spawn. One can also build a nether-sky base once they get up the bedrock.\nNote: This is Java Edition only.\nStep 2: Interior functionality and defense.\nYou will need a different set of supplies in your base if you're in the nether, you will need extra brewing stands for the constant resupply of fire resistance potions, fewer chests devoted to fuels since buckets of lava and blaze rods are readily available. Furnaces are also needed less in general as few things in the nether need to be smelted. Weapons and armor will see much use, so have extra anvils ready. A map showing where the nether portal is located is also crucial should you need to return to the overworld. Crafting tables remain necessary, as will enchantment tables. Setting up a melon farm is likely your best source of food, as the plant's growth is unaffected by how fertile the soil is. \"Be sure to have cauldrons filled with water.\" For defense, you can usually get away with pitfall traps and arrows, though you will still need obsidian padding.\nGetting ready for the rest of forever.\nAt this point you've gone beyond what the wiki can help you with, if you're not sure what direction to continue in, here are some ideas:\nVI- The End Base.\nSince in most multiplayer servers, the End dimension is usually broken and destroyed by previous players, this base style will likely not be the player\u2019s first base, but built while the player already has a base. Not many people can be bothered searching the entire empty void, so this is a very good stealth-oriented base. It\u2019s hard to build, but the means justifies the end. \nCons.\nMaterials: Choice of wall material (&lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, obsidian), &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, 5-6 &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; stacks, some armor and weapons against endermen.\nBuilding:.\nMain Island.\nPros:\nCons:\nBuild your walls out of obsidian and include a liquid layer. Build your defenses. Add farms, grinders, trading halls, anything you need.\nOuter Islands.\nPros:\nCons:\nOf course, you teleport first to the end (watch out for other enemy players!). Then, make sure no one is watching, then make a bridge or travel via End Gateway to whatever direction possible, out of the main island. Make sure you destroy the bridge. The main island should not be at least visible. You can start on the base immediately as soon as you are content with the surroundings like how many abandoned or non-abandoned bases are around. Make sure to claim the area first. Then, a few hours later, your base will be done!\nVoid Base.\nPros:\nCons:\nDig a hole down to where you want your base to be. Have people guard the top of the hole. When you reach the void, use lava and water to build a cobblestone pillar to the void. Place ladders on the cobblestone. At the bottom, make an overhang and use that to start your base. Fill in the deep hole so raiders cannot get in. Use a flying machine/elytra for leaving the base or going to the surface.\nSecret Base.\nPros:\nCons:\nBuild a flying machine and drive it to where you want your base. Place blocks on the machine so the pistons can't move. Use those blocks for your base. When you finish your base, fly back and bring in your animals/villagers. Make sure the flying machine is at the right y-level, or else the machine will go over the base, or suffocate the animals/villagers.\nDefending your base against hackers.\nYou will probably want to try to protect against hackers, some of the most unfair players in a game. There are several options. Most of the options below are ways someone can protect against most hackers.\nSome fly hacks can allow a hacker to easily fly around and reach any sky/end base. The best way to combat this is to place lava around the base, preferably two layers, as well as lava all the way to the block limit (at least 5 blocks higher than the top of your base), so that they cannot enter easily.\nWhat you need: Depends, but at the most, some &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s, any large quantity &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s/anything that can contain items, but not be detected by ChestESP.\nFor Xray hackers, they can see into the ground, ignoring any &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; entities, and can see any bases underground. This is mainly for underground bases.\nWhat you can do: 1. Make it extremely small: bases are harder to detect by x-ray-ers, if they are small. So, try to make your base as small as possible. 2. Surround it with &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s: Average hackers keep x-ray on the same setting as normal, which means that they cannot see through ores. Surround your extremely small base with ores, preferably &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, with a silk touch pick. Try to make it look like a natural cluster of ores, not big or even shaped. Coal is recommended, as it is in large blobs. Also, try mixing the &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;s with other ores, preferably iron ore.\nFinal Tips.\nKeep these in mind as you become the top faction:\nRaiding.\nNow that you have learned how to defend from raiders, you want to read up on how to do some raiding of your own! First, you must do some planning before you stage a raid. \nYou need to find the enemy's base. This may be the hardest part. Send out trackers and spies to find any enemy activity. Then hunt relentlessly and look into any odd landscaping or other signs. Signs can be things like flatter-than-usual mountainsides indicating Jeb doors, 1x1 lava pits that may cover a pressure plate, and weird landscaping (hills in a flat biome). One good tip is to always be suspicious. Or, if you get raided, just stalk the retreating attackers home.\nLook at everything you can see from the outside. If the defenses are similar to yours, then think about weak spots you have (or had) in the defenses. Also, take note of the biome and defenses to figure out what gear to bring along. Then think of a rough draft of the attack plan. Will you drop down from the nearby higher terrain to glide in with elytra? Or will you use Potion of Invisibility and Depth Strider III to knock a hole in their underwater glass wall? Get creative with your plan!\nUse all the information you have gathered to organize a raid.\nFirst of all, don't expect to win. They may have a secret last-ditch trump card you overlooked. Maybe, they had more organized anti-raid drills or possibly you just lost for no particular reason. Don't call it a total loss! You probably brought something of theirs home with you. You may win some other raid someday, but always remember, if you raid a faction's base, they will fix the weak spot, and you will have to adapt and overcome.\nRaid examples.\nNote: These are not the only ways to defeat the enemy. These are just examples.\n1: The Above-Ground Castle.\nYour enemy has built this base on top of an extreme hills. They have a giant wolf army and landmines around the walls. \nSend someone with elytra to scout their base before you fight them. When you have prepared your best equipment, go over there. Destroy all the landmines, and break through the walls. Don't let the enemy attack you, or their wolves will kill you. Bring as many people as possible to fight the wolves/players. Once the base is defeated, take the loot.\n2: The Flying Sky Base.\nYour enemy's base is in the sky, on a floating island. There are 5-block thick walls, with an obsidian layer, a liquid layer, and a checkerboard layer. All the players are inside, and their dispensers are filled with lava, to pour on raiders trying to pillar up. There are traps on all the chests, and the enemies have Punch II bows, splash potions, and Channeling tridents. When you go raid the base, it is a thunderstorm and no one will sleep through it.\nHave people with elytra scout out the base. For the actual raid, have everyone bring elytra, and a few shields, as the enemies use ranged attacks. Kill the enemies by shooting them with a bow, or splashing them back. If possible, have someone with invisibility sneak in and do some critical hits. Your enemies will be too late to notice that you were invisible behind them with a Sharpness V/Fire Aspect II/Sweeping Edge III netherite sword. Once the enemies are dead, pillage the base and destroy the defenses. Fly away with the loot you have taken.\n3: The Massive Cave Base.\nYour enemy's base is underground, surrounded by 3 layers of obsidian. There is an elder guardian inside the base inflicting mining fatigue. The owners of the base have trapped chests leading to arrow dispensers. The secret room has a trapped chest, which is linked to dispensers on all sides, and will shoot splash potions of harming. One of the owners is in the base, while everyone else is exploring. \nHave everyone dig for the base until they find obsidian. If you get mining fatigue, you can spawn a wither, as it is unaffected by mining fatigue. Run away and have the wither blow up the walls. When the wither has blown up the walls, enter the base, and try to take as much loot. Lure the wither into the secret room, and have it blow up the traps. Make sure it doesn't blow up the chest. Take as much loot as you can. Don't kill the wither. Heal it with potions of harming, run away, and have it kill the enemy base owners.\n4: The Underwater Base.\nYour enemy has an underwater base inside an ocean monument. The only entrance is a nether portal inside the monument. The walls are reinforced with 3 layers of obsidian, and the elder guardians are all trapped inside. The whole monument is filled with water, except for the nether portal room, which is under the monument. According to your spies, the owners are out exploring and are not going to come back for a very long time. There is a drowned army locked inside, which the owners believe should be enough to stop any invaders. All the drowned are given Impaling V tridents and each one has full iron armor.\nBring as many people and give each person an Impaling V/Riptide trident and full enchanted netherite armor. Each person should bring a netherite sword with enchantments.\nHave one person carry a full inventory of splash potions of water breathing and healing. Have another person wear aqua affinity and respiration turtle shell, use an &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; V pickaxe to break the walls. The person with potions should splash the miner with water breathing. Everyone else fights the guardians and protects the miner. When the walls are broken (which should take several real life hours due to mining fatigue, and let assume somehow the base owners haven't returned yet), team up to fight the large amounts of drowned. Once the drowned are dead, destroy the nether portal. Raid the base, but don't kill the elder guardians. When you exit, fill in the hole you mined with obsidian. Don't make too much damage to the outer structure, or else the owners will find out. This method will surprise the owners when they see the nether portal is broken. If they try to get back in from the outside, they will be very surprised that have mining fatigue and can't get in, and later realizing that their items and drowned army are missing.\nA much better strategy is to spawn as much &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s as possible. The wither will fire at any living life form (including the &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; around the base. Many players don't know that the wither can fire out blue skulls that can destroy even obsidian submerged in water. Now, let the wither bring havoc and act as a distraction as you loot the base.\n5: The Nether Base.\nYour enemy lives in a treasure room &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Remnant\"&gt;Bastion Remnant&lt;/a&gt;. They have a lava moat, fireball cannons, and a magma cube army. The spawner is covered with obsidian, and there are piglins and piglin brutes everywhere. The chests are hidden in a secret room under the lava on the bottom of the bastion remnant. The enemies have fire resistance, powerful netherite swords, and Protection IV netherite armor.\nHave someone fly with elytra to the base, and scout it out. For the actual raid, go to the base together, and destroy the magma cube spawner. Fill in all the lava by covering it with obsidian. Anyone in the secret room will be stuck and will be burned if they decide to break the obsidian. Make sure your team wears gold armor, and doesn't make the piglins mad. Trap the piglin brutes in boats, and destroy all the defenses. When the enemy comes to attack, shoot them with Punch II bows, and use tipped arrows. Punch will still knock them back (???), and potion effects go past their armor. Use arrows of poison and harming. If you can get them, use arrow of decay in Bedrock Edition. Bring some milk just in case they have the same ideas. Try to kill all the piglins and piglin brutes. Escape with elytra if you are low on health. (Don't hit the ceiling or fly into a wall.) Also bring potions of Fire Resistance\n6: The End Base.\nYour enemy has a secret base 5 million blocks from the central island, high up at Y 200. It is a secret base, and is very hard to find. The enemy has iron golems for defense, and has endermen in it. The base has high walls made of obsidian. The enemies have netherite armor, netherite swords, and highly enchanted bows. There is a lot of redstone traps. The rooms also have lots of villagers wandering around for distractions. The enemies are currently exploring, but they may come back if they see flying machines coming.\nBring elytra, but don't fly to the base with it. Use a flying machine. Make sure people are there for defense. Build some fake machines as decoys, and put tamed wolves in minecarts in each machine.\nBring as many tamed wolves as you can, and put small groups in different flying machines, so the machines fly into the base in all directions. Have the owners stay in the same machine with the wolves. Give every player and wolf invisibility, and bring a lot of invisibility potions. When in the base, Destroy as many traps as you can. If you see the players, have the wolf owners use the wolves to kill the enemies. Have your team shoot them from a distance. Don't let them shoot you. Also, be careful not to hit any villagers/iron golems. After killing the enemies, pillage the base and take what you can from it. Build a flying machine home, and use invisibility the whole way."}

{"id": "137813", "revid": "53537967", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=137813", "title": "Tutorials/Multiplayer survival", "text": "This tutorial is intended to help advise the player when playing on a public survival server with strangers.\nIf you are playing only with friends on a private server or an LAN world, each situation is different, and you will have to adjust to how you play the game if you want to have fun.\nIf you get bored of these tips, feel free to break a few, or all. These tips are just to ensure the player has the most fun when playing with others.\nNote: This guide is not for Factions. Factions is a different minigame with different rules and strategies.\nStarting.\nFirst, you will have to find out a few things:\nRoleplay servers.\nPlayers assume a role in this server. For example, they can be a rebel, a loyal soldier, a mercenary, an assassin, etc. They can also be a powerful dictator and the server also has a finished story that must be followed. \nOne of the best examples of RP servers is the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dreamteam.fandom.com/wiki/Dream_SMP\"&gt;Dream SMP&lt;/a&gt;. Dream himself is the main antagonist of the SMP. \nFriendly servers.\nThese servers meet most or all of the above conditions.\nWhile these servers are not 100% safe, they are generally cheater-free, friendly and encourage cooperation. There is not much strategy needed apart from a singleplayer world, and depending on the server, you might be safer to build things that you would normally not in a singleplayer world (e.g. &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; explosions turned off), and it is also recommended to engage in trade, if the server's players have set up an economy or you happen to be near a lot of players. Trading with players is a good way to start making new friends, along with helping them in various ways. The only rule is to be nice to others to get the best experience from these servers.\nThese servers are usually not Hardcore servers, but on the few that are Hardcore servers, try to bring friends to reduce the overall chance of death for all of you.\nVanilla servers.\nThese servers meet a couple of the above conditions.\nThese servers try to install a minimal amount of plugins other than anti-cheats and moderator plugins. These servers want players to have a vanilla experience, so you will need to keep your guard up as there are ways for your day to be ruined. There are a few tips:\nHardcore servers under this category must be played with extreme caution, as an enemy can quickly either give you a ban (allowing the player to rejoin after a few days at a random location so they can continue playing, albeit having to start over) or make the server unplayable in survival forever if they kill you or you fall into one of their traps.\nSemi-anarchy servers.\nThis is a mix of both vanilla and anarchy servers. The players here are encouraged to fight and usually grief and loot bases but usage of hack clients, duping, x-ray and other rules that the server owners add are prohibited.\nThe best example of a semi-anarchy server is Lifesteal SMP hosted by ParrotX2. The server allows fighting, griefing and conquering territory but bans netherite tools except for shovels and pickaxes, totems of undying, end crystals, respawn anchors, strength II pots, x-ray, hack clients, etc. \nAnarchy servers.\nThese servers meet none of the above conditions.\nThese servers are brutal, with only a bare minimum of rules (which only prohibit things like god mode hacks, in which a player is immortal, or activities that cause things like extreme server-side lag or intentional map corruption), and an unmoderated chat. These servers may even be prone to crashes caused by players or map corruption, and players with hacked clients are the norm, not the exception. &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Griefing%20prevention\"&gt;Griefing&lt;/a&gt; is all but an inevitability for players who choose to build anything out in the open. \nThese servers are not recommended for most players due to their unwelcoming and unforgiving nature, and many of their users are unwelcoming to new players and will probably spawnkill you. \nSome tips for anarchy servers are: \nCivilization SMP.\nHere, players are divided into groups. Sometimes, each team had a special perk that makes it unique from other teams. For example, in MARCUSK's Dimension Civilization video, the Overworld team had the advantage of the overworld's vast and rich resources, the End team being supplied with OP gear and elytra from the End Cities and the Nether team, although their environment was hostile, had the power of netherite. \nCivilization SMPs are often a symbol of fighting prowess, survival skills, teamwork, and tactical intellect. For example, in MARCUSK's Zombie Island Civilization video, a rogue faction of players who attempted to kill anyone almost won the entire competition due to their fighting prowess and teamwork, only losing due to a trap planted by one of the players in revenge of massacring his entire team.\nHow to survive in a server.\nIn friendly and RP servers, don't worry as fighting isn't really a problem. RP servers still fight but only for roleplay so expect your stuff to be returned after the play.\nVanilla servers are much more different. Competition is important, so it's better to gear up fast. Try to not make as many enemies as possible, as they might band up against you. Instead, try to go far away and get max gear ASAP. \nIn semi-anarchy players, survival and combat skills are much more important. Before joining this type of server, practice on PVP servers first such as PVP Legacy. Also, try to get good gear ASAP and set-up your HQ far away from spawn to prevent it from being griefed or looted.\nPVP is an important concept in PVP even if you're on a chill server. Don't try to fight when your gear is still bad. Max it out first. Although a full set of iron armour and tools is the bare minimum to deem you fit in fighting, it's much better if you're on full diamond or netherite. Also, know the basic concepts of PVP such as the kit, tactics, fighting methods and more. \nDiplomatic skills are very important. Forge alliances or friendships with strong players on the server. The reason why it's better to team up with strong players than weak players is because they have the resources to provide you gear, farms and more. Although beware of the risk of betrayals so it's also good to have a sense of suspicion. Or if you have no friends, you can grind alone. \nTo get the max gear quickly, there are a variety of methods, from simple mining/caving to trading. Trading is safer but it would require you a lot of mining trees but they provide you a full set of gear in just a few minutes without having to sacrifice your time dying in the dark. Mining/caving can provide you more diamonds but is harder and somewhat inefficient unless you would want to acquire the cobblestone/cobbled deepslate for later use.\nThe most important gear for PVP is a fully enchanted sword, armour, axe, bow, pickaxe and optionally a trident enchanted with Riptide and fully maxed out crossbow. Other things you'd need for a fight are some pots (recommended are Strength II, Swiftness II and Fire Resistance 8 minutes, you can also add Regen II and Healing II for quick regen), golden apples (64 is recommended), XP bottles (around 2 stacks), arrows to load your bow and crossbow, a water bucket, some nutritious food such as golden carrots or porkchops, and optionally an ender chest filled with backup gear and a silk touch diamond or netherite pickaxe.\nIf you joined an anarchy server, expect what is to come, including hackers, rude players, etc. It's recommended to have a hacked client of your own (normal clients such as Lunar won't cut it, as they don't have hack modules such as xray and advanced PVP methods). If you don't trust clients on the internet, you can code your own client, but it does require extensive knowledge of Java and programming for it to actually work. Alternatively, you can buy a hacked client instead, but it requires money and are typically more expensive than Minecraft itself."}
{"id": "40302", "revid": "40407133", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=40302", "title": "Tutorials/Mushroom Farming", "text": ""}
{"id": "12913", "revid": "50490299", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12913", "title": "Tutorials/Mushroom farming", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Mushroom\"&gt;Mushroom&lt;/a&gt; items are useful for a variety of purposes. They are available from three sources: huge mushrooms, mooshrooms and normal small mushrooms.\nHuge mushrooms.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on either a red or brown mushroom causes a &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt; to grow if enough room is available, and if the mushroom is planted on the appropriate &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;. Huge mushrooms can give at least 20 mushrooms when harvested. The image to the right illustrates the minimum growth requirements:\nBear in mind that the huge mushroom may still attempt to grow at a taller height than space is available, failing and wasting a bone meal. It is therefore usually ideal to farm with the maximum space available (7\u00d77\u00d78), so that the bone meal can never fail.\nHuge mushroom farming.\nThe basics of huge mushroom farming involve a 7x7x8 space and suitable ground. If you are outdoors, you can plant the mushroom using &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"overworld\"&gt;overworld&lt;/a&gt;, podzol is more easily available. To make podzol, plant a giant &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; tree with four saplings, and wait for it to grow. When it grows up, chop the tree down and use the newly formed podzol to plant a mushroom and bone meal it up. Planting consumes the underlying block, so you must occasionally regenerate by planting giant spruce again. (Mycelium can spread to the dirt, so no manual work is required.)\nAnother way to farm mushroom outside relies on timing: dig a 1x1 hole where you want your farm to be. Place &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in the 1x1 hole. Then, plant a mushroom in the water and use bone meal on it quickly before the mushroom unplants.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt; is a good choice for growing huge mushrooms on. Note that you can spread nylium to adjacent &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; blocks by using bone meal on the netherrack.\nThe extent of automation possible with mushroom farms is close to that of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Tree%20farming\"&gt;tree farms&lt;/a&gt;. You might be able to get some ideas from these harvesters. The bone meal input may require &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Bone%20meal%20farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; too.\nSmall mushrooms.\nBecause mushrooms do not grow on areas where the &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; is greater than 12, the farmer must carefully consider the placement of light sources. Mushrooms are placeable everywhere but well lit areas or non solid / transparent blocks, and do not require water, sand, or extra space like &lt;a href=\"crop\"&gt;crop&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHowever, even at night, they can be planted only on blocks where the light level would be less than or equal to 12. The exceptions to this are &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, on which they can be planted and remain in full light. They can then spread slowly to other opaque blocks.\nThe main danger in small mushroom farming is that they must be low-lit indoor rooms, which poses the risk of hostile mobs spawning in the same area (except on Peaceful mode). This can be countered in several ways. The easiest way is to place copious numbers of &lt;a href=\"soul%20torch\"&gt;soul torch&lt;/a&gt;es, as they emit light level 10, which is dark-enough for mushrooms and lit-enough to prevent mobs. Another way is to place normal torches two blocks above from where you want your mushrooms to grow (sometimes in tiny holes cut into the ceiling overhead). Another way involves making the farming area just one &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; high and paving any walkways with &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s and using a water system to channel the mushrooms out of the farm room and into a collection point. This removes most of the danger, since mobs cannot spawn on half-blocks or in one-block-tall areas and any other areas can be lit up. The &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; is a safe place to start a mushroom farm, since mobs there do not spawn in small spaces.\nSpread Mechanics.\nWhen a mushroom receives a &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Random_tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;, it has a 4% chance of \"attempting\" to spread. When this happens, the game chooses a block near the mushroom and, if a mushroom could be planted in the chosen location, a new mushroom appears there; otherwise the attempt fails. The algorithm used to choose the new location for the attempt is not a simple random selection, but a multi-step algorithm that depends partly on which surrounding blocks are valid locations for planting a mushroom.\nSome key aspects of the spread algorithm are:\nNote that a block is considered a valid location for a mushroom to be planted if:\nIn addition, mushrooms attempt to spread only if there are fewer than 5 mushrooms of the same type in an area of 9x9x3 around the original mushroom.\nMooshrooms.\nShearing a &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt; drops 5 of its respective mushrooms and convert it into the normal cow. Every ~5 minutes mooshrooms can enter love mode and make a baby, which can replace any adults that have been sheared.\nFarming methods.\nMooshroom farming.\nThis method involves breeding mooshroom cows or striking Mooshroom cows with lightning, and then shearing them for their respective mushroom type. 5 mushrooms are dropped when sheared. This is a cheap and quick method to obtain large quantities of mushrooms in quick succession.\nBasic small mushroom farming.\nThis method relies on thorough lighting to ensure a monster-free, no-mining-required farm for the beginner &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt; farmer. Create a room two blocks high and as large horizontally as desired. At regular intervals dig one block up into the ceiling of your room, and place a torch to create recessed lighting. This casts &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; of level 12 at floor height, allowing mushrooms to grow and spread. You can place torches at a distance of up to six squares between each other with no danger of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s spawning. This setup allows for the fastest mushroom growth. Spread the mushrooms on the floor with room around them to grow and wait.\nAnother way involves making the farming area just one &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; high and paving any walkways with &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s and using a water system to channel the mushrooms out of the farm room and into a collection point. This removes most of the danger since mobs cannot spawn on half-blocks or in one-block-tall areas and any other areas can be lit up. The &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; is a safe place to start a mushroom farm since mobs there do not spawn in small spaces.\nFarming mushrooms in this way can be rather difficult due to their slow growth. The most efficient method if one must use small mushrooms would be to plant unlike mushrooms in pairs, each pair no less than 9 blocks away from its neighbors -- preferably on mycelium so they can spread in any light level. By planting unlike pairs, one can get 10 mushrooms in a 9x10x3 space instead of just 5 in a 9x9x3 space. Obtaining a high yield requires a significant time and space investment, and typically isn't preferable unless huge mushrooms aren't feasible.\nAnother option is to prepare a large underground room and use &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt; to grow &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, which can then be mined for multiple mushrooms per mushroom block. In order to secure a reliable source of bonemeal, the player can set up a crop farm and grow &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s as a \"fodder crop\" and use a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; to convert the produce and any excess seeds into bonemeal.\nTunnel method.\nOne way of growing a red &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt; on the surface of the world at any time of day without &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; (using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;) is to dig a tunnel starting from several &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s where the mushroom should sprout, and plant the mushroom two or three blocks below the surface at the end of the tunnel. Then, dig a single block chute to the surface from above the mushroom. If the mushroom is deep enough underground, it does not pop off when exposed to the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; above it. Once there's light, use the bone meal and see if it grows the mushroom. If it does not, there may be too many blocks in the way of the mushroom, in which case, planting the mushroom closer to the surface may make it grow.\nFully-Automatic Mushroom Farming.\nUsing water dispensers and a light sensor circuit.\nIn the following design, mushrooms are planted on central platforms and new &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s spread to side platforms. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; flows once a day through the side platforms delivering the newly-spread mushrooms to &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s and finally into &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOn the central platforms, mushrooms can be planted in packs up to four mushroom of each kind. Planting more mushroom increases the spreading speed, but also reaches its cap limit sooner. In the video (that is unlinked in any form), three mushroom of each kind are planted, as it gives higher daily output.\nThe side platforms should be one block high to improve efficiency. The central platforms should be 3 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s high. \nIn the video (that is unlinked in any form), the central platform uses &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; blocks, as mushroom can't spread over &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;.\nA circuit, using a &lt;a href=\"daylight%20detector\"&gt;daylight detector&lt;/a&gt;, emits two delayed pulses once a day. Activating and deactivating &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s containing &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, making &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; flow through the side platforms for about 12 seconds. Enough to deliver every new mushroom spread in the side platforms to a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; collection point that eventually stores the mushrooms into &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe farm can be covered in glass, if the platforms are built in &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be covered with any other non-transparent block.\nUsing pistons.\nA simple fully automated &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt; farm can be built with the use of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. \nFirst, a room of the height 2 is needed, in this room, place a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; stream in the floor, 2 blocks wide. It transports the mushrooms out of the room. Mushrooms should be planted along the bank of the water, leaving every other block empty. Lastly, pistons are required to be placed facing toward the water stream. They need to be placed beside the blocks, where no mushrooms are planted.\nThe pistons need to be wired to an outside switch, the water stream shall be redirected to your favorite collection point. Then, the room needs to be sealed to be completely dark. The only opening should be 1x1 wide, for the water stream. This being the only opening, spawned monsters cannot leave the room. Eventually, the mushrooms spread to the blocks in front of the pistons. Activating the pistons then harvests the mushrooms and push them into the water stream. The system is reset by deactivating the pistons without any need for replanting.\nHigher efficiency can be achieved by multiple arrangements. The system can even be arranged in a room of the height 1, this makes setup more difficult though.\nPiston/Glass Based \"Dry farming\".\nThe idea here is that &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s can also be popped off by causing the block beneath them to change to &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, you can push 12 blocks of alternating block/Glass rows causing any mushrooms growing on them to pop off.\nThe basic set up is two sets of pistons facing each other on either side of the seed mushroom row. Upon pushing a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; a signal is sent causing the first group to extend popping off the mushrooms. The signal is delayed 12 ticks (3 &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;repeaters&lt;/a&gt;) and the second group of pistons then extends resetting the farm.\nGenerally this is designed for use in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, where \u201cwet\" methods are unavailable. Some benefits over other \"dry\" methods are simplicity and low resource requirements."}

{"id": "23927", "revid": "1907256", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23927", "title": "Tutorials/Music disc farming", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Music%20disc\"&gt;Music disc&lt;/a&gt;s can help break the silence of the world but they can often be difficult to obtain. Most music discs are dropped by &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s which are killed by a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is it hard to get a skeleton and a creeper together, but it is even harder to get the skeleton to kill the creeper.\nWhen farming music discs, you want a way to make the skeleton and creeper stand still in a controlled environment. In that environment, the skeleton should have a way to hit the creeper, while trying to hit you, and the skeleton must not be within the creeper's trigger radius. (Note: If you hit the creeper before the skeleton shoots it, it will cause it to only target you until you are further than 16 blocks away or until it can no longer pathfind to you.)\nExample designs.\nOne way to ease the task of obtaining music discs is to trap the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; in a fixed position. Doing this properly makes it easy to get the skeleton to kill the creeper.\nTrapdoor pitfall.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, it is possible to trick &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s into thinking that they can walk over a hole. This is because mobs see trapdoors as safe to walk on, even when open. In the example video below, a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; is trapped behind two trapdoors, while a creeper is lured in front of it using trapdoors. The player can then stand behind the creeper causing the skeleton to finish the job.\nPiston trap.\nThis design uses &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s to trap the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; in one spot. As shown in the video, to use this trap, you must first lure a skeleton into place onto the pressure plate of one of the traps shown in the schematic. Once that is done, you should weaken a creeper and lure into a second chamber. Finally, you should be able to stand behind the creeper and cause the skeleton to deliver the finishing blows.\nBoat trap.\nYou can also use boats to trap skeletons and creepers into place. Trapping a skeleton may prove difficult however since they cannot swim. With both a creeper and a skeleton in boats near to each other, you can swim between the boats and cause the skeleton to shoot the creeper. If you have enough armor and health, you can also enter the skeleton\u2019s boat and move it closer to the creeper.\nOR\nYou can get a boat to trap the creepers in it. Make sure there are skeletons nearby and get them close to the boat. Try to get the skeletons to shoot the creepers in the boat. Keep repeating the process until you get the discs you want. Do not put them in the same boat. If the skeleton shoots the creeper, the creeper may explode!\nDesigning a factory.\nBy combining use of one or more of these designs, it is possible to make a music disc \"factory.\" With a factory, the process should be streamlined as much as possible to ensure a rapid collection of discs. On average, you will need to get 49 music discs to get all 12 songs.\nObtaining mobs.\nBefore you can get a steady flow of music discs, it is necessary to find a reliable source of creepers and skeletons. It is fairly easy to get skeletons as you really only need one of them. To ensure it does not despawn, you should &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;rename&lt;/a&gt; it or find one that can pick up a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get creepers, it is possible to simply find them in the night and lure them into a trap. However, this can get cumbersome, especially when you want to get a lot of music discs. Instead, you may want to make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creeper%20farming\"&gt;creeper farm&lt;/a&gt; and connect it with water streams to your factory.\nFull Disc Factory.\nThe above is an example setup for a full music disc factory. This setup uses a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; trapping mechanism but it is possible to use another. When designing your own farm, the most important key is keeping the &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; 3 or more blocks away from you and the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, there is a chance it could explode and destroy your factory.\nIf you are luring the creepers into your trap, it is probably best to build it underground. Otherwise, you will need to find a way to get them up and into the structure. If you want to be able to see the process happening, you can use &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne issue you may run into is the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;'s aim. Often the shots may be too high and hit the ceiling. To fix this, you can replace the blocks preventing the creeper from moving with &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s and raise the ceiling. Another way to adjust the skeleton's aim is to lower the player by half a block.\nTo collect the music discs, you have several options. You could collect the discs manually, collect the discs with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; streams, or collect the discs with a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;. If using water streams, run the water so that it pushes the creeper against one of the walls. Then, remove the bottom half of the wall so the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s can flow through but the creeper remains stuck.\nTips:\nFighting at night.\nRather than using a specialized setup, it is also possible to fight the &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s manually at night. If you do this whenever you see a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and creeper together, it is possible to slowly accumulate music discs. Note that you will want to have good armor when doing this as you will most likely take damage from the skeleton.\nBefore getting the skeleton to kill the creeper, you will first want to lower the creeper's health as much as possible. It is recommended to use a Diamond Sword with Sharpness III and Knockback II. Two fully charged non-critical hits with the sword will drop the creeper to only 1 heart of health which will make it require only one skeleton arrow to kill. Once the creeper has low health, either get between the skeleton and the creeper, or line yourself up so the creeper is directly in between you and the skeleton. Either way, when the skeleton is shooting at you then the arrows should be able to hit the creeper. When the creeper gets too close, you will need to move away and try again. It will probably take multiple attempts so be patient!"}

This tutorial focuses on some of the easier ways of navigating \"Minecraft's\" landscapes.\nSpawn Points.\nEvery world has a set &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Player%20Spawning\"&gt;spawn point&lt;/a&gt; where players are placed when they first enter the game, and each time they die (see below about beds). The world has one spawn point, and all players spawn within a few blocks of that point. (Formerly, single-player games had a specific spawn point, but now they use the same system as multi-player.) In multi-player, the area around the spawn point is \"protected\", so that only server operators can build or destroy blocks there. Making a base too close to a multiplayer spawn area can also expose it to &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt;, so in multi-player it's usually better to move some distance before settling in.\nEach player can change their individual spawn point by sleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. In versions 1.16, using a charged &lt;a href=\"Respawn%20Anchor\"&gt;Respawn Anchor&lt;/a&gt; in the Nether also sets your spawn point. If the bed is removed, destroyed, or blocked, the spawn point is lost, and the player respawns near their world's original spawn point. A world's original spawn point can be found easily using a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, as of 1.16, compasses can be set to point toward a &lt;a href=\"lodestone\"&gt;lodestone&lt;/a&gt;.\nX, Y, and Z Coordinates.\nIn \"Java Edition\", opens the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the player's current &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt; in the world. All three coordinates are measured in \"blocks\", which are considered equivalent to meters of distance. These coordinates are interpreted as follows: X gives your distance east of the origin, and Z gives the distance south. Both of these can be negative, for positions west or north of the origin. The Y coordinate displays the altitude in meters, which is negative if seeing deepslate or in the rare case of falling through the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; level is at Y level 63. The spawn point is within a few hundred blocks of the map origin (X and Z of 0). The &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; also shows what direction you are facing. It is displayed as North, South, East, or West. It is also displayed as a numerical value, though this is not always useful.\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is a world option that always shows the coordinates. They are measured in the same fashion as in \"Java Edition\".\nThe simplest way to avoid getting totally lost is to write down the X and Z coordinates of your main base and other locations of interest. Then simply compare your current coordinates to the recorded coordinates and travel in the appropriate directions until the coordinates match. This method of navigation is particularly important for exploring the Nether. In \"Java\", a convenient way to record coordinates in-game is to use to copy your current position in teleport command form, then simply paste it in the chat (remove the codice_1), optionally adding your own annotations. \nDo note that many servers have the `reducedDebugInfo` gamerule enabled, which prevents these coordinates from appearing in the debug screen.\nAbove-Ground Navigation.\nDirectional Guides.\nMinecraft has an accurate system of cardinal directions.\nTrail Markers.\nYou may want to build your main base away from the world spawn point, and in that case, it's a good idea to construct a series of landmarks to follow, especially if the path is long. The use of trail markers is far more resourceful and time-efficient than building long roads. Place all trail markers in such a way so you can always see two markers from the one you are standing at: the marker you came from, and the marker you are heading to. This prevents you from losing the trail. It is also advised to have the markers placed or designed in such a way that you always know which direction leads to the origin of the trail. Here are some methods of marking the trail:\nRoads and Rails.\nTo connect two locations, dig a two- or three-block wide trench between the two places. This trench can later be filled in to make a nice-looking path or road. Light the pathway to make night travel safer, and fences can be placed along the sides of the road to keep mobs away. To connect the road to more locations, create forks in the road with signs listing the directions to different places. A minecart rails could also be added to speed up travel.\nMaps.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mapping\"&gt;Tutorials/Mapping&lt;/a&gt;\"\n&lt;a href=\"Map\"&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to keep track of different locations in the world. Maps are not exactly centered on where they are activated, because they snap to a grid. They also start off with a very small scale, and need to be zoomed out to a reasonable scale after activation. Each zoom level takes 1 paper in a &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;, and doubles the map scale and clears any current contents. The new map remains centered roughly where the previous map was activated. It takes 3 zooms to match the scale of the pre-&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4\"&gt;1.4&lt;/a&gt; maps; the fourth zoom reaches the maximum scale of one &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; per pixel. \nColored banners can be used to mark locations on maps (\"Java Edition\" only). In Bedrock Edition, locations can be marked using large structures of colored wool or some other standout material. (You could also simply keep track of the coordinates of different locations on the map.)\nAdditionally, making a map room of the surrounding area gives you insight of the area around their base and shows points of interest, not to mention looking nice.\nUnderground Navigation.\nBoth natural &lt;a href=\"cavern\"&gt;cavern&lt;/a&gt;s and artificial mines can be fairly disorienting without some kind of navigation or trail marking system. Here are some tips to avoid getting lost.\nTrail Markers.\nThere are a variety of markers the player can leave behind to make trails, with a somewhat different selection being useful underground.\nMarine navigation.\nHere are some helpful tips to avoid getting lost in the middle of large oceans.\nBlock Orientation.\nMany blocks are placed at a fixed orientation. Knowing this, it is possible to use the textures on the top faces of the blocks to orientate oneself without a compass. Note that actual block design may vary with &lt;a href=\"resource%20packs\"&gt;resource packs&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "43584", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=43584", "title": "Tutorials/Nether hub", "text": "Often, players in the Overworld have good reason to travel thousands of blocks from one place to another, costing both time and resources. In these situations, the can be used to significantly reduce the length of a journey. This is due to the fact that coordinates in the Overworld are 8x the value of the coordinates in the Nether, meaning that every one block traveled in the Nether translates to eight blocks traveled in the Overworld.\nIntroduction.\nWhen players build important structures in other &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, they often travel to these structures via , , , riding a horse, or by walking; however, a much quicker alternative is to use a .\nOnce you've made two nether portals in the Nether connecting to two different places in the Overworld, you can make a minecart railway or a boat-way made of or to get from one to another for even quicker travel.\nMaterials.\nAssuming you already have access to the Nether, you will need the following materials for a single linked portal:\nYou will also need to know how the works.\nSteps.\nEasiest and cheapest method.\nThe most straightforward way to connect two Overworld locations for faster travel via the Nether is as follows:\n1. Find the coordinates of the portal you want to use, then divide the X and Z values by 8. Note these divided values, along with the unchanged Y value.\n2. Enter the Nether via a (relatively) far-away portal, bringing materials to build and light a new Nether Portal.\n3. Head to the divided coordinates in the Nether. Try to place yourself at about the same Y coordinate (elevation), then make a second portal. You should come out at about the location you wanted to go.\n4. (optional) Move your exit portal to the location corresponding to your Nether portal. (Multiply the X and Z coordinates by 8.) This makes it less likely that new linked portals will attempt to link to this existing portal.\nYou can also let a website like https://gamertools.net/tools/3 calculate the nether/overworld coordinates for you.\nExample.\nFor example, say that your spawn is at X = 92, Y = 66, and Z = 45. You have found a village at coordinates X = 1054, Y = 78, and Z = -786 and wish to connect the two. Divide the X and Z of the village coordinates by 8, to get roughly X = 132 and Z = -98. Then, make a Nether portal at spawn, go through and travel to X = 132 and Z = -98 in the Nether, and up to Y=78. Make your Nether portal here, and when you go through into the Overworld, you should come out at or near the village.\nMore precise method.\nThe above method does not let you choose exactly where your second portal appears in the Overworld, and is more likely to link to an existing portal that is already nearby your target destination. This method allows you to do so, but is more expensive and time-consuming as it requires you to build an extra portal at your desired exit coordinates.\nComparing coordinates.\nCompare the following 2 pictures. The first one shows coordinates in the Overworld at a Nether portal. The second one shows the corresponding coordinates in the Nether. You will notice that the Overworld X and Z coordinates are about 8 times the coordinates in the Nether, although sometimes they may be slightly off.\nMultiple Portals.\nIf you have multiple locations in the overworld that you want to be easily accessible, then just travel to the location in the nether, build a portal, and travel through it. You should come out about where you wanted to go. If you have an exact spot you want the overworld portal to go that is close to where the portal generated, you can just remove the overworld portal and build a new one in your desired location. If you are running low on obsidian, you may want to consider taking the corners off of the generated portal. It may not look as nice, but it will give you four extra blocks of obsidian. To improve the look of the portal, place cheaper blocks such as wood blocks or chiseled stone bricks.\nSafe Travels.\nIf you travel through the nether frequently, mobs such as ghasts and piglins can be a nuisance, as well as the possibility of getting lost at any wrong turn. It may be worth it to install some sort of protection against these hazards. There are many different ways to do this, so you will want to find the one that best suits your needs.\nTunnel system.\nThis will require a lot of time and blocks, but possibly one of the best protection against mobs and getting lost. Since you may come across mobs while doing this, it is recommended that you put all of your stuff in a chest except for a stone or iron pickaxe, a lot of ghast resistant blocks such as cobblestone, and a bunch of torches. That way, if you die, you don't lose anything valuable. The exact amount that you bring will be up to how confident you are that you will not die. If you are a beginner, only bring a couple stacks of blocks and torches, but if you are more advanced, you may want to fill up your inventory. You can always return to your base in the Overworld to get more supplies.\nTo start, get the coordinates of all your portals in the nether and write them down. Pick two portals to do first. Start at one of them, and create a two block wide path along either the x (or z, it doesn't really matter) coordinate until you reach the z (or x if you started with z) coordinate of the second portal. Then turn towards that portal and continue until you get there. Note that if the portals are on different y levels, you may have to use stairs to make the path line up with the portal frame. You should now have a path between the portals. \nTo connect a third portal, you will need to get as close to it as possible without leaving the path you already created. You should share either the x or z coordinate with the portal. Then you can go ahead and create a path to the third portal. Repeat for any other portals you may have, and then go to the next step.\nNow you will want to cover up the paths so you do not fall off or get hit by ghasts while travelling. You will most likely want to have tunnels that are 2 blocks high so that you can sprint-jump through them, so build two block high walls on both sides of the path. \nNow take the torches and light up the path. It is ideal to start at your main base and place torches on the right wall so that you can always find your way back if you get lost. If you see any piglins on your path, ignore them, and they will eventually despawn.\nFinally, build a roof on your tunnels. If you make it two blocks high, you will be able to go a lot faster by sprint-jumping, but this will use a lot of hunger, so it is best to walk if you're low on food. Once you have done this, your tunnel system is complete! \nYou can still improve your tunnel in a variety of ways. Try some of these and see which ones you would like to have.\nNether roof.\nProbably the safest method of fast travel in the nether is also one of the easiest. This uses a bug to the advantage of the player, and only works .\nFirst, you will need to get to the nether roof. There are various different ways of doing this, many of which are listed at &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Breaking_bedrock\"&gt;Tutorials/Breaking bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. Go ahead and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Breaking_bedrock\"&gt;break a hole&lt;/a&gt; to the nether and put ladders in it with an iron trapdoor on top with a button. Once you have done this, mark the coordinates of the trapdoor so you will always be able to get back there. Now go to an existing portal in the real nether and break it. You may want to relight it later, but for now it will just get in the way. While you are there, mark the x and z coordinates because you will now need to build a portal in that same spot on the nether roof. Use your trapdoor to get back on the roof and travel to the coordinates you just marked. Create a portal there, light it, and step through. You should end up in the overworld at the portal that corresponds to the one you just broke. If you step through again, you should find yourself back on the nether roof. If you don't want mobs spawning on top of the portals, (you probably don't) put slabs or carpet on top to prevent mob spawning. At this point, you have done the minimum and your portal is successfully linked. Repeat for any other portals you have before moving on.\nTo access the real nether without having to find a trapdoor on the roof \nevery time, you will need to relight the portal you broke in the first step. Travel through it to get to the overworld. Dig down below the existing overworld portal, or make a platform above it and light a new portal. Now the upper portal should link to the Nether roof and the lower one should take you to the actual nether. Repeat as necessary.\nIt can be easy to get lost in the infinite bedrock on top of the nether, especially if your portals are far apart. To conquer this, use non-spawnable blocks like slabs, torches, signs, or carpet to mark the way. Using solid blocks may result in mobs spawning, defeating the purpose of having the nether roof.\nMap.\nIf there are a lot of portals that you want to link up, you can take advantage of the fact that the nether is a 1:8 scale and create a large map of your overworld in the nether that is also at this scale. It requires a lot of time, pickaxes, and blocks, but it is hard to get lost.\nTo begin, you will need to find the length and width of your map. Get the coordinates of each portal and write them down. Get a piece of graph paper and make rough diagram of where each portal is. Find the area of the entire map for the nether. This is about half the number of blocks you will need.\nYou will need a flat area in the nether that matches up to the overworld portals. It should be 4 blocks tall so that you will be able to sprint jump along after the final product is finished. \nNow you will be making the map. You will want blocks such as green and blue wool/concrete/concrete powder for the land and water, then possibly sand or even gravel for deserts and gravelly mountains. Note that if you are using concrete, you will have to harden it in the overworld before you place it (just a friendly reminder so you don't have your day ruined by realizing that your brilliant plan is not so brilliant.) Hold a map of the area you are working on in your off-hand so you can reference it easily. Remember that each block you place in the nether represents an 8x8 area in the overworld.\nAfter your map is finalized, go ahead and move your portals to the desired locations. You will have to dig up into the ceiling to get the portal to fit. To prevent mob spawning, put glass all over your map. You can still see your map, but mobs will not spawn on glass. The portals should be level with the glass so you can just walk right in. If there is any area where mobs are likely to walk into your map, block it off and use an iron door if you will need to enter/exit. Light up the area around the overworld portals too so mobs do not enter through the portals.\nThere you go! After many hours of hard work, you have yourself one of the coolest nether hubs ever!"}

This page lists some of the implications of these portal mechanics.\nFirst, portals are risky.\nPortals try to avoid spawning over lava, in midair, or inside rock, but they do so by spawning \"nearby\". Thus, a new portal from the Overworld has a disproportionate chance of being \"next\" to an abyss, lava lake, or netherrack wall. There is also no way to check whether a lava source (created with the landscape) is destined to send lava flowing over the portal. Furthermore, a portal can spawn on a one-block thick ledge or floor, or on a Soul Sand outcrop.\nPortals can accumulate Overworld mobs.\nPortals built in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; should be secured in order to prevent wandering &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s from entering the portal. These creatures can accumulate over time in the Nether; not only is there no sunlight to burn undead, but without a player present, time barely passes for them (15 seconds for each new entry) so they may not have time to despawn. Mobs such as &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s are especially bad to handle in the Nether due to the soft nature of &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; and the abundance of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; to fall into.\nMaking a portal.\nFarming obsidian.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Obsidian%20farming%23Portal%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Obsidian farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreating a portal without getting obsidian.\nNether portals can be built without the use of a diamond or netherite pickaxe to mine obsidian by placing lava in a mold of other blocks, and then pouring water over it to turn it into obsidian.\nA quick, simple method using a lava pool, water bucket, and some blocks.\nYou need at least 6 blocks, a water bucket, a lava pool, and a flint and steel or other lighting method. A block breaking tool is recommended.\nHow portals work.\nPortals try to link up at their equivalent location calculated by Overworld (X,Y,Z) &lt;=&gt; Nether (X/8, Y, Z/8). But as they say, the devil is in the details:\nPairing portals.\nTo set up pairs of Nether portals properly so that they reliably travel to each other, it is best to build both portals manually. Build at desired location X,Y,Z in the Overworld. Then travel to the Nether. And then dig your way to X/8, Y, Z/8, and build a portal there. \nAs block coordinates are centered on the lower northwest corner of blocks, higher precision can be achieved by placing a portal in the nether where block coordinates are the least precise relative to the overworld, recording the block coordinates, and adding 0.5 to each value before multiplying it by 8 to find the ideal overworld coordinates. This can allow portals as close as 8 blocks to behave reliably in the overworld, and can make adjacent portal blocks in the nether reliably teleport to different overworld portals as well. Even greater precision can be achieved when considering that teleportation from the nether to the overworld uses the player's coordinates without rounding -- thereby making it possible to have reliable, if difficult to use, portals as close as 1 block. Precisely linked portals can also be stacked vertically without interfering with one another. \nA less precise method would be to temporarily deactivate all portals within a 128 block \"radius\" from within the Nether. Through death or with the aid of a second player, entering a new portal from the Overworld forces the creation of a new portal within the Nether which the Overworld portal should prefer. This is not recommended as it limits how close Overworld portals can be placed due to the zone of exclusions and can lead to unpredictable placement of the resulting portal.\nThe Y coordinate is not divided for pairings, however it does play a factor in mapping the portals. Therefore, two Overworld portals could be built at the same x,z coordinates with one at a very low Y, e.g., 5, and one at a higher y, e.g. 160. A Nether portal at these X and Z coordinates links to whichever portal is closest on the Y axis.\nIf this all sounds complicated to you, this website can help you in the process: https://gamertools.net/minecraft/nether/.\nZones of exclusion.\nThe Nether portal spawning algorithm can only spawn a portal within a 33\u00d733 block column centered on the destination, but it does scan that width (and the height of the world) for open space to place the portal. This often causes it to spawn a portal at a location significantly different than the corresponding location in the other world. The larger the distance between a portal and its \"ideal\" destination, the larger the zone of exclusion. This zone is the area in each world where you cannot build another portal without breaking the link between the first two portals. One way to think of this zone is as spheres around each portal, each of a true radius equal to its distance to the equivalent location of the other. For example, if the Overworld portal was at (0,50,0) and the Nether portal at (0,100,0), then the portals are 50 meters away from each other. In this (simple) case, if a Nether portal was built closer than 50 meters to (0,50,0), then the Overworld portal links to it. \nBecause of the coordinate change, portals created in the Nether are much more likely to have ideal coordinates that are horizontally distant from the Overworld portal that created them. When going the other way, horizontal coordinates tend to be closer to ideal (because whatever space is found has a Nether-equivalent location closer to the original portal), but vertical displacement can still be an issue. \nIf you wish to ensure that two portals link together, manually build portals as close as possible in all 3 coordinate axes. It doesn't have to be exact, or even all that close, if the player ensures that no other portals is constructed in the exclusion zone created by the difference.\n2-in-1 Nether portals.\nIt is possible to end up in a situation where a Nether portal \"randomly\" places the player in 1 of 2 possible Overworld destination portals. This is simply because the Nether portal has two effective coordinates as it is 2 blocks wide, say (X, Y, Z) on the left, and (X+1, Y, Z) on the right. If the player entered on the left side, (X, Y, Z) translates to (X*8, Y, Z*8) in the overworld and the game picks the portal closest to that. If the player entered on the right side, (X+1, Y, Z) translates to (X*8+8, Y, Z*8) and the game picks a portal closest to that point instead. This situation occurs when the Nether portal's location is roughly equidistant between the 2 Overworld portals (within 8 blocks overworld distance difference). However, building 2 Nether portals side by side is probably better for destination clarity than building a 2-in-1 portal. It is possible to span distances with pairs of portals in this way, though normally faster to simply walk through the Nether.\nSpawning a portal in the air or buried..\nIt is possible for a destination portal (either in the Nether or in the Overworld) to spawn floating in the air, or buried in netherrack or stone. If your portal spawns in the air, it generates a 1\u00d72\u00d71 obsidian platform in the front and back of the portal. If it spawns in rock, a 3-high airspace is cleared out for one block on each side of the portal. This can only occur if there there are no existing portals within range to link to, \"and\" there is no suitable spot to place a new portal within 16 blocks horizontally (at any height) of the target coordinates. This usually means that floating portals spawn over the ocean (in the Overworld) or lava ocean (in the Nether), and buried portals are much more likely in the Nether.\nUsing portals.\nPortals can be built-in networks.\nYou should build portals at 64 Nether block intervals, even if you are not normally going to use these gates. (This is the maximum ideal distance, but they can be built as close to 8 Overworld blocks apart, if the coordinates are precise.) This is so that if you use Nether portals for long-distance travel, and your usual Overworld destination portal becomes inaccessible for some reason, (due to large gravel cave-ins, lava, water, or you have an automated activation system and forgot to turn it on) you still have a reasonably close backup gate, which returns you into your gate network.\n1-way long distance teleport.\nThe portal choosing algorithm can be used for long-distance travel by manual construction at carefully selected coordinates. If the player has a portal in the Overworld at (0,64,0) but makes a Nether portal at (127,64,127) with its perfect Overworld pair at (1016, 64, 1016), then the portal at (0,64,0) goes to the Nether portal correctly (1-way trip) because it is the only portal available within the 128 search distance along X and Z horizontal axes of the expected Nether portal position of (0,64,0). In about 15 seconds, the player can then travel 1436 meters in the Overworld. This specific form of fast travel by portal is one-way, since the Nether portal cannot find this Overworld portal. Given that a railway in the nether would need to span only 180 meters to go this distance, it is usually not worth making such portal links. However, it is theoretically possible to make a one-way ring of portals, with each Overworld to Nether jump going a long distance, but such a ring would easily be disrupted due to the huge exclusion zones created.\nNon-exploit water ladder replacement.\nThe Nether portal is an also entirely viable, two-way replacement for the water or conventional ladder. Note that if you want to travel a vertical distance of h from a point (X, Y, Z) in the Overworld to (X/8, Y+h, Z/8) in the Nether, there must be no other Overworld portal at any point (x, y, z) within a distance of 8*h from (X, Y, Z) (i.e. within the spheroid ((x-X)/8)\u00b2 + ((y-Y)/1)\u00b2 + ((z-Z)/8)\u00b2 = h\u00b2, note that Y is not divided by 8). That is, if you want to travel large vertical distances, there must be no horizontally close portal. (This holds for a portal from the Overworld to the Nether. The reverse direction (Nether to Overworld) was not discussed here.)"}

This tutorial also explains how to beat the game by starting in the Nether with nothing. \nIntroduction.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; is a dangerous place for even experienced players. It is filled with a host of exclusive mobs not found in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;: hostile &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, and the neutral &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one passive mob, the &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe terrain is much harsher to navigate than in the Overworld: one false step could mean death by fiery lava. &lt;a href=\"Nether%20fortress\"&gt;Nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s both spawn in the Nether. Nether fortresses are the homes of &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;blazes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, piglins, and hoglins all spawn in bastion remnants.\nThis guide is intended to help you increase your chances of survival in the Nether and opening up a lot of gameplay such as &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20hub\"&gt;nether hubs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; bosses.\nMaking a nether portal.\nTo make a nether portal, the player needs to make a rectangular frame of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, though the corners do \"not\" have to be obsidian. \nUsing lava and water.\nA player can cast part or all of frame in place, by placing lava source blocks and using water to convert them to obsidian. \nOn-the-fly method.\nIt is also possible to place blocks to the side and \"hang\" water off them to make most of the frame. This video illustrates the typical \"speedrun\" technique.\nPreparation.\nBeing well-equipped is essential for survival in the Nether. Lacking even a seemingly useless item in an unfortunate situation can put you in serious danger. However, be sure not to bring any items that have little or no use for your objective, leaving room to carry the loot you came to the Nether to find in the first place, as well as reduce the number of items lost if you die.\nCarrying backup items to handle specific emergencies can take up more inventory space than carrying the minimum supplies to craft what you need as the situation arises, provided you take into account that you need to be in a safe place for the time it takes to place, or craft, a crafting table, then go through one or more steps of crafting to get what you need. For example, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; is common in all Nether biomes except &lt;a href=\"basalt%20delta\"&gt;basalt delta&lt;/a&gt;s, so &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; can be crafted if that becomes necessary, provided you are carrying iron. It is unwise to bank on finding iron, as the only ways to find it are as rare loot in generated chests or by bartering. The same supply of iron serves in lieu of carrying replacement pickaxes, buckets, or weapons, but could take too long to craft into a bucket to scoop up unexpected lava. &lt;a href=\"Huge%20fungus\"&gt;Huge fungus&lt;/a&gt; stems can provide logs, and thus make sticks, a crafting table, and so on, but they are not as versatile as logs from trees and could take a while to find if you're in the wrong biome. Similarly, you could rely on finding &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt; rather than carrying &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, but it isn't quite as versatile and isn't as easily found as gravel. Always carry logs, cobblestone, and iron, and possibly potions of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance.&lt;/a&gt; If you have a lot of iron to spare, you may want to carry it as iron blocks, and bring pumpkins or &lt;a href=\"jack-o-lantern\"&gt;jack-o-lantern&lt;/a&gt;s to build an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; if you get mobbed.\nTools and weapons.\nOne of the most important tools in the Nether, especially in a structure, is your weapon. A melee weapon of iron or better is almost essential. A &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, along with at least 64 &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s (or one if you have &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; on your bow), is enough to dispose of any enemy. &lt;a href=\"Glowstone\"&gt;Glowstone&lt;/a&gt; is common in the Nether and allows a dwindling supply of arrows to be extended by turning them into twice as many &lt;a href=\"spectral%20arrow\"&gt;spectral arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, which are beneficial in their own right. While melee weapons work well in close quarters combat, consider bringing a crossbow or a bow in addition to your melee weapon, as &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s and blazes can be troublesome without them. \nAn iron &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; or two (or a single diamond pickaxe) can be useful, as you can use it to clear a path, or to gather some blocks if you run out. It can also be used to carve a staircase into the side of a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to it.\nAlways bring along a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; because even if you don't intend to build a new nether portal, a &lt;a href=\"ghast%20fireball\"&gt;ghast fireball&lt;/a&gt; can easily break a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;portal block&lt;/a&gt; inside the portal frame, leaving you stranded until it is relit with fire from a flint and steel, a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%23Spread\"&gt;burning blocks&lt;/a&gt; adjacent to the portal frame, or even another ghast fireball. If you forgot to bring a flint and steel, all hope is not lost -- you can bargain with Piglins for iron (or find one in a chest), or you can make a fire charge from Nether materials (Wither Skeleton for coal, a Ghast for gunpowder, and kill a blaze for blaze powder). \nEnsure your tools have enough &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; to last long enough for you to achieve your goal.\nArmor.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; is also important. Even if you are not planning on doing much fighting, armor reduces the amount of damage you take from being submerged in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, making it a potential life-saver should you accidentally fall in lava. A full set of iron armor should be enough to boost your chance of survival. Consider bringing diamond armor only if you are confident in your ability to survive (or if you're playing on Hardcore Mode), or else you may die and lose it. &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;s can be useful for fighting the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s present in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt;s. Wear at least one piece of golden armor to stop &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s attacking you, as this earns you their respect.\nTransport.\n&lt;a href=\"Strider\"&gt;Strider&lt;/a&gt;s can be the best means of travel in many situations. If you have a fishing rod and saddle, you need only locate some &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus\"&gt;warped fungus&lt;/a&gt; and head down to a lava lake to lure a strider. &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20rod\"&gt;Fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s are not found in the Nether, and &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; to make one appears only in some bastion remnant chests or as a drop from killed striders, so it's better to carry some rather than pulling off a dangerous heist or raid, hoping for lucky finds. You have better odds of coming across a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt; in a nether fortress or bastion remnant chest, but if your plan is to use a strider to find one of these structures, you need to have brought your own ahead of time. Killing striders in desperation as a source of dropped string could work, but it isn't the most practical or reliable means to do so.\nIf you don't have a saddle but by chance see a &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; riding a strider, you can draw it close, and ideally onto land, by wounding the rider with an arrow (or even a thrown egg or snowball), then kill it and take the pre-saddled strider for yourself. They might even drop their &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Fungus%20on%20a%20Stick\"&gt;warped fungus on a stick&lt;/a&gt; for you, but the odds of that are not high. Building some walls around yourself before trying this is probably necessary, since the zombified piglins in your area are likely to turn hostile when you attack the strider jockey.\nCarrying a few &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s can be helpful. Boats can help you slide off high cliffs without taking fall damage, and capture angry piglins, zombified piglins or endermen rushing toward you. Remember that boats cannot be crafted from Nether wood types, so you have to bring logs from the Overworld if you want to craft more boats.\nIt can be helpful to carry some &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;s if you have a lot). When applied to &lt;a href=\"weeping%20vines\"&gt;weeping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"twisting%20vines\"&gt;twisting vines&lt;/a&gt;, these vines can grow downward and upward rapidly with a few clicks. Then the player can climb the vines as a reliable, reusable method of vertical transport.\nEnchantments.\nEnchantments offer huge advantages for surviving in the Nether, if you have access to a means of obtaining them. For your weaponry, you should consider damage-boosting enchantments on your weapons (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Power\"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt;). Be aware that all mobs in the Nether (except for regular &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;) are immune to fire damage, so enchantments like &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; should not be a priority. &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely a great bow enchantment, as it saves you inventory space carrying arrows, as well as the constant worry of running out of them. \nFor armor, a combination of both &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; are helpful. Most water-related enchantments such as &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Affinity\"&gt;Aqua Affinity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; offer no use in the Nether at all; however, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt; allows you to walk normally across magma blocks without taking damage, which can sometimes make traveling in the Nether easier. Enchanting your boots with &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; can save your life by allowing you to drop down onto low terrain more safely. You may also enchant your boots with &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; to traverse &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt;s at higher speeds, since walking on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; slows you down if you lack that enchantment; but keep in mind that moving too quickly means an easier time walking off ledges (and worse, into lava).\nEnchanting your &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; II allows you to &lt;a href=\"instant%20mining\"&gt;instantly break&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, however mining netherrack too quickly can expose &lt;a href=\"Spring%23Hidden%20lava\"&gt;hidden lava&lt;/a&gt; that rapidly flows out and engulfs you, so if you do not have fast reflexes, it is recommended that you use unenchanted pickaxes instead. Other pickaxe enchantments useful in the Nether are &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. Unbreaking can save you bringing multiple &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s (but again, you can choose to devote on quantity instead of quality, and just craft new pickaxes when you need them). Silk Touch ensures that &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt; drops the ore itself, guaranteeing you one gold ingot per ore block (instead of 4 nuggets on average with unenchanted pickaxe), as well as obtaining &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt;, useful for farming Nether wood and foliage.\nBlocks.\nIn general, blocks are handy to bring along with you in the Nether. They can allow you to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar jump&lt;/a&gt; to reach high places, block off mobs from reaching you, and allow you to bridge across to different masses of land over the lava oceans. Two or three stacks of cheap, non-flammable blocks (e.g. cobblestone) should be enough for a normal trip in the Nether. Blocks that are affected by gravity (e.g. &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;) can be useful to get down from a high place; for example, from the top of a nether fortress bridge. The Nether's terrain is tough to navigate, so bringing these blocks can prove highly useful. A pickaxe can be useful in the event you run out of blocks, as it can be used to mine some of the abundant netherrack.\nBringing 10-14 obsidian is a good idea too, in the event you get lost and lose your portal home. Bear in mind that you also need your flint and steel to light this emergency portal.\nGeneral supplies.\nFood is as important in the Nether as it is anywhere else in the game. If you run out of food, you lose your ability to sprint, and, more importantly, regenerate health. Running out of it can be fatal. Think about how long you are planning to be in the Nether, and how much fighting you might do, and bring an appropriate amount of food for it. Keep in mind that different foods provide different amounts of &lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Mechanics\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;, which is the most important thing for healing. The more saturation a food has, the more health you regenerate from eating it. &lt;a href=\"Steak\"&gt;Steak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Porkchop\"&gt;porkchops&lt;/a&gt; are among the best foods for early gameplay, with &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cooked%20mutton\"&gt;mutton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cooked%20salmon\"&gt;cooked salmon&lt;/a&gt; being acceptable alternatives.\n&lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20stew\"&gt;Mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt; is also a good option, which can be crafted from mushrooms and \"wood\" found in the Nether. Bringing a few suitable flowers from the Overworld allows you to upgrade that to &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt; Using &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;oxeye daisies&lt;/a&gt; provides 7 seconds of &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, which can save your life if you are low on health with enemies nearby, or if you have been afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt; from a fight with a wither skeleton. Suspicious stew crafted from &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;blue orchid&lt;/a&gt;s provides much more saturation than regular foods, which can also be used to heal a lot of health in a short amount of time. However, it is worth noting that stew cannot be stacked, and even the ingredients take up three (mushroom stew) or four (with a flower) inventory slots. Consider bringing around half a stack of \"regular\" food, in addition to the aforementioned ingredients that can be crafted into suspicious stew as you need. Use the regular food for maintaining your hunger, and the stew as a method of quickly regenerating health in dangerous situations.\nFood sources in the Nether are rare but do exist, such as &lt;a href=\"porkchop\"&gt;porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s dropped by hoglins, and red and brown &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s that can be found scattered throughout the Nether. However these food sources are usually hard to find consistently, so don't expect to be able to keep yourself fed without bringing food from the Overworld.\nIf you have already explored the Nether and gotten some blaze rods, and can thus brew potions, you should do so. Fire Resistance potions are extra valuable in the Nether, as falling into lava is always a possibility. Splash potions of Healing can also save your life if you find yourself low on health in combat, like the suspicious stew (mentioned above). If you planned ahead and brought one or more water buckets, enough iron to make a cauldron (you can put water in a cauldron to put yourself out (&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; only), some bottles, and some cobblestone or blackstone (to craft brewing stands), before searching out a nether fortress, you can find everything else you need there to begin brewing potions, putting you in a much stronger position. A few stacks of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es can provide a means of leaving a trail, allowing you to find your portal again if you lose it. (Although, in this case, the use of &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt; is often a more practical solution.) Remember that &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;es do not work in the Nether, so do not bring one intending to use it to find your way home unless it has been aligned to a &lt;a href=\"lodestone\"&gt;lodestone&lt;/a&gt;. Torches are also useful for marking the parts of a nether fortress you have already visited, so less time is wasted exploring areas of the nether fortress you have already exhausted.\nA small handful of empty &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s can be useful for removing lava in awkward places. They can also save your life if you run into one of the many &lt;a href=\"Spring%23Hidden%20lava\"&gt;single blocks of lava&lt;/a&gt; while digging through the netherrack.\n&lt;a href=\"Ender%20pearl\"&gt;Ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s can be extremely useful if you fall into lava. They are also useful for crossing lava pits, or reaching otherwise hard-to-access areas. However, you should consider that ender pearls are relatively hard to get, and you may want to save them for activating the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; later (if you have not already done so). There are two easy ways to obtain ender pearls in the Nether: killing endermen that spawn abundantly in &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Forest\"&gt;warped forests&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; with piglins, which can give you almost a stack of ender pearls.\n&lt;a href=\"Gold%20ingot\"&gt;Gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s can be useful for bartering with piglins (as well as distracting them if they are angry with you) if you visit the &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt;. You can get useful items like fire resistance potions, ender pearls, obsidian, and crying obsidian. If you have more than a stack of gold ingots, you can store them as &lt;a href=\"gold%20blocks\"&gt;gold blocks&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful not to drop gold blocks, as piglins pick them up and without giving you anything in return.\n&lt;a href=\"Netherrack\"&gt;Netherrack&lt;/a&gt; can be acquired in the Overworld from &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s. This can be smelted, and the resulting nether bricks crafted into nether brick fence. Three stacks of netherrack yield exactly a full stack of fences. Since nether brick fences are blast resistant and can also be seen through, they make a good option for windows and/or perimeters when building your first shelter around your portal. A quick way to do this recipe is as follows:\nEntering the Nether.\nWhile the Nether's scenery is captivating, remember the Nether is a dangerous place. For the player's first visit, the main threats are falling, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, getting lost, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s. The first two can be handled in the usual ways, but the most urgent threats are most likely &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s and then &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s on account of the fact that the other hazards don't move or shoot at the player, excluding piglins (although they do not attack a player wearing at least one piece of golden armor who is not attacking or opening containers.) That said, don't be careless; sudden drops and holes can be hard to spot in the confusing netherrack landscape. Fire in the Nether is more dangerous than in other dimensions, as water cannot exist or be placed there. Magma cubes are also a threat considering their natural armor and the fact that they multiply like slimes, although the little ones still deal damage.\nWhen you first arrive at the Nether, stay in the portal until the chunks around you load so that you can see what the immediate surrounding area looks like. Often, a nether portal generates right next to a giant lake of lava or a high drop-off. If this is the case, then walking out of the nether portal upon arrival likely results in death.\nLag.\nWith a slower computer, the player may encounter a massive lag spike upon entering the Nether. The workaround involves doing the following: after the player steps out of the portal, turn on the &lt;a href=\"Debug%20screen\"&gt;debug info&lt;/a&gt;, then to pause the game. Note the \"Chunks Updated\" line\u2014even while paused, the game is continuing to load chunks and update them. It is wise to also note down the coordinates of the portal. The player can then wait for the chunk updates drop to zero, meaning the game has finished loading the region around them. Then the player can resume play. This trick is also useful when the player changes their render distance.\nProtecting the portal.\nEven though hunting, exploring, and mining may sound fun, it is unwise to start doing this as soon as the player steps into the Nether for the first time. The player's first order of business is to build a cobblestone shelter around the portal. &lt;a href=\"Brick\"&gt;Brick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, and other blast-resistant blocks also work, but &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; is cheapest in the Overworld. As noted above, nether brick fences can be crafted even before entering the Nether at all (by mining ruined portals for netherrack), and these are both transparent and blast-resistant.\nTake the quickest possible look around, just enough to see what kind of ground the player is building on, then start building as fast as is practical. Unfortunately, a first portal has a disproportionate chance of coming out next to an abyss, lava lake, or netherrack wall, and even if it spawns in the open, there may be multiple ghasts in view.\nYour shelter needs to be at least 5 blocks high, but the portal itself can be part of the roof. While it's tempting to do the same with a wall, it's probably safer to be able to walk around the portal on both sides. Use &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt; for windows. Make sure to leave enough space for a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; or two. The chests are important if the player does not want to lose too many of your items whenever you happen to die. Don't forget the door, either - wood suffices until you figure out where an outside button or lever could be placed where it is safe from fireballs. Note that if the player is building against a netherrack wall, you need a cobblestone back wall in front of that. If you want to dig there later, you can always put a door in. Once the player got the walls and ceiling up, likewise cover or replace the floor with cobblestone, extending it to under the walls. The walls should extend a block below floor level, and a little further under the doors. The shelter also needs a few blocks of cobblestone floor outside the doors, in case a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; shoots the player while they're entering or leaving. You should end up with a space completely enclosed by cobblestone, iron, and perhaps a bit of obsidian.\nMake sure you know which biome you're in:\nLater on, you can start to make nice houses and bigger bases in the Nether, but for now, a cobble shelter with the portal, a chest, and a crafting table is sufficient. The only necessities are iron armor, a pickaxe, sword, and shovel (all iron), food, bow and arrows, cobblestone for making quick shelters, dirt or gravel for pillar-jumping or stopping lava, and your trusty flint and steel. The rest of the items or extra supplies can be stored in the chests. If the player is going any distance, bring enough obsidian to make an emergency portal.)\nTo prevent mobs from spawning in the player's Nether home/base, one can use transparent items or half-blocks as the floor. However, be warned that mobs can spawn on the nether portal itself. Now that your nether portal is safe, the player can start doing what they came to the Nether for!\nIf the portal gets blasted.\nThe player's first resource should be their &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;. If for some reason the player does not have one, relighting the &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; portal frame becomes much more difficult. If the portal was exposed enough to get hit by a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;ghast fireball&lt;/a&gt;, the player could persuade a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; to hit it with another &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt; by getting into the line-of-sight long enough to shoot the &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;. If the player dodges the &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt; quickly enough and it hits the &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; of the portal, the portal gets re-lit.\nAnother possible method is to take any flammable block and place it on one side of the block. By getting &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; close to the flammable blocks, the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; can eventually light the wood, thus lighting the portal frame. Having the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; right on the opposite side of the frame of the flammable block is the fastest method. Also, the higher the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, the faster the blocks catch on fire, so this method is more difficult in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Easy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulties. If the player also lacks a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;, one can channel &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; past the portal, or even build a trail of flammable blocks (planks are cheap, but wooden &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s are cheaper) to the nearest fire. That last method is especially tricky, as &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; doesn't always catch. If this happens, try making it wider than one block.\nA new set of &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; can be acquired. Looking in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s, there is a chance of finding a flint and steel in a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; occurs naturally in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, so a player can collect &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; from there. Iron nuggets can be bartered from piglins, even or made from smelting down armor or tools. This process requires having a furnace and fuel source (such as a bucket of lava). Iron nuggets can also be obtained from bartering with piglins.\nAnother option is to create a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;. This is trickier as it requires &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt;, so the player may have to kill a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; to collect all three of these items. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20charge\"&gt;Fire charge&lt;/a&gt;s work just like &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, except each use uses up one item. Fire charge may also be found in ruined portal chest. Fire charges can also be obtained from bartering with piglins.\nAs a last resort, if the player has (or can make) a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; or two (they appear in nether fortresses, so you might be able to locate one), the player can stuff all their equipment into the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s (not forgetting &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;), and then commit suicide. However, you lose your XP levels if you do this. Assuming the player is not playing on &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt; and has not used a respawn anchor, they &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Overworld\"&gt;the Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, and can re-equip themselves at leisure (this time, not forgetting the &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;) before going back through the portal to collect their items. Note that this is more difficult on a &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; server because another &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can come by and steal your items. If you have previously brought blaze rods back to the Overworld, you might even be able to use an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;, which can let you stash your stuff and pick it up back home from another such chest.\nAdditionally the player if holding a diamond pickaxe can break a block of the portal replacing it after and relighting the portal.\nFending off ghasts.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt;s are one of the hardest and most annoying mobs to fight in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\", mainly because of their floating ability and their long-ranged fireball, which does considerable damage to both players and the landscape. If you are bridge-building across a lava sea, they might shoot you off. (One direct hit can kill an unarmored player.) That said, they do have several weaknesses: \nFighting hoglins.\nHoglins have high health and a lot of knockback resistance. However they can be burned, and they fear warped fungi. Some ways to get away from them are:\nIf there is nothing around to scare off a hoglin and your armor is low, you are best using ranged weapons or fire to kill hoglins. \nResources found in the Nether.\nOnce the player finds a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, they can obtain several other resources:\nOnce player finds a &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;, they can obtain several other resources:\nPiglins can be &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;bartered&lt;/a&gt; with for a variety of resources:\nExploring the Nether.\nWhen exploring the Nether, there are a few things to remember:\nNether fortresses.\nOne of your main objectives in the Nether is to locate a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;. To see all the features of the nether fortresses visually, try this video . Basically, their straight walkways and tall pillars are unmistakable but may be dimmed by distance. Be sure to look carefully into the abyss beyond the edges of the areas you explore; if you're not using Far &lt;a href=\"Frames%20per%20second%23Render%20Distance\"&gt;render distance&lt;/a&gt; already, you can occasionally switch to it to see farther. If you do not see any, remember that the lava seas that generate in the Nether allow the player to spot more land, and a saddled &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt; can help in this regard. Be aware that sometimes most of the fortress is engulfed in netherrack. Therefore, open your eyes and look for signs of fortress-like nether bricks, blazes, and wither skeletons.\nEven after spotting one, you may well need to find a way to get to it, or even build a bridge to it. (Suggestion: three-wide cobblestone, with two-high &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt; or nether brick fences for railings, and a roof. Those ghast get really annoying when you're out on a bridge\u2026 you might even put in a couple of turrets for sniping at them, too.)\nOnce you do find one, it is a good idea to make sure you have the necessary supplies to gather its many resources. So, head back to your base, or even back to the Overworld, and get, at a minimum, a &lt;a href=\"stone%20pickaxe\"&gt;stone pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"iron%20sword\"&gt;iron sword&lt;/a&gt; and lots and lots of food. An enchanted &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; is handy when it's time to take on a blaze spawner, but you may want to stash that nearby and go back for it when you actually find the spawner. Trading with piglins can also get you potions of fire resistance before the fight.\nLots of walls of any non-flammable material or nether brick fences are handy too: safety railings on the walkways are really nice when ghast starts taking potshots at you and blocking off unused areas and broken bridges helps cut down on fights.\nThere are a few things that are of the utmost importance when exploring a nether fortress:\nNavigation through a nether fortress.\nThe way to navigate through a nether fortress needs torches. When you finish a part of the nether fortress, put a torch at the entrance of the room to help you explore the nether fortress easily. Or you could block off the entrance with a certain block (like cobble). Wither skeletons can give you the Wither effect\u2014\u2014a health draining status effect made by both a wither projectile or wither skeletons hitting you. Blazes are extremely dangerous and can be in the hallways and rooms, so make sure you are aware of that.\nClosing a blaze spawner.\nWhile a blaze spawner can be destroyed as usual with a pickaxe, you probably shouldn't do that unless you're sure you'll never, ever, want to hunt there. Blazes can spawn up to light level 11, up to 4 blocks away from the spawner (and a block above or below it), so simply placing torches on the spawner doesn't stop them from spawning. You'll need to plaster the area with a mix of jack-o-lanterns (or glowstone, shroomlight).\nThis lighting pattern should suffice to squelch a Blaze spawner: (Top view, all on the same level.)\nAn additional light block is needed above the spawner, as shown in the 3D image. If the area around the spawner is to be cleared, another light block is needed below the spawner as well.\nFarming a blaze spawner.\nThere are many hints for fighting &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s on their page. Here are some useful ideas:\nLiving in a nether fortress.\nIf you've mastered the Nether, you can go in and start making a nether fortress more habitable. If you can have control of a nether fortress on a multiplayer server, you can control who enters the area, and also control who gets &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s (as blazes spawn only in nether fortresses). Mine down most (if not all) the netherrack covering the fortress. Make any surface where you don't want mobs with &lt;a href=\"trapdoors\"&gt;trapdoors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"slabs\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt;. With the addition of &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;, the one who controls a fortress can also control who gets nether quartz from the area.\nFirst, you should repair any bridges, as this can prevent falling deaths in the nether, though it gives mobs more access to the nether fortress. \nIn many places, lava may be leaking in, so it is advisable to close off the area.\nAlmost all forts have a single roofed, large building, which you can use as the main building, where you can store all the necessities. You should put doors on the building, to prevent destructive mobs from entering. \nDO NOT make a bed, beds explode in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; if you sleep on them, though &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;s are needed, and an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; might be useful (if one leaves the Nether in a hurry, they can get their items via another chest). Use a &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nYou should disable &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; spawners, so you can use them for mob grinding purposes later on, but also prevent blazes from overrunning the nether fortress, as they are extremely hazardous.\nSome parts of a nether fortress have been filled in with &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; and it can be a pain to dig it out. &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; is useful, though this risks damaging the fort, creating more hassle for the user. However, digging &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; can give you a good source of &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt;\u2014\u2014a good source of building material back home in the overworld. \n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20wart\"&gt;Nether wart&lt;/a&gt; plantations are in most nether fortresses, with many warts in one plantation. They usually generate behind staircases, so keep an eye out when hunting for them. For more about nether wart, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20Wart%20Farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Nether Wart Farming&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf one finds a nearby fortress that is not attached to the first one, &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; can be looted to repair the nether fortress if in survival. Large parts of the fortress itself such as the pillars for bridges are solid, and nether bricks can be looted from the inside of these pillars. \nKilling the various mobs that spawn there is tricky. Blazes, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglins\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s pose a threat, though &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s are a minor annoyance. Mobs spawn at a faster rate in a nether fortress, and trying to kill all the zombified piglins is impractical, so it is best to just leave them alone, as a large pack of zombified piglins could knock you off into a lava ocean. A few of these mobs can be prevented from spawning at all with proper light levels. Blazes spawn at light level 11 and under and wither skeletons at 7 and under, so lighting up the entire area with torches is recommended. Ghasts need a large space to spawn, 5x4x5 blocks with a solid block beneath them, so light sources should prevent all those mobs except zombified piglins from spawning. The zombified piglins are neutral, so avoid accidentally hitting them and you'll be fine.\nIf imported farming does not work, you should use the naturally growing &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s to make soup, so you have a bit to eat, though it is preferable to make better food, such as &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, with imported dirt and wheat seeds. This, however, may prove difficult, due to the inability to hydrate farmland in the Nether. &lt;a href=\"Chickens\"&gt;Chickens&lt;/a&gt; can also be brought in using &lt;a href=\"eggs\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; to provide &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt;.\nObstacles.\nLava.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; is plentiful in the Nether, in huge lakes (a sea of lava is near the bottom) rivers, and falling from the ceiling. You must be careful around lava as &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;s do not work in the Nether, and ice disappears instead of melting into water. Also, lava spreads much faster and farther in the Nether than in the Overworld (7 blocks instead of 3). Two good ways of crossing lava are to make a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; of Fire Resistance or eat an enchanted golden apple; while this effect is active, you can swim through lava without taking damage. Fire Protection on your armor can also protect you from lava: if using iron armor or better with the maximum possible protection, you take only half a heart of damage every couple seconds (with higher tier armor reducing how often you take damage), which is small enough that it can be outpaced by the natural regeneration you receive from a full hunger bar. This level can be achieved by wearing 1 armor piece with Fire Protection IV and 3 with Protection IV, or by wearing 2 armor pieces with Fire Protection IV and 1 with Protection IV. Note, however, that this rapidly damages your armor's durability. This can be mitigated with the Unbreaking and/or Mending enchantments, or completely negated by using Netherite armor, which doesn't lose any durability from fire and lava damage. It also uses up food as you'll need to keep eating in order to keep healing, so it's not as suitable as a Fire Resistance potion for crossing large bodies of lava, but it does remove the danger of dying from accidentally falling into lava without having to constantly drink potions \"just in case.\" Fire Protection also has the side benefit of reducing the amount of time it takes for you to stop burning if you catch on fire from the lava. If any lava is in the way of your builds, simply clear it out using a bucket or fill it with blocks, and then continue on.\nIf you can find and reach a lava flow's source block, you can bucket it just like in the Overworld. Unfortunately, in the Nether, much of the lava is pouring down from great heights. Normally, use cobblestone, or iron bars to contain lava or direct it away from you (if you use flimsy blocks like dirt or netherrack, a ghast fireball can undo your work in a moment!) As always, if you mine upward, then watch for dripping red particles (if you have particles turned on). The drip itself does no damage, but if you mine a dripping block, lava pours down. If you wish to get rid of lava flowing from the ceiling (in your way, or immediate hazard), you must block jump up to the source (or simply aim at the ceiling), and cover the hole with any non-flammable block (if it's flowing straight down from a flat ceiling, you may need an extra block next to the flow to place the dam). One must be extremely careful about the placement of the block, however\u2014if misplaced, the block can just spread the lava wider.\nYou can ride a &lt;a href=\"Saddle\"&gt;saddled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt; and control it with &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Fungus%20on%20a%20Stick\"&gt;warped fungus on a stick&lt;/a&gt; to cross a lava ocean. Make sure you know how to get back, though. Lava oceans are sometimes big and easy to lose direction in. If you want, you can drink a combination of Night Vision and Fire Resistance potions while exploring lava seas, because you can swim across lava to the bottom to scan the ground for ancient debris, which can rarely generate under lava seas.\nZombified piglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombified%20piglin\"&gt;Zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s are common in the nether wastes and roam in packs of 4-10, and they also spawn in crimson forests. Before &lt;a href=\"1.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt;, Zombified Piglins were instead known as zombie pigmen. They are neutral mobs, meaning that they don't attack unless you attack them. However, if you attack one Zombified Piglin in a group, the whole group (and any others in a wide range) swarms you like wolves, easily killing any unprepared player. When a Zombified Piglin is attacked, all others in a wide range (33 to 55 blocks horizontally and 10 blocks vertically) of the victim become hostile and give chase if you are within 40 blocks of them. This can be avoided if you kill the zombified piglin in one blow, but that's easier said than done. Do this by using a diamond sword enchanted with Smite IV or above and a critical hit. They can \"see\" you only in a 40-block radius \u2014 any Zombified Piglins between those distances are turned hostile, but do not move toward you (instead of wandering as normal) until you come into sight. This can be a nasty gotcha: When you defend yourself, any zombified piglin within a \"new\" 33 to 55 block range become enraged. As of version 1.8, Zombified Piglins forgive you over time if you leave them alone for 20 to 39.95 seconds, although if you are still within their 40 block pursuit radius, they continue to attack. If you really need to get gold from them, stand on a two-block high pillar in an open space and then kill them. However, Piglins and Ghasts get really annoying on the platform.\nIt is usually better to leave these creatures alone, but if you want &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s, or you want to increase your level (killing many zombified piglins gives you a lot of experience), you can safely attack the zombified piglins in various ways. Also, if you have to fight Zombified Piglins, make sure there isn't much (or even better, no) lava or fire surrounding you. You may have to move around a lot to fight all of them at once, and distractions make it worse (also, you may need to collect your stuff after getting killed).\nNote that Zombified Piglins wield and carry &lt;a href=\"golden%20sword\"&gt;golden sword&lt;/a&gt;s, which can sometimes be enchanted, but they usually drop only &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; and gold nuggets, rarely dropping &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s or their swords. Their swords can sometimes be enchanted, with the level of the enchantment varying depending on the difficulty.\nGhasts.\nAs mentioned earlier, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s shoot deadly fireballs at you when you're in their sight of 100 blocks, so stay alert for incoming fire any time you're in the open, or exposed to open space. Their noises, which sound like crying babies, can give some warning, but their fireballs travel even farther than their sounds, in fact the fireballs travel for one minute before despawning (or until the ghast is dead)., so this isn't a reliable warning. Cobblestone resists the fireballs, which is why you should bring a lot. \nHowever, ghasts can give you trouble with zombified piglins around! If you bounce back one of their fireballs, the fireball now counts as \"your\" attack, and if a zombified piglin so much as gets touched by the blast, it becomes provoked (along with all its buddies in and out of sight). \nPro tip: when the fireball is within the player's reach, aim at the Ghast and punch. As long as the fireball is in your FOV you can hit the ghast. NOTE: If surrounded by multiple ghasts, constantly hitting attack while aiming at a Ghast throws all fireballs in that direction, regardless of which direction they are coming from (they still need to be within reach). Do be careful, however, with bouncing fireballs back at Ghasts on the ground, as the explosion from the fireball can not only damage the vicinity, but provoke zombified piglins as above.\nRemember that unlike &lt;a href=\"Shulker\"&gt;shulker bullets&lt;/a&gt;, ghast fireballs do not follow the player. If you are in a difficult situation, just run to a safe place. You can always outrun the impact area.\nBlazes.\nAlthough they cannot be found in the \"general\" Nether, &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn in nether fortresses, both naturally and through spawners. For the first run, it is strongly recommended to find an &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt;. As of the new Minecraft 1.9 update, these can no longer be crafted but can be found in chests in various locations: &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. Failing that, loading your armor up with Fire Protection and Protection enchantments can help; maximum protection comes with 10 levels total of Fire Protection, with each two levels of regular Protection counting as one of Fire Protection.\nAfter that first run, your first two blaze rods (and some nether wart) let you brew potions of fire resistance; use the first one to make a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;, then craft the second into &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt;. The first piece of blaze powder fuels the brewing, the second can make &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt; if you haven't picked any up yet, but if you do have some it can be used to make Potions of Strength (with a bit of &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, your potions last even longer). At this point, you can run away and come back with potions of Fire Resistance. This makes you completely immune to their fireballs, and if you keep a block or so distance, you can avoid their melee attack.\nOnce you've gotten more comfortable with the blazes, you can build one of the &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s into a farm, by casing over the spawner area with nether brick fence, and digging a hole underneath for the blazes to slowly descend into.\nMagma Cubes.\n&lt;a href=\"Magma%20cube\"&gt;Magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s are slime-like mobs that spawn in the nether wastes and spawn abundantly in basalt deltas, generally near lava (hence the name magma cube). They look like burnt slimes with yellow eyes, and seem to have springs under them (they jump fairly high and the \"springing\" is visible). Their properties are much like slimes, as killing a large one results in it splitting into 2-4 medium-sized ones, which splits into 2-4 small ones. The large and medium Magma cubes have a chance of dropping &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt; and experience when killed. You can prevent magma cubes from spawning in your base by making the floor out of transparent blocks. As mentioned earlier, you can stand on a pillar to kill magma cubes, but any ghasts or crossbow-wielding piglins might really annoy you.\nWither Skeletons.\n&lt;a href=\"Wither%20Skeleton\"&gt;Wither skeletons&lt;/a&gt; are tall, darkened skeletons, wielding stone swords. They inflict the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;wither effect&lt;/a&gt; for 10 seconds with a hit. They walk when idle, but sprint toward a player when they see one. However, they can't pass through a two-block-high space, which makes them somewhat easy to deal with. They drop bones, coal, and occasionally their stone sword. They also have a small chance to drop a wither skeleton skull, which are essential to summoning the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither boss&lt;/a&gt;. These types of skeletons are found only in nether fortresses. They can roam in groups in fortress hallways, so be careful of blazes and being withered in this situation. Knockback is good for packs where you want them as far away as possible.\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s commonly spawn in &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wastes\"&gt;Nether Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;s, and in &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Remnant\"&gt;Bastion Remnant&lt;/a&gt;s and are armed with either &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;golden swords&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s. The adults are by default hostile, but if you have at least one piece of gold &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; on they become neutral toward you, and the babies are always passive. Throwing a golden item at them pacifies them for a moment. When killed, they have a small chance of dropping their golden sword or crossbow, any armor they naturally spawned with, and they drop any picked up items. If you &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; with them by throwing or using a gold ingot on them, they throw something back, as seen on the &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; page. You can prevent them from spawning by thoroughly lighting up the area as they spawn at light levels 11 or below. They also run from soul fire related blocks and zombified piglins. If they go into the overworld through a nether portal, they start to shake and turn into &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s shortly after.\nHoglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Hoglin\"&gt;Hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s are large pig-looking mobs, which drop &lt;a href=\"raw%20porkchop\"&gt;raw porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, and experience upon death. They spawn in &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Remnant\"&gt;Bastion Remnant&lt;/a&gt;s. They are naturally hostile with 40 health points. They run from &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus\"&gt;warped fungus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;s. They run toward players and fling the player into the air upon hitting. Unlike most hostile mobs, hoglins can be led with &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s and bred with &lt;a href=\"crimson%20fungi\"&gt;crimson fungi&lt;/a&gt;. If they go into the overworld through a nether portal, they start to shake and turn into a &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt; shortly after. Hoglins make good sources of food when you run out of them in the Nether for long periods of time or if you get lost.\nBrewing.\nMany resources in the Nether are essential for brewing &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s:\nSettlement.\nTurns out it wasn't enough for you to explore the Nether. You've decided it looks like a nice place to live (or if you're in a multiplayer world, perhaps you seek strategic control of the rapid-travel capability). So, what do you need to survive here?\nCrops.\nYou can start by importing some dirt to grow plants. You can even use a hoe to till it into &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, but there's a catch: With no water available, you need to till the ground, then plant your seed \"immediately\", before the farmland reverts to dirt. Likewise when harvesting wheat, replant immediately and keep the hoe on your hotbar. This works for all the farmland crops: &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;. Melons would be the most reliable as after the stem is fully grown, hydration does not affect the rate at which melons grow. &lt;a href=\"Wither%20skeleton\"&gt;Wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s can provide bones for &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; to speed this process. &lt;a href=\"Cocoa\"&gt;Cocoa&lt;/a&gt; plants are farmable on jungle logs as usual, so that gives you cookies too. You can also farm sweet berries. While you're at it, you can layout a few blocks of &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; farm.\nMushrooms.\nIt is also possible to build an 8 by 8 platform, plant &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s on two opposite edges, and then use bone meal. This can provide you with a steady source of &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Stew\"&gt;Mushroom Stew&lt;/a&gt;, and you can put torches or saplings in the other corners. On dirt or grass, mushrooms need a light level of 7 or below, but on podzol, mycelium, or nylium, applying &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; causes them to grow into their respective huge mushroom type at any light level. Nylium is also the only block in the Nether on which you can farm mushrooms, and that is crucial (or alternatively, bring podzol or mycelium from the Overworld).\nGenerated structures.\nOnce you've gotten used to Nether dangers, you can invade and repair a nether fortress, as it provides many Nether commodities, such as &lt;a href=\"blazes\"&gt;blazes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;. However, falling is a real danger, as there might be a lava ocean below you. If you're in survival, and you've found multiple nether fortresses (not connected but nearby) you can loot nether bricks to repair your favorite nether fortress. You can smelt &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; into individual nether bricks, then craft your own walls, stairs, and fences. You can also transform &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s in similar ways. For bastion renmants, block off any lava, and fill in any gaps. Try to fix up the jagged edges of the bridges/walkways. Make the bastion into an bartering farm/magma cream farm. Add decorations and fix up the bastion.\nWood.\nYou'll want wood for &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; and torches (and perhaps to smelt into charcoal), so make a tree farm as well. Wood also provide charcoal for torches and smelting. Oak trees also provide the occasional &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Apple\"&gt;golding&lt;/a&gt;, but that's not really a food supply. If you want Nether woods variants, you can grow &lt;a href=\"Huge%20fungus\"&gt;Huge fungus&lt;/a&gt; as they don't need dirt, but &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt; to grow. Also Nether wood is inflammable.\nAnother catch: Trees need space to grow - and ghasts need space to spawn. Happily (and contrary to popular belief), ghasts do spawn on blocks, and they need a 5\u00d75 space free of transparent blocks and slabs. You can scatter slabs, glass and &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; around the floor of your tree farm. You can plant saplings with glowstone adjacent, and slabs on top of the diagonal blocks. You can do this in rows for max efficiency. If you're low on glowstone, &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lanterns\"&gt;jack o'lanterns&lt;/a&gt; and torches suffice. You also need at least 4 blocks of air above the sapling. Using this method of tree farming, you can have a large enclosure for mass wood farming without ghasts! If not too densely lit, your tree farm also serves for bone-meal assisted &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, which is useful for &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Stew\"&gt;Mushroom Stew&lt;/a&gt;. The most basic way to safely farm trees is to have a 5\u00d75\u00d77 room with a floor made out of glowstone or glass (if you are using glass, make sure to put torches next to the sapling) and have 1 dirt in the middle of the floor.\nAnimals and villagers.\n&lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;s can also be farmed in the Nether (by bringing in &lt;a href=\"eggs\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; or by killing &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20Jockey\"&gt;Chicken Jockeys&lt;/a&gt;), but likewise, take space, and warrant anti-ghast measures. There is &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; around for &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; and Nether wood for sticks, so with the chickens for &lt;a href=\"feathers\"&gt;feathers&lt;/a&gt;, you can make &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;Cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; can be brought through the portal, which can provide you with &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, and meat. Sheep require special measures: You'll need to get a &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; with a Silk touch tool or killing an &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;Enderman&lt;/a&gt; holding one and use that to start grass on a well-lit dirt floor, so they can regrow their wool. You can also just breed the sheep until you have a lot, and then shear some of them and kill the sheared ones. However, the sheep do not re-grow their wool.\nVillagers can be brought into the Nether through a portal, either using a boat or minecart. Make sure the portal is protected, so ghasts don't fireball you or damage the villager. Villagers can use beds without blowing them up, allowing for artificial villages and iron golem farms to function properly. They do run away from zombified piglins even though zombified piglins don't attack them.\nOther.\nSome things can't be produced in the Nether, and need to be brought in from the Overworld: There are no ores, besides &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz%20ore\"&gt;nether quartz ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt;. There is no diamond unless you import it from the overworld or you find it in bastion remnant or nether fortress chests. Emerald, iron, redstone and lapis lazuli are renewable through villagers, and gold is renewable through zombified piglins. Iron is also renewable from bartering, as well as water, though it has to be stored in &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s. Coal is renewable from wither skeletons or smelting overworld wood. Blackstone can be used as an alternative to cobblestone. You can get the Pigstep music disc and the snout banner pattern from a bastion remnant, and diamonds and horse armor can be obtained through a nether fortress.\n&lt;a href=\"Paper\"&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; is crafted with &lt;a href=\"sugarcane\"&gt;sugarcane&lt;/a&gt;, which can't grow without water. You can get string from killing striders or bartering with piglins. Fishing rods cannot be used for fishing as there no water, but can be used to craft warped fungus on a stick to ride striders or reel in mobs. The same applies to some ingredients for brewing: Besides sugar, there are no &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s. They must be brought in from the Overworld. However, the piglins can provide occasional water bottles.\nNether survival challenge.\nThis is a challenge where you start in the Nether with nothing and leave. This section assumes you play in a release of the Nether Update. Both Java and Bedrock editions use the same mechanics. There are no impactful differences except that Bedrock mob spawning is different and less stable, and Bedrock Edition has worse loot in chests. \nStarting.\nCreate a &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; world. Build a nether portal and go to the Nether. Break the nether portal. Usually players start with a respawn anchor and four glowstones. If you are setting your spawn, make sure to right click on it even after it is charged so that you set your respawn point. You can avoid placing nether portals and respawn anchors and set your spawnpoint in the nether permanently with this set of commands: \nMake sure to stand on solid ground before executing /spawnpoint.\nIn either a crimson forest or a warped forest, obtain around 20 stems. The wart blocks can be broken with hoes faster. You do not need to break them, but they make the landscape ugly if you leave them floating. Make wooden pickaxes and start mining right away. Lava pockets generate at all levels in the Nether, so you could directly mine into lava. You must be careful, and if you run into lava, quickly block it off. &lt;a href=\"Blackstone\"&gt;Blackstone&lt;/a&gt; can be found in large blobs from levels 5-28. In a Basalt Deltas biome, it can generate with basalt on the surface. While you are mining, look for some nether gold ore. It gives you gold nuggets, which you should turn into gold ingots. (If you have Silk Touch, you'll get more gold by smelting the blocks.) With Blackstone, which can be used as a substitute to cobblestone, upgrade to stone tools, and make a furnace. After crafting many bowls, look for brown and red mushrooms and craft mushroom stew. Your priority is to mine any nether gold ore you see, so that you can get one piece of gold armor (most easily boots), so that the Piglins don't attack you. Continue mining any gold you see, and collect wood and mushrooms for mushroom stew. (You need a bowl, a red mushroom, and a brown mushroom for stew) \nFinding a good place to settle.\nThere are five different biomes, each with their advantages and disadvantages. Find one to base up in. \nThe safest of all Nether biomes, but can be unexpectedly dangerous. Nothing spawns there except for endermen and striders. You need to be careful about the endermen, and make the entrance to your house only two blocks high so that you can run inside and kill endermen if you want to/have to. \nOne of the more dangerous Nether biomes. It's inhabited by hoglins, piglins, zombified piglins, and striders. hoglins are the best way to get food in the Nether, and piglins are rarely an issue if you have gold armor. Zombified piglins are neutral, and don't attack you unless you attack them. Because the main use of this biome is to get wood and porkchops, it's better to base up on the edge of the biome, since there is no need at all to be inside it. Put warped fungus near your house to scare away hoglins, and put soul fires (fires lit on soul sand or soul soil), soul torches, soul lanterns, or soul campfires to scare away piglins. Idle piglins are scared by soul things, and if they are attacking you they do not ignore the soul things. No matter what, whether idle or hostile, they are scared of zombified piglins, so trapping and nametagging a zombified piglin and place it outside your house can scare away piglins under all circumstances.\nThis is the one of the most dangerous biomes. It is definitely not recommended to base up here. Because of the jagged terrain, magma cubes, and lava, it is easily the most dangerous biome to be in. The only benefit of this biome is easy access to magma cubes for magma cream (for brewing fire resistance potions), and easy access to blackstone (used as a substitute to cobblestone), and an easy access to basalt (no usage other than building). Do not build your house inside this biome, but building it close would do no harm.\nThis is one of the more dangerous biome. Mobs that spawn there include skeletons and ghasts, however they do not spawn in large packs, so you occasionally bump into these mobs. Soul fire does twice the normal damage, and skeletons and ghasts can easily overwhelm you. Soul sand also slows you down a lot, which is terrible paired with skeletons and ghasts. However, if you have Soul Speed boots (iron boots enchanted with a random Soul Speed level can be obtained from bartering with piglins), you can traverse this biome a lot easier. The benefits include easy access to nether fossils, which provide a large quantity of bone blocks, and skeletons from which you can get bones. You can also obtain soul sand and soul soil, the latter exclusive to this biome, however soul sand can generate near lava in other places and is obtained from bartering. \nOne of the safer biomes in the Nether. This biome is mainly inhabited by a mass of zombified piglins, but is also inhabited by piglins, more rarely. The piglins are scared of the zombified piglins so the piglins should not be an issue most of the time. This biome is known to be flat and easy to explore, which makes it perfect for building. Since this biome has exposed netherrack on the surface, there is more easily accessible nether quartz and nether gold ores than any other biome. You can build a gold farm, which is extremely useful.\nMob-proofing your house.\nYou can prevent any mobs from spawning by placing bottom slabs on your house. Bottom slabs refers to slabs that are placed on the bottom of a block, with one more half-block vertical layer above it. You need to also prevent mobs from entering your house. \nHoglins are scared of charged respawn anchors, lit nether portals, and warped (blue) fungi. This is easiest with warped fungi. It can be planted on any nylium or on soul soil. Soul soil can be obtainable from a soul sand valley. If you break a soul campfire, which can be crafted using soul sand, it drops one soul soil block. Soul sand can be obtained from soul sand valleys or with a 8.5% chance from bartering with Piglins. \nPiglins are scared of all soul fire items, which includes lit soul campfires, soul fire, soul torches, and soul lanterns. They are also scared of zoglins and zombified piglins. They ignore all items that usually scare them when hostile, except for zombified piglins, meaning that everything besides zombified piglins only scare idle/non-attacking piglins. Placing zombified piglins in a trap is not normally viable because being mobs in the hostile category, they despawn after the player is outside a 128 block radius. Naming a zombified piglin with a &lt;a href=\"Name%20Tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; prevents this. Keeping idle piglins away is actually useful because opening chests inside your house angers them. The best solution, if you don't have a name tag, is to just wear gold armor and not do anything to provoke piglins. If provoked, they cease hostilities in 30 seconds if you do nothing to further provoke them. \nAll other mobs cannot be deterred, but can be easily blocked off.\nMining.\nGold is the most valuable resource in the Nether. Bartering allows the player to obtain many items and though obtaining a full gold suit of armor does not sound useful, it gives 44% protection and allows the player to take 2x more damage, about. The resources that you must get while mining is:\nThis means that the best level to mine at is y=14, because it covers the most ancient debris, nether gold ore, and blackstone possible. \nDisabling mining spawns.\nMost people mine by having a main \"hub\" tunnel, and having a lot of seperate tunnels that go off of that.\nYou do not want to have your mines where you are farming mobs. More spawn in your mines and less spawn where you are farming. To prevent this, know where your main hub mining system is in proportion to your base. You need to make sure all of your biomes where you are farming things are outside of your mines. For example, if your base is at X point, and all of your biomes where you farm mobs are south of your base, then your mining tunnels must go north in proportion to your base. That means that your main hub mining tunnel must go between east and west, with the seperate mining tunnels going north, in that specific example.\nFarming.\nBone meal farming.\nA &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; farm is essential to obtaining mushroom stew through a mushroom farm, and farming trees and fungi. Most vegetation items in the Nether can be composted in a composter, including nether wart, shrooslights, nether wart blocks, warped wart blocks, weeping vines, twisting vines, warped roots, crimson roots, nether sprouts, crimson fungi, and warped fungi. However, weeping vines and twisting vines are the best, preferable twisting vines. Twisting vines and weeping vines can be farmed in a similar manner to sugarcane, with the whole plant growing from a single block. However, twisting vines grow upward and weeping vines grow downward. Farming these vines are quite simple. For twisting vines, plant a lot on the ground. When you need to harvest it, harvest the second block off the ground, to destroy all blocks but the one from which the plant is growing, to save a lot of vines. For weeping vines, it is a lot harder to farm. Ideally, you plant them on the top of wherever you are, and make a platform for you to go up and harvest them (second block from the source block from which the whole plant is growing), and then the plants fall on the ground. You can then use a composter to turn it into bone meal by using it. Most importantly, allow your plants space to grow. They can both grow to a maximum height of 25 blocks.\nVegetation farming.\nVegetation farming is essential to tree farms, hoglin farms, and strider farms. When you bone meal nylium of any type, it generates vegetation on that nylium block and surrounding nylium blocks. The vegetation includes fungi of both types, roots of both types, and nether sprouts. Certain types of nylium generate more of their color type of vegetation, for example crimson nylium generates mostly crimson fungi and roots, but can generate warped vegetation. The only thing you need to obtain from these farms is warped and nylium fungus, used for breeding animals and growing trees. All other items are used only as decoration. There is no setup for this, but make sure you are doing it on the maximum amount of nylium possible so that there is space for it to generate. If your area of nylium is not wide enough, you can spread it by putting bone meal on netherrack adjacent to nylium. You can also obtain nylium in the Warped Forest, where endermen are often found holding it\nTree farming.\nWhen a fungi is placed on its corresponding nylium and then fertilized with bone meal, it can turn into a huge fungi. Warped (blue) fungi can turn only into a huge warped fungi if placed on warped nylium (blue nylium), and vice versa with crimson. There is no special setup, but you need to destroy the nether wart blocks (fastest with a hoe), because it needs space to be able to generate a huge fungi. Also, after it grows into a huge fungus, the nylium below it decays into netherrack, and you need to apply bone meal to it, which turns it back into nylium if there is adjacent nylium next to the netherrack.\nMushroom farming.\nMushroom stew is the easiest food to farm. When bone meal is applied to a mushroom placed on any nylium, it can grow into a huge mushroom. They can be placed on nylium only to be fertilized, and unlike other blocks like dirt, they do not require a low light level to grow. Setup:\nThe iron age, after the stone age.\nAfter the establishing food and wood farms, you can begin the next stage of progression. Next, you need to explore. Exploring is the most essential part to the next step of your progression. While exploring, you need to \nNext, you want to do bartering with the Piglins. Hopefully, you have around two stacks of gold ingots, which can be a grind to get. You can drop a gold ingot near Piglins or use it on them. They'll pick it up and drop you a random item. \nYou are looking for several items in particular: \nThat's all you should need for exploring the bastion remnant or the nether fortress. However, you can receive many more good things. Visit the bartering page for more information. \n1. Nether Fortress.\nFind a nether fortress and break in. Use the right hand torch rule for exploring. Take the loot from the chests and try to find diamonds. Get nether wart and blaze powder. Make some ender chests and put your loot inside. Have some spare eyes of ender if you don't yet have silk touch. Avoid blaze spawners, as you don't have a lot of armor. Kill lone blazes and as many wither skeletons as possible. You need 3 wither skeleton skulls to spawn the Wither. There is no way to craft enchanting tables, so you can get Looting only through ruined portals. When fighting, make sure piglins, other skeletons, other blazes, and endermen cannot get to you when you are fighting.\n2. Bastion Remnant.\nFind a bastion remnant. Be careful with piglins. When looting chests, block yourself in or place hoppers under the chests. If you have one, put the loot in an ender chest. Kill the piglin brutes as they aren't distracted or scared by anything, and they always pursue the player. If the bastion is a treasure bastion, you can get diamond armor, tools and diamonds. Keep raiding bastions until you get enough diamonds.\nOnce you get enough diamonds, make only a diamond sword and pickaxe. Don't make the other tools. If you can, make some diamond armor. The next step is upgrading your items to netherite. Make a smithing table and start mining. If you have a strider farm, breed striders and kill them for string. Make as much wool as possible and prepare beds. Go underground, and use beds to blow up areas. 4 ancient debris yield 4 netherite scraps. 4 netherite scraps + 4 gold ingots makes an netherite ingot. Using the smithing table, upgrade your equipment to netherite. Next, find a good place to spawn the wither. It is recommended to spawn it in a large flat area. Reinforce the area with obsidian, as many layers as you want. You should reinforce the base with as much obsidian as possible, just in case the wither flies away and hits your buildings.\nPotion brewing.\nPotions are not necessary but vital if you are taking on the Wither. Craft a brewing stand with a Blaze Rod and 3 Blackstone. You need nether wart to brew potions, so set up a farm with soul sand. You also need blaze powder to fuel it. Now, Water Bottles are obtained through Bartering with the piglins. The only way to obtain water bottles in the Nether is through bartering. Piglins have a 2.18% chance to give you a water bottle when bartered with. Using water bottles, you could make potions with the ingredients limited to those that occur only in the Nether, which include blaze powder for potion of strength, ghast tears for potion of regeneration, glistering melon slice for potion of healing, golden carrots (from various loot) for potion of night vision, and magma cream for potion of fire resistance. You can use glowstone dust to to increase the potency of your potions, however reducing the duration, or gunpowder to turn it into splash potions you can throw, taking less time to use the potion on yourself. \nWither.\nAfter you got the skulls and soul sand needed, and have picked the place to spawn the wither, place 4 soul sand in a T shape, and place 2 skulls on top, but don't place the 3rd one until you are ready to fight. Prepare at least a full set of iron/diamond armor with a piece of gold armor. Bring fire resistance, and a netherite sword/pickaxe. Bring a bow with as many arrows as possible. (You can get arrow from bastions, or you can barter for spectral arrows.)\nGo to the wither spawning location, and block up dangerous areas with obsidian, including the floor. If you can, fight in a warped forest, as withers attack endermen. \nAt the start of the fight, fire fully charged arrows at it. Watch out for the skulls and hide to restore hunger/health. If the wither breaks the obsidian, reinforce it. At half health, use your sword to hit the wither until it is dead. Do critical hits to kill faster. Once the wither is dead, pick up the nether star, and prepare the beacon base. (You cannot make the beacon yet because there is no way to obtain glass). Once you have all the mineral blocks you need, build the portal to the overworld. Set up your beacon to show you beat the Nether survival challenge. You can continue on this world and do what you want.\nWatch the Nether survival challenge on Pixlriffs' channel on youtube.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/user/Pixlriffs\"&gt;Pixlriffs&lt;/a&gt;\nAlso Watch the Nether survival challenge(Season 2 ) on Binary Vigilante\u2019s Channel on YouTube\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMxY2I_Cl1aA%26amp%3Blist%3DPLir0xFpj1ZKMZoh-shnE3DtdtFOBGRTGM\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"}

It is only found in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Remnant\"&gt;bastion remnants&lt;/a&gt; in small supply. Once found however, it can be planted and grown on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; anywhere in any dimension.\nPreparation.\nBefore creating a nether wart farm, it is important to prepare in advance. Make sure to choose the right location and materials before setting up.\nLocation.\nNether wart does not need light to grow, but the farm should be built in a lit and enclosed area to prevent &lt;a href=\"creepers\"&gt;creepers&lt;/a&gt; from damaging growth. Additionally, putting the farm in a place where it will be often loaded will help the farm to continuously grow.\nDepending on the design of a nether wart farm, extra room may be required for the &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuitry\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure to know the size of the farm in advance so that the proper amount of space can be cleared in one go.\nMaterials.\nBefore making a nether wart farm, it is necessary to have one soul sand per nether wart which can be grown. At least one nether wart is also needed to begin producing. It is recommended to have more than one, however, to decrease the initial amount of time spent waiting for it to grow.\nThe rest of the required materials depends on the design. The following are some common materials which may be required to build certain farms:\nDesign.\nBecause nether wart must be planted manually and farmer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s don't plant nether wart, fully automatic designs for nether wart farms are not possible. However, the collection system can still be automated, making semi-automatic farms possible.\nDispenser powered farms.\nIn this design, water flows to a central spot the nether wart is harvested with the press of a button, and flows to a central point for easy collection.\nPiston powered farms.\nPiston movement destroy the nether wart off to be easily picked up and replanted.\nIn the following video this type of farm is shown, using a simple redstone circuit that triggers the piston to push the soul sand and then to reset the placement."}

With the concern of &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, this style is a challenging and engaging experience. This style is based on the real-life who roam the Earth without a permanent residence. There are certain rules and styles for this way of playing.\nThe basic rules are:\nThere are more specific styles which specify where you can go, where you stay, and even how you should survive.\nNomadic Experience Challenge.\nThis tutorial assumes you are playing on Java Edition and only follow the basic rules. Most is same for bedrock edition. It is best to play this on hardcore mode.\nYour first few days.\nLike usual survival, your goals on the first day is to get stone tools, a temporary shelter, some food, and possibly a bed. After that, go mining for resources. If you accumulate lots of cobblestone, you can throw some of it away because if you make a chest, you cannot come back to get it. You want to get enough iron for a full set of iron armor, tools, bucket, shears, and an anvil and some diamonds for a diamond pickaxe and enchanting table. If you find a dungeon, you can break the spawner if you want because you will never come back to it. Take the loot from the chests and throw out anything you don't need. The best things from a dungeon are golden apples, enchanted books, saddles, name tags, and resources. Try to gather enough string for a bow and at least 20 arrows. For the next days, you must leave the area you used. Kill all passive mobs you see because you cannot build a farm. If you find a village, take some beds and raid the chests. Kill the iron golem(Note: For &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you have completely raided the place before killing the iron golem as you may not have a chance after your &lt;a href=\"Village%23Popularity\"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; reaches -15). If it is a plains or desert village, gather all the hay bales and sell the wheat to a farmer villager. Do some trading to get some resources and take any useful workstations, such as blast furnaces and cauldrons. Take as much as you can and don't worry about the villagers' safety because you will never come back.\nThe nether.\nYour next goal is to go to the nether and get blaze rods and ender pearls. Make sure you have at least some armor and a weapon and some tools. Keep exploring until you find a nether fortress and bastion. Get at least 20 blaze rods from the fortress and get the nether wart as well. Find a bastion and kill the piglin brutes. Take as much gold, diamond, and netherite from the chests and toss the gold armor and weapons or put them in a furnace. Find a group of piglins and throw gold ingots at them and wait until they finish bartering. You need to have at least 32 ender pearls and 18 obsidian. If you get fire resistance potions, keep some of them. If you get soul speed boots, you can wear them. Keep as much items as you can and throw out anything else you don't need.\nThe end.\nAfter you get enough blaze rods and ender pearls, build your portal using the obsidian and leave. Craft eyes of ender. If you have more obsidian, craft an ender chest to store more items. Use the eyes of ender to find the stronghold. Find the end portal room and destroy the silverfish spawner because you don't need it. If you can, explore the other parts of the stronghold and find chests. If you found the library, break the bookshelves to get books (bookshelves with silk touch). If you find a silk touch book and you have an anvil, enchant a pickaxe with silk touch to get the bookshelves. Before you fight the ender dragon, make sure you have these things:\nKill the ender dragon the standard way or use beds to blow it up. If you are experienced enough, it should be easy. If you use beds, you need a obsidian block on the corner of the bedrock portal pillar so you can place your beds.\nOnce you have killed the ender dragon, use a torch to pick up the dragon egg and put it in your ender chest. Your next goal is to get shulker boxes and elytra. The reason you have to speedrun the game is to unlock shulker boxes faster. This allows for easier storage, a big problem with nomadic experiences. Use a trapdoor or ender pearl to go to the end gateway and find an end city. Kill all the shulkers, preferably with a Looting III sword to get shulker shells. Take all the chests and loot. If there is an end ship, ender pearl or bridge there and kill the shulkers. Get the elytra, the two chests, and the dragon head. Raid more end cities for more shulker boxes. Discard anything that has curse of vanishing or curse of binding because you don't need it. Bring the anvil to upgrade your armor with the end city armor. Find a return gateway to leave the end. You will end up at world spawn or at a bed or respawn anchor that you used.\nAdvanced Global Progression.\nAfter you have defeated the ender dragon and gotten shulker boxes, you have completed the basic global progression, but there are still many things you can do in a nomadic world.\nStorage.\nYour most important step is to expand your storage. The ender chest has 27 slots and pairing it with 27 shulker boxes can give you 729 slots, which is enough to store 729-46656 items (depending on stack size). Even though this is a lot, it is still limited. You will need to get as many donkeys and/or llamas as you can and get leads. To get the leads, kill some wandering traders. Equip the trader llamas with chests and check their storage. If it is less than 12 slots, kill it and try again with another llama. If you want a donkey, you can find it in plains biomes. Equip it with a chest. It is guaranteed to have 15 slots. If you put shulker boxes in the animals, you can store much more items. Just make sure your lead doesn't break and you lose all your diamonds. Put valuables in the ender chest's shulker boxes, and put bulk materials, like dirt and cobblestone, in the animals. If you have name tags, name the animals so you can tell which one carries which, such as naming them, \"Mob Drops\", \"Bulk Materials\", \"Potions\". It is also a good idea to dye the shulker boxes and name them with the anvil.\nNomadic Moving Base.\nThis base is built in a flying machine and moves. This base follows all the basic rules and can move in two directions. It contains 12 minecart chests for storage, 4 villager storage, and crafting tables. In order to move in other directions, the base has to be taken down and reoriented.\nAll pistons are sticky in Java Edition. For Bedrock Edition the pistons facing right are not. The ones facing left are.\nThe machine moves right.\nResource Production.\nSince you cannot build farms, you have to manually produce resources. You cannot farm crops and trees without using bone meal because you don't have time for them to grow. In order to get bone meal, compost extra seeds or kill skeletons for bones. If you see the wandering trader, buy as much items as you can because you don't have time to farm those items and the wandering trader makes those items renewable. To get honey, you have to bring a silk touch pickaxe to get a bee nest and place it during the day and wait for the bees to produce honey. You should get an average of one honey bottle a day, so you have to go through many days to build the nomadic flying base. If you find more bee nests, silk touch them. If you got honeycombs, you can also craft beehives and breed bees, but you have to pick them up at night because you cannot move them with pistons. If you need resources from the nether, you need to set up the nether portal and return to that portal before the 20 minutes passes, or you have to build a new portal and lose your base. If you need to go to the end, set your spawn point in your base and use eyes of ender to find the nearest stronghold and find the end portal. If you go through the return portal, you will end back at your base, which doesn't count returning back to previous locations because the end exit portal will always take you to your spawn point. The flying machine will allow you to bring villagers, although you have to break the minecarts during the day to let the villagers work. You must not place blocks on the flying machine, except the ones already in the blueprint, or the machine will break. To get villagers, you have to be quick to get them from a nearby village before the 20 minutes passes. Use a staircase or elevator to move them up and place them in minecarts and place workstations. If you want animals, you will need to expand the flying machine to allow animals. The base is built out of honey blocks, so the animals won't move around too much. You can still breed them and kill them for their drops. You can bring as many villagers as you want for your nomadic base, as long as you have enough space for them. You can also add more minecart with chest for storage. These are the basics of this tutorial. However, there are many other things you can do besides building, in a nomadic world.\nChallenges:\nNomadic shelters.\nNomadic shelters can range anywhere from absolute simplicity to an easily deployable craft station. In principle, Nomadic shelters should be easy to make and accessible from almost anywhere on the various maps of Minecraft. Below is a list of Shelters that are organized by complexity. The most basic utility for the nomad is the &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. It's easy to make - just 3 blocks of wool and 3 blocks of wooden planks are needed to craft it.\nBed.\nPlace a bed before sunset and go to sleep as early as possible to prevent monsters from spawning. Keep away from caves, as they supply no protection.\nInstant shelter.\nInstant shelters are the absolute basic, and while they keep you safe, you lack many luxuries and abilities.\nThese shelters are useful when exploring a map or finding rare resources like clay or cacti. They are meant to be built in 5 to 10 seconds, anywhere on the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or in a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 2 types of instant shelters you can do :\nThe first one is simply a hole in the ground.\nThis is exactly what it sounds like. All you need is to dig a hole according to the schematics below.\nThis design protects you from &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; even if you build the shelter at midnight. You should stay careful when going out of it, as a mob may fall into your hole. If there are any mobs on top of your hole, you might not be able to sleep due to them being too close. If you do not place a torch inside to light the shelter, it will be dark enough for a mob to spawn.\nThe second type of instant shelter is a pillar on which you can &lt;a href=\"sleep\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;. This method will only work if there are no mobs nearby.\nThis shelter is useful if you don't want to be surprised on your wake by mobs and see the sun (you can clean the area around with a bow and an arrow). However, building a pillar without overhangs is not advisable since spiders can climb the pillar. This is easily circumvented by making overhangs on top of the pillar to prevent &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s from climbing up the pillar and harming the player sleeping in bed.\nHuge mushroom shelter or PSS (Portable 'Shroom Shelter').\nThere is another instant shelter that is easy to make; all you need is 1 red mushroom, some bonemeal, 1 block of ground, 12 blocks of choice, a torch or two, and 1 bed.\nFirst plant your red mushroom on a dirt block, then use your bonemeal on that mushroom. Remove the central stalk to make it easier to maneuver. Fill the area between the edges of the mushroom and the ground with your blocks of choice, place a torch or two, place your bed, and you've finished your makeshift base. Some people like to think of it as a tent. It also has the plus side of producing even more mushrooms to make food. As of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.2.4\"&gt;Java Edition 1.2.4&lt;/a&gt;, you need to plant the mushroom on &lt;a href=\"Mycelium\"&gt;Mycelium&lt;/a&gt; to build the shelter unless the mushroom can't see the sun.\nIf you dig a 1-block hole in the ground to plant the mushroom in, it will usually (but not always) grow its walls all the way to the ground.\nBrown mushrooms can also be used as a safe place to snipe mobs from with the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBasic hut.\nIt's just what it sounds like. It's a ground level structure that can be a bit bigger than the Instant Shelter. Just place your bed and build a space around it that mobs cannot penetrate.\nMountainside hut.\nThis is built on a mountainside for maximum protection. Simply dig into a cliff, hill, or mountainside enough to fit a bed and room to wake up without danger of suffocation.\nTree house.\nThis might be one of the most efficient, and safest, ways of making a one-night shelter. All you do is go up in a &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; and barricade yourself with any material. This works especially well with larger trees (the ones with branches). Note that spiders may be able to get up the smaller trees. Also, a plus-side to this shelter is that you have a natural way to see outside.\nWith the use of jungle trees, you can make a really high tree house or even make a tree village in a jungle biome connecting each tree via a walkway/bridge. However, making an entire village is not the easiest thing to do when you have to keep on moving.\nCave dwelling.\nIf you happen to have a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; with you, this is an easy one. If you stumble upon a cave, you only have to barricade the entrance and you're done. Of course, barricading the side of the cave that leads into the earth is also a good idea, since lots of hostile mobs might spawn. Like always, proper lighting is a must-have.\nForest Roof Shelter.\nGo on to the leaves on top of a Dark Forest and build your shelter there. Be careful: mobs cannot spawn on leaves, but they can climb there!\nDirt Tower.\nThis peculiar structure allows sunlight in while keeping the mobs out. Basic design:\nSince spiders can sneak through the cracks and endermen can pick up dirt, it is advised you build your temporary dwelling out of cobblestone or something of the like, with 1 block wide openings.\nNOTE: &lt;a href=\"Zombie%23Baby%20zombies\"&gt;Baby Zombies&lt;/a&gt; can still get into your holes. Baby Zombies are not good for your health. Nor are Cave Spiders, which can fit in small holes.\nThe overhang keeps spiders out.\nIcy Dwelling.\nIf you happen to be in that biome, you can make your house in an ice spike. The packed ice doesn't melt or produce water. Carve a small room and be sure to light up the entrance. And if you don't have a bed, take out the first block in the one block wide pillar. Mobs can't get through and you can tell the time.\nTrapdoor Ground Bed.\nThis is a simple design where you break two blocks of ground and place a bed. Then, place two trapdoors above it. You can now open the trapdoors and sleep.\nCovered Ground Bed.\nThis method of making a simple bed is as easy as it gets. All you need is a bed, 4 dirt, and optionally a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;.\nDig a hole in the ground for a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. Then, place the bed down. Next, place two dirt on top of the blocks next to the base of the bed. Fourthly, place a block of dirt directly on top of the pillow side of the bed. After that, you can place a final block of dirt 2 blocks above the base of the bed. Place the trapdoor on the block in front of the base of the bed. Then, close it before getting in bed. If you have a torch, you can place it above the base of the bed on any of the dirt blocks.\nYou can also alter this design, saving one block of dirt, by using the bottom log in a &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; as what is normally the dirt block on top of the pillow side of the bed.\nEnterable Covered Ground Bed.\nThis design is similar to the Covered Ground Bed, except that you can enter it and there is a layer of protection.\nDig a hole in the ground of the bed, like the Covered Ground Bed. Then, place the bed down. Next, place two dirt on top of the blocks next to the base of the bed. Fourthly, place a block of dirt directly on top of the pillow side of the bed. After that, you can place a slab 2 blocks above the base of the bed. Remove the dirt in front of the base of the bed and place a slab. You can now walk into your shelter for the night, and place a trapdoor on the block in front of the base of the bed above the cobblestone slab for protection. Close it so no mobs can get in. However, you have to destroy this trapdoor to get out. The section above the trapdoor when closed can be used for archery, or can be replaced with another trapdoor. If you have a torch, you can place it above the base of the bed on any of the dirt blocks.\nInventory management.\nThe biggest part of this experience is the traveling. You'll need to pick up all your gear every morning and leave your base for the night. Storing your goods in &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s won't help you, but &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s help with carrying extra resources. As long as you have a tool with Silk Touch, you can use and mine your ender chest without worry, but if it breaks make sure to get a replacement before you mine the ender chest without thinking and get only obsidian. &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20box\"&gt;Shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es will also make a good storage setup, granted you can get your hands on a couple; however, &lt;a href=\"bundle\"&gt;bundle&lt;/a&gt;s will provide a more accessible alternative, while also allowing multiple types of items to be carried in one stack.\nYou also need to pack in the most economic way possible. Try to only carry the base materials, that way you can hold more per stack. For instance, carrying &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"plank\"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt;s will allow you to hold four times as many materials. Carrying wood (logs) instead of &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s will allow you to hold eight times more! Only craft as many items as you need and carry the rest in raw materials. Also, try not to mix things like the different types of wood or planks, as that takes up space, too. Although it isn't as compact, you could craft the mixed wood into sticks, as they will match then. If you are using &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es, it is advisable to use the different colors of shulker box for categorization.\nThen you have to decide what is worth taking and what is easy to make more of later on. Is taking up a whole slot for your &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; worth it, or is four planks easy enough to come by to build another? What else could you carry instead of that stack of wood? Another &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;?\nAnother good tip is to use the rare materials early. Using a couple of &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; ingots to make a faster &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; or pickaxe will save you a lot of time when chopping wood. That time is crucial when you're fighting the clock each day and night.\nIf you like inventory management but think a whole chest-full is too much space, you can add additional limits such as only holding items in your inventory bar (that you can access without pressing e) or setting off each day with only 9 items. Excess items could be incinerated, buried, placed, or otherwise discarded.\nAnother way to carry around a lot of items would be to have a &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;. Put a chest on it and have him store the extra things while you use a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; to have them follow you around. Having an ender chest and a donkey or llama with chest (plus your own normal amount of storage slots) will give you the third most amount of storage, the second most being &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es within a donkey or llama chest and the most being storing an ender chest full of shulker boxes. Be sure to store the ender chest in your own inventory (not in the animal\u2019s chest) so that if something happens to them, you don't lose as many items."}

{"id": "7246", "revid": "55868519", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7246", "title": "Tutorials/Obsidian farming", "text": "Obsidian farming refers to methods of obtaining large quantities of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. There are several places obsidian can be found:\nThe simplest and most common method is to pour &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; source blocks to \"drench\" them, either in a naturally-occurring lava pool or transported in &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s. Until recently, drenching lava was non-renewable, but Version 1.17 introduces a new mechanic for farming lava, using &lt;a href=\"Pointed%20Dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;cauldrons&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral structures can contain blocks of obsidian: Ruined portals (in the Overworld and Nether), the rare &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion/Structure/Loot%20Rooms\"&gt;woodlands mansion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"End%20City/Structure/Ship\"&gt;End ships&lt;/a&gt; all contain blocks of obsidian. Obsidian can also appear as items in several &lt;a href=\"Chest%20loot\"&gt;loot chest&lt;/a&gt;s, notably in villages, ruined portals, and bastions. None of these are renewable.\nWhenever a Nether Portal is created (to or from the Nether), a destination portal can be created. This will be made of at least 14 blocks of obsidian, but the four corner blocks can be mined without affecting the portal proper. If created in midair, the portal can generate with four more blocks as ledges, which can also be mined.\nIn the Overworld, obsidian technically does not generate with the terrain, but it can appear where natural lava pools are drenched by water. Lava underground or at the base of ravines can be drenched by a natural spring, and lava at the base of an ocean ravine will be drenched by the water above it. \nIn the Nether, lava is plentiful, but water cannot be used to drench it there. However, &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt; can provide obsidian (as items) through &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; provides huge amounts of obsidian: The &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;obsidian platform&lt;/a&gt; at entry is relatively small, but it is regenerated whenever a player enters the End. The &lt;a href=\"End%20spike\"&gt;End Spikes&lt;/a&gt; consist of tall pillars of obsidian, and these are regenerated whenever the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; is respawned. And again, a few blocks can be found in the rare end ships.\nMining times.\nMost methods of obsidian farming require manual mining. Obsidian is one of the toughest blocks in the game, so you'll need the right tools to take care of it. Enchanting a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; greatly speeds up the farming process. With a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;, the Haste and Haste II effects can be used to reduce mining time further. Below are the mining times for each level of enchantment. \nLava drenching.\nThe simplest way to obtain obsidian is to find lava and \"drench\" it with water to convert it into obsidian. Before Version 1.17, this was not a renewable method of farming obsidian, since lava was not a renewable resource. \nObtaining lava.\nIn order to create obsidian with this method, it is necessary to have a supply of lava. Lava can be found in a variety of locations, including in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Overworld, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; primarily occurs deep underground or at the bottom of ravines. Sometimes part of these pools will be drenched by a natural water spring. However, it can occasionally also be found in small &lt;a href=\"lakes\"&gt;lakes&lt;/a&gt;, at or near the surface. It is also possible to find small lava springs, but since these typically only contain a single source block, they are not particularly useful. It also occurs at the bottom of ocean ravines, where it is normally immediately drenched by the water over it.\nLava is much more plentiful in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, but as water cannot be placed there, it is necessary to bring it back in &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s to the Overworld.\nAs of Version 1.17, there is a &lt;a href=\"Pointed%20Dripstone%23Cauldrons\"&gt;new way to farm lava&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"Pointed%20Dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;cauldrons&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverworld drenching.\nOne of the easiest ways to obtain &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is to find a lava pool, pour &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on it, and then mine with a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20pickaxe\"&gt;diamond pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. It is also sometimes possible to find lava pools which have been naturally converted to obsidian by waterfalls.\nWhen mining in this way, the top layer of obsidian usually has lava underneath it. Not only is this hazardous, it can also destroy the mined blocks before they are collected. A solution is to place water next to the obsidian and stand in it. When you mine an obsidian block adjacent to the water, the water should flow and freeze the lava before it has a chance to burn anything. It is also possible to place the water above the obsidian, however this is more likely to get in the way and decrease mining speed. Be careful to periodically move the water, especially if you are standing in it. Otherwise, it is possible that the water will reach its limit of 7 blocks and push you or items into the lava.\nLava casting.\nIf you have obtained a large number of &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, it may be more efficient to \"cast\" the lava rather than drenching and mining it. In this process, the lava is placed as desired and then covered in water to convert it into obsidian. In this way, obsidian structures such as Nether portals can be created in place without the use of a diamond pickaxe.\nIn order to aid in the process of casting, it is helpful to create a mold or frame.\nWhen using a mold, the obsidian is usually casted one layer at a time. This is done by placing blocks around where the lava should go to prevent it from flowing. It can then be drenched in water.\nIf the obsidian structure is large, it may be easier to build a frame for the obsidian. The frame should be constructed so the lava can be placed on it. Next, water can be run down the sides next to where the lava will be placed. When lava is placed on the frame, it should immediately freeze without needing extra blocks to keep it from flowing.\nThis has the advantage of not requiring frequent reconstruction of the scaffolding and movement of the water. Additionally, the water streams can aid in mobility as it is possible to float in the waterfall. Care should be taken to remain clear of the area where obsidian is being created, however, as the solid blocks created can suffocate the player.\nVideo Tutorial.\nA quick video on how to find obsidian and how to make it.\nPortal and End farming.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s and End Towers are renewable sources of obsidian as they can be mined using diamond pickaxes &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;d from &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt; toolsmiths or enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;.\nNether portals.\nWhen traveling through a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt;, a new portal is created at the destination. Breaking this portal yields obsidian and does not affect the portal in the other dimension. \nTo farm obsidian using Nether portals, first travel to the Nether and build a second portal at least 16 blocks away. Traveling through the second portal will bring you to a newly spawned portal in the Overworld. This portal will be about 128 blocks away from your original Overworld portal. You can then mine the new Overworld portal and repeat the process. Each time after the first should yield 14 obsidian.\nIf you built the Nether portal too close to the generated one, it may bring you back to the original Overworld portal rather than creating a new one. The Overworld portal may then do the same thing and not generate a new portal. Conversely, if you built the second Nether portal more than 16 blocks from the first, the generated Nether portal may be more than 128 blocks from the original. For this reason, it may be necessary to adjust the location of the second portal in order to find the optimum distance.\nUsing two players, it is possible to use only a single portal. One player travels to the Nether, and the second breaks down the Overworld portal. The first player then uses the Nether side of the portal to return, generating a new portal nearby.\nThis can be done in single player by traveling to the Nether, breaking down the portal, storing everything in a chest, and dying. After returning to the Overworld portal, the process can be repeated.\nIt is also possible to travel through a portal and use a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; mechanism to deactivate it before traveling back. If the portal in the Nether is not exactly aligned with the Overworld one, a new Overworld portal will be generated in a different location. Note that game remembers portal locations, so it may be necessary to wait up to a minute before returning.\nIn all cases, be sure to maintain a 4\u00d74 area of flat ground with at least 4 blocks of air above the entire area near the location of the destroyed portal, either by filling in the holes left by mining out the base of the portal each time or by leaving the four base blocks unmined. If this is not done, you may suddenly find the newly created portal is in a cavern underground because there is no longer any valid location for a portal to spawn on the surface.\nIf the portal search fails to find a suitable location, it will create one with an air pocket and 4 extra pieces of obsidian. By creating the Nether portal so that the Overworld equivalent is over the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, it may be possible to use this mechanic.\nThe End platform.\nWhen using an End portal to travel to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, a 5\u00d75 platform of obsidian is generated. If the platform is damaged or destroyed, it will be restored. However, getting back requires either having killed the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; or killing yourself.\nThe End spikes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"end%20spike\"&gt;end spike&lt;/a&gt;s in the End may be mined for obsidian. They are renewable since they regenerate when the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; is respawned. These towers extend quite high and reach down to y=0. This requires being able to handle the Ender Dragon, however.\nAutomatic farming.\nThe biggest problem with obsidian mining is the time it takes; even with the best pickaxe and effects, it takes 1.6 seconds to mine a single block. Various methods can be used to break obsidian blocks automatically. , the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; is usually key in these methods as it is capable of breaking obsidian blocks with its attacks. , piglin bartering is the only reliable and stable way of getting a lot of obsidian automatically.\nNether portals.\nBy caging the wither in the Overworld and putting the player in a teleport loop through portals, a Nether portal is repeatedly generated and destroyed. \nSince Minecraft version 1.21, it has been possible to create nether portals using entities, making it possible to build automated obsidian farm using nether portal in the Overworld.\nEnd platform.\nAnother bug not now be fixing...\nBy caging the wither using some clever boat placement and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Indestructible%20ender%20crystals\"&gt;indestructible ender crystals&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; is caged to trap the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; on top of the end platform. \nEnd spikes.\nA lesser used method of farming obsidian is by caging withers in the lower part of the eastern &lt;a href=\"End%20spike\"&gt;End spike&lt;/a&gt;, causing the withers to blow up the pillar when regenerated, wielding up to 600,000 obsidian per hour when using the pillar completely. Only the lower part of the pillar can be used as the higher part generates air blocks around itself when regenerating, this would cause the withers to escape. After the withers are trapped inside the pillar, the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; summoning ritual is started, causing the pillars to regenerate. The ritual is either aborted before the ender dragon respawns or the ender dragon is killed by a specialized contraption such as a railgun. Such a desing is shown by cubicmetre.\nOutdated design.\nOne of the first designs used the wither to break portions of the 5\u00d75 obsidian spawn platform in the End, and regenerating it with a sand generator that pushed sand through the end portal situated in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. This method was patched however when the wither was made to shoot blue skulls that were capable of breaking any block. As such, this method works only in \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"12w36a\"&gt;12w36a&lt;/a&gt; and several earlier versions. The following video is an explanation of how this method works. \nPiglin Bartering.\nLinking a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Zombified%20piglin%20farming\"&gt;zombified piglin gold farm&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Bartering%20farm\"&gt;piglin bartering farm&lt;/a&gt; gives you lots of loot from &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;iron boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20nugget\"&gt;iron nugget&lt;/a&gt;s, and obsidian, along with many others. You can get a full double chest of obsidian after an overnight AFK session. If one's gold farm is in the nether, it can be linked with a piglin bartering farm fairly easily. If instead, you want to build your gold farm in the Overworld powered by nether portals, you might want to consider getting obsidian in another way first, such as other methods shown on this page, then you can switch to piglin bartering."}

{"id": "26599", "revid": "54086488", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26599", "title": "Tutorials/Organization", "text": "Organization is a very important habit to have in \"Minecraft\". Organization helps with finding things quickly and easily, especially later in the game when you have collected a lot of materials. It takes a long time to find what you need when it is cluttered up. This tutorial is intended for players who prefer to store items in specific categories.\nStorage.\nEarly on in the game, one double &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; can fit most of your items, such as wood, weapons, and tools. However, to progress further in the game, you eventually need to make storage rooms with categorized chests to store items. Chests, &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Barrel\"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most important blocks in the game. Here are the basic steps for organizing everything into a good sense of order.\nCategories.\nOnce you have completed your storage rooms, you'll want to be consistent with your organizing across all the singleplayer and multiplayer worlds that you play on. One of the main things to do is to come up with a few general categories for every item and block. The exact categories you decide to organize items vary between players\u2013organize them in a way that is convenient for you. Here are some suggestions:\nRemember that many items can fit in multiple categories. For example, most types of food would also fit into the mob drops or natural categories. You must decide what categories have priority over others.\nAnother idea for organization is to organize each chest based on where they are in the &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. For example, use the labels in the creative inventory like building blocks, decoration blocks, redstone, tools, combat, and others. Note that this does not work if you have a huge supply of items, but if this is the case, you can divide each category between two different chests.\nAt the entrance of your house or base, you may want to have a temporary chest that can be used for anything, so you can go farming while you keep your mining or building the setup in an easily accessible place.\nIt is also helpful to have a chest for items that need to be sorted. This discourages you from simply putting items in random chests when you need to empty your inventory quickly.\nContents.\nThe setup of how you put items in a specific chest is important too. Putting them randomly is going to make everything a mess, so you can group the same items and blocks together. Create rows of the same thing or section of the chest to specific items. One possible way to do this with multiple tools that have been used before, with differing durability, is to sort them like this: first, sort them by tool, sectioning them off in the chest vertically by pickaxe, shovel, hoe, etc.; then, by what they're made of\u2013any diamond tools go to the top, while stone or wood goes to the bottom. Within the spaces of the tools, the new ones would be higher up than the used ones. For example, a new iron pickaxe would be higher than the used ones, but still not higher than a used diamond pickaxe. How you sort your items in the chests can save your sanity in the future.\nInventory.\nCleaning up your inventory and hotbar can also benefit players by making unofficial hotkeys. This way, you don't have to look at your hotbar to select what item you want and you can find an acceptable limit for the extra resources you carry. Inventory management is crucial if you want to be an efficient player.\nThe following are suggestions only. There is no one way to organize an inventory, and if you are overflowing with items, you may need to adjust your item locations.\nDesignated inventory slots.\nThis is a method of inventory organization that is capable of changing depending on the task at hand. It uses a general layout with easy access to many items and utilities, but also leaves room for personalization. Some mods may allow you to bind inventory slots to hotkeys.\nGeneral layout.\nThe screenshot to the right shows the different \"zones\" in the inventory. You can add these colors to your survival inventory using resource packs. The color codes are explained below:\nSlot switching.\nThere are two ways you can navigate the hotbar: using the mouse wheel to switch between items, and using keyboard keys. The mouse wheel is better for beginners, but it takes longer to scroll to an item and you have a high chance of skipping over the item you want. The keyboard keys can allow to you to switch to any slot on the hotbar from anywhere, but requires you to memorize the keys and you have limited mobility in the split second you switch slots. By default, the number keys are assigned to the corresponding hotbar slot. Some resource packs add numbers to the slots to make it easier.\nHere are some different recommended keyboard bindings to use for more advanced players and what fingers might be assigned to them:\nInstant hotbar access suggestion.\nThis layout is designed for instant access to items you might need quickly, and places items with a similar purpose next to each other so they can be accessed with a single scroll. It is also very flexible and has several slots that can be changed without sacrificing the functionality of the layout."}

Feel free to stop by and help!\"\nThis tutorial covers aspects of parkour, including how to master parkour, as well as how to build your own parkour course!

The honey jump is a variation of the ladder jump that relies on the mechanic of players being able to climb on the side of honey blocks without using a ladder.\nShulker jump.\n\"Parkour that tries to kill you... well, that's pretty new!\"\nThe shulker jump involves jumping on shulkers attached to other blocks, which means that it has not only the basic dangers of parkour, but also the shulkers trying to kill you! You can further elevate this by creating an impossible jump on top, which would only be possible if you let the shulkers hit and levitate you so you could get to the next jump (and maybe get an achievement along the way).\nTNT trap jump.\nThe TNT jump tests how fast players can jump, as they must jump off the obsidian before the TNT blows up. Note that you will have to reconstruct this every time you do it, as the TNT will explode the pressure plate as well as, obviously, itself. Note that the major disadvantage is that TNT takes a while between ignition and detonation, which is way more than enough time for the player to jump off."}

While Phantoms only begin to spawn after three sleepless nights, some want not to go to sleep every two hours, but to fend off these winged terrors head-on.\nPurpose.\nWhen AFK-ing at a farm, it is likely that the player would be doing so for extended periods of time. Most farms have specific requirements such as world height that makes phantoms spawn regularly. Phantoms are often considered pests since they can deal &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, knock players off of platforms, and trigger &lt;a href=\"redstone%20components\"&gt;redstone components&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics and Properties.\nThey are considered \u201c&lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d meaning that they are healed by harming potions, harmed by healing potions, burn in sunlight, and are ignored by the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nPhantoms &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; at night or during a &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; 7 or less. They also must spawn above &lt;a href=\"sea%20level\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt; and they ignore the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Java%20Edition%20mob%20cap\"&gt;hostile mob cap&lt;/a&gt; when spawning (despite contributing to it). They will only spawn within 20-34 blocks above the player, as long as there are no blocks to stop skylight access. After three full in-game days without sleeping, phantoms will start spawning in increasing numbers for each extra sleepless night. They do not rely on surfaces to spawn. When they spawn, they announce their presence by hissing loudly.\nAttacking.\nWhen searching for a target, they hover and circle at a constant elevation. When attacking, they swoop down quickly, \u201cbite\u201d to deal damage, and then quickly swoop back up to their idle positions. The player is not safe underwater since water does not inhibit their movement and they cannot drown.\nMethods.\nMost methods are dedicated to preventing phantoms from spawning in the first place. However, some high-efficiency mob farms are incompatible or lose efficiency based on the method chosen.\nMethod 1: Covering.\nThis is possibly the simplest solution: cover up the AFK spot with any semi-solid or fully solid block. As long as it decreases light levels, anything goes. This way, the requirement for full access to the sky is never met, allowing the player to AFK indefinitely.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 2: Underwater AFK spot.\nEven though phantoms are not inhibited by water, having an AFK spot below sea level prevents their spawning entirely.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 3: Beds.\nThis method requires the player to constantly right-click/tap on a bed. When possible, the player can sleep in the bed. It is possible to manipulate bed mechanics so that the player ends up in front of the bed facing it to keep right-clicking/tapping on it.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 4: Cats.\nPhantoms try to stay at least 16 blocks away from cats. So the player can bring a cat with them when they are at a farm.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 5: Combined Farming.\nAny AFK spot can be turned into a simple phantom farm. Like most other mobs, phantoms are helpless in bubble columns and take damage from magma blocks. Well-placed windows can lure phantoms to the player so they can be dragged down by downwards bubble columns and die on the magma blocks that create the columns. Hopper minecarts can then collect the drops.\nPros:\nCons:"}

Phantoms are scared of cats, so placing one a few blocks under the trap will make them fly up into a trap. You can trap them using boats or minecarts if you are paranoid of them attacking you. You can then kill them however you want, using a sword strong enough to one hit them, using an observer connected to dispensers which will dispense lava for one second (which is enough to take them down to a one hit with an iron sword or higher). It is recommended you also use Looting 3 since that will give you more phantom membranes from the farm.\nTip:\nIf you don't need an automated phantom farm, you can instead just build a 3x3 platform in the air, and grab an axe (at least stone) enchanted with at least a smite IV (or if you can afford it, a netherite sword with smite V) (Since they can kill a phantom in 1 hit) and wait on the platform. Once the phantoms spawn, they will attempt to attack you, and right before they touch you, kill them. If you can't afford anything smite enchantment yet, you need to be careful. Make sure to kill the phantom before it kills you. You can build a collection platform around or below the platform you are standing on to collect the membranes.\nThis method is easy to afford, and does not require any redstone stuff."}

{"id": "291", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=291", "title": "Tutorials/Pillar jumping", "text": "Pillar jumping (also known as pillaring, chimneying, towering, jump stacking, nerd-piling, nerd-poling, piling up, or constructing a block elevator) is a method of reaching a higher &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; that can't otherwise easily be reached in a map. The pillars serve only the player creating them and are useless to others, unless a &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; is later placed on the side.\nPillars created in this way are useful in editing adjacent tall structures. However, they also cause the map to look unnatural, if they aren't destroyed after usage. They can also be used to get back up after going mining, and as a landmark indicator to help players find their way back to their houses. The latter is more useful if a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glowstone\"&gt;glowstone block&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; source is placed on top. Take note of the fact that if lava is left on top of just a 1x1 pillar, lava will flow down over time, and if the pillar is constructed in a &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tree\"&gt;trees&lt;/a&gt;, it could start a fire.\nAs of 1.14, players can use &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; to create reusable and easily destroyable pillars.\nMethod.\nThe following steps show how to pillar jump:\nBedrock Edition.\nIn mobile devices of Bedrock Edition, it is impossible to place blocks by tapping and holding, as this will result in mining the block below the player. It is also impossible to hold the jump button. However, the player can place blocks below the feet by tapping the screen immediately after you jump.\nRemoval.\nOnce a pillar has been used once, they are no longer needed, especially on &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; servers. This is because pillars cannot be climbed unless they are torn down and reconstructed. Because of this, and the fact that many players find that the pillars make the terrain look bad, it is recommended to take a pillar down after using it.\nIf the pillar is more than three &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s high and the player has no &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, stepping off it will result in &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. If a player falls off a 4+-block pillar, any &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; underneath can prevent any fall damage that may be done to the player. Using a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; to dig your way down is an efficient way to both clean up after yourself and prevent injury. Be careful using a diamond &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; with high-efficiency enchantment, as it destroys blocks faster than you fall. Digging a pillar is one of the few times when digging directly beneath your own feet is a good plan, because you know that there's nothing dangerous beneath you.\nRemoval can be accomplished with minimal effort if the pillars are made with a gravity-affected block such as &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. The method involves placing a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; (or other similar blocks such as &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Sign\"&gt;signs&lt;/a&gt; that have the same effect) on the ground. Then directly above it placing a non-gravity-affected block such as &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and then building the column with the gravel on top of that block. When the pillar is no longer useful, the dirt can be removed, which will cause the gravel to fall onto the torch. This will cause all the gravel to rapidly disintegrate. However, doing this on a public multiplayer server can be dangerous, as another player can quickly kill you from fall damage if you are on top. You can also build it without the torch and dirt, by destroying the bottom block by hand and quickly placing a torch underneath the tower, and the blocks will appear as items the same way as previously.\nEven without using the &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;, etc., it is beneficial to use a gravity-affected block to make pillars, since when the player is done with them, they can stand at the bottom of the pillar and delete it block by block, instead of having to start from the top and work their way down as they would have to do if they used a non-gravity-affected &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can also build a pillar out of flammable material such as &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, then ignite it when it is no longer wanted, however, this presents a number of problems. First is the possibility of the unintentional spread of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Another is the fact that a block lit on fire is not guaranteed to burn away completely, which can lead to burning wooden blocks suspended high in the air (although this issue has been mostly resolved since the release of &lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; 1.3). Since Beta 1.6, using fire to burn very high pillars is not recommended, as it can stop midway due to the nerfed fire.\nBlock jumping.\nBlock jumping is similar to pillaring and also referred to as \"block glitching\", which is an easy way of traveling upwards. By block jumping, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can easily reach very high places by jumping and placing a block underneath the player's feet while airborne. Block jumping is a form of glitch movement involving high connection pings or high lag rate, and is used as pillaring on &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode in areas the player cannot build in.\nOn most servers, there are protected areas in which the player cannot build or destroy. However, players can still reach high places in these areas by placing a block under themselves and quickly jumping off before it disappears. This can be repeated as long as the connection ping is high enough or the client's lag is high enough. A better way of block jumping that even works on servers with a very low ping is to jump next to a wall and place a block on the wall. By quickly jumping and placing blocks one after another in front of the player, they will be able to bypass the build protection used in servers. Using this way, the block the player is going to place is not contingent on the previously placed block.\nThis glitch is often used to complete challenges such as \"jumping puzzles\" to achieve false accomplishment and steal a prize or reward that was intended for a legitimate player. When a player attempts this glitch they are sometimes noticed and appropriate consequences may occur.\nMost servers run anti-cheat plugins and most of these will detect block jumping as &lt;a href=\"flying\"&gt;flying&lt;/a&gt; and will kick the player from the server or report the player to an admin. It is also not allowed on most servers and is referred to as an exploit by some players."}

{"id": "14063", "revid": "40002724", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14063", "title": "Tutorials/Piston uses", "text": "Since &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced in &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7\"&gt;Beta 1.7&lt;/a&gt;, players have been experimenting with their potential uses. Below are some demonstrations and guides. The interest in pistons is their ability to manipulate the position of other blocks.\nPlease however keep in mind that as of the \"&lt;a href=\"Better%20Together\"&gt;Better Together&lt;/a&gt;\" update on console editions that \"Quasi-connectivity\" has been removed and its function replaced with the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; block. In doing so, many of the contraptions listed below might have been made non-functional.\nFlush doors.\nA flush door is a piston door that is completely hidden in the wall that it is in. Unfortunately, due to the lack of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity&lt;/a&gt;, the first two designs do not work , though there are other designs that work.\nPros:\nCons:\nExtenders.\nMany smallest extenders.\nMany of the smallest double and triple extenders in all directions, including expandable ones. Note that the smallest horizontal triple extender is out of date.\nTileable upward 1 wide double extender.\nThis video showcases a small tileable horizontal double extender in this design everything but the input is flush as well.\nTileable ceiling double extender.\nHere we have a tileable ceiling double extender.\n1 wide double extender (downward).\nThis is a Double extender. This time its directed downward.\n1 wide horizontal double piston extender.\nHere we have a small Double extender, which is horizontal and directed upward.\n== Secret Entrances\nHidden piston stairs.\nBelow are examples of hidden piston stairs.\nPiston escalator.\nUses pistons and different repeater timings to create a wavy motion that can propel the player up a number of levels.\nDoors.\n5x5 piston door.\nGood combination of compact and fast.\nSimplest 1\u00d72 piston door.\nStack up two horizontal pistons. Put a block next to the top one. Put a lever on this block. On Java Edition, you're done! On Bedrock Edition you need to add a piece of dust below the block, due to lack of quasiconnectivity.\nAnother version of a 1x2 piston door can be seen here:\n(1.12+) scalable piston door (up to 15\u00d715).\nUses observer blocks for a design that can be easily scaled to any size up to 15 wide and 7 tall. The design is resource efficient enough to allow for the creation of larger doors even in survival mode.\nPiston lava door.\nA &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; door that allows for safe entry to rooms without the player getting burnt, uses &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s to accomplish this!\nFlush Seamless piston door.\nThis design is fully hidden, no &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; visible. Also, this design can be activated from both sides, and still, everything is hidden. The design isn't too complicated and doesn't take up a whole lot of resources either.\nImproved hidden piston door.\nThe improved hidden piston door is a flush 2x2 door that can be opened through the use of a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; on a wall. PearSquirrel improved this by compacting it and configuring it with &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s on the inside.\nSmallest 3x3 piston door.\nThis is the smallest possible 3x3 seamless piston door, made by SacredRedstone. It has a size of 56 blocks.\n1x2 flush seamless door.\nThis is a piston door that cannot be seen on the outside, and no wiring/pistons are exposed when the door is open. The video below includes a demo and how to build it.\nHidden door.\nFor a door that is completely hidden except the &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; to power it, you can use a hidden door. A tutorial for one can be found below.\nIf you really want it to be invisible, remove the button or lever, and instead carry a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;. Place it where the button was when you are ready to enter. It stays open until you exit but hey, who carries those things around randomly anyway? \nThe button or lever can be hidden by putting it underground in a specific place, and it cannot be opened from the outside. An example of that is below.\nStructures.\nPiston Draw Bridge.\nA &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; operated \"&lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Piston\"&gt;Sticky Piston&lt;/a&gt; Draw Bridge\" that can be used to cross a lava pit, it also acts as a moat as it can expand and contract to reveal or hide a secret path.\nPiston table.\nBy placing an upward-facing &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; on top of a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;, one can easily and effectively create a 1x1 table.\n&lt;br&gt;\nAn example of a piston table with chairs below!\nScrolling display.\nThis makes a columns of blocks move in sync. Make two rows of a movable material (it cannot be longer than 13 blocks because the &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; can move it only that far, but can be as tall as desired) and make your image or message built into it. Use pistons to move the blocks across, then back, the across the other way, back to the front/beginning.\nGarbage disposal.\nBy placing a row of three cobble, then on top of it, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; on the left one, and &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; (facing right) on the middle one, nothing on the third one and a hole in the ground at the end, one could create a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; garbage disposal. After following those steps, put a &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt; in the 2 block deep hole at the end, and place a button on the top left block. Unwanted blocks can be 'dropped', using the Q button (by default), onto the top middle block, then, after pushing the button the little blocks are pushed into the lava. This device does not destroy placed blocks, only dropped icons of blocks. While it does demonstrate concepts of using pistons, and looks cool, this device is not as practical as most other incinerators and garbage disposals, which are much simpler. For example, you could make a small pit of lava and drop items in it manually. After adding a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;, it is a safe efficient way to dispose of unused items. You could also clear out a plus 2 blocks down. Put &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; in the center place a &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; and trapdoor and one that if you fall in, you can save yourself.\nDry docks.\nA dry dock can be made by reversing a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Water%20Gate\"&gt;Floodgate&lt;/a&gt;: instead of controlling the liquid, the player is controlling a solid. Place a piston facing upward in a 1 block deep pool of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and wire this &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;. When a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; comes over the piston, flip the lever to raise the boat out of the water. This prevents the boat from being influenced by currents or being bumped.\nA dry dock with an water powered launcher feature: \nAs an upgrade, using &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; for the parts that come in direct contact with the boat helps conserve its durability.\nVariable enchantment room.\nThis design has three settings - low-level, medium-level, high-level. You can choose a level range depending on how much levels you have. \nSelf-repairing structures.\nSelf-repairing structures use a piston &lt;a href=\"tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone generator&lt;/a&gt; to endlessly create blocks that get pushed into place by pistons. The following video shows how to create a cobblestone generator, a simple clock and connect it all together to push cobblestone.\nThe following video shows a bigger, self-generating floor. By removing some blocks the same machine can also generate a wall, as shown in the video.\nSelf-repairing structures are not limited to &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, however, it is by far the easiest material to manipulate as its generation can be fully automated.\nPistons can push up to 12 blocks, which limits the scale of the structure. Pistons cannot push &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, so these can be used to stop a line of blocks before the 12 block limit is reached.\nMoving vehicles/machines.\nMoving vehicles are a result of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt; adding the capability to &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing adjacent blocks to attach to the slime block.\nTraps.\nDisappearing floor trap.\nWhen triggered, the section of the floor is withdrawn from below the target. This design is best used inside to hide the pistons and circuitry.\nThis can easily be added to a tunnel. Under the floor, dig out a 2-block deep pit for each of the trap blocks you want to move. Mine out two blocks horizontally from each space where the trap floor goes and put a sticky piston at the back of each hole. In front of the sticky piston, replace the floor blocks (make sure that the trap block is the same as the regular floor blocks so as not to cause suspicion. In the space beneath the floor can be a long drop, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s filled with &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. For simplicity, we chose lava.\nTriggering this is best done with a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, however, this can be difficult to hide from other players. You need to wire the pressure plate to the input of a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuits%23NOT%20Gate%20.28.C2.AC.29\"&gt;NOT-gate&lt;/a&gt; and the pistons to the output. A delay can be helpful to ensure the player is over the right blocks when the trap triggers, which can be accomplished by putting in &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Stone%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;Stone pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s triggers only when players or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s walk over, whereas &lt;a href=\"wooden%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;wooden pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s trigger also for dropped items. Metal pressure plates act differently still.\nThis trap is reset once the signal from the pressure plates is disabled. \nAlternatively, the pistons could be connected to a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;. This requires input from the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, but can be activated when the target is above the trap, which removes the need for a delay.\nYou could also use &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; to make a refillable trap, as well. Make sure to hide the refilling station for secrecy!\nIf you think this is bad, feel free to revert to the previous \"version\".\n&lt;br&gt;\nSimple Floor Trap Tutorial!!\nHidden bridges.\nLike disappearing floors, but in reverse, hidden bridges show an impassible obstacle (usually lava or a long fall) to hinder other players or kill mobs. These bridges can be activated by lever to allow a player to cross, then deactivated on the other side or by a set delay, done by placing &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s and setting the second &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; to any four positions (Right clicking it).\nAdding multiple repeaters can make a longer delay if necessary.\nSuffocation trap.\nWhen a piston moves a block into the same space, as the head of a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, the entity takes damage from suffocation. Tunnels work well for this type of trap because the area is small and can hide the components.\nIn a tunnel, mine out the ceiling an additional two blocks high. At the top of every part of the tunnel, place a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;, then replace the ceiling with the same material used in the tunnel. This trap can be triggered in a number of ways, the simplest being a pressure plate or lever. If you choose to use a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, this trap can also act as a door, because aggressive non-baby cannot enter. For this example, we use a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince players are pushed into the nearest air pocket to avoid suffocation, the trigger should be in the middle of a series. To ensure the trap doesn't reset too early, add an &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuits%23RS%20NOR%20latch\"&gt;RS-NOR latch&lt;/a&gt; that is either reset manually or by an automatic delay.\nYou can also make a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; door, mine two blocks down and place a &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom block(s), so the thief or griefer who activates it can't escape, but can still be suffocated.\nFloodgate.\nOne of the piston's most important uses is its ability to stop fluids. A &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Water%20Gate\"&gt;floodgate&lt;/a&gt; is a device that does just that. Fluids don't destroy &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s, which makes them ideal for triggering this trap. In a tunnel, have a pressure plate activate an RS-NOR latch that blocks the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; into that tunnel, which also minimizes other damage caused by the fluid. From the same output, have the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Water%20Gate\"&gt;floodgate&lt;/a&gt;s open, dropping &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; on the target.\n&lt;br&gt;\nStorage.\nHidden chest/store room.\nA &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; operated \"&lt;a href=\"Sticky%20Piston\"&gt;Sticky Piston&lt;/a&gt; Hidden Room\" that is ideally big enough to hold a &lt;a href=\"large%20chest\"&gt;large chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, easily hidden, but bulky, remove &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; to leave just a bare wall!\n&lt;br&gt;\nEasy To Follow Tutorial&lt;br&gt;\nFarming.\nTo see the uses of pistons in farming, see the respective &lt;a href=\"Tutorials%23Item%20farming\"&gt;farming tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.\nLight switches.\nPistons can be used to cover and uncover holes with light sources. This can be triggered by a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"T%20flip-flop\"&gt;T flip-flop&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers tend to use &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; for lighting, however, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; is another viable method. A lava light uses an &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block to hold the source block of lava from the area it flows into (generally a &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; tube). Since lava can flow, it can be a space-efficient light source. However, lava takes a long time to dissipate. If you need to flip a switch for immediate darkness, flowing lava lamps are not recommended. However, you may want to consider using a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;, as it tends to be more resource friendly.\nSince light levels affect mob spawning, light switches can activate and deactivate a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20Farm\"&gt;mob farm&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaution: \"This video uses the piston mod, which was released before it was implemented in the game. They function identically though.\"\nMining.\nPistons can be used to locate caves through solid rock. In order to do so, one places the piston on the ground facing the ground, on the ceiling facing the ceiling, or facing straight into any wall. The piston is then powered. If the piston extends, it indicates an opening within 12 blocks. If it does not extend, then there are at least 12 blocks in that direction. This allows a player to find &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s from nothing more than a 2x2 tunnel.\nThe effectiveness of this technique is limited. Close caves have &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s (either &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s or ambient sounds) to indicate whether or not a cave is nearby. The limit of 12 blocks can also hinder this method.\nA variation can be used in a 1x2 passage, \nis a video of it in action. The basic idea is the same except the &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es are placed on the wall above the pistons, and you use a piston facing to each side not just one. There are two positions to place the torches: above the side-facing piston that touches the &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;, and above the forward facing piston. As they are wall mounted, placing the torch above the side-facing piston powers both side-facing pistons as well as the sticky piston, saving time.\nOther devices.\nMinecart direction shifter.\nThis small device is a shifter for &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; tracks.\nUsing this device, you can choose to ride your minecart AFK or switch tracks as desired.\nShowcase: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7GYLFNPWcw4\"&gt;Track Switcher&lt;/a&gt;\nLocking chests.\nA &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block above it cannot be opened. A &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; can be used to replace or remove that block, effectively locking the chest and its contents. Note that chests themselves cannot be moved by pistons.

{"id": "93988", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93988", "title": "Tutorials/Pixel art", "text": "This tutorial provides you with basic instructions and guidelines for building pixel art in Minecraft. Examples of Minecraft pixel art will be given to show some of the many ideas you can build in your world. \nDefinition.\nPixel art refers to a player utilizing Minecraft blocks to make certain figures from within the video game or in real life. These pieces of art are usually composed out of colorful blocks, such as &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, though you could also use other types of blocks to further match the reference or idea with the art that you are constructing. Although pixel art has no real purpose for survival, it may be a fun way to show people what you can build with the blocks that you have access to, or it can just be a hobby you could do to express your artistic talents. \nDesigns in Minecraft.\nDesigns drawn that are copied from Minecraft are usually mobs or blocks, drawn so that a 1 pixel is equal to 1 block. This makes pixel art that copies Minecraft textures around 16 times bigger than the mob or block. To make these even bigger, you can upscale your design by making 1 pixel equal to any square (1:1) ratios bigger than a 1 x 1 block area, such as 2 x 2 blocks, 4 x 4 blocks, etc. \nBlocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;s can be rather difficult to make with pixel art, because of the fact that some blocks use many different colors for each pixel, but they are all similar. The reason this makes the pixel art difficult is that there may not be enough &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; colors to simulate every pixel. If this happens, you can either try to figure out what colored block simulates each pixel the closest, or use blocks that are not wool, concrete, or &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;. Blocks that are not these colors usually have many different colors within themselves, but from a distance, it looks equal.\nSea lantern.\n&lt;a href=\"Sea%20lantern\"&gt;Sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s are arguably one of the easiest blocks to make with pixel art. Therefore, they're a great block to start off with. Simply make the outer edges of each face with cyan wool or concrete. Then, add cyan wool/concrete in the corners of what you just made. For the rest of the next layer inward, use light blue wool/concrete. Once again, add light blue wool/concrete in the corners of what you just made. Finally, fill in the middle of it with white wool/concrete. You are done.\nStone.\nThe pixels in &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; blocks are different shades of gray. Making a stone block for pixel art should consist of gray wool or concrete, light gray wool or concrete, and stone itself. If you want an even bigger contrast, you can use white concrete for the lightest pixels in a stone block.\nObsidian.\nFor the purples in an &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; block, use a combination of a few of the following blocks: magenta wool or concrete, purple wool or concrete, magenta terracotta, and/or blue terracotta. For the black, use a combination of black terracotta and black wool or concrete. Use black wool or concrete for a more solid black color.\nCake.\nUse red terracotta and brown wool/concrete for the base of the &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;, or the actual \"cake\" part. For the top of the cake, or the \"icing\" of the cake, use a combination of light gray and white wool/concrete. For the specks of red on top, which simulate \"strawberries\", use red wool or concrete. If 1 pixel is equal to 1 block, The cake should be 8 blocks high, rather than 16 blocks, because a cake is a half-block in height.\nPumpkin.\nFor most of the &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;, use a combination of at least 3 of the following: orange wool/concrete, brown wool/concrete, orange terracotta, light gray terracotta, and/or white terracotta. For the \"face\", or front of the pumpkin, use brown terracotta or brown wool/concrete for the lighter parts, and gray terracotta or black terracotta for the darker parts. The \"stem\", or the center of the top, should be made with green terracotta, yellow terracotta, and yellow wool/concrete.\nGlowstone.\nFor the dull background of the &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, use cyan or green terracotta. For the highlights, use a combination of white wool/concrete, yellow wool/concrete, white terracotta, and yellow terracotta, and surround these highlights with brown wool/concrete and gray terracotta. Do this on each of the 6 sides.\nMobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s have varying heights in Minecraft, depending on what mob it is. Like blocks, they can be difficult to create, but generally, mobs have slightly more varying colors than blocks.\nZombie.\nThe \"feet\" of the &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; should be made of gray &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;. The legs should be made up of purple wool/concrete, with blue terracotta to highlight the \"knees\". The torso of the zombie should be made of light blue wool or concrete, with cyan to highlight certain spots, and the arms should be made of green and lime wool or concrete. Finally, the head of the zombie should be made with lime wool/concrete and green wool/concrete, or if desired, also include green and lime &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, and white wool/concrete.\nCreeper.\n&lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s are ugly in their colors, so use plenty of different colors when making a creeper with pixel art. Use lime wool/concrete, green wool/concrete, white wool/concrete, and light gray wool/concrete for different parts of the creeper. If you want even more variations for colors similar to these, use the same colors but in terracotta for some parts of the creeper, so that you can have a slight contrast. Also, you may want to use blocks that are not wool, concrete, or terracotta, such as &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s. The most important thing when making a creeper is to line the blocks up perfectly with the pixels on the creeper's face, as this is the most noticeable part.\nHere is a simple example for starters:\nWitch.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es are slightly easier to make than the mobs mentioned previously, as witches do not have quite as many colors in them. Their \"feet\" should be made of light gray wool/concrete and yellow terracotta, and their \"legs\" should be made of green, lime, and purple wool/concrete. Their torso should be made of mostly purple wool/concrete, with blue terracotta to highlight the center of it. Their face should be made with white terracotta, with light gray terracotta for highlights. Their eyes should be made with purple terracotta and white wool/concrete, their eyebrows black wool/concrete, and the area below their nose with orange terracotta. Finally, their hat should be made of black wool/concrete, gray wool/concrete, green terracotta, lime wool/concrete, and green wool/concrete.\nSee the following grid for an example of how to make a witch's face:\nIron golem.\nThe basic layout of the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; is white with \"rusted\" parts that are more brown. For the white or light gray parts of the iron golem, use white wool/concrete and light gray wool/concrete. For the slightly \"rusted\" parts, use white terracotta, light gray terracotta, and gray terracotta. White and gray terracotta are actually slightly browned, making them perfect for this circumstance. Use red and black wool/concrete for the iron golem's eyes.\nIron golems have vine-like streaks of green running down their left side. These can be made with yellow, lime, and green wool/concrete. If you want, you can even mix in a little bit of lime terracotta or green terracotta, for some variation, or simply replace the lime and green wool/concrete with terracotta.\nDesigns in real life.\nDesigns in real life refer to taking objects that can be found in the world, and building them in Minecraft using &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s. You can also build objects that don't exist in real life but do in movies.\nOverview.\nWhen building something from real life, first you must decide what you're going to build. It's recommended to build something easy, such as a box, before trying to build much more difficult things, such as a car. If you're in &lt;a href=\"survival%20mode\"&gt;survival mode&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you have all of the necessary materials before starting to build. When in survival, it's strongly recommended to use primarily renewable materials for larger pixel art. \nOnce you know what you're going to build and you have the materials, you need to make sure that what you are going to build in Minecraft is proportionate to what real life object you're basing it on. The easiest way to do this is by setting a legend for what a block equals. For example, you may decide to have 1 block equal 1 cubic centimeter (100:1 scale). For bigger objects (such as buildings) 1 block may equal 1 cubic meter (actual size), or perhaps for giant objects (such as the earth) a cubic kilometer. It all depends on the size of the object, and how detailed you want it to be.\nSomething that is fun to do once you have completed your pixel art project, is to make a hole to go inside of it. If you want, you can even turn the inside into a parkour course, a maze, a house, or a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;. If you're advanced with &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, you may want to add some to the inside of the pixel art. There are many possibilities - it's up to you to decide which one to use.\nShapes.\nWhen building advanced pixel art from real life that contains anything other than squares and rectangles, you must know how to build shapes that may be difficult to make in Minecraft. These include circles, triangles, spheres, and more. If new to building shapes, start off by breaking 3-dimensional shapes down into 2-dimensional, and combining the 2-dimensional back together. To learn more about how to build shapes, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creating%20shapes\"&gt;Tutorials/Creating shapes&lt;/a&gt;.\nExamples.\nHere are some examples of real life objects you can simulate in Minecraft through pixel art.\nPiano.\nA piano is one of the more simple real-life objects to build in Minecraft as pixel art, as it is mostly made up of squares rather than round shapes. The coloring is also pretty simple, you just need black and white wool or concrete. Here is an example of how 1 third may look on a piano.\nCreeper Face.\nMinecraft's iconic mob can easily be made out of green and black wool\nAlways remember, the bigger you make something in pixel art (especially for real-life designs), the more precise it looks.\nMap Pixel Art.\nIt is possible to make pixel art using a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;. You do this by finding a suitable area, preferably one with few obstructions, and using a map. Find an appropriate area on the map to begin building, and start by laying down blocks in the pattern of whatever you are trying to create, be it a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or anything you'd like to build. When you're done, you can check the map again. On it, there should be whatever image you tried to create.\nIf you want to, you can lay down a canvas of solid blocks behind or around the picture to use as a background, but be aware that doing this creates a tremendous shadow beneath the picture. It may also be a good idea to have your picture take a large portion of the center of the map, so there isn't too much whitespace, since that would be a waste. You can even create a pixel-art frame to go around it! Locking the map has the advantage that the pixel art need not be in place in order to appear on the map.\nIf you're creating some kind of &lt;a href=\"Map%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; (the playable kind, not the item), preferably an underground or indoor one, you can use colored blocks to create a \"minimap\", which is a small map that appears as part of the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; in some games. You do this by putting a solid-color layer over the top of the area, and tracing the &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;'s layout using a different block over the top of the solid color layer. You can create labels, other pieces of pixel art and/or different colored blocks to mark certain areas on the minimap. Finally, when the layout is all done, give the player a used map (this time the item kind) to hold in their off-hand slot to use as a minimap as they explore the dark caves or wherever you set the area in. If you want to have the minimap as an actual feature rather than just a map item, you can get a &lt;a href=\"Mods\"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Add-on\"&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; to put a minimap on the HUD, but be aware that the player may not have the mod installed when they play the map if they aren't playing on a server with the mod preinstalled.\nVideos.\nThe following video is a pixel-art creeper in Minecraft. Note that this creeper is a three-dimensional pixel art creation, meaning that it has depth, width, and height.\nThis video is a timelapse of Harley Quinn (Suicide Squad) being created in Minecraft using two-dimensional pixel art.\nThe next video is a tutorial on a relatively easy way to make \"The Flash\" with pixel art in the original Mega Man style. This one, like the previous, is two-dimensional.\nThe next video is a timelapse of Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece) being created in Minecraft using two-dimensional pixel art."}

{"id": "25644", "revid": "27010889", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25644", "title": "Tutorials/Player versus Player", "text": "Player versus player, also known as PvP, refers to combat in \"Minecraft\" which involves players fighting other players in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;. Whether fighting in teams or in one-on-one duels, this is a difficult skill to hone for many players.\nThis guide covers PvP in vanilla \"Minecraft\", though it will acknowledge well-known &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; plugins.\nOverview.\nPvP in \"Minecraft\" results in the death or injury of one or more players. When a player dies in normal difficulty, the contents of their inventory are scattered on the ground. This creates a powerful incentive for players to participate in PvP, as successfully killing another player rewards the killer with the dropped items, and sometimes reputation and power too.\nPvP can occur on any &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; where the admin has not set rules on it, or has allowed it. As some servers endorse building and adventuring cooperatively, while others are PvP-oriented, servers will usually have rules which dictate whether or not PvP is allowed. \nOne such rule may be only allowing PvP in \"war zones\", which are designated areas of land wherein players are allowed to engage in combat. It is impossible for players to damage other players outside of these war zones. This type of rule may be in place to give players a safe area to restock on items or simply take a break from PvP.\nEquipment for PvP.\nA combatant's equipment is a deciding factor in PvP, increasing one's survivability and damage output. Having good gear does not guarantee you success though, because skill is arguably a more important factor. Good gear can, however, greatly boost your chances in a fight. Players should be familiar with all aspects of equipment in order to effectively utilize them and assess the gear of their enemies'. \nSettings.\nIt's important to determine the best settings for you. Settings don't improve your fighting skill rather they make your fights more comfortable.\nHaving more FPS is incredibly important if you have a low-end system. Tone down most of your graphics, such as setting it to \"Fast\", turning down your render distance, and turning your FPS cap to unlimited are some examples that can somewhat improve your FPS. FOV values really depend on your preference, higher FOV makes you see wider thus making you see more of your environment while a lower FOV does the opposite and can act as a \"mini-zoom\". Optionally if you would want to improve your aim, turn off Dynamic FOV. What it does is it would make your FOV \"fixed\" and it won't change when going from walking to sprinting, though it would sometimes confuse you. To counteract this, HUD mods such as MiniHUD has an option to tell us our speed and sprinting status. If you're walking, the speed meter will input the values: 4.317 m/s and won't show the word \"Sprinting\", while if you're sprinting, it would show your speed as 5.612 m/s and will show the word \"Sprinting\".\nNext are your controls. First, modifying your keybinds is totally up to you. It's recommended to change your hotbar keybinds starting from either 6 or 7 up to 9, as it will be harder to reach them with your fingers. Although using the scroll wheel in your mouse can be helpful, keybinds are faster and more accurate than using the scroll wheel. Your mouse sensitivity is also dependent on each player and choosing one that you're comfortable with is essential with getting better aim. With a high sensitivity, your crosshair would start becoming shaky and you won't accurately track your opponent as your mouse is too fast, while if your sensitivitiy is too low, your rotation is too slow, thus you won't be able to track your opponent that moves too much and too fast. Other settings to change are turning Auto-jump to off and turning your Sprint to \"Toggle\".\nTexture packs or resource packs (whatever you call them) are optional but sometimes they make your PVP experience more comfortable. Beware of claims that PVP texture packs that some youtubers say will make you better are false, they don't make you better, they just make your experience better. Some vanilla textures in the game obstruct your vision too much, such as swords, shields and fire, so if you would want an unobtrusive gameplay, consider getting a low-shield pack, a shorter sword pack and low-fire pack.\nUtility mods are very useful in combat, as well as performance-enhancing mods. InventoryHUD tells you your armour durability, potion timers and what your inventory has, along with other useful information including how many arrows do you have. Sodium and OptiFine are the two best FPS enhancing mods, although OptiFine isn't compatible with Fabric mods unless you download OptiFabric, which allows you to use OptiFine and other fabric mods simultaneously (do note to that OptiFine and Sodium aren't compatible even with OptiFabric). Appleskin is a mod which tells you your saturation which is important in healing (more about that later) and is available with both Forge and Fabric versions. Custom Crosshair Mod customizes your crosshair, and it would change the colour of your crosshair once a mob is within your reach, allowing you to time your hits better. There are more mods out there to improve your experience in PVP but these are some of the more popular ones. \nLocations of PvP.\nIn PvP, the fighters will have to fight in some setting, whether it be a custom-designed arena, normal terrain, or in a challenge map.\nNormal Terrain.\nThis is when two players fight in the naturally generated terrain of \"Minecraft\". In this type of fight, players decide on a designated area or may be unexpectedly attacked (underground, caves, cliffs, or strongholds). One can also add custom features into the natural terrain, normally player-built structures.\nCustom-Built Terrain.\nThis is PvP that takes place in a unique area or challenge map. Players that are friends may decide to create or use a challenge map that facilitates PvP. The players may choose to divide themselves into multiple groups, enjoy a free-for-all, or any other distribution of players that fight amongst one another.\nPlayers may prefer to build an arena for the sake of organization or aesthetics.\nTypes of PvP.\nThis is an overview of various types of PvP. Further sections may take this into greater detail.\nFriendly PvP.\nFriendly PvP is when two or more players agree to PvP for friendly practice and training ONLY. Friendly PvP is great to play on LAN. It is the least hostile option for PvP as it:\nOrganized PvP.\nIn organized PvP, players agree on the circumstances of their fight, and then battle. The victor may be agreed to receive anything, from diamonds and emeralds to proven superiority to nothing at all.\nThis type of PvP can be highly competitive and players may need an impartial judge to enforce the rules.\nUnorganized PvP.\nThis is when someone surprise attacks you without warning. Keep your weapons ready for this! This is mainly common in SMP PVP. \nIf you have better equipment than your attacker, you will likely be able to kill them. At this point, there is no better time to give it your all. Utilize anything and everything at your disposal to destroy your opponent \u2014 any method that \"Minecraft\" provides, you should exploit. (Combat-logging, hacking, and other out-of-game methods are unacceptable except on select servers.) Always carry extras. You never want to be stuck in battle without a weapon. Therefore, extensive measures must be taken to ensure that equipment can be readily replaced in a fight, such as enchantments, extras, and consistent resupplying.\nPress any advantages you can, and consider fleeing if you don't think you can win. There's very little point in being honourable, and more point to staying alive.\nIf someone intervenes in your fight, and attacks the enemy, then you and the new fighter can kill the enemy. When that is finished, then you will fight the new opponent and possibly lose. Also, you may have a chance to \"clean up\" the player that won the fight between the 2 when they are low on health, or to escape while they fight. This is also known as \"third-partying\", or \"janitor-ing\".\nKit PvP.\nIn this type, 2 players spawn in a set map with an arranged set of equipment, thus the name of PVP. Practicing kits are very important in learning the basics of PVP. And the kits can also be customizable depending on the server.\nIn 1.16, the most important kits to practice are axe and shield PVP, netherite pot kit PVP and crystal PVP.\nMinigames.\nMinigames are typically played on dedicated minigame servers. Some popular ones include Bedwars (where each player/team has a bed that allows them to respawn if it is undestroyed), and Capture the Flag (where each team tries to steal a banner/wool from the other team). Many other variations of these games, and some more niche minigames, also exist. Each minigame will typically have its own set of rules, as well as a shop or class system (although this is not true for all minigames). To gain experience in this kind of PvP, it is recommended to try different kinds of minigames, and find one/some that you enjoy. Minigames are technically a form of Organized PvP, but are normally on a dedicated server.\nPractice servers.\nServers are a good way to sharpen your PVP skills. Listed below are some of the popular PVP servers.\nTactics.\nNOTE: Tactics are not the same as strategies. Tactics are individual moves and processes used in a fight to better your chances of winning. Strategy is how you string them together, and how you apply them in a larger context. For example, strafing is a tactic. How you use strafing to win a 1v3 is a strategy.\nPractice.\nPractice doesn't make perfect, but it can make better. Practising Minecraft PvP will increase anyone's skill over time. However, knowing how to practise well can speed this improvement up. Practice is used to burn certain moves, like strafing, into your long-term muscle memory. There are many servers out there which focus on practice. For pre-1.9, Hypixel duels are a commonly used practice method. For 1.9 and above, PvP Legacy offers good duels modes where you can set a custom kit to play with on different maps. It is recommended to practise with a wide variety of equipment and techniques. Find what you're bad at, and practise it. \nAim and Reach.\nAim plays a big part in PvP. Reach is measured from your head to the enemy hitbox. If you aim at the head you will get the most amount of reach because the reach is measured from your head to the enemy hitbox. The distance between your head and the enemy's head is 3 blocks, and the distance between your head and your opponent's legs is more than that. \"Minecraft\"s reach is 3 blocks meaning you will not get the first hit if you aim for the legs while your opponent aims at your head. \nAnother part of aiming is accuracy - practise keeping your crosshair over your opponent, and avoid swinging wildly at thin-air in the hopes of landing a hit. Particularly in versions 1.9 and up, this is a sure-fire way to lose a duel.\nOne of the best strategies for PvP is letting your opponent get the first hit. They hit you first, and while in the air, you hit them. (This is called a trade hit) This gives you the low-ground advantage, and you can follow up with an easy combo.\nClicking Methods.\nIn pre-1.9, CPS (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.clickspersecond.com\"&gt;clicks per second&lt;/a&gt;) is the difference between life and death. Clicking fast is incredibly important, with most skilled PvPers being able to reach a CPS of 8-30 through different clicking methods such as jitter clicking, drag clicking and butterfly clicking (these last two are sometimes banned on servers). Playing in pre-1.9 versions can cause repetitive strain injuries and finger problems for PvPers over time, so it is advised to always regulate how fast you click and make sure you do not exceed 20 seconds of jitter clicking at any time. In 1.9+, jitter clicking is a very bad idea, as the attack cooldown feature means that PvP is more about aim and strategic hits. PvP in these versions is less about how many clicks you can do per second, but how you make each click count.\nStrafing.\nPvP isn't always standing still in one spot while hitting someone with a sword, and never should be. Circle strafing around your enemies can benefit the player, especially if the opponent(s) wield strong weapons. Circle strafing can be achieved by using the A and D keys to move in a loop around your enemy - change directions to disorientate them further. Side-to-side strafing is also used to avoid bow shots. \nHow to counter: Most competent players have at least a basic knowledge of strafing. Effective use of a shield will help to counter them - try to turn and block their strikes from the direction they are strafing towards. Practice your aim and learn to strafe yourself - the best way to beat a strafer is to be one yourself.\nW-Tapping.\nW-tapping is a technique where the player taps W right after hitting their opponent with a sword (axes are typically too slow to get a W-tap chain, but can be used for single W-taps). W-tapping resets a player's sprint and increases the knockback dealt to the opponent. This makes it harder for the opponent to hit back as they will be constantly knocked back, and backwards momentum plus server delay (ping) makes a deadly combo. The term \"combo\" is used a lot, and it simply means a chain of hits on another player. Despite popular belief, W-tapping does not increase your attack reach, but gives the illusion of it due to the effects of knockback and server ping mentioned above.\nS-tapping is a related concept. After executing a knockback hit, immediately tap S to create some distance between you and your enemy, they won't be able to attack you but you are still able to reach them. S-tapping is arguably the easiest way to hold a combo.\nHow to counter: Netherite armour, water, and other items can help to reduce the knockback you take in a W-tap combo. Try to reverse the combo by getting a chain of hits on your opponent - this is normally achieved by strafing to their side and hitting their exposed back or side. When they turn to face you, begin W-tapping them. W-tapping is typically the best way to counter W-tapping. Also, shields can block sword W-tap chains, so they're a worthwhile investment if facing an enemy with some experience.\nBlock Hitting (pre-version 1.9 only).\nBlock hitting is when a player presses their attack button and place block button at the same time. When a player block hits it allows them to take 50% less damage than if they weren't block hitting. Since blocking resets sprinting, this will increase knockback for an opponent, similar to W-Tapping. Block hitting does not work post-1.9.\nHow to counter: Block hitting is difficult to counter, but dealing true damage can bypass a skilled player's block-hitting capability. True damage is damage which does not take armour into consideration. Lava and poison are two of the best methods of dealing true damage.\nThird Person Usage.\nThird Person might not seem very useful, it is harder to strike the opponent, and you can't shoot bows well, but when used for sneak attacking, it is very useful. Say you are about to ambush 2 people in iron by a hazard (Lava, Long Drop,) but you can't see them! if you used third person, you could wait until they look away and them knock them into the hazard and run away! (Note, don't use lava if you want the loot, as it will burn.)\nHow to counter: Countering this is very hard, and that is why it is powerful, the only way to defend it is to simply stay alert. \nKnockback.\nKnockback is one of the most important mechanics in PvP, and feeds into other tactics such as W-tapping and clicking methods. Manipulating knockback is incredibly important, and can be the difference between life and death. In many cases, you want to increase your opponent's knockback and decrease your own (although in some situations, this isn't the case - see the infamous duel between kingoros and popbob on 2b2t). Netherite armour, cobwebs, and water are all legitimate ways to reduce your own knockback, but if your opponent can land multiple hits and you fail to knock them away from you, this can often play against you. Increasing your opponent's knockback is typically done through combos and W-tapping.\nHow to counter: See above paragraph for ways to decrease your own knockback.\nDistractions and Decoys.\nWhen playing using vanilla terrain, making a fake base can be a good way to lure opponents into a trap, or simply waste their time as you close in to attack them. This method works best on faction servers, but if you are good enough at designing these you can make it compatible with a non-Faction PvP server. Once they fall in the trap and die, you are able to take their items. This is a great source of money, items, and PvP supplies. Players can also be used as decoys - if one member on your team is low on health, another can try to lure the opponent away while the low member regenerates some health.\nHow to counter: A large part of countering decoys is experience. The longer you play on a certain server, the more familiar you will be with what a real base looks like, and this will allow you to spot decoys more easily. However, always go into bases with caution - some decoys are very convincingly made. To counter decoy players, try to focus on the player trying to heal, and don't leave them for the prospect of a free kill.\nTraps.\nRedstone is a vital skill to learn. The ability to make unseen and creative traps allows for the killing of enemies whose endgame gear might be otherwise unstoppable. There are many different kinds of traps, and they all have advantages and disadvantages.\nHow to counter: If you know a trap is near you, then disable it, or use it against its creator. Shears can be used to break tripwire hooks without setting off a trap. If you do not know if an area is trapped, simply be very careful. Carry a water bucket and some obsidian with you at all times.\nConstructions.\nWalls, trenches, and other defences can be used in PvP as well as for base defence. Walls can stop players having a clear line of site to you, can stop arrows, and can provide cover for eating and loading crossbows. Trenches can also provide cover, and can be the basis for traps. Pillars and skybases can help you get a height advantage, which can be useful when sniping or trying to find an enemy. However, never focus on constructions in a fight more than the PvP. It's very easy to be caught off guard while building, and allow your opponent to land free hits on you.\nHow to counter: Ender pearls can bypass most walls and trenches, as well as TNT and other blocks. However, be prepared for the enemy that is waiting on the other side of the defences, and switch to a weapon as soon as you're past their blocks.\nTag-Teaming.\nTag-teaming is when you and 1 or more teammates take turns reducing a player's health. To do this effectively, you need to charge forward, and then when you take damage, run away again while another player charges in. This can be a good way to defeat a player with stronger gear and more experience.\nHow to counter: Having your sword and bow enchanted with knockback and punch respectively can send enemies flying and make tag-teaming difficult.\nSniping and Archery.\nGood aim with ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows, and tridents is a very important skill to learn. Sniping is specifically when you shoot from a long distance, and better aim is required when doing this. Against heavily armoured players, sniping and general ranged attacks can be used to chip at their health and armour durability before they get close and can engage in melee combat.\nHow to counter: Strafing is important for dodging arrows and other projectiles. Shields can also block arrows, except when they are shot from a piercing crossbow. Strong armour can also reduce the damage they do, and netherite armour reduces the knockback.\nInventory Management.\nManaging your inventory well in a PvP situation is incredibly important - there will be times when you need to get an item into your hotbar quickly, and cycle one back out. You'll need to change totems, drink potions, get a new stack of ender pearls, and much more. When you kill someone, your inventory will get clogged up. It's worth noting that if you are fighting multiple enemies, stopping to loot one of your opponent's gear once you kill them is a big mistake. For good inventory management, you need a combination of three things: organised layout, quick and precise item movements, and situational awareness. You need to have items stored in a way that makes them easy to navigate, you need to be good at moving them around quickly (often with keyboard shortcuts), and you need to know your position so that you can figure out how much time you have to sort through items.\nHow to counter: There is no way to counter good inventory management, and that's what makes it so powerful. The only way to reduce it's value is by pressuring your opponent, but if they have mastered the \"situational awareness\" element mentioned in the paragraph above.\nUsing Your Surroundings.\nUsing your environment to your advantage can enable you to defeat overpowered players. Using your surroundings can mean anything from strafing around opponents on a staircase to scaling a mountain to gain high ground. For more info, see the \"strategies\" section on \"PvP in different terrains\".\nHow to counter: The main way to counter someone who takes advantage of their surroundings is to do the same. Be adaptable in which weapons, movements, and timings you use. A skilled PvP-er will be able to adapt their plan based on what their opponent is doing in the blink of an eye.\nGood Communication.\nIf in a team, good communication is vital, and ties in to other tactics on this list like decoys and tag-teaming. Preferably, use a voice-call rather than ingame chat. This means the opponent(s) will not be able to see your messages and the clarity is better too. Discord or TeamSpeak are recommended, but other apps/software with voice call features can work too. When talking to teammates in a fight, don't talk unless you need to, and keep what you're saying clear and concise. Rather than yelling \"AArrRgggHH I'm ON FIRE HElp mE somEonnE Arrgjh\", say \"I'm on fire, getting low, can someone cover me while I eat.\" Don't talk over others unless it's urgent. Also, you can use different types of goat horns to spell out different messages, such as \"Attack\" or \"Retreat\".\nVigilance.\nVigiliance (or awareness) is simply knowing what is going on around you. You need to know where opponents are, how many of them there are, and what gear they have. While you can still win a fight without this knowledge, it greatly reduces your chances of being surprise-attacked. It also means you can better adapt to the situation, since you know the layout of what's around you.\nDistrust.\nOn a server where PvP is allowed, you can't trust anyone. Everyone has their own agenda, and you might be just another rung in the ladder which allows them to accomplish it. Never class someone as your \"friend\" - friends betray friends all the time. Distrust and paranoia are very different though. Distrust is healthy and keeps you on your guard, but paranoia wards off any potential allies. Teaming can be a good idea, but be aware of your teammate(s) at all times and feel free to betray them yourselves if you feel the alliance has run its course.\nHow to counter: There are few effective ways to counter distrust, except for convincing the distrustful person that you are in fact trustworthy. This can be done by basing with them and not stealing their items, by taking hits for them, and generally convincing them that you are on their side. Once you have them trusting you, you can decide whether or not to stab them in the back for resources or to honour your truce.\nCrit-chaining.\nCrit-chaining, also known as crit-spamming is a fighting method where the user repeatedly crits out his opponent. A crit hit is made when the user hits while falling down. A critical hit adds up a 4.5 additional damage per hit which can literally melt your enemy's HP when performing a crit-chain.\nCritting out your opponent repeatedly requires a good aim and the ability to properly keep a track of your opponent. You can also perform a ground hit or a knockback hit so that the enemy will be flung up in the air before critting your enemies to take them offguard. After this, you can then perform a massive crit chain.\nHow to counter: P-critting, short for punish critting is a type of critical hit where the player uses the knockback applied by his opponent to make a crit hit. For example, if the enemy flings you into the air, while you're falling down, hit him, this will make a crit hit. After a crit-trade, you can knockback your opponent by doing a sprint hit and start a combo. \nInsta-shielding.\nIn Netherite PVP, seeing a player use a shield as their offhand item is quite a rare site. However, when used well, it can annihilate players who aren't prepared for it.\nInsta-shielding is a tactic where you block before your opponent's hits land and then perform a crit-chain while still blocking when they attack. This tactic is almost obsolete against explosives but in Netherite Pot kits, insta-shielding can help you secure a health advantage because their hits are simply blocked by the shield. \nHow to counter: Explosions such as TNT minecarts, End crystals and beds counter shields, since the shield won't absorb their explosion. Axes also work, since they will disable shields when you hit a shielded opponent. \nNote: The counter method is only partially applicable since Java 1.19.3, when they fixed shields to block all types of explosions now. You will now need to detonate these explosives behind the opponent. \nSword and axe combo.\nAlthough most fighters don't really use swords in the early stage, swords are still one of the best weapons due to their higher DPS than the axe. Axes can disable shields but have a slow swing time so in this tactic, we first use axes to deal damage. When you hear the shield of your enemy being disabled (you'll know it when an item breaks sound randomly plays even though items are still fresh or when you attack him with an axe and you saw it being brought down), switch to the sword and attack him repeatedly for the next 4-5 seconds. Then rinse and repeat.\nCrystal Combat.\nEnd Crystals deal one of the highest damage explosions in the game and can one-shot a player even in full Protection IV Netherite Armor. This makes it one of the most effective ways to fight in PVP. It's why many late game players opt to have one piece of Blast Protection IV on their netherite armor instead of full Prot IV.\nThe basic idea of crystal combat is to detonate end crystals next to your opponent when their feet are at the same height or higher than the crystal, and have the explosion damage take them out. Since explosions deal damage based on proximity and the lower half of a player's hitbox is especially vulnerable to explosions, you would want to play around that and try to knock your enemy into the air before placing your obsidian and end crystals as close to them as possible, as they do significantly more damage to your foe if they are in the air or have the high ground. In fact, if timed right, this damage is enough to break through multiple enemy totems of undying and take them out in seconds. Knockback I is used on swords as a sword with Knockback I doesn't require a sprint hit to do a block of vertical knockback to full netherite armor, while Knockback II is usually avoided due to it not providing any additional vertical knockback and the extra horizontal knockback allows enemies an easier time to recover. Therefore, it's recommended to apply Knockback I on your sword when you have end crystals. Aside from crystals, you can also use Respawn Anchors or Beds in conjunction with them. Respawn anchors, when not in the Nether, explode and produce fire as a byproduct at the cost of \"slightly less damage than a crystal,\" with the damage being rather inconsistent depending on several factors, most notably \"distance and angle.\" Respawn anchors are also slightly harder to detonate as you have to swap your hand three times (Respawn anchor &gt; Glowstone &gt; Any item that isn't glowstone) unlike end crystals which can be repeatedly spammed once the obsidian is placed, and without needing an obsidian block shielding the bottom from harm, would create huge craters whenever detonated assuming the blocks below it aren't explosion-proof. Beds are a cheaper substitute to both crystals and anchors, but only work in the Nether and End and are \"unstackable.\" For this reason, they are rarely used in endgame combat, as it's trading off a whole totem slot for only a one-time-use bomb. However, due to its power and cheap cost, it's a great weapon to use to take out players who haven't obtained totems of undying yet. It is also helpful to note that \"nearly all explosion damage can be negated if there is a solid block between the player and the explosion source,\" so whether or not your legs are shielded by said blocks in a firefight could mean the difference between life and death.\nSlow-falling arrows and crossbows enchanted with Quick Charge III and Multishot (the latter can be replaced with any level of Piercing if the server you're in has a shield metagame) can also help you, as slow-falling makes it \"hard for the enemy to avoid crystal explosions\" if you fling them into the air, as they'll take longer to descend to a safe elevation. \"Weakness/Slowness arrows\" are great to use alongside or as an alternative to slow falling arrows. This is true even if you aren't playing crystal combat, as these two debuffs are good for pretty much all combat situations. (Warning: DO NOT replace slowfalling with weakness or slowness if you have high ping, as slow falling is much more useful for you to get damage in when your crystals are too laggy to explode on time otherwise.) A player affected by Weakness cannot punch a crystal to explode it unless they either have Strength II or use a weapon to hit the crystal. Slowness IV is good against strafe-heavy enemies and will allow you to throw a follow-up ender pearl into them and land your hit a lot more consistently. Speaking of ender pearls, they are invaluable in crystal combat, as you can use them to engage, escape, get to advantageous positions, most commonly low ground, or confuse your enemy. However, be careful while using them, as pearling into an enemy at the wrong time (such as when they're spamming crystals) could lead to a very quick death for you. (Note that if your pearl hits a crystal, the crystal would explode but its damage would be calculated from where you \"were\" when the pearl landed, and not where you are, which often means no damage if you pearled into it from far away. However, you would be stuck at a much higher elevation due to the crystal's large hitbox, and thus, in a bad position.) Turtle Master potions are optional. They give you Slowness but enough damage reduction to tank the 3 explosives mentioned in this category (this also doesn't make your armour last longer).\nStrafes and combos (1.9+).\nContrary to popular belief that 1.9 made strafing and combos obsolete, strafes and combos do still exist albeit at a minimal extent. The reason they aren't use as much anymore is because of shields and netherite PVP, in the latter, crit chaining is a much more efficient method because it deals 50% more damage. However, if you enchant your sword with a Knockback I enchant, the netherite knockback resistance property is cancelled out, meaning you can actually combo people even if they are wearing netherite armour as if the knockback resistance wasn't added.\nHit-and-run.\nDuring early and mid game, you can hit and run to slowly drain the enemy's health using an axe while they chase you around. An axe does much higher damage per hit than a sword, at a cost of a long cooldown, which is mitigated by the \"run\" part of the hit and run. You should try to use underhanded tactics such as going in when you know they aren't paying attention, so that way, they're more likely to miss you completely after getting your hit in.\nHit-and-running works wonders against inexperienced fighters, as even a stone axe does 13.5 damage on a critical hit, which is almost 7 hearts to an unarmored player. However, it's not recommended to use against seasoned warriors, as they can predict and counter you, and your dinky little axe with no knockback enchantments simply wouldn't kick the enemy far enough to avoid the wrath of their sword slashes when they're in full netherite armor.\nHow to counter: Stay alert at all times, and keep an eye out for your health. You can fake being low and trick your enemy into going in for the kill and start the actual fight once they go in, and punish them with crits when they're forced to improperly retreat.\nJump-resetting.\nArguably the most broken way to nullify knockback is jump resetting, where we jump at the exact second the enemy goes in for a hit. This results in knockback being completely negated. This works in both 1.8 and 1.9 combat systems and the only real way to counter them is timing your hits accurately.\nPing.\nNow ping isn't really considered a tactic in PVP but is incredibly important in PVP. Lower ping is smoother, less laggy and thus, less delayed while higher ping is the exact opposite. However, that isn't the only thing that ping affects in PVP. For some reason, higher ping players are harder to combo and take less knockback, which can be done by playing high-quality videos or by a VPN. VPN is banned in some servers though.\nBow boosting.\nBow boosting is a hard concept to master and is mostly used before 1.11, when rockets couldn't boost elytras back then. In PVP, they're useful as a mobility weapon. With this technique, you can easily go to your enemy without the use of ender pearls, escape sticky situations, start combos and when being chased, heal up, immediately bow boost and hit your enemy to start a combo. This results in the enemy being ambushed as you immediately made a sharp turn, making them easy targets to combo.\nStrategies (WIP section).\nHow/When to Heal in a Fight.\nYou can heal faster by having high saturation, or by consuming a healing item like a golden apple or a potion of healing. Foods with high saturation such as golden carrots are preferred as more saturation translates to a longer period of faster healing. Another option is to quickly splash yourself with a splash potion of healing. Since healing by eating normally takes some time and slows you down, you want to do it behind cover. This means that an opponent can't shoot or fight you while you try to get your health back up. In contrast, when your opponent tries to heal, you want to take advantage of it to either heal yourself, or to press and attack while they are eating. The same is true of other actions that take time, such as drawing a crossbow.\nWinning Outnumbered Fights.\nWhen you met with multiple people that has the intent on killing you, the best option is of course run or negotiate for peace. If that's not an option though, then try to separate them before going in. The best way to winning outnumbered fights is by targeting them one at a time, usually the ones with the least gear or alertness. If you get a kill on one of them and they drop their stuff, access your options. Pick up anything useful from them, and if the other enemy is near, burn their stuff so the other enemies cannot get it. This way, you'll be left with a gear advantage and will fare better against the remaining enemies. If you have AoE weapons such as splash potions or instant explosives, try to gather the enemies. Have them bunch up, and expend your splash damage on the lot of them, and escape before their numbers advantage gets the better of you. If you and your enemies have the same gear, you can try to splash an invisibility potion on them in the heat of close combat to hide the nametags and confuse them so they don't know who's on whose team. It is highly unlikely that they will carry a bucket of milk specifically to counter invisibility. There are enemy teams that will carry a specific item to identify each other (such as colored wool) but having to switch to that takes time and gives you some breathing room to heal up or plan your next move.\nProper usage of utilities.\nUtilities are your backup weapons in a fight. They will greatly help in combat but be aware though that you shouldn't bring all of them, as it will clog up your inventory.\nProper usage of ender pearls is very important. When escaping, you should throw your pearls not too close to the enemy, as they can easily chase you and kill, but not too far as pearl teleports aren't instant and they will have enough time to inflict massive damage or finish you off. An important game mechanic in Minecraft combat is known as the i-frame, or invincibility frame, wherein if a player took damage, they'll appear as red for 0.5 seconds. During this time, they cannot take knockback from anything other than explosions, so by using the damage done by an ender pearl teleport, you can get right into your opponent's face without taking knockback from their attacks. This is called pearl flashing and is best done when you need a tempo advantage over your enemy, which is why sometimes you see pro players use their ender pearls on their opponent for no apparent reason. Keep in mind that \"any\" form of damage will grant i-frames, which includes fall damage, poison, hazardous blocks like cactus, fire, and magma, and hostile mobs. If those things are around and you're in a position where taking knockback is much less preferred than taking some damage, it would be wise to run into those hazards on purpose to decrease your odds of being knocked around.\nCobwebs are another great utility to use. Cobwebs can either be used defensively or offensively. In defensive play, they're used to slow down a chasing opponent, useful to heal momentarily or manage your inventory. In offensive play, place a cobweb on someone and repeatedly strafe and crit someone out, or if you have harming arrows, pepper it on them by using a bow or a crossbow enchanted with Quick Charge III. Be aware though that cobwebs are also easy to escape, either by using ender pearls or with a water bucket. There is also no way to renewably farm cobwebs so use them efficiently. One of the most effective ways to use cobwebs is to use them \"dynamically,\" by transitioning from defensive to offensive. Say your enemy is chasing you, and you trap them in a cobweb. You can follow up by webbing them more, blocking them in and lighting TNT around them, so your enemy has to deal with a potentially deadly threat while you can heal or prepare to catch them during their escape before they can react. An often overlooked aspect of the cobweb is their ability to prevent knockback, which can sometimes be a life saver if, say, you're about to get knocked off the map or if you know the enemy would put ender crystals in your face once they deal that knockback. \nTipped arrows are one of the most powerful items in the game, and can give you a massive advantage if you bring them in the right situations. They're expensive and tedious to craft, but the payoff in bringing them is invaluable. Some tipped arrows such as the arrow of regeneration are downright useless in PvP scenarios, though, and the only useful ones in PvP combat are Harming II, Weakness, Slowness and Slow Falling. Slowness is great if you are to give chase, since it makes you faster than your opponent and makes them easier to hit, weakness is great for extended trades as they will do less damage to you. Slow falling means they would have longer time between crits (due to longer time between jumps) and are easier to combo with more air time. Speaking of combos, one of the nastiest combos in the game involves a certain utility, which is the end crystal. Since end crystals require a block of obsidian to place on, you can kick your opponent into the air and place an obsidian block, before placing and blowing an end crystal. You will receive recoil damage from the explosion, but since your enemy is in the air and you're partially shielded by the obsidian, they will take far more damage than you. Strategies like these can be used with other utilities, too, and as long as you have the ability to evict your opponent's control over their own movement, and the slow falling arrow helps tremendously with that. However, if you are to use slow falling, you should (obviously) make sure that your main strategies don't rely on your opponent falling to their death/off the map. \nBe aware that tipped arrows aren't affected by Infinity and are consumed as if Infinity wasn't enchanted on the bow, so your only choice is to bring a ton of tipped arrows if you want to spam them constantly, and use a stack of regular arrows if you still want to make use of your infinity bow, as that way, you wouldn't run out of arrows to shoot even if you run out of the tipped ones. A high power enchant combined with full charge could also override the harming arrows' effect (instant damage II) with its higher physical damage, which actually causes you to deal less damage with full charge than low charge since the tipped arrow effect ignores armor but the physical damage doesn't. Therefore, it is more advisable to use a crossbow with tipped arrows, as the piercing enchant goes through enemy shields and will apply tipped arrow debuffs, and if your enemy doesn't use a shield, multishot makes you fire a 3 arrow volley which is a lot harder to dodge than a single shot, and harming arrows will work no matter what, since it doesn't do enough physical damage to override its effects.\nNegative potions such as Poison and Harming can help you in PVP. The Instant Damage effect ignores the protection of your armour, so it would deal a lot of damage when used properly. Poison meanwhile is almost the same as Fire Aspect/Flame, but unlike the former, you can't nullify Poison unless drinking a milk or a honey bottle (milk also removes all status effects even if it's positive). \nWater and lava buckets are useful especially in the early game. Water is useful for resisting fall damage, putting out fires and cobwebs, climbing higher blocks, pushing away mobs (including players), etc. Lava meanwhile is incredibly powerful in the early game but their power fades away in later stages, when everyone has Netherite Armour enchanted with Protection IV, totems and Fire Resistance potions. Lava is at most useful in UHC duels, since UHC doesn't naturally regenerate your HP unless you eat something that gives you a healing effect, like Golden Apples.\nBlocks are useful to tower up fortifications, slow down the enemy, bridge, etc. They're also useful for ambushing enemies and setting up a rudimentary fortification to block arrows.\nXP Management (only for Crystal, SMP kit and Neth Pot).\nIn these 3 kits, players are given usually 2 stacks of XP bottles. Now beginners might just use down a whole stack of bottles to repair their gear but this is wrong. \nBefore repairing, make sure to back off way before your armour breaks (preferably when your helmet/boots dips to below 100 durability). If the enemy won't back off, try to strafe as much to force them to repair their armour. Then try to repair your helmet and boots to 70-80% durability (around 300 points), while your leggings and chestplate gets 40-60% (around 250 points). Prioritize healing the low durability gear then your helmets/boots (which ever needs the XP) since helmet and boots break faster than chestplate and leggings. To equally distribute XP, unequip the pieces you don't want to repair and then repeat until you're satisfied. Also, make sure you're not too close to your enemy while repairing, since they can get free hits on you, wasting your bottles. \nGeneral tips for each famous kit.\nDiamond Sword.\nFirst, players must learn how ton initiate a combo by hit-selecting, which is where you deliberately let your enemy fling you into the air, after which you attack them using knockback hits. Next, players must learn how to hold a combo, in which the easiest way to hold them is by S-tapping. While S-tapping, players must learn how to time their hits, spacing, aim and attack speed. S-tapping is the building blocks of many combo methods, including circle strafing and uppercutting. However, combos aren't the only thing in this kit, as players must also learn how to fight using critical hits. \nNetherite Pot.\nP-critting is especially useful in this kit, and even though combos aren't as used here due to the knockback resistance of netherite armour, knockback and sweep hits still does decent damage. Be wary of armour durability, since you're only given 2 stacks of XP bottles, so balance out how much XP each armour piece receives. Also ration your potions and golden apples, since without them, you won't be able to heal as much. Also, it's better if golden apples are in your offhand slot, so you can heal on the spot rather than hotkeying to the golden apples in your hotbar.\nIn terms of potion usage, they're meant to be used only when you're too low and you can't heal with your gapples. Use them around 3-4 hearts, since you would be dead meat if you still tried using gapples to heal.\nAxe and Shield.\nPlay strategically. Use your environment to your advantage, and if you have money, buy a mouse that can double-click at the cost of one mouse click, this means that you can disable a shield and crit at the same time, though this is controversial. Also, since this kit usually don't have food supplied to players, draining one's saturation is the key. Players must also hotkey at strategic moments, especially when the enemy's shield is disabled. Players can also bait their enemy into using their crossbows and \nDiamond Potion.\nUnlike nethpot, diamond potion only have 16 golden carrots in place of 64 golden apples. Also, players aren't given any XP bottles, which meant players must end fights before their armour breaks. P-critting, crit-chaining, combos and strafing are especially important, strafing and comboing to soften up the enemy and critting out opponents when they're low. Also, saturation plays an important role in rationing your healing pots, players can intentionally wait until the time is ripe to eat 2 golden carrots, which can give them full saturation and thus, faster healing.\nUHC.\nUHC is unique for a reason, that is because of a game mechanic being absent, the ability to heal naturally. This meant that you can't heal on food alone, and you'd need either the regeneration effect or instant health pots to heal. Aside from that, UHC has a diverse inventory of melee, ranged weapons and utilities that players can use to their advantage.\nPlayers must be fast at hotkeying, and scrollwheels won't simply cut it, since hotkeys are more accurate and faster. Second, players must know how to use each utility to their advantage, and must know when to fight defensively or offensively (AKA gamesense). Blocks for example, can be used not only to build/bridge up but also to put out a lava or a water source block when placed down. Finally, players would need to fight using a diverse range of fighting methods. \nSMP.\nNow each SMP might have a set of standard rules when it comes to fighting, such as netherite and crystals being illegal. Even though this is the case, the tips here can still be used on SMPs regardless of their rules.\nOne thing unique about SMP combat is that it's a mix of both UHC and Netherite Pot. You have netherite gear, potions and normal regeneration from the neth pot, but you also have utilities and shield from UHC. The main fighting styles in SMP fights are almost similar to neth pot, but you would have to learn how to deal with the shield and how to ration your XP bottles, totems and golden apples.\nCrystal PVP.\nCrystal PVP is one of the hardest yet very effective PVP style. Players tend to use both end crystals and respawn anchors. Anchors are used to create a hole in which players can drop on, giving them the low ground and thus will protect them from the damage of crystals momentarily. Hotkeying is especially important and being too slow can really make things harder for you. Also, just like UHC, there is a wide variety of utilities given to the player, including crossbows, potions and obsidian.\nOrganized PvP.\nStructures.\nA base made of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; with several &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s for allies.\nA base made of 3 layers of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and about 50 &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s and over 100-150 &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. Recommended to have a &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; farm.\nVery small, but easily camouflageable. Do not make this base more than 15 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s wide, or it will lose its ability to hide. &lt;a href=\"Cave\"&gt;Cave&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s are your best bet for making this base. To hide its identity more, add &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; and other natural resources around it. You could even add portal entrances to the base, so baddies cannot infiltrate inside the base from outside.\nNot really a base, but produces resources and holds some player. Has about 50 &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s and tons of &lt;a href=\"chests\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;. As the name suggests, this is where you get most supplies, but make sure your other bases have mini factories too. Have tree farms, ranches, mob grinders, &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; farms, &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; generators, and stockpiles. Have people who run it, and people who defend it. Make sure to add minecart rails and tunnels to transport supplies and people from the factory to the bases. A self destruct machine is helpful to avoid it falling into enemy hands. Make sure it has farms to produce food, potions/nether wart, iron and other minerals, and wood and stone!\nA huge sky base with 200 &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, 200 &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s and made of &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; with people monitoring the outside with &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; turrets and other advanced weaponry. The only way for it to be destroyed fast would be lots of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. If you wish to mass-produce these, you really should build a &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; farm.\nA medium-sized sky base with enough space for 100 troops and lots of storage and requires lots of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; turret with a redstone clock and a rapid fire redstone gun that shoots about 3 &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s/second. Recommended for the guns to be high and blocked off.\nRecommended to mass-produce everything above. Creates &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\nMade of about 3 layers of cobble, with creeper and witch farms (or just a lot of chests with these materials in them) and dispenser guns. Make sure to have about 10 brewing stands and people operating them, with about 20-30 beds and chests. Put splash potions of harming, poison, and weakness in the guns, hook up a redstone clock and watch the fireworks.\nAn items stash is a small (no more than 4x4x2), completely camouflaged room with a few double chests loaded with equipment. Because they rely on not being detected, their locations should be only known to trusted members. The ideal location to build one is underground but in a location where no-body would dig. For example, near but not in a surface cave since the player trying to mine would just go down the cave. \nThis house is the trap of them all! Make the house look very inviting, iron blocks behind the glass, chests everywhere, and maybe a sign that was \"supposed\" to be to a friend for a secret entrance. They walk in the door, see the chests, and open them, only the chests are trapped chests! When they are activated, you can have them shoot arrows, lava, or even TNT! Make sure to add a piston that blocks the door when the chest is opened too!\nTroops.\nThe stock iron. The most basic troop is equipped with full Iron Armor, an Iron Sword or Axe, a Shield, a Bow and stack of Arrows (or Infinity Bow and an Arrow) and a cheap source of healing such as steaks, Oxeye daisy, or Suspicious Stew. These are fairly cheap but are able to deal and withstand moderate amounts of damage.\nHigher-ranked players or commanders or those of exceptional PVP skill are those who benefit most from superior equipment. They should be armed with Enchanted Iron or Diamond Armor, Enchanted Iron or Diamond weapons, Unbreaking Shield, Enchanted Bow possibly with Tipped Arrows as well as a few higher-quality sources of healing such as Potions or Golden Apple as well as lesser sources of healing such as steaks. Given this level of equipment is usually given to more skilled players, they should be able to deal and survive significant amounts of damage.\nOwing to preferring ranged combat over melee combat, these units can afford to be less equipped defensively. Chain armor is acceptable, though Shields should still be kept as they are nonetheless useful for protection from enemy ranged attacks. Beyond that, arm them with their preferred ranged weapon (Bows, Potions, Redstone materials etc.) and place them away from melee combat. If armor is to be enchanted, consider Projectile Protection, as ranged units shouldn't ever be engaging enemies in melee range. Generally dishes out and survives high damage at range, unable to survive much damage at melee.\nThe key difference between a Monitor and a Stock Iron is the former is defending a fortification with numerous advantages for the defender. Can be a Stock Iron put in charge of defense, can be someone better equipped. Regardless, they should be trained in operating any defensive redstone as well be capable of ranged attacks (and armed with extra ranged weapons if able) as to attack the enemy before they breach the defenses. Superior damage and survivability compared to enemy units due to advantageous terrain.\nFor those experienced with using elytra (1.9 only). Equips full Projectile Protection Iron armor (Minimum) with Feather Falling IV (minus chestplate), elytra, a Punch II bow/fireworks (1.11.1 or above only) for boosting oneself in midair, and a fully enchanted bow for dealing damage from above. Try equipping potions if aim is good. A Knockback II sword is also good if your enemy has the same ideas. Pack a lot of steak and arrows (or Infinity). Favor hit-and-run tactics, lack of a chestplate and use of Projectile Protection results in poor melee durability. \nFrequently overlaps with Officers and Commanders, a Juggernaut is an experienced PVP'er of noteworthy skill equipped with Enchanted Diamond or Netherite gear. Aside from higher grades of armor and weapons, they should also be equipped with ample healing including Potions and Golden Apples to ensure they survive. These are the strongest units and the difference of power level can allow one of these to fight several Stock Irons at once and win.\nFaction Wars.\nThis can be done with a Factions plugin or through other means. \nThis is when a group attempts to irreparably exterminate members on another group and later destroy or loot all property of the said group. \nThese can range from a surprise attack to a formal challenge of two armies, and can have up to hundreds of warriors on either side (though this is extremely rare and may cause lag). \nIn some servers, you may be asked to pick a team without knowing who is on it.\nSabotage.\nIf you can't hurt them from the outside, hurt them from the inside! \nIf possible, join your enemy faction while you are still able to.\nIf you get into their base as a faction member, wait until the faction moderators are all offline. This is the best time to strike.\nTake their best valuables, then break the furnaces, chests, and burn the items with a flint &amp; steel. If they have a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; mine, block the water. If they have a staircase mine, put a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or two at the top. Go to the \"/f home\" and dig a hole. Put lava in it, from the ceiling and make a wall so as soon as they \"/f home\" they will constantly respawn in lava. If you have spare lava, fill the place with it! Make sure that there aren't any hidden chests, and destroy the farms if no one in the faction catches on. If possible, if they don't know you griefed/raided them, wait until they repair their bases with more food/loot and restart the process! Remember to give loot to your actual team after each raid.\nInfiltration.\nIn most, if not all faction servers, there is a plugin that allows factions to claim chunks of land. If you are raiding a base, there is a 99% chance that they have claimed their base. So how do you get in? Here's how.\nDo note that certain servers have plugins that enable obsidian to be destroyed by a sufficient amount of TNT. If that's the case, then set up your TNT cannon and blow up a hole in it. There are bases that have obsidian covered in water, you CAN TNT-cannon in, but before that, either you have to turn that water to cobblestone or you have to fire sand in using the TNT cannon. Then after you've covered the water, fire your TNT in, now you have a hole to enter their base. If these servers do not have these modifications, on servers with the essentials plugin (Basically every factions server), if you sethome in a \"dangerous\" thing, such as lava and water, it will teleport you to the safest place. Abusing this glitch to get into bases where they have water underneath them or on top of them to prevent from being exploded, you can sethome at the side of the base in the water, walk away and use your command to go to that home, usually, you will be teleported inside of the base, but a way to counter this is to layer your base twice, what this means is you put a second layer around your base that can fit a player on all sides, then create a box inside of there, then even if someone glitches in, they are stuck in the outside layer and cannot get to your chests.\nYou can also build hidden cannons for a surprise raid. TNT cannons can combine with bombing flying machines and elytra pilots perfectly.\nNote: Some servers prevent you from ender pearling right next to a block.\nRaiding.\nIf you intend to explore the full tactical armory of PvP, then a helpful one and likely the first is the raid.\nSimply put, a raid is the theft of materials from the property of another player and killing enemy team members. Raids have a pro and a con.\nThere are three different types of faction raids:\nGenerally, raids are worth the risk. There are two objects that are absolutely necessary if you want the raid to be effective and efficient.\nThe first is always needed since this may take some time. However, you may wonder why the list contains an enchanted diamond pick. It's because you can break almost anything fast. Without a powerful pick like this, the odds are that the owner will have mowed you down before you could even get inside their base! Therefore, you must be fast.\nChoosing a base is easy, and really, an unmanned base is a dead base. When a minimal amount of people are manning the base, then you can strike. Steal all goods. Remember that your point is sabotage, and so you should dispose of all you didn't steal. If you really want to damage them, clog all entry points. Don't stay around too long, though. Take a minute longer and they might be online and hunting you down, in the end you're just wasting your time.\nTactical Planning.\nKeep in mind that faction wars are not always about combat. It's about preparations and knowledge in order to turn the tide exponentially in your favor, such as how you can slay a player in diamond armor with only iron armor and win a battle before going out to war. You can't rush into an attack, you need to plan it.\nFirst of all, PvP is clearly about fighting and killing your enemy before they kill you. Here's the lowdown on your armor.\nIf someone has Protection III diamond armor, it takes without them healing\u2026\nNow say a new enemy has come and they have Protection IV armor, with a Sharpness V sword, and an obsidian base. Attacking them would be suicidal in a fair fight (unless you have better equipment). First, send someone to scout their base while you prepare a full assault. TNT their base and ruin the defenses. This allows you to eliminate their source of power. Then, send someone to cause a diversion to distract them. They'll be chased all the way until they come back and finds the smoldering ruin that was their home. Lead them to a terrain useful to you, such as a cliff where the wall is shaved clean for at least 64 blocks with a diamond block next to the edge. By the time they realize you were invisible behind them with a Punch II bow, it's too late. A plan like this might be hard to follow, but brains beat brawn. You may also fake running away and at the last second, strafe around and hit them with a knockback II sword, it's usually certain death if you can find the right cliff.\nAlways make sure every fight is strongly in your favor. Go to reasonable lengths to ensure you can attack, but they cannot retaliate, or sacrifice to gain power, such as you losing through snowballing them, but in the process breaking their diamond armor.\nAs stated earlier, faction wars are not always about fighting. Although the point of a Faction War is to demolish, a clear assessment about the other side is very helpful in doing so. Let's go into another scenario. Another faction is the strongest faction but is secretive, stealthy, mean, and very rich. Your faction has never liked them, and in fact, hated them. But in terms of pure force, your faction is outclassed. They need \"you\". Now, they equip you with invisibility potions, a diamond sword, a bucket of milk, a splash potion of poison and 3 of harming, a bow with 128 arrows, and 32 pieces of pork. Throw in some Fireworks for distractions, and you're ready to go. The whole faction depends on you!\nNow, as a spy, don't ever alert them to your position, because even if they don't know who you are, you are someone sneaking around their base, and they will pursue. To do that, you must follow some steps.\nMake note of \"everything\". Don't write on a book and quill, write it on pen and paper to avoid being exposed, but write it on an in-game book later. This intelligence is most important, and can get you one step closer to victory. Do not forget that secrecy is \"required\". Report back to your base once you think you have more than enough information on the enemy and that is when you can declare war. Another trick is to (if in a faction server) station your teammates nearby. (Say, a mountain bunker in the distance) That way, if you are caught and running for your life, you can send a distress signal or flares (The most obvious thing would be fireworks). \nOne other trick is to pay attention to what you hear. Say you are in the base, and you hear someone munching on food. Avoid them as quickly as you can. If you hear a nether portal, then your team may be able to build a corresponding portal in the Nether and invade through \"the enemy's\" portal.\nBase Building.\nBuilding a base to protect yourself from the diamond swords and the arrows? Good work! Here are some tips to help you make your base even more efficient: (Note that the marvelous &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Multiplayer%20PvP%20Bases\"&gt;Multiplayer PvP Bases&lt;/a&gt; guide is also useful.)\nBuilding a base? Smart. However, check that your seemingly secure base is not vulnerable. Time to troubleshoot!\nIf the base is being raided, and your hand is forced, activate the self-destruct on your base. It is very important to keep one on hand at all times and also have an escape. The self-destruct must be designed to overwhelmingly destroy all life and loot inside the base and the base itself but also be well-hidden. This is hard and so you should experiment. In times of need, start the lethal countdown and escape. Ender chests are good for these kinds of bases, as they don't drop their content and it can be accessed anywhere as long as you have another one.\nEscape pods are essential for above-ground bases as they can drop you deep underground into a water spot, where you can dig (possibly minecart) yourself up to the ground and escape with your friends (if you have more than just one pod) to far away from the base. You can lock the escape pods with pistons to prevent enemies follow you when attempting to escape.\nNot all of your faction skirmishes in the PvP world will be set up beforehand. Organize raids with your faction. Find some server to host a voice chat box with your teammates. This will allow you to coordinate your attacks on hostile bases and their creations. The more connected you are with your fellow faction members, the more likely you are to emerge victorious. Keep in touch with them and increase your odds of success.\nLet's say that you have just moved in with your awesome new faction. They have diamonds, dozens of anvils, and general awesomeness. Now, a faction war has started, and you have no base, no food, nothing except what the faction gave you. This is dangerous. In the event the faction fails, you are defenseless. Trust nobody and keep a secret base all to yourself. Put a home there and be safe from pursuers and spawn campers. Be ready! If you need to and fear that the faction is about to fall, steal some items and leave the faction when necessary.\nR\u014dnin were Japanese Samurai who went rogue after their master was killed. If your group's/faction's leader has been killed, or you just feel like it, don't be afraid to go rogue. In order to do so successfully, you need to follow certain rules. First, you need to either decide whether you want to be a wandering rogue, or a bandit-style rogue. Wandering rogue life is relatively simple. You wander around, and occasionally raid abandoned or unguarded bases, and avoiding other players at all costs. If you decide on this, you can refer to the nomadic experience tutorial to help you get started. If you want to be a bandit-style rogue, however, then you need a top secret base of operations, and lots of equipment. Only engage people if you are 100% sure you can win, and escape as quickly as possible. Trust no one, let no one see you. Although the life of a rogue may not be as action-packed as being in a faction, it is certainly profitable, and once you have enough stuff, you might be able to join a new faction, either to settle down or backstab them, get their stuff, and move on to the next gullible faction.\nMass Battle.\nPvP in large factions can include multiple scenarios, from individual murders or attempts to murder, to entire factions battling it out with lines of defense, barricades, and tunnels.\nTo make it brief, an open field battle is the combat of multiple factions in an open area. This can cause chaos and may lead to a slaughter in the right conditions. Be sure to be well-stocked for this.\nFirst of all, the open field battle playstyle is to have minimal life lost on your side no matter what, even above the victory itself. \nThink about it like this. With lots of people on one side, as well as regeneration from a full hunger bar slowly healing each player (and health potions), the whole army in general is almost continuously regaining &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. (If your army's &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar isn't full, you shouldn't be in a battle!) Since all the opponent's damage is not placed in a concentrated area, every person alive is in a sense helping heal others. When someone dies, their regeneration and health is lost. So is their ability to fight, and the formation they were in is weakened, so momentum in terms of a steady advance is lost. Therefore, minimal life loss is the goal throughout the battle.\nThere are three major melee builds, which will be discussed more in depth later. They are:\nIt is tempting in an organized battle to do one of two things:\nCharging the enemy is a waste of time and durability due to damage distribution. It is also near-suicidal due to the large number of weapons present. Running wastes time as well and is both cowardly and counterproductive, as then damage distribution will be far less useful.\nInstead, have all your soldiers in a group and have a continuously switching front line.\nThe first situation is if the enemy has large numbers of archers. Send a wave of soldiers charging in, with moderate armor, a few Instant Damage II potions, and some skill. Even better, get some enderpearls and rush in to engage the archers, who will often be weaker in melee combat.\nIf they don't have archers, they will run or charge. If they run, have archers retreat to the back lines and then have the whole army sprint, bunching Juggernauts close to the front line while staying together, for maximum impact.\nIf they charge, stop their forward momentum with arrows, shooting when they are 10\u201315 meters away. Then the infantry should then fight for a bit, while juggernauts and potion lobbers move in at sprinting speed to surge into enemy lines and later replace the infantry and slaughter anyone that was engaging the infantry. Make sure that the juggernauts and potion lobbers do this carefully, as the enemy infantry may have lethal potions.\nHowever, in general, the enemy can do little versus Juggernauts and potion lobbers coming in from a flank as well as a defensive row of Exotics to stop enemy Juggernauts from advancing effectively.\nHowever, if you are on the attack, there are some threats to your advance you must take into account.\nThen charge with infantry, followed immediately by exotics. The juggernauts among you should flank around and smash the enemy infantry after a few seconds of fighting. The Exotics should only engage juggernauts in combat, and only with superior numbers. In this situation, have archers aim for infantry advancing toward the fight, NOT the enemy front line, where you could shoot one of your own men. One can make some professional charging units with horses.\nNever have everyone charge at once. They will lose momentum and a solid position, while also becoming less cohesive which causes less damage distribution. Retreat, while also dangerous, is far safer.\nIf possible, lure a charged creeper at them to blow them up and inflict very high damage. Best to do on hard. Use the wither to distract them and retreat quickly or the wither will kill you too.\nA suggested tactic for a mass-team retreat on servers running Java 1.9+ versions: if you happen to be attacking as a juggernaut, take precautions in case of a forced retreat from battle, by bringing 1 stack obsidian, an efficiency IV+ diamond pickaxe, and end crystals, at least a dozen or so (if you don't have resources for juggernauts, just bring iron armor, 2 end crystals, and 4 obsidian blocks for a suicide-bomb version). First, get everybody around to retreat, now get your juggernauts and yourself to slow down the retreat by placing obsidian around them, one block above their feet. This often fools enemies into thinking the person's trapped, for one, and if they get close, place down the end crystal on the elevated obsidian, and fire in the hole! The explosion would easily kill off the peons chasing your team in iron, and likely even enemy juggernauts in protection IV if the difficulty is set on hard. \nFor maximum damage and a near-foolproof way to kill, wait for any enemy juggernauts near the vicinity to jump (either to critically hit you or because they couldn't hit you without standing on one of the obsidian blocks and attacking below) then place and detonate 2-3 crystals in quick succession. \nThis is because a player's feet is much more susceptible to explosion damage, and even if someone uses an enchanted golden apple with full blast Protection 4, three point-blank end crystals would still be a guaranteed death. You'll take some recoil damage from this, but as long as your feet are below the crystals, the amount you take is minuscule to the amount you &amp; your juggernauts dish out, buying your allies time to retreat and wasting the enemies far more resources, sometimes even forcing them to retreat as well. \nIn some cases, If they shoot at you or are rushing you without jumping, dig down, and place obsidian around you. Then get ready to crystal the top. If they dig down and try to mine through the obsidian or you're about to run out of end crystals, mine further down and block off the top. Since obsidian takes so long to mine, this strategy would likely last you long enough that the combat tag would expire and you'll be able to /home, which on most servers, takes idling for 5-10 seconds. Note while this is extremely effective in open battlefields, this isn't as effective in enemy bases, even if the floor is made of obsidian, as oftentimes, it'll be a flat floor which means you'll take just as much damage as your enemies.\nMany people think \"Minecraft\" PvP is \"just clicking with a sword\", yet it is so much more than that. Learning how to PvP may seem simple, but takes days, weeks, even months to completely master PvP.\nGetting killed? With this guide and some practice, you will be killing diamond people with iron! First off. Swords are everything. Kill your enemy, and they won't hurt you anymore. Unless you are a tank and have some kind of lucky-level-30-enchanted sword, always remember that swords will save your life any day.\nA stone sword will do 1 full heart of damage against it with no buffs. A critical hit with a diamond sword will do of damage, and if that is Sharpness I then it will do of damage.\nNow that we have described all armor, we will now give you a guide on how to PvP.\nour \nIf you see a strong enemy heading for you, if you have one, drink a Potion of Strength II. As of \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.6.1&lt;/a&gt;, they increase your damage by a whopping 260%! Even if they have full Protection IV and you have Sharpness III, you still stand a chance because you do damage every hit! Note that can only be obtained by critically hitting. If the server has a plugin that shows the health of the enemy, even better!\nPractice all the time with a sword against other players, if they allow you, or do it on LAN. Bows are not as useful at close range, depending on the skill of the player, medium-long is usually best. Jumping while shooting while fighting other archers will decrease the chance of getting hit, but only do this if your skill in aiming is good.\nAlways keep splash potions of Speed II in your hotbar. If you get a hit on your opponent, best with a knockback sword, you can throw the potion (make sure your enemy(s) get as little or none of the potions at all), and start running for your life. This can also be used against someone that loves to run. Remember! You should never jump while sprinting if you have Speed 2! (Jumping too much will cause you to not be able to take advantage of the Speed potion\".\nIf you are in water, always go under your opponent! Be sure not to drown, though. This also applies when you're trying to hit someone and they're up on a mountain! That way, unless they are cheating, you will easily be able to knock them up on the mountain, plus your hits will make them unable to sprint, due to the fact that they are hit against a block. In water fights, you should always keep lily pads and jump off one while looking down and holding right click, so the lily pad will be placed right when you are about to hit the water, and so you will basically be able to walk on water. This works if you want to run, or if your opponent is running, because in water, your speed is so low and the knockback is so high that you will only be able to get 2-4 hits on them before they are 10 blocks away. Note that ping affects this.\nIf you are somewhere where strafing is impossible and you are not in water or hitting someone up a mountain, then jump, hit, and block at the same time. Spam the right and left click buttons at the same time. This will make you take a lot less damage while still dealing good damage to your opponent.\nIf you are on a mountain and someone is repeatedly hitting you, you should jump over them, and then they will be at a higher elevation, so the fight will be turned in your favor.\nIf you are in water and someone is under you, wait until you get knocked back, when you do you have time to go down in the water, and then you will be at a lower elevation and the fight is turned in your favor. Be sure not to drown though!\nOn flat ground, you should always sprint after one second of getting hit, if possible. This will eliminate the possibility of the sprint glitch. Note that since &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7-pre\"&gt;Java Edition 1.7-pre&lt;/a&gt;, you can press to sprint. When sprinting, you will do major knockback, and this will allow you to get free hits on your enemy.\nSniping and using a bow can be difficult for some but for others it's their natural talent. Some people have many styles of shooting such as jumping and shooting, aiming upwards and strafing to the right/left or by simply hammering people with spam shots.\nIn order for you to support your team as an archer/sniper you need:\nAlso, it is recommended that you strafe from left to right when shooting and you should also know when the right time it is to shoot another person. A good scenario is that your in battle with another person, and they're a good few blocks away cocking their bow up and you just started charging your own, what do you do? Well, first of all, you release it halfway there then strafe so that when they shoot, you have the advantage of shooting back at them dealing more damage to the enemy. To hit moving enemies, lead the arrow ahead of them some blocks depending on their distance.\nSniping is attempting to hit targets at long range with a bow. Done well, sniping can deplete an enemy's health or knock them off a cliff before they even notice you, or at least before they're upon you.\nWhen using a bow at short range, there is no need to aim significantly up.\nAt 1 degree upward, a bow will hit anyone within 25 meters with over a 90% probability of hit.\nAt further ranges, the level of precision needed to have a good hit rate increases. It is still possible to achieve hit rates close to 90% out to 60 meters, with a pitch of around 10 degrees. However, it is necessary to accurately estimate the range of the target. For example, an 8-degree pitch shot will hit a target between about 47 and 52 meters out with 90% accuracy, or about 46 to 54 with 50% accuracy. This means that judging distance accurately should be a reflexive habit for anyone who wants to learn sniping archery. Being able to, in a split second, figure out the range of a target, the height, and the approximate angle needed to hit (hint: F3 menu helps) will allow you to make shots at truly vast distances, with a 37-degree angle putting shots to around 120 meters.\nIf you want a mathematical formula as a guideline that will work fairly well under 80 meters.\nAim 1 degree up for every 4 blocks away your target is over 18 on level ground, compensating for movement appropriately. So for example, to hit a target 50 meters away, aim up by 8 degrees. 62 meters away, aim up by 11 degrees. 74 meters away, 14 degrees.\nSo codice_1.\nAnother good thing to do is keep in mind the target's horizontal angle. This allows you to make shots confident that the target is horizontally at the right position. Further, learning to judge distance is valuable. As a rule of thumb, a block at 60 meters away is 1 degree tall. A player at 60 meters away is about 1.8 degrees tall.\nSo for ex, let's say you see a player you want dead and they're at your altitude: the procedure a good sniper will go through is as follows.\nIf a player is higher than you, a simple way of compensating is to look them in the face and set that as your zero. This works for relatively flat shots that aren't at an enormous range. For example, let's say we look at a player 9 degrees above us who's 1.8 degrees tall? They appear to be 60 meters away based on their height. 60-18=42. 42/4=10.5. 19.5 degrees pitch is a good approximation of where to aim. I wouldn't try this method for targets more than about 30 degrees off of level, and not for very long range shots, but for under 70 meters and 30 degrees, it works quite reasonably.\nObviously, you don't need to do a bunch of math every time you fire a bow, but these rules of thumb can help you aim at a long range.\nMany people who shoot have developed their own style of shooting such as:\nPeople who strafe just simply move in one direction while shooting the target and occasionally take cover when getting pinned down. So when shooting you have to aim slightly above your target's head before shooting for a larger hit rate. In extended combat, opponents may be able to read your strafing patterns if you move predictably, so be sure to vary your strafing.\nSpam shooting is being very close to a charging target and lightly cocking the bow and shooting the target. This is a risky style you can do but the risk fades if you shoot the target off a high place like a cliff. Note that when encountering another spam shooter, you have to strafe to avoid getting hit by it. Another easy way to kill a spam shooter is to sprint, then jump, this takes advantage of the fact that you can't be hit while your character turns red, and are immune to damage in that short time. This will be more than enough time to spam-click the person to death (however, this is ineffective and it was proven on actual PVP servers).\nWhile most of your allies are fighting the enemy melee (better if there aren't many troops on each side), the classic styled sniper (which have very powerful bows) can fire a precise shot which will do good damage while the enemy cannot retaliate much due to your allies attacking them with a sword. Be sure not to hit the ally though. One may drink invisibility potions so even if the enemy noticed the shot and want to hit the sniper first, they cannot shoot the sniper.\nNote that arrows can also activate wooden buttons or pressure plates, thus making good archers able to operate redstone contraptions from afar.\nServer War.\nThis is a rather rare type of PvP. It is not friendly at all. It is just like a real war. Two parties fight for power or resources on a server.\nServer Wars happen when one party, typically griefers, organize into an army and invade or attack a certain area or group of people on a server.\nThis attacking party is typically very organized and very well armed. They launch an attack big enough to cause a disturbance on the server. Another party, typically admins, retaliates against this attack. If the retaliating party is composed of admins, it will typically resort to Intel and the power to ban players. However, admins will counterattack with weapons in the process of banning the attacking players. Unless they allow griefing of course.\nIn an all out server war, you have two choices: you can either fight for one of the two parties, or you can flee to safety and let the admins sort it out.\nMost players decide to fight for their server, however, players who have a lot of resources like diamond might feel the need to protect their precious resources and flee to safety. If you decide to join the party that is defending the server, you don't really need to worry about firepower since you will probably be armed by fellow soldiers.\nIf you join the attacking party, you should equip enchanted weapons with high damage. It is also good to equip weapons of mass destruction such as TNT, end crystals, lava buckets, etc. You should do everything in your power to keep your nametag hidden if you don't want to be banned. Being banned means you are out of the server, and out of the war. You can no longer fight alongside your comrades. \nWhen you are fighting with the attacking party, you typically want to destroy as much as possible and invade as much of the server as you can. A good tip? Drink an invisibility potion, arm yourself with end crystals and blast protection armor, and let the terrorist bombings commence on anyone you see, especially the ones that are insecure.\nRemember, the retaliating party doesn't always win even though they seem like the \"underdogs\". Server wars are won with great soldiers, and most importantly, great leaders. You don't have to be a \"grizzled\" war veteran to be a great general, a great general is someone who is smart and fights alongside their soldiers. Remember, great generals take point, they don't watch from a safe distance and bark orders while watching their fellow players get slaughtered.\nAlso, if the server has mods equipped, especially mods like \"flans mod\", \"flintlock weapons mod\", or \"Mo' explosives mod\", use that to your advantage!\nBecause of the nature and the danger of these wars, the mechanics of these \"groups\" of people that are attempting to overthrow the server will be explained. \nGenerally, the group may know each-other personally. If three friends chose to do this, and each friend tells two of their friends, then we already have nine people ready to attack. Doing this makes it easier to create order and hierarchy. This is also done to deter any traitors or turncoats in the group. Some of these groups go into faction servers, claim land, and make a legitimate faction. They will probably use the faction as a temporary \"bank\" for what they steal and make. They will build a secondary base, and will use this when they attack. They are highly armed, and are equipped with heavy enchants, potions, lava buckets, redstone, TNT, and whatever the Modifications on the server make available. They disband the faction, and move to the other base and create a new faction, (if they make one at all) and begin their attack, or they may each stay factionless (to avoid detection) and cause great destruction to large bases using the exploits above, communicating attacks via a third-party social platform.\nThere is a hierarchy involving the status and rank of the players usually, there are generals of the troops that go to battle. They are on the battlefield. And they command the players to attack. But these generals get their orders from one player. This player is the equivalent to the \"god father\". They are never seen, although sometimes in the game anonymously.\nSeveral of these groups have primarily PvP champs, but most of them have hackers, x-rayers, cheat mods, and whatever they chose. Most times the hacker is the godfather or at least very close to the top. They also have spies and intel groups. This is not the most usual case, but there are exceptions. \nSome of them have strategies that they commonly use. Some are griefing, personal raids, and singling out a player. For example, if they know that a player has valuables (diamonds, enchanted books, etc.) and they don't know where it is hidden, they may grief and threaten the player.\nPvP Behind The Scenes.\nPlayer-against-player combat is far more advanced than it may look. With it said, it's best to know what people can encounter in a so-called \"behind the scenes\" stage.\nPolitics.\nIf you want griefers or spawn killers on your side, be really nice to them. Most of them are notoriously good at PvP from practice, and giving them a reason to be on your side through making sure they never have to worry about starving or being hunted by others is a good way to avoid alienating them. Ironically, this may be the most effective way to make allies with random people, giving them full access to all of your resources and your considerable efforts to be hospitable will generally remove any want to take your items. (As always, this may backfire).\nIf a server has an online dynamic map or if the Rei's Minimap mod is allowed (most likely), USE THEM. Rei's Minimap helps you understand what structures are ahead of you, and Online maps show everything and also show locations of players. Forgo any advantage you can get your hands on.\nWhether it'd be a Drop Party or an organized PvP match, participate in server events and you'll be known by most members in the server. This means people will have second thoughts of attempting to kill you.\nThis one is obvious. Make sure to be friendly and caring with your members. Give items randomly to the squadron. Make an Army, Navy, and Air Force if you must, but let them mingle. Give crate keys to your teammates if the server has a crate system. And make sure to not act stuck up. Listen to their opinions. If you want a Mega-Uber Skull Laser Chainsaw Castle of Death\u2122, and your friend wants a smaller base, compromise.\nLet's say you're on a faction server and you have many enemies. Your base has not been found until now. Two players each holding a Sharpness V, Fire Aspect II, Knockback II sword and wearing Protection IV armor are directly outside your base setting up a TNT cannon.\nYou should always have defenses that are innately active, such as obsidian and water to negate explosions and if available, a spawner that can funnel out mobs on command (go exploring for spawners) to distract and dangerously deter, or snow golems to break armor.\nIf you have these, don't jump down and PvP. Wait for the spawning mobs to break their armor, or call for your faction members and allies to assist in defeating the enemy.\nIn these cases, booby traps are good, so set up booby traps everywhere where the enemy can't find them. In fact, make some that are meant to make the enemy know about the traps but it itself is a trap. These work as warnings and signals. Use tripwires and wool under them to use as signals for example.\nIf you're building a massive fortress near the spawn, a griefer or simply a plain idiot might run behind you and kill you, disassemble your fortress and run off with your materials. Well, the easiest method to prevent this is to build your house away from spawn and try to survive a good distance away from spawn. It is usually a good idea to use the /sethome command around this area where you wish to live, as if it is a long way away from spawn and you die, it's a long walk, or mad chase if there are spawnkillers with diamond armor and enchanted diamond swords. Using the /home command if you used /sethome cuts the time getting to your safe zone drastically, usually having the spawnkillers and griefers be dazzled in confusion.\nThe best way to keep your most precious valuables is to put them in an ender chest. Then put a chest in your house with basic invaluable items in it (with a few valuables mixed in to help fool them), and bury a chest with 8 obsidian, an eye of ender, a crafting table, and other less semi-valued objects in it a short way away from your house.\nEven if your entire house is a crater and the ender chest you placed is destroyed, the chest you buried will still be safe, and you can craft an Ender chest with what is in it to access all your valuable items and loot in there, as well as the loot in your actual chest.\nBasic PvP supply setup.\nThe following is a step-by-step tutorial on how to survive while being new to a PvP server. Follow in this order:\nTip: You must have a fallback in your base in the case of hard times. This means:\n-Note to do this when only a few people are online to make sure that nobody else is there to make you enemy (if you're lucky).\nThat's it! Not too long ahead, you should become good enough to last through most attacks... eventually.\nGetting Loot Quickly.\nA lot of times in single player survival \"Minecraft\", you are going to need something. In factions, you are going to need it a lot more because you are competing with other people for it. Some ways to get it faster:\nPvP Itself-The Foreground.\nLag creates opportunities.\nDespite lag making people randomly visually act, cause injury because of damage just showing up, and crash the server, it may still be useful instead of a nuisance if you know how to control it to your advantage. Whenever you hit someone under the effects of a lag spike, there is a chance that they won't be hurt and can escape. You can use this time to run when a lag spike comes, therefore you may escape if necessary. Keep in mind, lag also delays redstone machinery, meaning if there's a staircase that only activates when you're on a pressure plate, you can get up easier.\nExploit Knockback.\nMost servers have anti-flying plugins installed to prevent hacking users. If your server has one, \"use it!\" Spamming hits from a Knockback II sword will send your enemy flying fast enough to trick the server into counting them as flying, so that they will be immediately kicked (possibly banned) from the server. If there is a combat logging plugin as well, all the better! Your opponent will drop whatever loot was in their inventory for your enjoyment. Though you can be banned from many servers from exploiting any server side anti-cheat programs.\nMistakes.\nAmbushing someone is good. It's even better when they turn around to attack you with the wrong item! (e.g. food or blocks) This makes an easy kill. Take this advantage. And try to make sure this does not happen to you. If it does, it can cost you everything you have on hand!\nWeapon training.\nAlways carry potions of damage and poison on you. You'll never know whether you're fighting a player with a stone sword in gold armor with minimal enchantments or if you're face to face with a full armed juggernaut carrying what people consider as \"God Equipment.\" This is the most efficient way of disposing of anybody.\nYou may be a fast clicker with a powerful sword and you may have a large chest's worth of damage potions, but without training these aren't of any use. Train yourself to arch with a regular and enchanted bow so that you are so good at it that people accuse you of having an aimbot (don't shoot people constantly or you might get banned mistakenly). Get it in your mind to strafe around the enemy and jump to get critical hits and get an edge over your opponent. Train to throw potions so well that you don't wound yourself and get direct hits for maximum effectiveness.\nYou see a player mining some diamonds, and the only weapon they have is a bow. You decide to kill them. It seems like a great idea, especially when you have armor, until you get close to them and they start rapidly shooting arrows. Some players have an uncanny ability to shoot arrows \"very\" fast at low charge. They may only deal 1/2 heart of damage, but they will knock you back, and enough of them will kill you. If someone starts using this tactic on you, \"do not rush them!\" It will most likely lead to your death. Fall back behind some cover, and if you have a bow, start shooting back at them. Stay far away, because while they are amazing at close range, they usually aren't very good at hitting those far shots (there are exceptions). Finally, Almost no amount of spam shots can stop a sprint-jump attack, Ender pearl charge or splash potion, so if ranged combat is not your strong suit either, hit them with a critical attack or potion, this will usually cause them to run, then be slaughtered by your melee strikes. Remember though; you could do this as a tactic too!\nWho says you need \"normal\" weapons to beat a strong enemy? Nobody, that's who! The truth is, using weapons that your enemy doesn't even think about will make you more probable to beat your enemy. If you know how to use them, that is. For instance, if you are fighting a juggernaut, there are few weapons usable against them;\nPotions harm and distort the enemy, making them the most effective against especially such people with Protection IV armor. There is no magical protection in vanilla, so armor points are useless. Snowballs and eggs will knock the enemy back. You can project them into lava or a pit, and as part of a bug in the game, it damages armor as well because it technically harms the player pummeled by it. Always try to find a way around normality!\nGood Philosophy for Fights.\nThere is that one case of being Left for Green. This means that your squad disbanded, you are out, all alone with maybe a few enemies a kilometer or two behind you looking for you, and you're starving. Be independent. What if nobody is there stupid to help you? What if your leader takes all the valuables and leaves their troops out to die? You must gather resources, get help of any kind, whether it be a lone man just with a stone toolkit or a juggernaut in Protection IV armor, and you must be careful and start your own faction. Tip: Since anyone can be bought\u2026eventually, keep your own secret, hidden, well guarded bases. \"Never\" tell anyone about it. It is for you and only you.\nThe most iffy is skill. Some people are so good with their timing that they can calmly mine and take their diamond ore, then swing around and shoot just as soon as you are within a block of them!\nIn fact, who says you need better equipment to win? Let's say that your base is in the sky with a public chest containing some equipment. Then, all of a sudden, you come down with one teammate and realize that the base is being raided! In the chest, you find some string and cobblestone. The enemies are in iron armor, but enchantments are unknown due to this being before the 1.3 update. Now, if the raider's armor was not enchanted, then you're in luck. A stone sword against iron armor with no buffs deals a full heart of damage. A fully charged bow does about as much damage as a diamond sword. Even if you have no armor, you still somewhat stand a chance against those two since it's you and your teammate fighting them. You do not need to be the same size as long as you can beat them. If you and your teammate are strategic, let's say they stick together, and your enemy doesn't, then you are almost guaranteed to kill them, that is if both of you have at least stone swords and they are alone with an iron sword and full iron armor. If you got lucky enough to mine a diamond sword, bring that out too: if you can, enchant with even just Sharpness I, which will do about hearts every hit. If you somehow have gotten a Strength II potion, maybe by buying it on a server, then DRINK IT! It will multiply your damage by 3.6, so that , if you make that a critical hit (by falling when attacking) (will do hearts) WITH Strength II, then you just might have killed your opponent in one or two hits.\nYou may be thinking that people who have lost so much that their anger is uncontrollable are going to go psycho to win and when people come with supreme equipment you should be scared out of your wits, since that \"causes\" adrenaline. \"No!\" Anger and fear are both factors to defeat. When either happens, whether it be an attempt to kill a player who has diamond armor with your fists or combat logging just because you are so scared that you have to go to the bathroom of fear of peeing in your pants, you will most likely forget all the tips you have learned until you get back to your senses. Avoid that. Now, you must stay calm. Run for cover, and don't stop to watch the deaths of your teammates. If you have one, drink a Potion of Swiftness (the second tier is highly recommended), and keep running. Do not turn back, do not look back, do think of what's back there, and do not stop. Just keep running until you reach safety, whether it be allied or peaceful territory, or a secret place. Don't stop. Stay sharp.\nRemember what's been said about not trusting anyone? Your turn to chip in to take a stab at backstabbing. Create peaceful factions for your team. Their only purpose is to earn supplies while being impossible to touch.\nIf two players in diamond with enchantments come and raid your base, and you're 4 people in iron, and only you have a full set of diamond equipment, \"do not bring it out!\" It is obvious you don't stand much chance as you are overpowered. You do, however, need to keep potions. They should consist of the following:\nAlso, keep flint and steel, along with fire aspect swords and bows, along with you. And if you find generation errors that create gateways to the Void, use them. Don't forget to keep your dispensers loaded and ready to fire with arrows, damage splash potions, and fire charges. The reason why this equipment and these traps can beat people in diamond is because they go right through their armor. Nothing, not even diamond armor, can resist their effects (except for arrows. Fire, potion effects and Void damage are the only lethal things unaffected no matter what kind of armor.). Also, a potion of invisibility will mean no one will know where you are attacking from!\nAlso, remember the gift of decoys. Say you have nothing at all and you were just a player that started in a faction war faction. Use your expendable condition. Say there is a hall of traps designed by a redstone scientist. Throw yourself at the traps, run like a madman, break those hidden redstone clocks, and just kill your player on those lethal traps so your faction can zip in and break a hole in their obsidian shield. To victory!\nOn some servers, the PVP can take place in real life, as well. If you have many friends who play \"Minecraft\", you can call them to join your (allied) faction, which will make strength in numbers. If one of your friends is good at persuading or knows a lot about strategy, that's even better! Also, if you know your in-game enemy well in real life, you can somehow reduce the time they can play or have a talk with them, so they may have a change of heart.\nNo matter how your opponent fights, they are bound to have \"some\" kind of weakness. Wastefully attacking where they are well defended won't work, and you will usually have to change your plan accordingly. Is he trying to use redstone? Douse it with water. Debuffing you with splash potions? Chug some milk. Shielding your arrows and tridents? Whip out the Piercing enchantment. Not even the heavily-geared Netherite player is invincible - you can bypass his armor with splash potions and tipped arrows. This also brings to the next point:\nJust as you adapt to your opponent's tactics, your opponent will adapt to your tactics. If you see your opponent change his actions, think about why he is doing that. Don't rashly play into his hands. If your opponent just placed blocks to stop you from shooting him, \"stop shooting him and attack up close\". Just as your opponent counters your actions, you need to counter his actions. Your plan of bypassing his Protection IV Netherite Armor with tipped arrows may be a sound plan, but if he starts holding down his shield, you'll have to change. If you, say, start shooting with your Piercing Crossbow then you're golden. As long as you are devising and implementing counters to your opponent's counterplay, then until your opponent figures out what to do in response, you have the advantage and you should press it. The longer one plays reactively rather than proactively, the more of a disadvantage they are at.\nTrick the enemy.\nIt is said above regarding running in traps (refer to \"Diamonds aren't the key to victory\") being a tactic that will fool the enemy, this makes it a rather effective attack. Always use psychology as a weapon! When running into a row of tripwires, the enemy might find it as a suicide attempt and not as a double trap, although not very likely since most people will tend to just chase you. However, if you have a circuit that makes it so that the first time somebody runs through it, there is a chance your enemy may think that it's a dud or just a scare for the raiders. Once they step over it, though, the trap activates. This makes it useful since it can make the enemy think you are intending to run away when you're instead luring them into a death trap. If you have any type of invisibility potion or maybe you are just very good at not being noticed, you can easily lure the enemy away from your actual position, then jump-attack them when they are least expecting it. This can be the key to a neck-and-neck battle, where your enemy's equipment is as good as yours."}

If you want to make Minecraft portable for an older launcher version, please view &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Playing%20and%20saving%20Minecraft%20on%20a%20thumb%20drive%20with%20the%20old%20launcher\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; page instead. \nThis tutorial explains how to run Minecraft on a portable location (e.g. on a thumb drive). Portable installation is, an installation that is not \"integrated\" with the computer, which is useful for managing multiple installations and generally keeping things organised. This is useful if you want to retain your game data (launcher profiles, worlds, resource packs, etc.) when switching computers. \nIf you are not planning to play Minecraft on a thumb drive but on your main hard drive instead, it's highly recommended for you to make the game portable with this guide because this will give you some big advantages over standard installation. If you store different Minecraft versions (1.8, 1.12, modded 1.12, modded 1.7.10, latest, etc.) in one folder/launcher instance, mods/worlds/settings from other versions may conflict with version you are currently playing. If you want to separate them on standard installation, you will have to also keep each folder of each version in codice_1 and rename them every time you want to change version you are currently playing. On portable installation only a folder and launcher script file is needed to be created and after following this guide you can just play selected version just by double-clicking on its script file. \nNote: After this guide the game will be only 99% portable: the game data will be stored and used by game and its launcher where you want but launcher will create &lt;a href=\".minecraft\"&gt;codice_2&lt;/a&gt; anyway and will be placing there (just only) its log files (like update logs, logs with game messages and crashes, etc.) If you really care about it, you can combine this guide with &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Playing%20and%20saving%20Minecraft%20on%20a%20thumb%20drive%20with%20the%20old%20launcher\"&gt;the guide for the old launcher&lt;/a&gt;: the game will create &lt;a href=\".minecraft\"&gt;codice_2&lt;/a&gt; if it doesn't exist anyway but will just leave it empty[unverified]. \nInstructions (for Windows).\nNote: The following Windows tutorial will guide you through installing the game to codice_4. However, this guide can be used to install the game to any directory. When following this guide, replace this directory with the directory you actually want to install the game to. Please also note that while this guide was written for Windows, it is still largely applicable to other operating systems with minor changes.\nNavigate to the portable drive in the file explorer, and create the codice_4 directory. Next, create codice_6 folder for launcher with its data and codice_7 folder (or another name of your choosing) for game data.\nIf you have existing game data, you can move it to the desired directory. Navigate to the codice_8 folder and copy all of its contents (but not the folder itself) into codice_9.\nNow you need to move the launcher. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.minecraft.net/download/alternative\"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; codice_10 (if you don't have it) and move it to codice_11.\nCreate an empty text file called codice_12 (or another name of your choosing) in the codice_4 directory.\nOpen the batch file with notepad or another text editor and paste the following text into it before saving the file:\n@echo off\nstart \"\" \"%cd%\\Launcher\\Minecraft.exe\" --workDir \"%cd%\\MyMinecraft\"\nEverything is now finished. When you want to play, just use the batch file to launch the game. Do not start the launcher directly (without using the batch file), or the game will just use the default directory in codice_14 as its working directory. It is recommended to set the launcher's executable to have the \"hidden\" attribute to avoid accidentally running it. You could also make a shortcut on the Desktop to run the bat file without having to find it.\nInstructions (for Linux).\nNote: The following tutorial assumes that the USB disk is located (and mounted) at codice_15, and that you would like to have portable Minecraft at codice_16. However, this guide can be used to install the game to any directory. When following this guide, replace this directory with the directory you actually want to install the game to.\nImportant preparation: You need to make sure that you have correct java version installed because linux launcher doesn't have its own java. If you want to play Minecraft versions less than 1.13, you should have Java 8 installed and selected as default in your system because Minecraft versions earlier than 1.13 don't support Java 11, they will just simply crash at launch.\nDepending on the GNU/Linux disro commands may vary.\nFirstly, check which version of java is currently used in your system:\ncodice_17\nIf your java(or openjdk, doesn't matter) version in the first output line doesn't look like codice_18 (but instead looks like codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, etc.), it means that Java 8 isn't installed or selected as default on your system.\nSecondly, install Java 8 package on your system (depending on the distro the package name can be codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, codice_26, etc.) via terminal or graphical package manager. If your distro repositories don't have Java 8 package, maybe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//stackoverflow.com/questions/57031649/how-to-install-openjdk-8-jdk-on-debian-10-buster\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; can help.\nFinally, run the following command and select the path containing previously installed Java 8 package name:\ncodice_27\nNow, you are ready to install the game.\nStart by creating directory for the game:\ncodice_28\ncodice_29\nNext, create codice_30 folder (or another name of your choosing) for your Minecraft game data:\ncodice_31 \nNow, at this point, if you would like to copy all your existing game data, run the following command:\ncodice_32\nYou now need to download the Minecraft Launcher. Do so by running the following command:\ncodice_33\nNext, extract the codice_34 folder by using your favourite extraction utility. This tutorial assumes the extracted folder is located in codice_16.\nAll the basic setup is completed. You will find the launcher at codice_36\nTo open the launcher correctly, you can run the following command:\ncodice_37\nBut the better way is to use a shell script and run it when you want to play Minecraft. Create empty file called codice_38 (or another name of your choosing) with the following text:\n\"$(dirname \"$(readlink -f \"$0\")\")\"/minecraft-launcher/minecraft-launcher -w \"$(dirname \"$(readlink -f \"$0\")\")\"/myminecraft\nThen make it executable:\ncodice_39"}

You survive by yourself and your only friends are the animals that you will probably cook for food! Yet you might want to roam the world with friends. Just experience it with other players and more mobs\nJoining a Server.\nHow to get a server\nPossible errors.\nThings will go wrong at some point, so here are some error messages and what they mean. These messages might appear when you click Join Server:\n\"Disconnected by server. Outdated server!\" \"or\" \"Disconnected by server. Outdated client!\".\nIf \"Minecraft\" updated recently, you might get these error messages. They mean that you are running a different version than the server. You can only connect to servers with the same &lt;a href=\"protocol%20version\"&gt;protocol version&lt;/a&gt; as your client. You can create a new profile in the launcher with the version the server is running or you will have to wait for the server to update, that may take more or less time depending of the server owners' reactivity.\n\"You are not whitelisted on this server!\".\nSome servers enable a whitelist system to prevent others from joining - usually, to be whitelisted, you have to ask on some external website, usually where you found the server.\n\"You are banned from this server!\".\nYour account or your IP got banned from the server. To be un banned from a server, you need to take contact with an administrator of the server, and request to be unbanned. If it's a server you have never heard of you may have been IP banned meaning your IP address was blocked.\n\"Disconnected by Server. Invalid session (Try restarting your game)\".\nWhen you log in to \"Minecraft\" you get a session ID which the Mojang servers keeps track of. Only the one with the latest session ID for your account are allowed to join servers (which have online mode on). Do as the message says and restart your game. You can't join a server if you use a cracked &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20launcher\"&gt;Minecraft launcher&lt;/a&gt; unless the server has set its properties to codice_1.\n\"Cannot connect to server\".\nThis appears next to the list of servers. This means you couldn't reach to the server at all. The server might be down, you may not have an internet connection, or the server didn't respond in time (because of lag).\n\"Cannot resolve hostname\".\nThis appears next to the list of servers. This means that there is no server with that name. Check the address and try again.\nThis sometimes happens when the server was shown as online to you sometime ago, but when you look at the server list again, it would be in the list but offline.\n\"End of stream\".\nThis may happen if you try to connect too rapidly to a server; disconnect, wait a bit and try to reconnect, it should work.\n\"The authentication servers are currently down for maintenance.\".\nThe server that Minecraft uses to check your session ID are currently down. You can check the current status at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//help.minecraft.net/\"&gt;help.minecraft.net&lt;/a&gt; under \"Service Statuses\"\nJava error, such as codice_2: An error message.\nThis might be different depending on the error message. Search the web for others with the same problem, and you might find a solution.\n\"Buffer overflow\".\nCheck for information.\nWhat happens on the server.\nMultiple archetypes of Minecraft servers exist, distinguished by the unique gameplay features, rules, and societal structures which they implement. No two servers are the same, and frequently the line between archetypes is blurred or indistinguishable. Many special types of servers rely on modded versions of the server software, such as . Modded server software is not supported by &lt;a href=\"Mojang\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt;. Bukkit (and other modified server software) servers may have plugins that modify the experience from the vanilla server. If on a bukkit server, one can type \"/plugins\". You can then do research on what the plugins do.\nIf you are having a slow device, you may encounter a huge lag strike upon entering the server. Lag happens when there are too many moving beings on the server, and the computer is not advanced enough to calculate lots of movements at once. Lag happens more often when two (or more) players are far apart from each other. The computer only \"cares about\" the chunks around you, but not those far away, so forcing the computer to load in separate far locations can mean lag.\nFor a list of common server types, go to the &lt;a href=\"Server%23Types%20of%20servers\"&gt;Server page&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is true for the unmodified server software:"}

The bug was incredibly overpowered as potions are intended to be somewhat of a rare item and also only have one use per bottle. This bug simply allowed the user to bypass the original intention for potions; hence the patch.\nPotion farming is a way to get infinite potion using water, dripstones, and cauldrons filled with potions. The concept is very similar to lava farming, with a cauldron, a stalactite dripstone a block above the cauldron which is connected to a block with a water source over it. However, you need to place 1 potion of the one you want to farm into the cauldron (you can also do this with splash or lingering potions). Then you will need to wait in the area and once the cauldron becomes 2 or 3 high, harvest it with glass bottle(s) until it is only 1 high again. If you used a splash or lingering potion then when you pick it up with the glass bottle it will turn into a splash/lingering potion."}

Place as many cauldrons as desired. Remember that in Bedrock Edition powder snow accumulates much faster than in Java Edition, so you will need fewer cauldrons. Now afk until snowing, and once the snow level in the cauldrons reach the top, you can harvest it using buckets. Make sure there is no solid blocks over the cauldrons."}
{"id": "89386", "revid": "27010889", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=89386", "title": "Tutorials/Printing", "text": "This tutorial seeks to show you how to make a printer using &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;. You can impress your friends with it, by making some type of structure automatically, without having to place the blocks down.\nThe Basic Mechanics.\nThe idea of a printer is to input colors into a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, put it through a block sorter, and then have a block of the requested color be pushed into position using &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds simple, but it can be surprisingly complex to design.\nSnapshot 17w06a of update 1.12 brought gravity-affected &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt; blocks. It also brought &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, which forms if concrete powder touches water. Concrete powder and blocks come in all of the 16 colors that make up the color spectrum in Minecraft. By telling certain pistons what colors to drop down from a \"stock,\" it's possible for a printer and 3D printer to be built in Survival mode.\nPre-1.12.\nBefore the addition of concrete, the only way to make a printer, or a 3D printer, was to use &lt;a href=\"command%20blocks\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Spawner\"&gt;spawner minecarts&lt;/a&gt;, or ghost blocks. These designs were insanely complicated, and very difficult or impossible to make in survival mode without using cheats. See the following 2 videos for examples:\nSpawner minecart printer:\nGhost block 3D printer:\n2D Printer Designs.\nMost 2D printer designs have three basic parts: the input (a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;), the \"stock\" (several piles of &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt;), and the &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt; to create the output. A sorting system removes the items from the chest. The concrete powder that is ready to be printed is on top of extended pistons. The pistons that correspond to the colors requested retract for a long enough time to allow one concrete powder from the stack to fall onto a \"conveyor belt,\" which moves the dropped block to the printing surface. When it reaches the surface, it turns into solid concrete and is pushed into position. This is repeated until the print is complete.\nSee the videos below for a few examples of 2D printer designs:\n3D Printer Designs.\n3D printers are even more complicated to build because there are multiple layers of blocks to place. Currently, there is only one infinitely-expandable design that is possible to make in Survival mode. See the following video for a demonstration of this design:\nThe design works similarly to a real-life 3D printer that uses printing powder. Because this design uses flying machines and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, it can be expanded infinitely, but the time taken to print increases quadratically because of the way the flying machines are designed. The design is unique in that the stock can be any color. When a specific color is needed, the stock color is sent through a color-converter to get the desired color. \nIn the 3D printer, the structure is split into flat 3x6 areas. The colors and arrangements for each of these areas are put into multiple shulker boxes for ease of use. For larger prints, it makes sense to instead input the colors in the order they are interpreted. There is a \"conveyor belt\" comprised of flying machines that drops the powder on a set of synchronized flying machines to drop the powder into the printing area. By making the conveyor belt faster, the whole design can be sped up.\nSee Javamonk's video below, for a 3D printer almost the same as the previous one, but with a faster conveyor belt."}

{"id": "21192", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21192", "title": "Tutorials/Programs and editors/Tectonicus/Custom Blocks", "text": "By default Tectonicus will render all the standard Minecraft blocks, but if you're using mods that add new block types then those blocks will be skipped. By making a custom block config you can add in custom block types to Tectonicus so that maps made with your favorite mods will show correctly.\nInternally all blocks in \"Minecraft\" have a unique number, or id. You can see all of these here: &lt;a href=\"Block%20IDs\"&gt;Block IDs&lt;/a&gt;. Mods will add blocks by using block ids currently not in use - if you're a mod author then you can make a block config for others to use, or you can ask the mod author to document the new blocks and their ids.\nTutorial: Adding a simple custom block.\nFirst, you need to create a custom block file. An empty file looks like this:\nSince this is xml, the extension is usually .xml, but this is not required. We'll save this to C:/customBlockConfig.xml.\nSay you've got a mod that adds a 'cheese' block, made entirely out of hard cheese. It's a solid block (like dirt or stone) but has a yellow image on all sides. You'd add your cheese block so your config looks like this:\nThere are a few important things to notice:\nThen you need to include your custom config when drawing your map. Find your config file, and add the config to the 'layer' tags as shown (the last two attributes are the new ones):\nRender your map, and the new block should appear!\nReplacing Existing Blocks.\nIf you want to change how a regular Minecraft block looks, then you can just redefine it in your custom block. For example, if we changed the id above from 200 to 12 (the block id of sand) then all of your sand would appear as cheese.\nRemoving Existing Blocks.\nIf you *only* want custom blocks then you can set 'useDefaultBlocks' to 'false'. This means that you don't get all of the regular Minecraft blocks. You could then use this to make a config containing *only* ores (coal, iron, gold, diamonds) to get a map of where they are under ground. This config would look like this:\nThe interesting thing to note here is the texture=\"terrain[0, 2]\" bit. Minecraft block images are stored in a single big image called terrain.png (see &lt;a href=\"Texture%20pack\"&gt;Texture pack&lt;/a&gt;). Here terrain[0, 2] means use the block image from terrain.png in the first column and third row (the place where gold ore is).\nAny image may be used with [] to select a tile from it, as long as the image has the same grid size as terrain.png (i.e. 16x16). E.g.\nUsing Images From A Texture Pack.\nAs well as using images directly from your hard drive, you can use images from either Minecraft or your texture pack.\nAs with regular textures, first the texture pack is checked and if the file does not exist there then the regular minecraft jar is checked.\nDifferent Kinds Of Block.\nSo far we have only used 'Solid' blocks, like stone and dirt. You can also add differently shaped blocks if a similar one already exists in Minecraft. For example, a custom plant:\nHere the 'Plant' used instead of 'Solid' means instead of a solid block Tectonicus will draw a X with the image, like regular minecraft plants.\nFor examples of all the different kinds of block you can add, please see the default block config used by Tectonicus itself: http://www.triangularpixels.com/Tectonicus/defaultBlockConfig.xml\nSub Blocks (for mods).\nAs well as a block id all blocks have a data value. For simple blocks (like cobblestone) this is ignored. For others (like beds) it stores the direction or other extra data.\nSome blocks (particularly blocks added by mods) use the data like a secondary id. This can be used in the 'id' field.\nHere's an example for the wool blocks in regular minecraft:\nThese all have a block id of 35, but use the data to decide which color texture to use. Red wool for example has a data value of 14, so the id actually becomes id=\"35:14\".\nNote that they don't all have to be 'Solid' type blocks. You could mix any block type as you need. This is particularly handy for mods with custom blocks.\nAvailable Block Types.\nAir.\nAir blocks are empty space. Use them if you want to disable a regular minecraft block.\nSolid blocks.\nCreates a square cube like dirt or stone. May have the same image on all sides, or a different image on the top.\nOptionally may be drawn with 'alphaTest'. This doesn't draw transparent pixels (like glass or mob spawners)\nWater.\nA solid block with transparent sides and special handling to make deeper water darker.\nLog.\nA solid block with different side and top textures. Texture changes based on the block's data value."}

{"id": "14286", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14286", "title": "Tutorials/Programs and editors/Tectonicus/Mac Scripting Tutorial", "text": "Tectonicus can be scripted to run on any Linux- or BSD-based operating system, including Mac OS X. This gives the system administrator the ability to generate maps on a schedule without having to manually trigger anything.\nTwo things are required to make this happen: a script, and a crontab entry.\nExample Script.\nThe script is the actual thing that gets executed to perform the Tectonicus render. It contains the Tectonicus commands and anything else that you might want to include. The example script below triggers Tectonicus and uploads the resulting map to a web server using rsync, and also times how long each operation takes and then writes the results out to a short log file.\nFirst, here is the entire script:\nExample Script Breakdown.\nThat might look like a pretty intimidating block of text up there, especially if you've never done any scripting before, so let's dive into what each of the sections does.\nExit Status.\nThe very topmost part of the script lists the potential that the script could report when it stops running.\nAn exit status of 0 means that no errors were reported, while other numbers indicate either a failure with Tectonicus itself or a failure during rsync. These exit status numbers could be used to determine what to do next based on what failed\u2014for example, you could re-trigger Tectonicus if the script returns an exit code of 3. This script doesn't do any of that, though.\nVariables.\nThe next part of the example script sets variables that the rest of the script uses. This is done so that you can change things around (like the Tectonicus jar file or the locations of the working files) without having to edit the main part of the script.\nYou'll want to fill in your own information in each of these spots. Here's what they're for:\nLogging.\nThe first thing that the next section does is set another variable, named STARTTIME, which records the time to the second that the script starts:\nThe time is recorded in , which gives us the number of seconds elapsed since 00:00 on 1 January 1970. At the end of the script, we'll store the Unix time in another variable, which will give us the number of seconds that the entire script took to run. Just recording the seconds makes the time math a lot easier\u2014this way, we don't have to do multiple hour/minute/second conversions, since we're already working with seconds.\nNext we set up our script's log file:\nThe first thing we do is check to see if there's already a log file, and if one exists, we rename it with the mv command to the value in the LOGOLD variable. After that, a note gets placed in the log file that the old log has been backed up, and records the time that this script starts running.\nIf no old log file exists, the script makes one, and then records the time in it.\nRunning Tectonicus.\nThe next section actually starts Tectonicus and waits for it to finish rendering before moving on.\nThe first line notes in the log file the time Tectonicus actually starts, and then the next line executes Tectonicus, using the variables set in the beginning of the script to specify where the Tectonicus jar and config files live.\nThe next part, starting with the \"IF\" statement, looks at the exit status that Java spits out when it finishes. If Tectonicus runs successfully and reports no errors, then the Java process will send back an exit status of 0 when it's done. The script is watching for an exit status of anything except 0 (that's the \"if $? -ne 0\" bit\u2014if the exit code is not equal to zero), and if it sees anything except zero, it writes its own error message to the log file and terminates.\nHowever, if Java does indeed return a status of zero\u2014indicating a successful Tectonicus run\u2014we note that in the long, along with the time, and move on to the next section.\nTransferring The Map with Rsync.\n is a powerful file transfer tool with many uses, but the one we care about most here is its ability to look at a whole bunch of files at a source and at a destination, and then only transfer the files from source to destination that are different. Tectonicus generates lots and lots and lots of files, and you will save huge amounts of time by transferring to your web server only the new bits of the map every night instead of copying the whole thing every time.\nThe first line records the time rsync starts transferring, and the second line executes rsync. Here's a what each of the command line arguments do:\nTiming and Completion.\nThe last two sections measure how long the entire script ran, record the info in the log file, and then report a successful exit.\nThe current Unix time is recorded in the STOPTIME variable, and then using some handy bash math, STARTTIME is subtracted from STOPTIME, which gives us the number of seconds that the script took to run. This value is converted to hours/minutes/seconds and recorded in the log file. (Some limited testing reveals that the date -ur function works correctly on OS X, but doesn't appear to work on Linux). Lastly, we report an exit status of 0 and the script comes to an end.\nFor Linux, try using the alternate \"Total time elapsed\" line. 07:11, 1 October 2011 (UTC)\nMaking Things Run Automatically With Cron.\nThe preferred way to schedule a task on OS X is to use , but these instructions are for cron, since that will work on both OS X and also other Linux- and BSD-based operating systems. For instructions on setting up a launchd job to execute a script every night, use Google.\nTo tell cron to run this script nightly whether or not a user is logged on, you'll need to edit the system crontab file, which is located at /etc/crontab (though on OS X 10.6.x, the file might not exist\u2014if that's the case, then you can create it yourself). Open the file for editing and paste in the following line:\nMake sure to substitute in the path to the Tectonicus script. The first two characters are the minute and hour that cron will execute the script in 24-hour notation, so the line as it is above will run the script every night at 01:00. To change it to 03:30, you'd replace the \"0\" with \"30\" and the \"1\" with \"3\".\nWrapping Up.\nThe script above is just an example of one way to automate the execution of Tectonicus\u2014it can be modified to do lots of other things, including execute multiple instances of Tectonicus, either in serial or parallel.\nThis article would probably benefit from instructions on creating a launchd item instead of using cron, but cron works fine for me, so I haven't put in the time to figure out how to make launchd work instead."}

Most VNC applications mimick a display area on the server, as if you connected a monitor to it.\nNOTE: This tutorial is for the Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 operating systems. Previous versions of Windows might work too with this method, but it's unconfirmed.\nCurrently only Teamviewer has been tested successfully. Recommended is to stick to Teamviewer at this moment, unless you are unable to do so.\nTeamviewer Instructions:\nYour server should now be set and ready. Remember the ID given to your server.\nNow setup Teamviewer on your laptop, pc, or any computer that is used as a client to connect to the server. No special settings are required on the client. If you wish, sign up for an account, so you may register your server in a contact list.\nFirewall Instructions:\nTeamviewer runs on port 80, the HTTP port, by default. Unless you deny HTTP connections to your server, this port should be unblocked by default. \nHowever, if you decide to use a different port, you may need to forward this port to your server, and open the port in your firewall. \nPost Installation Notes:\nIf you close teamviewer without logging out on the server, the server will still believe there is a screen for tectonicus to render on. This means that you can setup Task Scheduler to run tectonicus every once in a while. Note that you cannot use Remote Desktop, as this will reinitialize the screen in a way in which it does not support the hardware rendering needed by Tectonicus.\nAny and all problems related to your server's graphics card and its drivers may still occur, so if this doesn't work with Teamviewer: try it with a real screen attached to the server.\nTectonicus Setup.\nYou will need a minecraft.jar (Not the one you can download from minecraft.net). Start up the game and the auto-updater will download it to '.minecraft/bin', usually somewhere in your home directory.\nPlease replace all /path/to/ to the correct path. \nIf you are gettin a biome related error use this flag for tectonicus and of course you can use all other flags for tectonicus &lt;a href=\"Programs%20and%20editors/Tectonicus%23Additional%20Command%20Line%20Arguments\"&gt;Programs and editors/Tectonicus#Additional Command Line Arguments&lt;/a&gt;\ncodice_2\ncodice_3\nNote: Tectonicus currently works in one of two ways: either the options can be passed through via command line or via console. So anyone out there who is placing their options in an xml file and is using 64 bit will need to enable the force64BitNatives command in the tweeks section of the xml config file. \ncodice_4\nFeedback.\nPlease give me your feedback in the minecraft forum &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D1022%26amp%3Bt%3D95739\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or via e-mail wallnuss13 [at] gmail [dot] com."}

For other types of farming see &lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrowth mechanics.\n&lt;a href=\"Melon\"&gt;Melon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s use essentially the same mechanics for growth and can be easily farmed with the same techniques. Once the plants are mature, they provide a steady supply of fruit for your needs. Surprisingly, water is not needed to grow pumpkins or melons. When planted, they create a stalk that starts out short, but grows and becomes yellow as it matures. Only mature stalks can grow pumpkins and melons.\nFinding Seeds.\nTo begin farming, seeds must first be found. You can either find seeds in chests or find whole melons or pumpkins and craft them into seeds.\nIf you do have a whole pumpkin or melon, but no seeds, simply place the pumpkin in a crafting grid, which yields 4 seeds, or, alternatively, place the pumpkin somewhere and use &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; on it. The melon drops melon slices when mined, yielding 1 seed each when putting in a crafting area. \nOn average, it takes around 272 seconds (4 minutes, 31 seconds) for each stem to generate fruit (be it a Pumpkin or a Melon).\nNote: Pre-1.13 players must put the whole pumpkin in a crafting area and craft it into 4 seeds.\nGrowth Factors.\nThe growth rate of melon and pumpkin stems and the spawning of melon and pumpkin fruit is determined by the same &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Crop%20farming%23Growth%20rate\"&gt;growth rate algorithm&lt;/a&gt; as for wheat, carrots, and potatoes. The stem itself has 8 phases of growth until maturity. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; may be used to accelerate growth.\nThe attempt to grow a fruit happens when the mature stem would grow again (to \"phase 9\") and is not already adjacent to an instance of its fruit. First one of the four sides is chosen. If this space is suitable (empty with &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coarse%20Dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rooted%20Dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20Mangrove%20Roots\"&gt;muddy mangrove roots&lt;/a&gt; beneath) the fruit is created. Bone meal does not force fruit production.\nBoth sorts of fruit revert farmland below them to dirt when they grow. Pumpkins can most easily be harvested with an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, and drop whole as items. Melons can be broken quickest using an axe. They also break faster using a sword but at the cost of double durability. While melons grow as blocks, the melons are broken into 3\u20137 slices by harvesting (unless a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; tool is used). In both cases, the harvested fruit can be &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt; back into seeds. Harvesting mature stems also produces seeds (1\u20134 per stem), but it is faster to wait for the already-mature stem to grow a fruit than to regrow a mature stem from seed.\nManual farms.\nThis section contains suitable layouts for farms that must be manually harvested. The percentages given are space efficiencies. Parenthesized values are theoretical maximums, which assume that there are free blocks surrounding the farm for the border plants to place melons. The maximum possible efficiency for any melon or pumpkin farm is 50% (one fruit per stem). Spaces, where fruit can occupy two or more stems, reduce the efficiency and yield. Question-mark blocks indicate that anything could be put in that spot\u2014perhaps lighting, or other crops such as &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es. You may want to cover the water with a &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimple farms.\nThe following grids provide different availabilities for designs of pumpkin and melon farms.\nIf you just want a quick, compact farm, use design D below. C and D have slightly lower efficiency, but both fit on a \"standard farm plot\", and are easy to harvest. Of those two, D likely has a faster growth rate due to the separated rows of stalks, but the middle row should \"not\" be open dirt/grass or farmland (or more stalks), because any fruit spawned there can tie up two stems. For C, the middle row can be anything except more stalks, for the same reason.\nDesign A is slightly larger and maximizes space efficiency. It can be tiled for larger farms, but alternate rows should be mirrored top-to-bottom to keep the efficiency. Design B is least efficient but fits in a slightly smaller plot.\nLarge farms.\nMost of the above farms can be tiled to make larger farms, though in some cases, alternate rows or columns of the plots should be flipped for best results. This farm represents an expansion of design A (turned sideways), with the left column of plots reversed (it also shows the farmland border for the whole farm). The basic plots could be repeated further, expanding the farm in units of 9\u00d79. Note that this design aims to make sure that each fruit occupies only one stem \u2014 as it increases in size, the efficiency approaches 49%.\nMulti-level farms.\nWhile the above designs all use one layer, the most efficient (49.38%) 9\u00d79 farm can be created by using two layers. Design is based on design D, and cobblestone indicates spaces that are covered (with dirt) by the layer above.\nWhen replicated over a larger area, design G has spots where you need to jump. Design H avoids that but keeps the same efficiency. For design H, the water source must be placed with care so that it won't spread into the \"corridors\". However, if there is the usual pit in the bottom layer (and matching hole above), the source block can be placed against one of the upper blocks, or 2 blocks above that layer. The position of the melon stems and dirt/grass/farmland blocks in the two farming layers can be swapped without losing efficiency.\nRapid-harvest farms.\nThe above layouts are optimized for high spacial efficiency, at the cost of speed. They work best for infrequent harvests, with plenty of time for the field to regrow in between. For frequent harvests, the first following layout may be better suited; if harvested once per day-and-night cycle, it yields about 17 fruits per harvest (as opposed to about 13 fruits for the above designs). The second layout goes even further in that direction\u2014it does not use space efficiently but instead gives each stem 2\u20134 potential places to spawn a pumpkin or melon, encouraging quicker initial growth at the cost of a clumsier design and reduced long-term yield.\nSemi automatic farms.\nBoth melons and pumpkins are broken and dropped when a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; pushes into them. This mechanic can be used to create self harvesting farms. The simplests designs like this push &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s upward into the fruit. Since it is difficult to automatically collect the items when harvested this way, the technique makes for some practical semi automatic designs.\nBasic design.\nThis design uses &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s to push the block the pumpkin or melon is sitting on upward. To save &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;waterlog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s so that the redstone line can be underneath the water without being washed out.\nStackable design.\nThe following design sacrifices space efficiency in order to fully automate harvesting and allow \"massive\" expansion: The tower can be expanded up to the build limit and/or down to bedrock, potentially yielding nearly a thousand growing spaces per tower.\nThe total area of the farm is 13 blocks by 7 blocks, with an alternating piston and farm layers. Its height is 2 blocks, plus 2 more for each \"crop layer\" of 8 growing spaces. You need the following materials to make it: \nThe farmland is hydrated by water flowing down from above. A pressure plate at the end of the collection area on the bottom activates a Redstone torch tower, which in turn activates each piston layer. The harvest falls down the empty middle area into flowing water at the bottom layer and is channeled to the player standing on the pressure plate.\nStarting tips:\nSee the following steps to build the farm itself:\nSchematics:&lt;br&gt;\n \nFully automatic farms.\nThese farms require no player interaction for the harvesting and collection of pumpkins or melons after being built. Fully automatic farms require pistons and redstone to function and are generally more expensive to build than manual or semi-automatic pumpkin and melon farms.\nFarms are triggered automatically in one of three ways.\nPumpkins and melons are collected in a combination of the following.\nEfficient pumpkin/melon farm.\nThis farm requires an observer directly above a plant and pistons that activate when the plant moves. These outputs are then taken through a hopper minecart into a chest. This is cheap but harder to build due to the orientations of the pistons and and observers. This is a short video explaining the topic.\nOpaque block detection farms.\nThese farms send redstone power through the space where a pumpkin or melon can grow. When the block there is opaque, redstone power can pass to next component, triggering a piston to harvest the pumpkin or melon.\nThese designs made obsolete by the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;. Observer based melon and pumpkin farms are generally easier to make, more compact, and, in some cases, more efficient.\nSingle plant detection.\nThis design requires only 1 piston per pumpkin stem and doesn't require a bud switch. This pumpkin farm fits within a 5x5 area and is relatively simple to build.\nClock designs are superior to this as they allow for better control over the harvesting. It is possible for the two rightmost plants to grow long before the first one does, so more frequent harvesting is desirable.\nDropper hopper trigger.\nThis melon/pumpkin farm is modular and uses a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; combo to detect melon growth. The dropper should contain an item to be dispensed into the hopper, triggering the &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;.\nDual-piston growth detection.\nThis design powers a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; whenever a &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt; has grown. The sticky piston is used to power a regular piston and break the produce.\nThis design is tileable and stackable, which could be useful if you want a larger farm. When tileing, the rightmost column can be rotated around the air column behind the lower piston to save space.\nWhen stacking, you may want to run a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; line beside the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s to the bottom so everything can be collected at a central location. It may also be possible to remove hoppers from the upper layers and allow the produce to fall down to the bottom.\nThe schematic shows half of tileable part of 4-growing-space floor plan. The other half is a north-to-south mirrored copy of the first half, sharing the central slice of hoppers and chests to keep iron cost low (7 hoppers per 4 growing spaces). \nEach growing space has 2 stems beside it. There are 2 rows of farmland between growing spaces, so each stem in the middle has 5 wet farmlands nearby, resulting in better growth rate than if the stem has less than 4 wet farmlands around. The leftmost and rightmost side of the farm should also have 2 rows of 3 farmlands to have the same stem growth rate. Not all of melon slices are collected by the hoppers, but the amount collected is probably good enough.\nThe second floor is a left-to-right mirror image of first floor, so the upper hopper of the first floor pulls items from the large chest of second floor.\nAs shown by the schematics below, the design can be varied for early game before &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s have been obtained for &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s. It instead uses 2 regular pistons and 2 sands per growing space. However, the height is 6 blocks, 2 times taller than the original design.\nBUD circuit farm.\nDesign 6 (doesn\u2019t work in bedrock edition).\nThis farm is small, has no sticky pistons, and is resource friendly. It uses a BUD switch to determine if a pumpkin/melon has matured and then activates a piston to break it and send it into a hopper.\nVertical &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; farms.\nAn observer on top of a melon/pumpkin growing block, looking down, can be used to detect a melon/pumpkin growing. \nThe observer also detects the piston arm and the other block moved by the piston to harvest a pumpkin or melon and may cause the piston to extend and retract in a loop if there is no mechanism to prevent it.\nAn observer on top of the stem inhibits growth, so it cannot be used in this position. \nDesign 7.\nThis design is lag-friendly and uses the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; block to detect grown pumpkins (or melons). It's compact and cheap to build and can be easily expanded.\nThis design uses a sticky piston to push the observer down to harvest a pumpkin or melon. The piston does not receive power from the direction it faces, so another route is needed to transmit the signal. A slime block is placed between the observer and piston to help extract the observer's signal. The signal is passed through a 2-tick redstone repeater that extends it enough for the sticky piston to pull the slime block and observer back to their original position. \nDesign 8.\nThis farm packs high yield per growing space in a small tile area per growing space (2x2, excluding border and water). All mechanical and circuitry components are above ground and stem level, so the ground can devote to maximize growth rate. Its stacking height is 6 blocks. This design might be bad because the crops aren't picked up by the hopper when they fall on the full dirt blocks. \nFor high output per growing space, plant 4 stems (2 pumpkin stems and 2 melon stems) adjacent to the growing space, and surround each stem's root with 6 wet farmlands, so its growth rate is the maximum value (1/3 per random block tick) (1/12 for each available space adjacent to stem). Growing spaces surrounded by 4 such stems have the highest possible output rate per growing space. Potatoes are planted to prevent pumpkin or melon growing on farmland where they they are not wanted. The border of farm surrounding the outer stems should have potatoes on wet farmland too if there is available space. A water block is placed in every 8x8 area. Stems around the water block in the middle of the farm has 5 wet farmland around them, so their growth rate is slightly reduced to 1/4 per random block tick (1/16 for each available space adjacent to the stem). When the farm is extended in the schematic's east-west direction, sharing the leftmost and rightmost redstone dust on the stationary block, 1 pumpkin or melon fruit growing trigger 8 pistons at the same time.\nHorizontal observer farm.\nThe observer can be used to detect melon/pumpkin growing, or detect the change in the stem when it bears fruit. \nDesign 9.\nThis farm uses observer horizontally, it needs a larger area than vertical observer farm. \nPlace 2 stems on farmlands with one air block between the stems. The stems can be melon, pumpkin, or both. \nBeneath the empty air block, place any type of block that a melon/pumpkin can grow on, and behind that space place an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; block. Have the observer be wired up to a regular &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; pointing toward the air block and on top of it. Finally, have a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; beneath it that collects the melons and put it into a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. This method, however, loops continuously once set off, as the observer sees the piston arm and triggers repeatedly unless there is a mechanism to stop the signal.\nDesign 10 - stackable horizontal piston observer melon/pumpkin farm.\nIn this case, the observer measures the stem instead of the fruit. This makes the farm more compact since there is no need for a mechanism that stops the machine from continuously looping once set off, as the observer sees the piston arm and triggers repeatedly. The farm produces 12-13 melons per minute.\nTime-based farm.\nDesign 11 - High-density pumpkin and melon farm.\nThis farm has a high yield per volume. And it takes little resource per growing space when you expand the farm. \nThe floor consists of farmlands and dirt in the checkerboard pattern. There are hoppers under farmlands and they are connected to a storage container(s). \nOne block of dirt is replaced with water in every 9\u04459 area. \nPumpkin seeds and melon seeds are planted in alternating rows, so their diagonal stem neighbors are of a different kind from themselves. \nOn dirt, blocks are air blocks and on these air blocks are pistons facing down. \nOn the same level as pistons, jack-o'lanterns are placed over stems and farmlands column. \nThe pistons and jack-o'lanterns are in a checkerboard pattern. \nRedstone pulses from clock are sent to one opaque block on piston, then spread through redstone repeaters and redstone dusts, which are on jack-o'lanterns, and more opaque blocks on pistons. \nAppropriate clock cycle period may be around 5-6 seconds or longer. \nThis farm's stacking height is 5 blocks. The second floor does not need another clock. It can take signal from redstone torch column and pass it through pulse limiter in the corner like the first floor.\nItems from the second floor can be sent down through first floor's water with &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;Minecart with Hopper&lt;/a&gt; or chest in the water and &lt;a href=\"Dropper\"&gt;Dropper&lt;/a&gt; in the Redstone circuit layer with hoppers between them."}

{"id": "65109", "revid": "54086488", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65109", "title": "Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity", "text": "Quasi-connectivity is a property of &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s that allows them to be activated by anything that would activate the space above them, no matter what is actually in that space. While quasi-connectivity can be difficult to work around sometimes and might seem like a bug, it and does make some builds much easier (for example, piston walls).\n\"Quasi-connectivity\" means the block's activation is quasi-connected to the space above itself (\"quasi-\" means \"seemingly\" or \"apparently\"). Quasi-connectivity can be abbreviated as QC. Other terms used for this property include \"connectivity\", \"piston connectivity\" (as the property originated with pistons), \"indirect power\" (but that term is also sometimes used for activating mechanism components with an adjacent powered block), and \"BUD-powered\" (although quasi-connectivity and block update detectors are not synonymous).\nRather than repeating \"dispensers, droppers, and pistons\", this tutorial discusses only pistons, but everything discussed here applies to dispensers and droppers as well.\nActivation by normal methods.\nBefore discussing activation by quasi-connectivity, let's review more general methods of &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Activation\"&gt;activation&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanism components (pistons, doors, redstone lamps, etc.) can be activated, which causes the mechanism component to do something (push a block, open the door, turn on, etc.). Most Minecrafters would just say they are \"powered\", but it can be useful to distinguish &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Powered%20vs.%20activated\"&gt;powered and activated&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll mechanism components are activated by:\nActivation by quasi-connectivity.\nIn addition to the normal methods of activation described above, pistons can also be activated if one of the methods above \"would\" activate a mechanism component in the space \"above\" the piston, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the component is &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; or a transparent block).\nAnother way to look at it is that pistons have an activation \"shape\"/\"hitbox\" similar to doors. Anything that activates the top of a door also activates the bottom of the door, and anything that activates the space above a piston also activates the piston.\nThis method of activation is known as \"quasi-connectivity\" (QC) and is often simplified to saying that pistons can be powered by blocks diagonally above or two blocks above, but other methods of such activation exist (described below).\nWhere quasi-connectivity gets complicated is that it can cause states where a piston \"should\" be activated by QC \u2026 but \"doesn't know it\". When redstone components change their state, they update other redstone component around them of the change so that they can update their state in response (for example, when a lever turns on, it updates nearby components that they should now be powered or activated). However, redstone components only update other blocks a maximum of two spaces away, but quasi-connectivity can create situations where a piston should be activated from a redstone component \"three\" spaces away. For example, a redstone component powering a block next to the space above a piston\u2014the redstone component can activate the piston by QC but is three spaces away so does not provide an update to the piston.\nBecause of this update problem, some methods of activation by quasi-connectivity (\"QC activation\", for short) update the piston immediately (\"&lt;a href=\"%23Immediate%20QC%20activation\"&gt;immediate QC activation&lt;/a&gt;\"), while others put the piston into a state where it should be activated but doesn't know it yet, so it waits to activate until it is updated (\"&lt;a href=\"%23Update%20QC%20activation\"&gt;update QC activation&lt;/a&gt;\").\nImmediate QC activation.\nImmediate QC activation is the activation of a piston by quasi-connectivity that occurs immediately and doesn't require the piston to be separately updated. This only works with redstone components that can update other redstone components two blocks away from them.\nOther redstone components cannot update redstone components more than one block away so cannot be used for immediate QC activation, only for update QC activation.\nUpdate QC activation.\nUpdate QC activation is the act of putting a piston into a state where it should activate by quasi-connectivity, but it hasn't received a redstone update so doesn't know it should activate \u2014 it then waits to activate until it receives an update.\nPistons can be updated in a number of ways:\nThe redstone components that cannot be used to put a piston into a QC activation may still be useful for updating them. For example, a &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt; updates adjacent blocks when an entity moves into or out of its space, and &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s are useful in that they update adjacent blocks when activated or deactivated (thus updates can be controlled with redstone without directly powering neighbors).\nBenefits of quasi-connectivity.\nAlthough somewhat difficult to understand, quasi-connectivity does offer many benefits.\nMore activation options.\nBecause a piston can be activated in its own space or the space above it, there are simply more options when figuring out how to activate it.\nRemote activation.\nBecause a piston can be activated by anything that would activate the space above it, pistons can be activated from two spaces away while most redstone components can only be activated from one space away.\nBlock update detectors.\n&lt;a href=\"%23Update%20QC%20activation\"&gt;Update QC activation&lt;/a&gt; can be used to create a block update detector: a redstone circuit that is triggered by a block update rather than a redstone power input.\nA piston activated by quasi-connectivity is sometimes described as \"BUD-powered\". However, quasi-connectivity and block update detectors (BUDs) are neither synonymous nor even subsets of each other. There are methods of QC activation that do not produce block update detectors (for example, any &lt;a href=\"%23Immediate%20QC%20activation\"&gt;immediate QC activation&lt;/a&gt; method) and there are block update detectors that do not depend on quasi-connectivity (for example, stuck-piston BUDs).\nTorch keys.\nA torch key is a circuit that can react to the placement of a redstone torch in a particular location, even when the circuit is hidden beneath the ground. They are used to create a hidden method of activating another mechanism (for example, a piston door).\nThere are two primary methods of designing a torch key. The first is to place a block update detector under the ground so that the placement of a redstone torch updates the BUD. However, BUDs can also be updated remotely by other redstone components, increasing the chances of discovery. The second method is to use &lt;a href=\"%23Immediate%20QC%20activation\"&gt;immediate QC activation&lt;/a&gt; by placing the torch so that it simply activates a piston by quasi-connectivity.\nFloating button.\nSimilar to torch keys, but with an obvious input, a floating button is a button that doesn't appear to be connected to anything but can still be used. The strategy is to put a button far enough away that it can activate a piston by &lt;a href=\"%23Update%20QC%20activation\"&gt;update QC activation&lt;/a&gt; and then repeatedly update the piston (without activating it) so that it responds quickly to the button turning on and off.\nFor example, the schematic on the left shows one way to build a floating button. The clock circuit on the left repeatedly powers and unpowers the powered rail next to the piston. When the powered rail changes state it updates the piston without activating it. If the piston is updated while the button has been pushed, it extends because the button would activate a mechanism in the space above the piston. Similarly, if the piston is updated after the button pops back out, the piston retracts again.\nA quieter floating button (right schematic) can be created by using a dropper instead of a piston and using it to push an item into a hopper, which pushes it right back (unlike the dropper, the hopper isn't affected by redstone components two blocks above it), but briefly activates a comparator output. This version updates the dropper with a &lt;a href=\"Clock%20circuit%23Hopper%20clock\"&gt;hopper clock&lt;/a&gt;, which is a little slower and thus slightly less responsive, but smaller than a torch-repeater clock.\nDrawbacks of quasi-connectivity.\nQuasi-connectivity can make it difficult to do things above pistons compactly without also activating them. For example, the player can't run redstone dust over a block on a piston because the dust affects the piston even if the block is a top slab.\nWorkarounds.\nThere are a number of strategies for getting a signal over a piston without affecting the piston:"}

Without filling the hunger bar regularly, players may be unable to heal and starve to death. This tutorial highlights several ways to find food quickly.\nOverworld.\nKilling animals that drop meat.\nMany mobs in the Overworld drop meat or fish when killed. If these mobs are killed while they are on fire, their meat will be cooked. This also includes salmon and cod in rivers and most oceans. \nThis list shows various mobs that drop meat and their drops when killed with and without fire. \nCooked foods have better saturation and restore more &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; than raw meat. The player can kill mobs with fire using &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; enchantments, &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. Bear in mind that fires from flint and steel or fire charges and lava may burn items that the mob drops and may also set the player on fire. It can be difficult to light fish on fire without Fire Aspect or Flame unless the fish can be brought to dry land.\nIf you do not have access to any of the above methods to set mobs on fire, it is also possible to cook the food using a furnace. For small numbers of food to cook and/or when the player does not have time to make a furnace, bringing or making a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; may be a better option.\nVillages.\n can offer many food sources, depending on the biome they generate in and which buildings are present.\nLooting and breaking.\nDepending on biome, villages contain piles of hay bales, pumpkins or melons.\n&lt;a href=\"Hay%20Bale\"&gt;Hay bales&lt;/a&gt; are the most valuable crop to find in these piles because they can be crafted back into wheat and then bread. Each hay bale makes 9 wheat which is enough for 3 bread, granting a total food points. \nBiomes that do not spawn hay bales will instead contain pumpkins or melons. While melons are immediately edible, they do not provide much hunger or saturation, and are best used to fill out the worst of the player's hunger. Pumpkins are not edible by themselves, but may be used with sugar and eggs to make pumpkin pie.\nIn addition to piles of the above crops, many village buildings generate with chests, which may contain a variety of food and food items.\nThese food items can be found in the village chests:\nFarming and trading.\nThe farmland in villages can be a viable source of food by itself, but can potentially give the player much higher quality foods if the player engages in trading with any villagers that have the farmer profession.\nLooting Shipwrecks.\nYou can often find &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s in any &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;-type biome. If the \"bow\" (front) of the ship is present, the \"supply\" chest within can have a decent amount of food, or at least wheat to make bread. The list of food items that can be found in shipwrecks:\nNote that each suspicious stew will have one of six random effects; most of these will pass within a few seconds, and are only an issue if you're currently in a fight. But there are equal chances of getting poison (which can do up to damage), or saturation (bonus food, effectively maxing out your food gauges).\nForaging.\nSome food items can be gathered from the environment with varying degrees of ease, depending on the biomes a player passes through. While many of them may not provide good saturation, they will prevent starvation and can be used to \"pad\" the hunger bar before eating something more nourishing.\nMushroom Stew.\nBrown and red mushrooms can be found in various places throughout the world, mostly under trees or in caves. Giant mushrooms can also be found and broken in dark oak forests and mushroom fields. They can also be found in the Nether. \nIf the player gathers some wood to craft bowls in a crafting table, &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt; can be made without the need for a crafting table. If the player finds the rare &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Fields\"&gt;Mushroom Fields&lt;/a&gt;, using an empty bowl on a &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt; also produces mushroom stew, although the fields themselves contain plenty of mushrooms even without milking mooshrooms. Since mushroom fields do not grow trees, wood may be harder to find in this biome. \nMushroom stew is a helpful food source on par with other staples like bread and small cooked meats like rabbit and chicken. However, mushroom stew itself is not stackable and can quickly take up a lot of inventory space if crafted in large numbers, so the player may want to keep the ingredients uncrafted until the stew is needed. Both types of mushroom as well as the bowl are stackable, and the bowl is returned to the player after eating. This means that it is possible to carry a small number of bowls and a larger amount of red and brown mushrooms, to fill the bowls with as needed. \nSuspicious Stew.\nAdding a &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt; to the mushroom stew will instead produce &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;, which is just as nourishing and also grants a brief status effect. Take note of the flower used, as not all flowers produce beneficial effects. Some notable effects:\nSweet Berries.\nSpawning in/near a taiga biome allows you to get early access to &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Berries\"&gt;sweet berries&lt;/a&gt;, which are a weak but plentiful food source and easy to farm. However, the bushes hurt the player when stepped into - avoid walking through them.\nApples (Leaves).\nWhen cutting down oak or dark oak trees, the &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; have a 1 in 200 chance to drop apples when broken or as they decay after cutting the tree.\nMelons.\nIn jungles, you can likely find melon blocks, which can be broken into &lt;a href=\"Melon%20Slice\"&gt;melon slices&lt;/a&gt;. These are a weak food, but can be plentiful, especially since unused slices can be crafted into seeds to (eventually) grow more melons.\nPumpkin Pie.\nIf you happen to have the ingredients, &lt;a href=\"Pumpkin%20Pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively cheap and filling food item, crafted with only one &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;), and an &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;. All of these can be farmed in mass quantities. One thing troublesome is finding the pumpkins in the first place, but once that's done, there are no real challenges. They can also be crafted without a &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Table\"&gt;Crafting Table&lt;/a&gt;, requiring only three ingredients.\nRotten Flesh.\n&lt;a href=\"Rotten%20flesh\"&gt;Rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most common and least-valued items in the game. Most often found after killing &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; and their various relatives (or waiting for them to burn in the morning), it can also show up &lt;a href=\"chest%20loot\"&gt;chest loot&lt;/a&gt;. It is a bottom-tier food, which furthermore has an 80% chance to inflict \"food poisoning\" -- 30 seconds of the &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28effect%29\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; effect. However, the duration does not stack from eating multiple pieces, and the hunger effect costs very little hunger. If low on hunger, eating several pieces in a row is enough to heal the player if needed, with only a small amount of hunger lost to the hunger. Additionally, drinking a bucket of milk after eating the last piece of rotten flesh will cancel the effect entirely.\nIn the Nether.\nIt is challenging to find food in the Nether, but there are still some (if not somewhat unreliable) food sources available. \nBastion Remnants.\nA &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Remnant\"&gt;Bastion Remnant&lt;/a&gt; is an uncommon structure populated with dangerous mobs, but may provide the player with many chests if explored thoroughly. Some &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; may contain &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Porkchop\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt;, and golden carrots and golden apples[Java Edition only]. Note that &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglins&lt;/a&gt; will object to your looting or breaking chests as well as breaking any blocks containing gold, and will attack the player if they're not wearing at least one piece of golden armor. Piglin Brutes, however, do not care about the player's armor and deal considerable damage. Blocking the path of piglins attacking the player is a safe way to avoid fighting them and accessing loot in chests.\nIn the End.\nThe End is a very hostile place, and it is extremely difficult to find food sources there. You should bring plenty of food with you whenever venturing into the End; the only edible thing you'll find there is chorus fruit; it grows only on the outer islands, but is plentiful there. It does have a little side effect...\nChorus Plants.\nChorus plants only grow on the Outer End Islands and only become easily accessible after defeating the Ender Dragon. They restore four hunger but can also teleport you to a random location, up to 8 blocks away. This can either be a great convenience or an annoyance. The trees are very common in the End islands, and with a little effort you can easily farm them as well. "}
