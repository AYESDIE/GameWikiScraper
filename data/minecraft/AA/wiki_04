This was linked to by the &lt;a href=\"locked%20chest\"&gt;locked chest&lt;/a&gt;, a block which was implemented for this purpose, as it was implied that keys had to be bought from said store to unlock these chests.\n2013.\nDuring 2013, Mojang released a pre-release for a fake future version containing numerous joke features to various YouTubers this was not to the public.\n2014.\nA post was added to Mojang Studios' blog for the joke. \nThis caused all players' current skin to be replaced with the various villager skins, and caused users to be unable to change their skins unless they modified the &lt;a href=\"launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt; file. Different career villager skins were used, including the then-unused green robe of a nitwit villager.\nIn-game, villagers still acted the same, but they made different sounds. All noises were replaced with the sound effects of Element Animation's \"T.E.A.V.S.R.P\" (The Element Animation Villager Sounds Resource Pack). Mojang Studios also added in-game villager music. The title screen music contains a parody of the \"\" theme, due to the new series starting in early April and also because of its being included in the original trailer for \"T.E.A.V.S.R.P.\" Jeb also claimed the villager got his Twitter account.\nGrumm [ released the villager skins on Reddit] on April 1, 2014.

This \"update\" is called the Love and Hugs Update. There was also a QR code written in the snow that generated in a &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; world that, when scanned, reads \"Minecraft 1.9: The &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Update\"&gt;Combat Update&lt;/a&gt;\".

Clicking on both of them will cause them to breed and spawn numerous chickens, covering the entire page.\n2024.\nFor April Fool's Day 2024, the loading icon on the Minecraft launcher was a poisonous potato, instead of the usual two allays spinning in a circle. All the text also changed from the 'Noto Sans' font to a handwritten-like font, and on every click inside the Minecraft launcher, a poisinous potato would fly from the cursor. If multiple clicks were in quick succession, a group of them would spawn.\nAlso for April Fool's Day 2024, Mojang Studios published the snapshot 24w14potato, titled \"The Poisonous Potato Update\".

{"id": "108503", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=108503", "title": "List of model issues in Java Edition", "text": "This page aims to document some easily-fixable issues with Java Edition's default model files in as much detail as is needed. Screenshots of the problems with said models are included for comparison purposes, as to show the changes the fixes make.\nA resource pack containing all of these fixes may be linked here in the future. Copying the model files directly from this wiki page is not recommended, as they have been reformatted specially for viewing purposes.\nVisual problems.\nFire: misconfigured inner planes.\nWhen fire was changed to use block models in 1.8, the conversion resulting in two of the planes being converted incorrectly, resulting in subtle visual differences. This is best seen when looking at fire from above, which reveals a lack of a \"square\" on the inside as there was previously (and still is on Bedrock Edition, making this also a parity issue), with it instead looking more rectangular.\nThis is easily fixable, as the first two elements are rendering the fire texture on the wrong side, and are also rotated in the incorrect direction. Flipping these as follows yields a more correct model. The pre-1.8 model appears to apply the alternate fire texture on some of these planes, however, so it may be worth further modifying the fire model as to load both of the fire textures and apply them accordingly.\nCoral wall fans: incorrect plane mirroring.\nSnapshot 21w13a fixed a large number of 2D block models such that the positions of pixels would remain consistent when viewed from the front and the back, rather than the texture mapping being identical on the rear, which looked strange. A small number remained, however, with coral fans being one of them. As texture mapping is all that needs changed, this is an easy fix, although care has to be taken such that no undesirable mirror symmetry effects arise.\nAnother thing worth noting here is that coral fan models reference a main template model. Most template models are prefixed with \"template_\", however coral fan template models are not, which is inconsistent and confusing. This section will not go into detail as to all that needs changed, as this does not result in any in-game visual differences (the changes are trivial anyways, as all of the other coral fan models just need \"template_\" added to their referenced parent model).\nDragon egg: redundant faces and incorrect element sizes.\nAnother casualty of flawed model conversion in 1.8, one of the top cuboids comprising the dragon egg was created at the wrong size. This not only causes the shape of the dragon egg to be incorrect, with it having a weird and pointy top as opposed to the smoother curve it had previously, it also causes the texture on that cuboid to be unnaturally squished and causing it to misalign with the usual 16\u00d716 grid that blocks are expected to conform to.\nThe dragon egg is also a major offender when it comes to rendering extra planes for no reason. Being composed of a total of eight stacked cuboids, every single face of each cuboid is rendered no matter what, which both strains the game \"and\" bloats the model file. The majority of other model files don't define faces that can never be seen without clipping inside of the block, and faces which are obscured by adjacent blocks typically have &lt;samp&gt;cullface&lt;/samp&gt; defined as to remove those faces when they can't be seen. By removing these unnecessary faces, we can reduce the model file size by seven whole lines.\nThere are also some other, more minor, problems with the model file:\nThe fixes detailed below implement fixes for both of these issues as well as the more focal hidden face removal.\nStem crops: incorrect plane mirroring and sizes, unwanted shading.\nMelon stems and pumpkin stems are perhaps the worst affected by 1.8's move to block models, with three visual problems arising from the conversion:\nAlongside this, the names of the stem template models are simply atrocious, being massively inconsistent with the very models that reference them, alongside just not having that preceding \"template_\".\nPotted plants: unwanted shading.\nIn much the same way as melon and pumpkin stems as described above, the majority of plants placed inside of pots had directional shading unaccountably applied to them, which has yet to be removed. This has subsequently affected all potted crosses added after the fact, with the important exception of the mangrove propagule, which has its own model rather than referring to the same template model. Despite the mangrove propagule highlighting this glaring inconsistency, it still remains to be fixed.\nPotted crosses are yet another example of many models referencing a parent template, with this template being one more example of the many templates which are not marked as such. Like with previously mentioned cases, example name changes are provided, which will require all models that point to it to be accordingly repointed."}

A &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s spawns with two &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;leashed&lt;/a&gt; trader llamas. , trader llamas always spawn with a wandering trader.\n10% of llamas spawn as baby llamas.\nTrader llamas often despawn one &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; before their trader does, because a trader llama has its set to 47999 ticks. This value is decremented each tick that the llama is untamed, unleashed, and not being ridden by a player, and is reset to one less than the trader's own if leashed to a trader. The llama despawns if the value reaches zero.\nDrops.\nAn adult llamas drops when killed:\nLike other baby animals, killing a baby llama yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaravans.\nLlamas do not accept &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;s, so the player cannot control its movement, even when tamed. &lt;a href=\"Lead\"&gt;Lead&lt;/a&gt;s are the best way to move llamas. Leashing a llama actually signals all other llamas not already in a caravan nearby (up to nine) to follow each other, forming a caravan of up to ten llamas. Leashing a second llama forms a caravan of ten more llamas and there is no limit on the number of llamas following a player.\nA llama can be equipped with a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; by right clicking a chest on it once tamed, giving it 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 slots of inventory space, scaling directly with its NBT (see below). Once equipped, the chest cannot be retrieved without killing the llama and can be accessed by shift + right clicking the llama. A llama's potential carry capacity is a number of item slots equal to 3*, with a maximum of 15 spaces. \nLlamas can be equipped with &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s in their carpet slot (). Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug on the llama's back. This can be useful for color-coding their storage, similar to dyed &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es.\nFor the purposes of the command, a llama carries its carpet in the codice_1 slot. Trader llamas that do not have a carpet wear a unique blue rug design. It can be replaced with a carpet but not removed. When given carpets, both types of llama look the same. A llama's &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt; decoration remains visible when the llama is under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nThe llama floats when in water deeper than two blocks.\nLlamas are neutral, but if a player or mob attacks one, it spits at the attacker once to deal damage. Sometimes their spit can miss their target and hit another llama, starting a fight within a group of llamas. Additionally, a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;'s llamas spit at mobs or players who attack the wandering trader.\nLlamas are hostile toward wolves and spit without provocation, but they don't attack tamed wolves unless provoked. Wolves are fearful of llamas of &lt;a href=\"%23Data%20values\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; 4 or 5 and always run away. Wolves flee from weaker llamas less often.\nTrader llamas are hostile toward &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s and all zombie variants, defending both themselves and their &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;.\nLlama spit.\nDespite the spitting being a projectile, dying from llama spit still shows the death message \"&lt;player&gt; was slain by llama/trader llama.\"\nThe spit entity must belong to an entity to do damage, meaning that a spit entity summoned by commands does no damage unless its codice_2 NBT attribute matches the UUID of an entity in loaded &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe llama spit can be deflected if hit by the player.\nLlama spit cannot pass through any blocks including (e.g. signs, open fence gates, and sugar cane) this even includes water. The spitting animation will still show the trajectory, but the spit entity that does damage will terminate on the non-solid block.\nLlama spit can be &lt;a href=\"blocking\"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreeding.\nAdult tamed llamas can be bred by being fed a &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;. The baby llama takes on the coat color of one parent at random. Its strength is chosen as a random integer between 1 and the strength of the stronger parent, inclusive. 3% of the time the resulting strength is increased by 1, but it is capped at 5.\nWhen two trader llamas are bred, the offspring wears a rug.\nSelect a row based on the stronger parent. The column shows the probability of the resulting offspring having a given strength. \nA llama's base health (15 to 30 HP) is calculated based on that of its parents, in the same way as a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;'s.\nTaming.\nLlamas can be tamed by repetitively riding them until hearts are displayed, done by pressing on the llama while holding nothing.\nTaming success depends on the llama's NBT. is a positive trait, with higher values increasing the chance of successful taming. Llamas begin with a codice_3 value of 0 and a maximum of 100. When a player rides an untamed llama, a random number from 0 to 99 is chosen. The llama gets tamed successfully if this number is less than the codice_3 value, otherwise, the codice_3 is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. codice_3 can also be increased by feeding the llama.\nTamed llamas can still retaliate at players should the player hit them. If a player kills a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt; and stays away from the trader llamas for a while, the llamas are tame when the player rides it and the player can place carpets on the llama.\nNaturally spawned trader llamas are untamed and cannot be ridden while being led by their &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;. If unleashed, they become tamable or tamed.\nA death message is displayed to a tamed llama's owner if it is killed. Tamed trader llamas will not despawn.\nTamed llamas do not spit at mobs that attack its owner, although it spits at any mob that attacks the llama.\nFeeding a llama food can alter its behavior, restoring lost health or making a baby grow faster (babies ordinarily take around 20 minutes to mature to adults). The table below lists the effects of the 2 food items llamas accept.\nTo feed a llama, hold a valid food item and press while facing the llama. Llamas can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. If the food is invalid, the player mounts the llama instead.\nSounds.\nLlamas, trader llamas, and llama spit use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nLlamas have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nLlama spit have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

If the chosen location is air and has a solid block below, a locked chest generates.\nUsage.\nThe locked chest's initial purpose was to direct players to the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Store\"&gt;Minecraft Store&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking the would result in the dialog box to the left being displayed.\nThis functionality was exclusive to Beta 1.4; all later versions did not trigger this.\nPlacement and orientation.\nLocked chests would decide their facing direction according to the blocks around them, generally making an attempt to face outward from walls. If their face was obstructed by a block, they would rotate accordingly to face away from said block.\nPrior to Beta 1.8, said behavior was standard for directional blocks such as chests and furnaces. From Beta 1.8 onward, said blocks would instead face toward the player placing them, and would not change their facing direction depending on nearby blocks. The locked chest, being an unsupported block, was not subject to this change, and retained its old behavior up until its removal, making it unique in this aspect.\nFuel.\nLocked chests could be used as &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;, lasting 1.5 items, the same as a regular &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nLocked chests did not have any unique sounds, such as an opening sound.\nIssues.\nLocked chest is a removed block and was an april fools joke, and as such issues relating to it cannot be fixed."}

It appears to be made of cracked stone in older designs, or stone with etch marks in newer designs, and the letter A has the face of a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; as a hole. Several variations exist, also containing 3D text though not always with the stone material.\nVariations.\nHistorical changes.\nMinecraft's first logo was originally showcased only at &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Persson\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt;'s personal blog \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Word%20of%20Notch\"&gt;The Word of Notch&lt;/a&gt;\". It was designed as the word \"MINECRAFT\" begin formed with &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nAn updated version of the previous logo was first seen on &lt;a href=\"Minecraft.net\"&gt;the official website&lt;/a&gt; on May 22, 2009 and it would later be used in-game when the phase of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31\"&gt;v0.31&lt;/a&gt;) started on December 23. Changes include that the logo was made brighter and a shadow was added to it. It could be seen only at the menu screen against a wall made of dirt. It was later used in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; and early Alpha versions.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.4\"&gt;Alpha 1.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, the texture of the blocks were changed from &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;. An animation was also added where the stone blocks would fall to the wall forming the word \"Minecraft\" (this feature along with the logo was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.4\"&gt;Beta 1.4&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt; unveiled Minecraft's most well known logo in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.4\"&gt;Beta 1.4&lt;/a&gt;, the previous design was replaced with a hand drawn stone-like lettering, in which the iconic face of the creeper was added to the \"A\".\nThe logo was slightly retouched in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, some of the reflections of the letters were a bit decreased. This is the design that would later be used for the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%23Official%20release\"&gt;full release of the game&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;v1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;) on November 18, 2011 and also seen in merchandise and other media.\nIn 2017, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;the PC version&lt;/a&gt; of Minecraft was renamed as the \"Java Edition\" to separate it from &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was renamed from \"&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" to just \"Minecraft\" by the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;. This logo was introduced in version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.12.2\"&gt;1.12.2&lt;/a&gt; and while most versions of Minecraft uses the main design that was established since 2015, Java Edition kept using the original with the addition of the \"Java Edition\" subtitle. The logo was modified in version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt;, the gray tone of the letters was made lighter and thick outline was added around them.\nOn August 31, 2021, one of &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt;'s workers, Ined, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/Mojang_Ined/status/1432731734110613508\"&gt;officially announced&lt;/a&gt; on his Twitter account that a flat logo would begin to be used for the franchise while the detailed one would still be used for the game itself. This change took effect on Minecraft's &lt;a href=\"Minecraft.net\"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. The logo itself looks similar to the polished logo used for &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20annual%20events%23Minecraft%20Live\"&gt;Minecraft Live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Festival\"&gt;Minecraft Festival&lt;/a&gt;, but with minor changes like the outline is thicker, the reflections in the letters were removed and the creeper face in the \"A\" was slightly altered."}

They do not affect dropped &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, or dropped non-item entities such as &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s from larger slimes or &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"infested%20blocks\"&gt;infested blocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefinition.\nCustom data packs use loot tables to change what loot can spawn in containers or drop by &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. They can either change existing loot tables or create new ones. Note that some &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;, such as bedrock, end portals and other blocks unbreakable in Survival do not have loot tables, some blocks share loot tables (namely wall and floor variants of blocks) and that certain drops, namely head drops from charged creepers and the wither's nether star, are currently not covered by loot tables.\nLoot tables belong in the following folder of a data pack's structure: \nVanilla loot tables are grouped into 4 categories: (fishing, cat morning gift, piglin bartering), , , and , with some tables being in subfolders of those. For example, the file for zombies would go in codice_1. This makes every zombie in that world use the datapack's loot table rather than the default zombie loot table.\nUsage.\nThe loot tables are structured as a String tag that determines the table to use, and a Long tag determining the seed. Containers or mobs with the same seed and table drop the same items. Loot tables do not determine the container's slot to be used; that is randomly determined based on the seed.\nFor :\nThese tags are removed once the items have been interacted with (by opening the container, breaking the container, etc.), and only then are items put in the container.\nFor &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe loot tables of mobs and containers can be altered with and . The player could also grant a loot table to an entity or drop it in the world with .\nTags.\nLoot tables are defined using the &lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; format. Below are a list of tags used.\nEntry provider.\nThe possible values for and associated extra contents:\nRecurring JSON structures within loot tables and other data pack files.\nPredicate.\nPredicates (aka. Loot conditions) are JSON structures that are used within loot tables to add requirements to a drop, pool, or function. They can also be used in standalone files (see &lt;a href=\"Predicate\"&gt;Predicate&lt;/a&gt;), where they can be called upon from multiple different contexts.\nThe specific structure of a predicate is shown on the &lt;a href=\"Predicate\"&gt;Predicate&lt;/a&gt;s page.\nItem function.\nItem functions (aka. loot functions) are used within loot tables to apply modifications to the item stack being generated, such as adjusting the stack size or adding enchantments. They can also be used in standalone files called &lt;a href=\"Item%20modifier\"&gt;Item modifier&lt;/a&gt;s, where they can be called upon to modify items in an already existing item slot within a block or entity's inventory.\nThe specific structure of an item function is shown on the &lt;a href=\"Item%20modifier\"&gt;Item modifier&lt;/a&gt;s page.\nNumber Providers.\nLoot tables use number providers in some places that accept an int or float. They can either be defined as a constant value or as an object.\nOr:\nThe possible values for and associated extra contents:\nLoot context types.\nThe field is used when loading the data pack to check whether the context parameters used by this loot table match the specified context type. The field makes it possible to check for errors in the loot table files without applying them in-game. If the loot table is used for a specific context, specifying the type field allows the game to check whether the loot table file uses parameters that will not be provided in that context.\nDepending on the type of invocation, different parameters may be supplied to predicates, loot functions and number providers. Below is a list of all possible contexts of invocation, and the parameters:"}

For example, if a player throws a Loyalty-enchanted trident while in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and goes to the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; before the trident returns, the trident stays in the Nether and does not despawn. As soon as the player returns to the Nether, the trident resumes returning to the player.\nA returning trident travels to its owner in a straight line, and can phase through all blocks and entities without hitting them. If the trident attempts to return to the player while their inventory is full, it starts circling around the player indefinitely, until an inventory slot is freed up. Multiple returning tridents can circle around a player simultaneously.\nIf the player dies while the trident is returning, the trident then drops in item form and is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29%23Despawning\"&gt;despawning&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nWhen a trident enchanted with Loyalty is thrown and comes into contact with any block or entity, it returns after a time interval to the player who threw it. Higher enchantments decrease the waiting time to return.\n, throwing a trident into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; effectively destroys the trident; it never returns because there are no blocks or entities for it to hit. , the trident returns after traveling around 15 blocks in the void. A Loyalty-enchanted trident does not return when thrown by a dispenser. If a Loyalty-enchanted trident is shot into the void by a dispenser, it does not despawn immediately like a normal trident would.\nIf commands are used to increase the enchantment level beyond 127, Loyalty no longer functions.\nIncompatibilities.\nLoyalty and &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; are mutually exclusive. If the two are combined via &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, Riptide still functions normally but the trident can no longer be thrown, unless underwater."}

On the ceiling, &lt;a href=\"vine\"&gt;vine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cave%20vines\"&gt;cave vines&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"glow%20berries\"&gt;glow berries&lt;/a&gt; grow down and light up the caves, and &lt;a href=\"spore%20blossom\"&gt;spore blossom&lt;/a&gt;s grow from the ceiling and drip water &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s.

While hostile mobs can spawn throughout the biome, many areas have a light level greater than 0 due to the pervasive &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Berries\"&gt;glow berries&lt;/a&gt;. Most hostile mobs are therefore found in large caverns more than 10 blocks high and near borders with other cave biomes.\nLush caves contain copious amount of &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, around a few thousand blocks.\nThe following &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s can naturally spawn here\uff1a\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Lush Caves.\nHistory.\n \nExternal Links.\n "}

Prior to 2020, she was known as the brand director, and before that as the director of fun. She is best known for being a part of &lt;a href=\"MINECON\"&gt;MINECON&lt;/a&gt; livestreams, where she generally welcomes people to the event, and is also a special advisor at &lt;a href=\"Block%20by%20Block\"&gt;Block by Block&lt;/a&gt;, a charity dedicated to using \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" to improve public spaces worldwide. She is generally known as the first woman to have been hired by Mojang. \nAs of Friday, October 4th, 2024, Lydia Winters has resigned from her job at Mojang Studios and is starting a brand new journey. \nEarly life.\nWinters graduated in 2008 from with a bachelor's degree in \"Elementary Education and Teaching\". She then taught fourth grade for a year before delving into photography, often shooting local weddings. Later, she discovered video blogging after attending a photography workshop, and began making daily videos about random topics. Despite her style becoming popular, which also led to her raising $10,000 for breast cancer research, she then decided to focus her videos on videogames after consulting with friends. Although Winters had played only one video game by then, \"\", she decided to play \"Minecraft\" as her friends thought it would be hilarious. On November 15, 2010, she uploaded her first video to YouTube under the name \"MinecraftChick\" as \"Minecraftgirl\" was already taken.\nCareer.\nBy June of 2011, Winters sent an email to Mojang asking if she could interview the creators of \"Minecraft\" at that year\u2019s . &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Manneh\"&gt;Carl Manneh&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of Mojang at the time, replied, asking her if she could host a portion of their booth dedicated to \"Minecraft\" on the . She accepted, and was soon at the booth in Los Angeles. Manneh was so impressed with how she acted that he had told the rest of the staff that Winters would be hired. She was then hired on June 28, 2011, and flew to Stockholm that December.\nOver time, Winters' job has evolved from being a community builder to a more senior role toward merchandising, licensing, and events. Winters says that she also had an instrumental role in adding Alex, the predominantly female character, to \"Minecraft\". As with licensing, Winters tends to avoid using gendered typecasting as a way of making \"Minecraft\" accessible to everyone, saying that she wouldn\u2019t approve descriptions of Steve and Alex if they weren\u2019t gender neutral."}

In addition, multiple mobs can sleep as part of their natural behavior. Also, the players' and mobs' hitboxes reduce to 0.2 blocks when lying.\nPlayers.\nPlayers lie down when using a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, this is the only way that a player can adopt the lying position. Players cannot move, and cannot use items while doing so, unlike with &lt;a href=\"sitting\"&gt;sitting&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of moving their arms slightly forward and back like in the idle animation, they move their arms side to side slowly.\nVillagers.\nVillagers lie down when using a bed. They can be woken and removed from their bed by either breaking the bed, pushing them out of the bed, attacking them, or pressing on the bed.\nCats.\n&lt;a href=\"Cat\"&gt;Cat&lt;/a&gt;s lie, and sleep, on beds whenever their owner is sleeping on one. They purr every 5 ticks/once when doing so.\nFoxes.\n&lt;a href=\"Fox\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;es occasionally lie down and sleep during the day, taking shelter beneath blocks when doing so. Shade is a necessity for sleeping; if a path for direct sunlight is created that lights up a sleeping fox, it immediately wakes and tries to sleep elsewhere. Foxes are currently the only &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; to switch to a texture with their eyes shut upon entering their sleeping state.\nPandas.\nLazy &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s occasionally lie on their backs. Unlike with other mobs, this is a passive action, which is unrelated to sleeping."}

People were able to vote via a Twitter poll, and the three mobs that did not win the vote were not implemented. \nMob A.\nMob A, the Barnacle, also called \"The Monster of the Ocean Depths\", is a &lt;a href=\"Squid\"&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt;-like ocean creature that sucks players down with its tentacle. The mob spawns in the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Ocean\"&gt;Deep Ocean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; and has a large mouth that it uses to propel itself through the water. &lt;a href=\"Jens%20Bergensten\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; says that viewers should vote for Mob A because there is currently not a lot of content in the oceans, and it would make a good challenge for players traveling across the ocean. Mob A was eliminated after the first poll.\n1.13 however, added whirlpools generated from magma blocks, serving a similar purpose.\nMob B.\nMob B, the Phantom, at the time known as \"The Monster of the Night Skies\", is a flying creature that seeks out and attacks players who haven't slept for 3 days. It spawns at high altitudes in the air, and attacks in groups. Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob B because there were no flying monsters in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; yet. Mob B won the vote, and was first added into the game in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; snapshot &lt;a href=\"18w07a\"&gt;18w07a&lt;/a&gt;, with the name of Phantom.\nMob C.\nMob C, \"The Great Hunger\", is a lizard-like creature that sinks into the ground, camouflages itself and consumes mobs and items with its huge mouth. It has a \"great appetite for &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; powers\" and Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob C because players may be able to use the mob's abilities to add or remove enchantments for players' own items. Mob C was eliminated after the third poll.\nThe ability to remove enchantments was later added in the form of the &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; block.\nMob D.\nMob D, The Wildfire, called \"The Hovering Inferno\" during the vote, is a type of &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;. Its body parts look like &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s and are used to defend itself from attack. This mob spawns with groups of blazes randomly and attacks the player in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; with its dangerous shock wave attack. Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob D because it would make the Nether \"even more scary and exciting\". Mob D was eliminated after the second poll.\nIt was later planned to be a part of the for \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;\", but was cut due to time constraints. A statue of it still appears in the in that game. It was then added as a mob in the .\nResults.\nAt 30 minutes into the event, Mob A lost the vote and was eliminated. 30 minutes after that, Mob D was also eliminated. After 20 more minutes, Mob B won the vote, eliminating mob C. Mob B has been released alongside \"Java Edition\" and Legacy Console Edition &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt; and alongside &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.6.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.6.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\nVideos can be found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLZHdY_46KnYtmXKAaXasDVeIdsJikHvs0\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "223599", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=223599", "title": "Mace", "text": "The mace is a slow melee &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; crafted with a &lt;a href=\"breeze%20rod\"&gt;breeze rod&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"heavy%20core\"&gt;heavy core&lt;/a&gt; that is used to deal &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, along with its unique new damage mechanic.\nObtaining.\nRepairing.\nUnit Repair.\nA mace can be repaired using &lt;a href=\"Breeze%20Rod\"&gt;Breeze Rod&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nAttacking.\nPressing attack while holding a mace inflicts damage on both mobs and other players. Upon damaging a mob or player, the mace's durability decreases by 1. \nIf the player hits a mob while falling more than 2 blocks, it deals significantly more damage depending on the distance fallen. Attacks with this new mechanic also deal knockback to the mobs in a small radius. This is called a \"smash attack.\"\nDamage.\nThe mace has an attack speed of 0.6 and a cooldown of 1.67 in . It deals base damage in both editions, but also deals extra damage depending on the distance the player has fallen before attacking.\nIf the player falls over 1.5 blocks before hitting, they perform a smash attack. Smash attacks, which can be recognized by their unique sound and particle effect, reset all vertical momentum and negate all fall damage, allowing the player to fall considerable heights without taking any damage, and also deal knockback to other entities nearby.\nSmash attacks also deal extra damage for each block fallen. For the first 3 blocks fallen, additional damage is dealt per block. For the next 5 blocks fallen, additional damage is dealt per block. For any additional blocks fallen, damage is added per block. A one-block fall only counts as a regular critical hit as it doesn't trigger a smash attack, and so, does not boost the mace's damage in this way.\nAs the damage boost from fall height does not have a limit, it is possible to kill anything in the game with a smash attack\u2014from a player in full &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; to even a &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in 1 hit. As a result, the mace is, situationally, the strongest weapon in the game.\nTechniques.\nWhile it's a risky move, attacking mobs and players with a mace from high places by jumping onto them allows players to deal lots of damage without the downside of fall damage. With &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Charge\"&gt;wind charge&lt;/a&gt;s in the off-hand and a mace in the main hand, a player can right-click and jump to launch themselves upwards, allowing them to fall enough blocks to deal considerable damage.\nA mace enchanted with Breach at its highest level can ignore over half of the damage reduction from armor, but the enchantment is only really helpful on the mace when fighting other players, as it isn't too often that mobs spawn with equipped armor and only a handful of mobs spawn naturally with armor points. Density is the better enchantment choice to go for for someone who doesn't plan on fighting other players. Its ability to deal even more damage for each block fallen makes it even more powerful when paired with wind charges or when jumping from a high place.\nEnchantments.\nThe mace has eight possible &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Density\"&gt;Density&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Breach\"&gt;Breach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Burst\"&gt;Wind Burst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt;. Density, Breach, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only have one of the four on a mace.\nUnique Enchantments.\nThe mace has three unique enchantments.\nDensity.\nIncreases the extra damage dealt by the mace for each block fallen by 0.5 per level, having a total of 5 levels.\nBreach.\nBypasses 15% of the damage reduction from &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; per level. Has a total of 4 levels.\nWind Burst.\nLaunches the user up into the air seven blocks per level after using a smash attack with the mace. Has a total of 3 levels and can only be obtained from &lt;a href=\"ominous%20vault\"&gt;ominous vault&lt;/a&gt;s."}

If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.\nNatural generation.\nOverworld.\nIn the Overworld, magma blocks generate at the bottom of water &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"underwater%20magma\"&gt;underwater magma&lt;/a&gt; features, in clusters of 1\u20138 blocks.\nMagma blocks also generate as a part of &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trial%20chambers\"&gt;trial chambers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s that are not in cold biomes. \nThe Nether.\nMagma blocks generate in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Ore%20%28feature%29\"&gt;ore feature&lt;/a&gt;s. , it attempts to generate 4 times per &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; in sizes of 0\u2013160, from &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;s Y=27 to Y=36 in all biomes.

It can replace &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagma blocks generate as part of &lt;a href=\"delta\"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt; biomes, replacing some of the lava.\nMagma blocks also generate as a part of hoglin stable and treasure room &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as all ruined portals in this dimension.\nUsage.\nDamage.\nMagma blocks damage most living entities standing on top of them, even if underwater, dealing of fire damage every &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;, which in practice is reduced to once every half-second with &lt;a href=\"damage%20immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt;. Walking into the side of a magma block doesn't cause damage. Magma blocks do not destroy &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. Damage from magma blocks does not reduce &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; armor. Because magma blocks deal fire damage, it can be reduced by &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect, and &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantments, and can be completely negated by the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect. Unlike other sources of fire damage, &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt; enchantment can also grant immunity to damage from magma blocks.\nAny mobs immune to fire damage cannot take damage from magma blocks. However, a few mobs like &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s cannot take magma block damage despite not having natural immunity to fire.\nMagma blocks do not set mobs or players on fire, and thus do not cook the animals that it kills.\nBlocks that are the &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;height&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; or lower (such as &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt;s) do not prevent a magma block from damaging mobs and players above it.\nThere are a few specific &lt;a href=\"death%20messages\"&gt;death messages&lt;/a&gt; associate with magma blocks. If a player or named pet is killed simply from standing on the block, the death message displayed in the chat is: \"[player] discovered the floor was lava\". If a player or named pet was attacked and knocked back to their death onto magma blocks, the message is: \"[player] walked into danger zone due to [player/mob]\".\nBehavior.\nMagma blocks emit a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of 3. They do not melt &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagma blocks emit smoke particles under rainfall, much like &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaking walls out of magma blocks prevents &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s from climbing them.\nMobs avoid magma blocks that are in the way. Most mobs do not spawn on magma blocks (exceptions are &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;).\nWhen a magma block's top is set on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, the fire burns indefinitely, similar to netherrack.\nBubble columns.\nWhen a water source is directly above a magma block, a &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column%23Whirlpool\"&gt;whirlpool bubble column&lt;/a&gt; is created, going down from the highest source block. Anything encountering the bubble column is pulled down, including items, boats, players, and mobs. \nA player can restore &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Drowning\"&gt;breath&lt;/a&gt; underwater by entering a magma block's bubble column.\nNote blocks.\nMagma blocks can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds."}

{"id": "18046", "revid": "55158730", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18046", "title": "Magma Cube", "text": "A magma cube is a &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. A magma cube behaves similarly to a &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;, but is fireproof, jumps higher and less often, and deals more damage.\nSpawning.\nMagma cubes spawn in areas of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; at all light levels. The space they spawn in must be clear of solid obstructions and liquids. Due to being inherently fireproof, magma cubes can spawn on &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s. \nOnly sizes 1, 2 and 4 (NBT tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally. With use of , magma cubes can potentially range from size 1 to 127 (NBT codice_1 tag 0\u2013126).\nA magma cube needs roughly a 3\u00d72.1x3 free space to spawn. The area in which they spawn must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions. When a magma cube attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large magma cube, and the size is determined later. Therefore, since large magma cubes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no magma cubes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas. Also, since large magma cubes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 3\u00d72.1x3 area, even as thin as a &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;, can prevent a magma cube of any size from spawning.\nMagma cubes' size is affected by &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.\nNether Wastes.\nMagma cubes spawn uncommonly in &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt; in groups of 1 to 4.\nNether Fortresses.\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Fortress\"&gt;nether fortresses&lt;/a&gt; in groups of 4.\nBasalt Deltas.\nMagma cubes spawn commonly in &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;, in groups of 2 to 5.\nSpawners.\nMagma cube &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s generate in the treasure room of &lt;a href=\"bastion\"&gt;bastion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDrops.\nThe maximum of can be increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;. Looting 1 averages 0.5 per kill, Looting 2 averages ~0.81 per kill, and Looting 3 averages ~1.21 per kill. Unlike a lot of common loot which picks a random number between 0 and 1 for its drop, the magma cube's drop ranges between -2 and 1 instead. This leads to the 25% drop chance from an unenchanted kill, as well as the relatively low averages with the Looting enchantment since a negative base roll can cancel out the bonus roll made by Looting.\nBehavior.\nA magma cube seeks out any &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; within a spherical distance of 16 blocks. If it finds no enemy, it changes direction every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds) and jumps forward every 40 to 120 ticks (2 to 6 seconds). If it finds a target, the delay before jumping is as long (13 to 40 ticks), and the magma cube changes direction directly toward the target before jumping.\nMagma cubes cannot be hurt by fall damage or burning, and are not slowed down by lava. They can swim upward in lava and leap above its surface. \nTheir jump height depends on their size. Their forward speed is twice that of most other mobs. They always make a distinct sound upon jumping up and landing, but no idle sounds.\nWhen a magma cube is killed, it splits into 2-4 smaller magma cubes. Tiny magma cubes disappear when killed, like other mobs.\nThey can swim in water and attempt to stay on the surface. Like &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, magma cubes starts taking &lt;a href=\"drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt; damage if submerged in water for 15 seconds, splitting into smaller cubes if possible.\nMagma cubes take extra damage from &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;, taking every two seconds, unlike for other mobs.\nUnlike most mobs, magma cubes have no pathfinding ability, meaning that they do not avoid falling off cliffs and cannot go around walls, even when chasing a player. This behavior is shared by slimes.\nWhen they are in lava, they hover and try to move to nearby land.\nCombat.\nMagma cubes attack by jumping and attempting to land on the player, and cause damage when touched anywhere. As their jump rate is random, magma cubes can be hard to fight.\nThe health of a magma cube is its size squared; the attack strength is its size + 2, and the armor points are its size tripled.\nA magma cube jumps a distance of approximately its length times 1.5 and a height equivalent to its size in blocks. This means that a large magma cube jumps 4 blocks in height and moves significantly quicker than a small magma cube, which jumps 2 blocks in height; while a tiny magma cube moves slowly and jumps 1 block in height.\nMagma cubes continuously damage all players and iron golems they collide with (although &lt;a href=\"damage%20immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt; reduces the actual damage to 2 attacks per second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack. This means that a large magma cube deals of damage per second on normal difficulty. Unlike &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, tiny magma cubes can deal damage to the player.\nSounds.\nMagma cubes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nMagma cubes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

It also serves as a farmer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"job%20site%20block\"&gt;job site block&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nComposters can be broken using any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, though an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; is the fastest. The composter does not retain the compost inside; instead, it drops empty.\nCrafting.\nComposters can only be crafted using proper &lt;a href=\"wooden%20slab\"&gt;wooden slab&lt;/a&gt;s, not &lt;a href=\"petrified%20oak%20slab\"&gt;petrified oak slab&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNatural generation.\nComposters generate in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; farms.\nUsage.\nComposters can be used to recycle &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and plant &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s (excluding &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"poisonous%20potato\"&gt;poisonous potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;) into &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. To do so, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must any of a selection of items on the composter. When an adjacent &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; is facing away from the composter, a comparator signal strength of up to 8 is emitted depending on the fullness of the &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposters appear to have an empty interior. As such, &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; can enter and exit a composter through the top, but not the sides or bottom. The composter has a \"floor\", whose height depends on the fullness. When the composter is completely empty, this floor is slightly above the block below, and when it is completely full, there is a slight dip on top. When the composter\u2019s fullness increases, any entities inside are pushed up accordingly\u200c.\nComposting.\nThe composter can be filled with compost, which is done by adding compostable &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s to it. When successfully adding an item, a green &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; () appears. The table below lists supported items, which have different levels of compost-ability. The higher the percentage of an item, the more likely it is for it to add another layer of compost. Each layer of compost has a &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;-like appearance. When the composter reaches the 7th layer of compost, the compost changes appearance indicating that &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be collected by the composter a final time.\nThe following table shows the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s that can be used in a composter, the percent chance for an item to add a level of compost, and the average number of items needed to fill a composter. Smaller pieces (individual pieces of wheat, melon slices, etc.) produce more compost than the blocks or other items that can be made from them. The exception is cookies, because each recipe produces 8 cookies, and together those give more than 3 times the compost.\nChanging profession.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; has a composter that has not been claimed by a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, any resident villager who has not already chosen a &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block has a chance to change their profession to farmer.\nRedstone component.\nA composter can act as a power source for a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;. With a composter behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;), a comparator outputs a signal strength between 0 and 8, proportional to how full the composter is: 0 for empty, 1 for full, 2 for full, and so on to 6. 7 is for completely full but the &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; is not ready to collect, and 8 for completely full and the bone meal is ready to collect. However, if there is a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; between the composter and comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\nHoppers.\nComposters can interact with &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s. A hopper directly below a composter pulls &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; from it. A hopper or dropper facing downward directly above a composter pushes &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s into it. See for more details.\nHoppers cannot interact with the sides of a composter.\nFuel.\nA composter can be used as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; to smelt 1.5 &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNote Blocks.\nComposters can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds."}

This effect restores oxygen, gives underwater night vision and increases mining speed by 16.7% (1/6th). Conduits also damage any hostile mobs, like &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"guardians\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Guardian\"&gt;elder guardians&lt;/a&gt;, within a range of 8 blocks of the conduit. Conduits can be activated in any &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; and at any height or depth.\nTo activate, a conduit needs to be in the center of a 3\u00d73\u00d73 volume of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; (source blocks, flowing water, and/or &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; blocks), which itself must be enclosed within an activation frame. The frame is built out of blocks in three 5\u00d75 open squares centered on the conduit, one around each axis. Only &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dark%20prismarine\"&gt;dark prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20bricks\"&gt;prismarine bricks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt; blocks in the frame contribute to activation. A minimum of 16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s are required and produce an effective range of 32 blocks. Prismarine-type &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s (including double slabs), &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"walls\"&gt;walls&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used to activate the conduit. Any blocks (of any type) that are not part of the activation frame itself but are in the 5\u00d75\u00d75 outer shell likewise have no effect. Once activated, removing any blocks away from the conduit (frame blocks) does deactivate the conduit.\nThe effective radius of the conduit is 16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s for every seven blocks in the frame, though the effect does not activate until the minimum of 16 blocks is included in the build. Thus, it extends to 48 at 21 blocks, 64 at 28 blocks, 80 at 35 blocks, and 96 with a complete frame of 42 blocks. A complete frame also carries the additional advantage of attacking &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s within 8 blocks of the conduit by every 2 seconds, if they are in contact with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;.\nLight source.\nConduits emit a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of 15, the brightest light level in the game, whether activated or not; including on land.\nData values.\nBlock entity.\nA conduit has a &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; associated with it that holds additional data about the block."}

The player can often get around this by pressing the ' key or sometimes the ' key while they press an F-key. To make F-keys work in macOS, go to the Apple menu \u2192 System Preferences \u2192 Keyboard and mouse and check the \"Use , etc. as normal keys.\" If the player choose the first option, they can then use the \"\" key to switch F-keys back to actions they used to do (e.g. play/pause music, etc.). The player can also use the F-keys by holding the button while pressing them.\n\"Java Edition\" uses a combination of the mouse and keyboard for controls, generically known as \"mouselook/keymove.\" Many prior games (such as DOOM and Quake) have used such a scheme, but those who have not played such a game before may need practice to get around effectively. &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode or &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; survival mode are helpful for a player to gain familiarity with the controls.\nSemi-configurable controls.\nWhile aspects of these controls can be modified to an extent, full control over them is not possible\nConfigurable controls.\nThese are controls that a user may change at their preference.\n\"Bedrock Edition\".\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse.\nThe \"Keyboard &amp; Mouse\" controls are similar to , with a few differences.

All of these controls, except the stick controls, can be changed in the Options. The Nintendo Switch version can be played with a pair of Joy-Con controllers, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Lite. It cannot be played with a single Joy-Con, as it does not have enough buttons or control sticks. If the gamepad has control sticks, then the left stick (////) would be used for moving and the right stick (////) would be used for looking.

Hence, it may be thought of as the 0,0 coordinate:\nAs the player travels south, the z-axis number increases; travel north and it decreases. Similarly, the x-axis number increases as the player travels east and decreases as you travel west. As the player's elevation rises, the y-axis number increases, and as the player's elevation lowers, that number decreases.\nAn entity's coordinates are actually the coordinates of the center at the bottom of player's collision box. When the display shows you are at Y=63, then the player's feet are at Y=63, and their eyes are at 64.62.\nBlock position.\nThe position of a block is actually the coordinates of the point at the lower northwest corner of the block, that is, the integer coordinates obtained by rounding down the coordinates inside the block.\nIn \"Minecraft\", decimal coordinates usually needs to be converted into integer coordinates by rounding down, which is called the block position of the coordinate.\nDisplaying coordinates.\n, pressing (or on Macs and some laptops or on newer Macs) brings up a &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; which gives the player's current coordinates and rotation in the upper left part of the screen. It can be disabled using the command .\n, pressing can also replace the crosshair with a display of these three directions: +X in red, +Y in green, +Z in blue (eastward, upward, and southward, respectively).\n, the block position of the player can be displayed by changing the world options. The coordinates are displayed in a box in the top left, if the \"Show Coordinates\" option is turned on in the game settings screen or is used.\nCommands.\nSome &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; use require the player to specify coordinates. They can be expressed explicitly, using absolute world coordinates, or relative to the command source, using relative world coordinates or local coordinates.\nRelative world coordinates.\nWhen specifying coordinates, each coordinate can alternatively be expressed as a relative world coordinate, written in tilde notation (codice_2). A number following a (~) describes an offset from execution position along one of the world axes, and a lone tilde assumes an offset of 0.\nFor example, the position codice_3 means \"10 blocks east (+X) and 30 blocks north (\u2013Z) of here.\" And codice_4 means the command's current position.\nRelative world coordinates can mix with absolute coordinates; for example, keeps the sender's X and Z positions unchanged but teleports them to an absolute height of 64 blocks.\nThe command can update a command's current position, changing the meaning of codice_4.\nLocal coordinates.\nThe other way to describe positions is with local coordinates, written in caret notation (codice_6).\nLike relative coordinates, these describe positions relative to where a command is executed from, but with different directions. A number following a (^) is an offset within a moving, entity-centric frame: This coordinate system is centered at the executor's position, with +Xlocal directed to its left, +Ylocal directed upward, and +Zlocal directed in the direction the sender faces. (Note that an entity with rotation codice_7 has its local frame aligned with the world frame.)\nDescribed in other terms, these coordinates express ^\u0394Sway ^\u0394Heave ^\u0394Surge\nFor example, teleports the player 5 blocks forward. If they turn around and repeat the command, they are teleported back to where they started.\n, pressing + displays the +Zlocal direction for all entities as a blue ray centered on their heads.\nLocal coordinates cannot be mixed with world coordinates (e.g. codice_8, codice_9), and attempting so alerts the typist, \"Cannot mix world &amp; local coordinates (everything must either use ^ or not).\" So such a command fails to be parsed. However, this effect can be achieved using to \"globalize\" the y coordinate, and to \"globalize\" the x and z coordinates. For example, will teleport the player 3 blocks in forward, but at the same y level.\nA command's execution position, rotation, dimension, and anchor all can change the effect of using codice_10. These can be updated by the command."}

They consist of multiple clusters of &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"coral%20fan\"&gt;coral fan&lt;/a&gt;s. These clusters come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors.\nGeneration.\n\"Java Edition\".\nThe distribution of coral reefs is noise-based, which means that in some places of &lt;a href=\"warm%20ocean\"&gt;warm ocean&lt;/a&gt; floor, the reefs are distributed densely, and in other places there's no coral reef at all.\nThere're three types of coral reefs: coral tree, coral claw, and coral mushroom. Coral tree has a main trunk and two to four branches that tend to point upwards. Coral claw has two to three branches that tend to point horizonally. Coral mushroom looks like a small hut or a domed building.\nAll these three types consist of &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coral%20fan\"&gt;coral fan&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Vegetation%23Underwater\"&gt;seagrass feature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vegetation%23Underwater\"&gt;sea pickle feature&lt;/a&gt; can generate on coral blocks because they are generated later than coral reefs. So coral reefs may have several sea pickles on them, but not all sea pickles on them belong to coral reef feature.\nBedrock Edition.\nUnlike , coral features densely cover &lt;a href=\"warm%20ocean\"&gt;warm ocean&lt;/a&gt;'s floor.\n, there're two types of coral features: huge coral and small coral.\nThere're two types of huge coral: coral (coral reefs) feature and coral crust feature. Coral feature comes in four varieties of shapes, including small clump, tree-like coral, craw-like coral, and coral spire. Coral crust feature is a huge pile of blocks including &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt;s, dead &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;s. Both the two types of huge coral have some &lt;a href=\"coral%20fan\"&gt;coral fan&lt;/a&gt;s attached on them. Unlike , there's no sea pickle in these feature, however, &lt;a href=\"Vegetation%23Underwater\"&gt;seagrass feature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vegetation%23Underwater\"&gt;sea pickle feature&lt;/a&gt; can also generate on them.\nThere're two types of small coral: sea anemone feature and coral hang feature. Sea anemone feature consists of &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coral%20fan\"&gt;coral fan&lt;/a&gt;s, generating attached to the top surface of blocks that are not lower than 16 blocks below the sea level (Y&gt;=48). Coral hang feature consists of &lt;a href=\"coral%20fan\"&gt;coral fan&lt;/a&gt;s, generating attached to a side surface of blocks that are not lower than 14 blocks below the sea level (Y&gt;=50).\nStructure.\n, coral crusts are generated with structure files, which are stored in the codice_1 folder."}

A crafter does not craft upon activation if the ingredients in the grid are arranged in an invalid recipe.\nThe slots in the crafter can be disabled so only certain slots can be filled. This allows for hoppers to load ingredients in when crafting items with a specific shape, such as &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen receiving a redstone signal, one ingredient from each slot is consumed, and the crafted result is dropped as an item out from the side of the crafter, similar to how a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; drops items.\nCrafters only craft the items once when a redstone signal activates it, similar to droppers and &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s.

These are commonly known as \"shaped\" recipes. Ingredients in shaped recipes can be \u2018moved\u2019 up, down, left, or right. They can also be flipped side-ways. For example, a 3\u00d71 recipe, such as &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3\u00d73 grid, and a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; may be made with the strings placed on the left instead of on the right.\nThere are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way. These are commonly known as \"fixed\" recipes. For example, dyes in banner recipes must be specifically placed to achieve the desired pattern. Fixed recipes can be added by &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;s or mods.\nUnlike other in-game actions such as &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, crafting is completely silent.\nRecipe book.\nThe recipe book is a mechanic in \"Minecraft\" that serves as a catalog of &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s and as a crafting guide. It shows every crafting recipe that the player has had materials for. \nCrafting recipes are organized in several different categories. The categories differ between \"Java\" and \"Bedrock\". On \"Bedrock\", categories consist of craftable items from each &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Creative inventory&lt;/a&gt; tab. On \"Java\", the categories are as follows:\nRecipe system.\nRecipes, including crafting recipes, can be configured by &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"add-on\"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt;s . There are currently 379 crafting recipes as of 1.16.\nComplete recipe list.\nTo save space, some recipes are animated (requires ). On this wiki, shapeless recipes are marked with a pair of intertwined arrows on the crafting table graphic, while fixed crafting recipes are marked by an exclamation point.

{"id": "12421", "revid": "55623690", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12421", "title": "Crash", "text": "Crashes are unexpected shutdowns of \"Minecraft\", generally caused by unhandled \"exceptions\" while running the game. When \"Minecraft\" crashes, it typically closes immediately, though it may show an error report marking the location of the exception that caused the crash instead of closing. A sign of a server crash during gameplay is a \"Saving &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Shutting down internal server\" screen.\nThe most common causes of crashes are &lt;a href=\"mod\"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt;s, pre-existing bugs, and updates. Attempting to modify the files of \"Minecraft\" or individual worlds, even with advanced editors, can also cause crashes. Crashes can also be caused by bugs in the game. Crashes can sometimes cause the corruption of save files if the player is not careful enough. Because of this, it is highly recommended that the player regularly keeps a copy of their save folder (located in the %appdata%\\.minecraft directory on Windows systems or ~/.minecraft/ in linux and also &lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/minecraft on macOS), to reduce their losses should a world become corrupted as a result of a crash. Alternatively, they could make a backup. Large &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; explosions can also cause crashes.\nCrashes used to have an error report screen, but that feature has been removed. Yet sometimes, an error report can quickly flash right before the game closes. \"Minecraft\" occasionally does this on startup, except it stays there, not allowing the player to play the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/How%20to%20get%20a%20crash%20report\"&gt;A tutorial exists&lt;/a&gt; for obtaining the report file generated by the game when it crashes so that the player can share it for diagnosis.\nCauses of crashes.\nMods.\nCrashes can easily occur due to bugged mods (particularly unfinished mod versions (alpha/beta), much of Fabric mods under certain conditions, etc.), mod conflicts (particularly in older Minecraft versions when mods used a config file to determine item/block IDs and they weren't changed by the end-user), or wrong versions of mods (for example, many of the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.10\"&gt;1.7.10&lt;/a&gt; mods are not compatible in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20data%20values\"&gt;data values&lt;/a&gt; changes introduced by &lt;a href=\"the%20Flattening\"&gt;the Flattening&lt;/a&gt;, but almost all mods for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16.2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16.3\"&gt;1.16.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16.4\"&gt;1.16.4&lt;/a&gt; can run on &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16.5\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16.5&lt;/a&gt;, as Java Edition 1.16.3 and 1.16.5 are minor updates with just minor fixes).\nIf the player has installed several mods, if using the older launcher, they should try renaming the \"bin\" directory in the \"Minecraft\" folder, then start \"Minecraft\" (Or replace the current minecraft.jar with a clean minecraft.jar from either a clean backup, download a jar file from the internet or force update the game should cause the player to get a new clean jar file.). A new bin folder is created. The player should remove the problematic mod. Now, the player should install each mod they desire one at a time, starting \"Minecraft\" and assuring that there is no crashing for each mod. Once the crashing starts occurring again, the last mod installed is likely the problem, or another mod simply does not work with it. Either way, the player should either remove the mod they determined to be causing problems, or repeat the first step, except without installing the problematic mod.\nIncorrect Java version.\nRecent versions of \"Minecraft\" require significantly newer versions of Java than versions prior to 1.16. Older versions could run on Java 6, 7, or 8, while the newer versions require Java 16 or 17. Recent Java versions broke the backward compatibility that existed up to Java 8, introducing breaking changes that stop older programs from running on newer versions of Java. If the incorrect version is used, the game will crash during startup due to \"Minecraft\" attempting to use functions and commands that aren't in the Java version the game is expecting to run on, or in later versions, crashing when it detects an incompatible version of Java.\nThe incorrect version of Java may be used by unofficial launchers, such as MultiMC or CurseForge, incorrectly detecting the wrong version of Java for the game version, or defaulting to a Java 8 installation which \"Minecraft\" 1.17 and later is not compatible with, or Java 16 or later for 1.16 or earlier. Manual configuration is required to get the launcher to use the latest compatible version of Java for the \"Minecraft\" version being played.\nHardware problems.\nProblems with the player's computer's hardware can also easily cause crashing, or buggy behavior. If this is the case, it's likely that they are experiencing problems in other, unrelated games as well. If \"Minecraft\" is the only game experiencing issues, then it is unlikely to be a hardware issue.\nIf the player is indeed experiencing crashing or visual corruption in other games as well, the first thing to check is whether their computer's vents are blocked, or clogged with dust (which inevitably occurs over time). Dust or vent/fan blockages can cause overheating, which may not be severe enough to cause problems during normal computer use, but during more intensive activities such as gaming, the temperature may spike. If the player is using a laptop, they should make sure any vents on its sides or bottom are neither blocked nor filled with dust. For a desktop, the player should check obvious fan locations for blockages, and use a flashlight to peer inside the case. If there is much dust, or any internal fans appear to not be spinning, the player should either take their computer to a repair shop for a \"tune-up\" (mention that the player suspects there is overheating problems), or read a few tutorials online related to computer cleaning (note that a computer's internal components are highly sensitive to damage from ESD (Electrostatic Discharge, basically a static shock), so it would not be difficult for the player to accidentally damage their computer).\nIf the player's computer appears to not be suffering from overheating related issues, another cause of game crashing could be a damaged component, especially either the RAM, or the video card. If the problem just recently started occurring, and the player has not recently installed any major updates or software such as Anti-Virus suites, the player may want to take their computer to a shop to have it tested, or they can do it yourself using tools such as \"memtest86+\", \"Furmark\", etc. (however these tools tend to require a medium to large amount of computer knowledge).\nIt should be noted that even if the player's computer meets the basic system requirements of \"Minecraft\", there is a possibility that their hardware might have unique issues, one being the use of Intel GMA (Graphics Media Accelerator) cards, known for issues with OpenGL. However, if the player's graphics card is one of those cards, they can still play 1.7.10 and 1.8. \nSoftware.\nThough unlikely, unrelated software can conceivably cause crashing in games such as \"Minecraft\". The most likely candidates are User Account Control (Windows), Gatekeeper (macOS), various types of Anti-Malware (i.e. Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, Firewall, etc.) software, which could either consume enough system resources to choke other resource hungry applications, or could cause issues as a result of their \"Heuristic\" real-time scanning. If the player recently installed an application such as AV software, they should try disabling it. If Minecraft stops crashing, they know the AV program is the perpetrator. The player can either remove it (not recommended for security reasons), or configure it to ignore Minecraft's folder and executable. If they are unsure of how to, they can look up some tutorials on the Internet. Alternatively, system processes can often consume a lot of resources (most infamously Windows 10). If there is too much system overhead, there is really not much one can do besides attempting to disable those processes or switch operating systems. Another certain crash is to set all the files in the .minecraft folder to read-only.\nJVM Crashes.\nJVM crashes occur when the Java Virtual Machine, the program that runs Minecraft itself, crashes. These are almost always caused by doing large, potentially groundbreaking operations like moving many blocks, exploding a lot of TNT, or other memory or processor intensive activities, and additionally almost always are caused by running out of RAM. These are unique in that the crash message is quite different, having come from the JVM's crash handler rather than Minecraft's handler. Because of this, they do not generate a crash report in the .minecraft/crash-reports directly, but rather one directly in the .minecraft folder, with name \"hs_err_pid&lt;PID&gt;.log\" where &lt;PID&gt; is the Process ID of the JVM at that time. Additionally, these crashes cannot be stopped by mods that \"catch\" Minecraft crashes, like VanillaFix.\nFor certain development versions, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20removed%20blocks%23Removed%20in%201.8%20%2814w26a%29\"&gt;certain blocks with extreme data values such as overgrown cocoa, wheat, melon and pumpkin stems&lt;/a&gt; may cause the game to crash due to the invalid block rendering, particularly development versions from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w02a\"&gt;13w02a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w09c\"&gt;13w09c&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w10a\"&gt;14w10a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w21b\"&gt;14w21b&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w14%E2%88%9E\"&gt;Java Edition 20w14\u221e&lt;/a&gt;, certain biomes in the generated dimensions may cause the game to crash, depending on the seed, due to exceptions in , such as \"bound must be positive\" and \"Exception generating new chunk\". However, since most dimensions do not contain the crashing biomes generated near the center of the world, such crashes are exceptionally rare.\nManual initialization.\nThe player can also trigger a crash manually by holding and . This is used for debugging, and is the safest possible crash.\nOn some computers, pressing enables the F3 key.\nTicking entities.\nRarely, a ticking &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; may also crash the game, either vanilla (particularly in certain development versions) or &lt;a href=\"%23Mods\"&gt;modded&lt;/a&gt;.\nTicking block entities.\nThe rarest type of crashing possible is that of a ticking &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt;. However, ticking block entities from buggy mods are very easy and common.\nOld versions.\nMinecraft &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; might trigger a NullPointerException when generating a new world of the size \"huge\". Some versions might not start and throw an exception instantly.\nServer-caused crashes.\nIt is very rare but possible for a server to cause the client to crash (particularly some of the buggy mods). Crashing a server using the world height limit crashes both the server and client. If a server has too much lag, it might randomly crash the client multiple times until it stops lagging.\nWitty comments.\nWitty comments are phrases shown at the top of crash reports generated using the process shown earlier in this article. They do not show on crash screens and are similar in nature to &lt;a href=\"splash\"&gt;splash&lt;/a&gt;es. They can be changed by changing the player's minecraft.jar .class files. They are selected using the system's time in nanoseconds.\nHopper.\nHopper is a non-publicly viewable crash report utility, operated by Mojang, which manages, stores and maintains crash reports, originally exclusively for technical Minecraft troubleshooting. In 2019, its help articles were moved to https://minecrafthopper.net and all Hopper pages are redirected to the new site. This new site is maintained by the community and contributions are welcome in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/MinecraftHopper/MinecraftHopper\"&gt;its repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;."}

For example:\nIn these circumstances, the player automatically switches to a crawling state. When enough space opens up above the player's head, the player automatically exits this state and begins standing again. In the crawling form, the player is reduced to 0.625 blocks tall, or of a block, meaning that they can crawl over blocks 0.375 blocks tall, or blocks tall, the height of a &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20Detector\"&gt;daylight detector&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaster crawling.\nWhen crawling, the player travels at &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; speed.

{"id": "76", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=76", "title": "Creative", "text": "Creative mode is one of the main &lt;a href=\"game%20modes\"&gt;game modes&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\". It strips away the survival aspects of \"Minecraft\" and allows &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s to easily create and destroy structures and mechanisms with the inclusion of an infinite use of &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"flying\"&gt;flying&lt;/a&gt;. It also changes some of the background &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, Creative mode also allows creativity, as people made many redstone builds and amazing things. \nGameplay.\nIn Creative mode, players have no visible &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar to hamper their building since they are invincible (though it is still possible to eat). Creative mode allows players to destroy all blocks instantly (including normally indestructible blocks such as &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.), provided they are not holding a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"debug%20stick\"&gt;debug stick&lt;/a&gt;. However, these blocks are not dropped and must be obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Creative%20inventory\"&gt;Creative inventory&lt;/a&gt;, or by using on the block.\nWhen continuously holding to break blocks in Creative mode, there is a 6 &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt; (0.3 second) cooldown between each block broken. This is distinct from &lt;a href=\"instant%20mining\"&gt;instant mining&lt;/a&gt; in Survival mode, where one block can be broken every game tick (0.05 second). This cooldown can be bypassed by rapidly clicking the button, allowing blocks to be broken as quickly as the player clicks.\nCreative mode gives players &lt;a href=\"Flying\"&gt;the ability to fly&lt;/a&gt;. To activate flying, double tap the key. Use the jump key to go up and the key to go down and the movement keys (the default is ) to move. The player can disable flying in mid-air by double-tapping again, causing them to drop to the ground. Touching the ground when flying disables flying , but not . Getting into a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; does not disable flying. However, getting into a boat or riding a mob such a a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Horse\"&gt;skeleton horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Llama\"&gt;trader llama&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt; will disable flying.\nPlayers in Creative mode are unable to receive &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from the vast majority of sources. , going too far into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; still kills the player; however, , the player is also immune to this (they are stopped by an invisible barrier that exists in all three dimensions). The player can fly around in the void provided they do not descend &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;more than 64 blocks below the bottom of the dimension&lt;/a&gt;. The void, the and commands and &lt;a href=\"Mods\"&gt;external editors&lt;/a&gt; are the only way to die in Creative mode. Creative players are completely invulnerable.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s still spawn as they do in other game modes, unless the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is Peaceful or when the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to , but all are passive toward the players (even if they stare at the player in strange ways). If the player enters &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; while in Creative mode, the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; still attempts to attack the player, but cannot cause any harm. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s summoned by others calling for backup attempt to attack the player, but they still cause no harm, and they stop attacking after several seconds. The player can still ignite &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce a world is created, if &lt;a href=\"cheats\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; are enabled, the game mode can be manually changed to Creative (or other game modes) with either the command, specifically by typing , or the game mode switcher (). In &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, players can be individually changed between game modes with the command available to &lt;a href=\"operator\"&gt;operator&lt;/a&gt;s. This means that individual players can play Creative mode (at the operator's discretion) on a &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; map, or vice-versa. The default game mode for new players can also be changed with the command.\nIf it is possible for the game to determine that a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; was broken by the player, it does not drop (exceptions being &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt;s if they have non-default NBT data). If the game cannot unambiguously determine how a block broke, the block drops. Mobs killed by the player in Creative still drop items, but most other entities do not. Containers also drop their contents when broken. A notable exception to the no drops rule is the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;, which, if renamed, drops itself as an item.\n, creating a new &lt;a href=\"flat\"&gt;flat&lt;/a&gt; world is always opened in Creative mode. Opening a new Creative world or opening an existing world in Creative permanently disables &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;, trophies, and leaderboard updates for that particular game, but has no other effects on &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, achievements, trophies, and leaderboard updates work only in games that have always been in Survival.\nPlayers in Creative have a longer reach for placing, destroying, and attacking than in Survival.\nCreative inventory.\nIn Creative, the normal &lt;a href=\"Inventory\"&gt;inventory screen&lt;/a&gt; is replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23Creative%20mode%20inventory\"&gt;item selection screen&lt;/a&gt;, which contains almost all &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s (with &lt;a href=\"%23Unavailable%20blocks%20and%20items\"&gt;some exceptions&lt;/a&gt;) in a tabbed interface. Some items and blocks are available only in Creative mode, such as &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s. Likewise, some blocks can be only in Creative, such as &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Java Edition\".\nIn \"Java Edition\", there are 13 tabs that are ordered from top-left to bottom right as: \nBedrock Edition.\nIn Bedrock Edition, there are five tabs, which are:\nThere is also a view tab, which can be toggled to:\nGeneral info.\nSome &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s behave differently in Creative mode. Generally, consumable items create a duplicate of themselves that remain on the same inventory slot when d. Items do not disappear or lose &lt;a href=\"Item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. For example, putting an item in an &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt; or on an &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt; does not cause it to disappear from the player's hand. Instead, the item is duplicated. It is the same for putting on &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; by right-clicking it from the player's hotbar. Buckets with contents (&lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Bucket\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bucket%20of%20aquatic%20mob\"&gt;aquatic mob&lt;/a&gt;) duplicate their contents along with their carrying respective mobs (and with &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT tags&lt;/a&gt;, if any) upon placement. &lt;a href=\"Bucket\"&gt;Empty buckets&lt;/a&gt; on the other hand, only cause &lt;a href=\"Fluid\"&gt;fluid blocks&lt;/a&gt; to disappear and do not have the capability to carry mobs.\nIn \"Java Edition\", there is a \"destroy item\" button, where items can be dragged to and deleted. + clicking on the button clears the entire inventory, including the hotbar, off-hand slot, and armor slots.\n&lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;Item entities&lt;/a&gt; can be picked up by the player, but if the hotbar is already full, the items go into the &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; inventory. If the Survival inventory is full, they're deleted upon picking up.\nJava-only Creative inventory exclusives.\nSeveral blocks can be found in the Creative inventory that are not normally available as items through vanilla Survival gameplay (excluding bedrock, chorus plant, end portal frames, farmland, spawn egg, dirt path, and the infested blocks as of the 1.17 snapshots):\nPick block.\nThe player can obtain items using . Unlike Survival, the block selected appears in the player's hotbar even if the block is not already in the hotbar or in the Survival inventory. If it is in the inventory, then the block moves out of its former slot and replaces the block/item in the active hotbar slot, with the size of the stack preserved. If the hotbar is full then the selected block replaces the block/item in the active slot.\nMost blocks give the player a copy of themselves when using . Using it on an item frame gives the player the item held inside, or the item frame itself if no item is held. Using it on a mob gives the player a spawn egg of that mob. Using it on a &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt; gives the mob type that it is; using it on custom heads gives only the mob type that was used in the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;, but without the custom skin.\nIf the player holds and presses , in addition to obtaining the item, it also preserves the block's &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT tags&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the player to place an identical copy of the block; this allows the player to duplicate items inside of chests, dispensers, and so on, and also duplicates the text on &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUnavailable blocks and items.\nThere are several blocks and a couple of items that do not appear in the Creative inventory. They can be obtained with the command and can be manually placed using command, using the IDs provided in the table below. Additionally, using on these blocks also gives them, except where noted. &lt;a href=\"Technical%20blocks\"&gt;Technical blocks&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s and off-state &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es, do not have corresponding inventory items at all and cannot be obtained without external help , and thus cannot be legitimately obtained.\nPlatform specific exclusive features.\nSome blocks and items are obtainable in Creative on one platform, but not the other. The full list blocks and items only obtainable in the Java Edition Creative Inventory can be found &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20exclusive%20features%23Creative%20inventory\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Bedrock Edition exclusive Creative Inventory blocks and items can be found &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20exclusive%20features%23Creative%20inventory\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nRepresentation in &lt;samp&gt;level.dat&lt;/samp&gt;.\nCreative mode is represented as codice_1 in codice_2 in the &lt;samp&gt;level.dat&lt;/samp&gt; file; to manually change the codice_2, the file must first be opened with an &lt;a href=\"Programs%20and%20editors/Specialized%20programs\"&gt;external NBT editor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Singleplayer\"&gt;Singleplayer&lt;/a&gt; worlds do not use this field to save the game mode the player is currently in."}

They spawn individually and in groups of up to four .\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/entityreference/examples/definitions/nestedtables/density_limit\"&gt;density limit&lt;/a&gt; of five creepers in the Overworld's \"surface\".\nDrops.\nWhen killed, creepers drop:\nBehavior.\nCreepers chase any &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; within a 16-block radius. They do not attack any other mob without provocation by being attacked first.\nWhen within 3 blocks of a player, a creeper stops moving, hisses, flashes and expands, and explodes after 1.5 seconds, destroying blocks in the area as well as significantly damaging the player. A creeper's detonation can be halted if the player leaves the blast radius, including by knocking it back, going out of the creeper's sight, or if the creeper is killed before the explosion. The distance with the player at which a creeper cancels its explosion is greater at higher &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulties&lt;/a&gt;. Normal creeper &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s have a power of 3.\nA creeper explodes only if it has an uninterrupted line of sight with the player throughout the entire 1.5-second countdown. As a result, if the creeper does not have line-of-sight with the player, it does not start hissing even at close range, even if the player is attacking it, and a detonation is canceled if it has started. The hissing sound plays in its entirety regardless of whether the explosion happens or not.\nUnlike most mobs, the creeper doesn't have an idle sound, nor does it have unique step sounds. Although it does make normal stepping and swimming sounds, it is hard for players to distinguish those from sounds they make themselves. This makes the approach of a creeper difficult for an unwary player to notice until it starts hissing. \nA creeper jumps down to a player if it can survive the fall. Creepers begin the 1.5-second countdown before falling, so an explosion occurs sooner after landing with higher falls.\nCreepers can climb up &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, and similar blocks like any other mob, but do not do so intentionally. \n a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; on a creeper forces an explosion.\nThe detection range of creepers is reduced by 50% when the player is wearing a &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;creeper head&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreepers flee from &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s within a 6-block radius, with faster movement than when pursuing a player. Cats and ocelots do not attack creepers. A creeper that has begun a detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. \nCreepers are not targeted by &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;tamed wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s. However, they are still attacked by &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s named \"Johnny\", &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s. When hit by a stray projectile (like a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;'s trident), a creeper retaliates if not already chasing a player, unless said projectile is a skeleton's arrow. When attacked by a goat, or poisoned by a &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, a creeper does not retaliate. If a creeper is attacked by any other mob, the creeper moves toward the mob that attacked it and explodes.\nWhen a creeper is inflicted with a &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;, its explosion creates an &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Potion%23Area%20Effect%20Cloud\"&gt;area effect cloud&lt;/a&gt; of the effect. \nCharged creeper.\nA charged creeper has a significantly increased explosion power.\nA charged creeper is created only when &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm%23Lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes within four blocks of a normal creeper. The lightning can be created in any way, including naturally, with the command, by a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, or attracted to a &lt;a href=\"lightning%20rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt;. Charged creepers are distinguished from normal creepers by their blue aura surrounding them.\n, a charged creeper can be summoned with the following command: codice_1\n, a charged creeper can be summoned by: \nTheir countdown timers are the same as normal creepers, both in terms of range and time. With a power of 6, an explosion caused by a charged creeper is twice as powerful as the explosion caused by a creeper. Charged creepers' explosions are 50% more powerful than an explosion of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. How close the creeper was to the lightning strike does not affect the size or power of the explosion.\nCharged creepers have the same entity ID as normal creepers. The only difference is that the value of the boolean &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Mobs\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt; is set to (true).\n, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, or other creepers causes one of those mobs to drop its corresponding &lt;a href=\"Head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;. If multiple valid mobs are killed in the explosion, the one that drops a head is chosen at random. , a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, or other creepers causes all the killed mobs to drop their corresponding heads.\nA charged creeper does not drop its own head when it explodes, although any other charged creepers or creepers killed in the explosion drop a creeper head. Players and &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s do not drop their heads, nor do mobs without corresponding mob heads, such as livestock animals.\nDisable creeper explosions.\nTo disable creeper explosions while still allowing mob griefing (e.g. for villager farms), run the following command: codice_2\nSounds.\nCreepers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nCreepers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nTrivia.\nPublicity.\nCreepers have a formidable reputation in the community because of their potential to hurt or kill even veteran players and destroy structures. Their distinct appearance and destructive abilities have made them a widely recognizable \"Minecraft\" icon. Creepers are referenced in several of the items available at the \"Minecraft\" merchandise depot, and have become an internet meme complete with fan art, webcomic references, and demotivational posters. A central part of the meme is the creeper's unofficial catchphrase derived from the mob's tendency to sneak up on the player and hiss before detonating:\n\"That'sssss a very nice &lt;random valuable object&gt; you've got there... It'd be a ssssshame if anything were to happen to it...\"\nMoe Szyslak took the appearance of a creeper and exploded in the Simpsons\u2019 home within the 17th episode of season 25.\nMerchandise.\nCreepers have been portrayed in many \"Minecraft\" products including but not limited to:\nAppearances.\n\"TV series\"\n\"Console/PC games\"\n\"Flash games\"\n\"Other games\"\n\"Other\""}

Powder snow can only be &lt;a href=\"Powder%20Snow%20Bucket\"&gt;obtained&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nNatural generation.\nPowder snow naturally generates in &lt;a href=\"grove\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"strip\"&gt;strip&lt;/a&gt; formations.\nCauldrons.\nA &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; in a snowy &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; under open sky fills with powder snow when it is &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowing&lt;/a&gt;. Powder snow can then be picked up from this cauldron with an empty &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nBucket.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow%20bucket\"&gt;powder snow bucket&lt;/a&gt; places powder snow; placed powder snow can be picked up again with an empty bucket. These actions can be automated using a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;. When picked up, breaking particles appear.\nBreaking.\nPowder snow does not drop anything when mined, even with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, and tools do not speed up mining.\nPowder snow is broken by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, or when shot with a &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted bow.\nUsage.\nEntities (except &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es) fall through powder snow without taking fall damage and move much slower in it, as they do in &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s. Powder snow does not cause &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Suffocation\"&gt;suffocation damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nMobs, &lt;a href=\"armor%20stands\"&gt;armor stands&lt;/a&gt;, and players wearing &lt;a href=\"leather%20boots\"&gt;leather boots&lt;/a&gt; do not fall through powder snow. In this case, the powder snow behaves like &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; when the player sneaks or crouches while on the block and jumps while inside of the block. It is impossible to climb out of powder snow without leather boots.\nMost walking mobs (except for &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s) treat powder snow as a normal solid block while pathfinding, similar to &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing them to voluntarily walk into it, and fall through it if possible. Goats avoid powder snow, although they are not immune to falling through it and taking freezing damage.\nIf an entity that is on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; touches powder snow, powder snow cools it down as the powder snow melts.\nBeing fully inside a block causes a thick &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; effect around the point of view. , players in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode can see through powder snow without any fogging effect.\nWhen powder snow is on top of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, the blocks below change to a snowy texture, similar to when &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; layers are on top; they revert to their default textures when the powder snow is removed. This change can be detected by &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFreezing.\nWhen an entity is inside a powder snow block, it begins to freeze, taking &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nA player submerged in powder snow sees a frosty vignette slowly fade in at the sides of the screen and the FOV slowly decreases. When the vignette is fully shown, the player begins shivering visibly. After seven seconds (140 game &lt;a href=\"ticks\"&gt;ticks&lt;/a&gt;), the player's &lt;a href=\"Heads-up%20display\"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt; change to a cyan frosty texture (), and the player begins taking damage at a rate of HP every two seconds (40 game ticks). When an entity dies of freezing damage, a &lt;a href=\"death%20messages\"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; will appear, saying \"[entity] froze to death\". If the player leaves the powder snow block, the vignette slowly fades away. A frozen player moves slower than usual until the vignette fully fades away. This is controlled by the \"TicksFrozen\" data tag, which increases by 1 every tick (to a maximum of 140) for an entity within the powder snow block. It decreases at a rate of 2 per tick after the entity leaves the powder snow block. This is currently not a separate effect when used with commands such as codice_1, and does not have its own unique art, particles, or potion.\n, players do not take freezing damage if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nWearing any piece of &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; stops the freezing effect and reverses the damage. This applies to entities that can wear armor, such as &lt;a href=\"players\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s wearing leather &lt;a href=\"horse%20armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt;. If the leather armor is put on while the entity already has the freezing effect, the effect fades away the same as if the entity exited the powder snow.\n&lt;a href=\"Snow%20golem\"&gt;Snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s are immune to freezing damage. Fire-related mobs like &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s take from freezing.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s turn into &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s instead of taking freezing damage.\nPreventing fall damage.\nSimilar to water, powdered snow resets the fall distance of players and mobs falling into it, and can be used to prevent fall damage. It is superior to water in that it can be used in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nPiston interactivity.\nDespite not being a solid block, powder snow can be pushed and pulled by pistons like most solid blocks. This makes it the only block that can be placed and retrieved by &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, while also pushable by pistons."}

A powered rail can be placed on:\nA powered rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the powered rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a powered rail to the side of the fence causes the powered rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.\nWhen placed, a powered rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a powered rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a powered rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the powered rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a powered rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a powered rail \"prefers\", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails. Unlike their unpowered counterparts, and like detector and activator rails, powered rails are always straight.\nIt cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands, which is not unintentional.\nRail.\nPowered rails (and other rails) can be used as \"roads\" for &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. A minecart that enters a powered rail's space from either end of the powered rail continues to move in the direction the powered rail is facing, but its speed may change depending on whether the powered rail is active or not (see below). A minecart that enters a powered rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the powered rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted powered rail.\nRedstone component.\nPowered rails can be used to affect the speed of minecarts that travel over them."}

However, &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s are the fastest way to break one.

For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a plate to the \"side\" of the fence causes the plate to be attached to the \"top\" of the ground next to the fence instead.\nMore information regarding placement on transparent blocks can be found at &lt;a href=\"Opacity/Placement\"&gt;Opacity/Placement&lt;/a&gt;.\nA pressure plate \"activates\" when an entity is on top of it (specifically, when the entity's collision mask intersects the bottom quarter-block of the pressure plate's space, which may include entities flying close to the ground), with a minimum activation time of 1 second.\nA stone pressure plate is activated only by &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s, while a wooden pressure plate or a weighted pressure plate is activated by all entities (including players, mobs, items, arrows, experience orbs, fishing bobs, etc.) besides snowballs.\nHeavy or light weighted pressure plates deactivate 5 redstone ticks (10 game ticks or 0.5 seconds, barring lag) after no entities are on top of it, while stone or wooden pressure plates deactivate 10 redstone ticks (20 game ticks or 1 second, barring lag) after no entities are on top of it.\nA &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; traveling on &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s activates a pressure plate next to a diagonal track but not one next to a straight track (stone pressure plates are activated only if the minecart contains a mob or player).\nWhile active, a pressure plate:\nFor stone and wooden pressure plates, the &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt; is always 15. For weighted pressure plates, the power level varies depending on the number of entities.\nThe signal strength from a weighted pressure plate does not vary with the type of entity: all entities have the same \"weight\", so two mobs produce the same strength as two dropped items. An item stack counts as a single entity, no matter how many items are in the stack. When multiple items of the same type fall on a weighted pressure plate, they may initially be separate item entities and the weighted pressure plate counts them separately, but if they then collapse into a single item stack entity the signal strength from the weighted pressure plate may go down.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow around a pressure plate without affecting it.\nA pressure plate is not solid (it is not a barrier to entity movement). A block under a pressure plate can provide a solid barrier underneath it (for mobs to walk across, items to fall on, etc.), but when a pressure plate is placed on a block with a small collision mask, such as a fence or nether brick fence, it is possible for entities to move through the pressure plate while still activating it (walking through it horizontally, or falling through it vertically). Thus, a pressure plate on a fence can be used to detect entities without stopping them (more compactly than a tripwire circuit).\nPressure plates are 0.0625 blocks high ( of a block) when inactive and 0.03125 blocks high ( of a block) when active, but because they are not solid they do not affect the position of entities \"on top\" of them, so a player on top of a pressure plate is actually standing on the block beneath it.\nPressure plates can also open &lt;a href=\"doors\"&gt;doors&lt;/a&gt;, activate &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, and power &lt;a href=\"Command%20Block\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuel.\nWooden pressure plates can be used as a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per pressure plate.\nNote Blocks.\nWooden pressure plates can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nStone pressure plates can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nSounds.\nGeneric.\nMetal.\n&lt;br&gt;\nHistory.\nPre-1.7.2 requirements.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;, weighted pressure plates could be activated only by &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s, and they required larger quantities."}

{"id": "56423", "revid": "52936326", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=56423", "title": "Prismarine", "text": " Prismarine is a type of stone that appears underwater in &lt;a href=\"ruin\"&gt;ruin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. It periodically changes color between blue and green.&lt;br&gt;\n Prismarine bricks are cyan bricks with chiseled patterns. &lt;br&gt;\n Dark prismarine is dark cyan, with a tight grid pattern.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nPrismarine only drops itself when mined with a pickaxe. If mined by any other &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, it &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; nothing.\nNatural generation.\nAll types of prismarine naturally generate as the main blocks making up &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. Normal prismarine and prismarine bricks are found in large amounts due to the size of the structure. Prismarine bricks make up the 23 pillars below the monument, and appear decoratively throughout the structure. Dark prismarine encases the 8 &lt;a href=\"gold%20block\"&gt;gold blocks&lt;/a&gt; of the dungeon, and appears in fewer decorative features. Normal prismarine can also be found in &lt;a href=\"underwater%20ruins\"&gt;underwater ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting.\nEach type of prismarine can be crafted using varying amounts of &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20shard\"&gt;prismarine shard&lt;/a&gt;s (and an &lt;a href=\"ink%20sac\"&gt;ink sac&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"black%20dye\"&gt;black dye&lt;/a&gt; in the case of dark prismarine). All of these resources can be obtained from underwater mobs.\nUsage.\nPrismarine can be used for decoration or as a high blast resistance building block.\nThe normal prismarine is uniquely useful for decoration as it has an animated texture. The cracks in prismarine slowly cycle in color through light blue, green, purple, and dark blue. The full animation for the prismarine texture changes color 22 times in an irregular sequence before the whole pattern repeats; this takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds.\nConduit power.\nPrismarine, dark prismarine and prismarine bricks can be used to activate a conduit by building a structure around it. By doing this, the &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; emits the \"Conduit Power\" effect in a certain radius, depending on how many blocks are used to power it. &lt;a href=\"Sea%20lantern\"&gt;Sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s can also be used for this purpose.\nNote Blocks.\nAll types of prismarine can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce a \"bass drum\" sound.\nHistory.\n "}

Each layer is represented as an array of floats, each with 256 elements, corresponding to the 256 (16x16) texture pixels within the block.\nAs can be seen when loading up a world with water or lava in view, the textures start as a solid color before the cellular automaton starts generating the texture.\nIndexes which end up outside of the bounds of the texture reappear at the opposite respective side.\nFor the purposes of explanation, the variables used have been named (arbitrarily) as attributes of a boiling pot of soup over a fire. The first layer represents the &lt;samp&gt;flame_heat&lt;/samp&gt; value (which can be either negative or positive), the second layer represents the &lt;samp&gt;pot_heat&lt;/samp&gt; value and the third layer represents the &lt;samp&gt;soup_heat&lt;/samp&gt; value.\nNote that and used different pseudorandom generators for generating all random numbers in the game (Java Edition using a LCG whereas Pocket Edition used a MT19937), which includes the random numbers used for water and lava.

The pre-rendered animated approach, used in 1.5 onwards, is far less precise, with only 64 different frames.\nDue to an oversight with how assets were loaded however, the item sprite for clocks couldn't be overridden by texture packs (as they are set to always load from the vanilla atlas, stored in , rather than the one of the currently active texture pack."}

However, it is impossible to reach this cap with the base Protection enchantment alone as it is impossible to obtain Protection V in &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nThe protection enchantment is applied after the armor's damage reduction. For example, 20 armor points provide a 4% * 20 = 80% damage reduction, meaning 20% of the original damage will still get through to the player. If the total protection enchantment levels on the armor adds up to 10, they provide 40% damage reduction against the 20% that made it through, or 8% additional protection (40% * 20% = 8%) for a total of 88% damage reduction.\nIf applied on wearable items that can't get the enchantment normally, such as a pair of &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; (using commands or an anvil in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode), the enchantment works as usual.\nIncompatibilities.\nProtection, &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Projectile%20Protection\"&gt;Projectile Protection&lt;/a&gt; are mutually exclusive.

Although they never seek out mobs to attack, they will defensively inflate themselves when approached too closely by &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Axolotl\"&gt;axolotls&lt;/a&gt; or non-aquatic mobs, dealing damage and inflicting &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; on them.\nSpawning.\n, pufferfish spawn in groups of 1-3 in warm, lukewarm, and deep lukewarm ocean biomes, subject to &lt;a href=\"Fish%23Spawning\"&gt;fish spawning requirements&lt;/a&gt;. If trying to spawn inside a waterlogged solid block, the pufferfish uses the bigger \"puffed\" size to determine if it collides with anything solid.\n, fish spawn underwater at around 12\u201332 blocks away from the player in groups of 3\u20135 in &lt;a href=\"warm%20ocean\"&gt;warm ocean&lt;/a&gt; biomes, and only on the surface; that is, there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top. They are considerably rarer than tropical fish, with only of fish groups or individual fish (within the warm ocean biome) spawning as pufferfish.\nDrops.\nPufferfish drop 1 of their item form when killed: \nBehavior.\nPufferfish inflate themselves when approached by the player, most mobs, and &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe player may collect a fish by a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; on it, giving the player a &lt;a href=\"Bucket%20of%20aquatic%20mob\"&gt;bucket of pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;. Fish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it. An empty bucket may be used as well.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, pufferfish don't swim in schools.\nWeaknesses.\nLike other fish, pufferfish cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around like &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s for a while until they start suffocating, and then die like &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;. they rotate when flopping. Fish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.\nAll fish are vulnerable to weapons that have the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, which also affects &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, guardians, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDefenses.\nA pufferfish inflates when approached by a player in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; mode, a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;, or any non-water mob within a 5\u00d75\u00d75 volume around the fish, going from unpuffed, then semi-puffed, to fully puffed. Pufferfish are technically passive mobs but going near one when semi-puffed or fully puffed inflicts the player/mob with three or six seconds of based on the inflation level, and touching one in its puffed or semi-puffed form deals damage separate from the Poison. \nPufferfish also instantly inflate to their fullest form after taking any kind of damage. After inflating, they slowly deflate to their normal shape as long as a threat is out of range. If the player/mob leaves the radius while the pufferfish is in its semi-puffed stage, it deflates back to normal. \n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs are unaffected by the Poison effect, but still, take damage when they come into contact with pufferfish.\nA pufferfish inflicting damage to a mob other than creeper and ghast via touching provokes that mob to retaliate.\nIn Peaceful difficulty, pufferfish do not inflict damage or Poison to player.\nSounds.\nPufferfish use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nPufferfish have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Pumpkins have the same texture on all 4 sides.\nA carved pumpkin is a carved version of a pumpkin that can be worn or used to spawn &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s. It can be made by using &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; on a pumpkin placed in the world.\nObtaining.\nNatural generation.\nPumpkins naturally generate with the terrain in most &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of &lt;a href=\"random%20patch\"&gt;random patch&lt;/a&gt;es. They require only &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s with air above (clear of any plants such as &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;), and can generate regardless whether that grass block has a layer of &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; cover. Practically speaking, this means that the occurrence of pumpkins in stony or sandy biomes, or in grassy biomes with few clear grass blocks, is comparatively rare. Each chunk has a chance to generate a pumpkin patch, making naturally-generated pumpkins rarer than &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt;. \nPumpkins naturally generate in stem farm rooms in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\n4 pumpkins generate naturally in &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;en tents in &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPumpkins generate naturally as &lt;a href=\"pile\"&gt;pile&lt;/a&gt; (and in some farms) in &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCarved pumpkins generate in rail rooms in woodland mansions, as well as in pillager outposts as a part of scarecrows.\nBreaking.\nPumpkins can be mined using any tool, but &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s are the quickest way.\nWhen a pumpkin and a carved pumpkin is pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, it breaks and drops as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;. It cannot be pulled.\nMob loot.\nThe carved pumpkin of a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained by &lt;a href=\"shearing\"&gt;shearing&lt;/a&gt; its head, revealing the golem's face. The carved pumpkin cannot be put back on the golem.\nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s can sell a pumpkin for one emerald.\nPost-generation.\nA carved pumpkin (and 4 &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20seeds\"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt;) is obtained by &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; on an uncarved pumpkin. Once carved, a pumpkin cannot be changed back to uncarved. This changes the rotation of the top texture.\nUsage.\nWhen placed, a carved pumpkin automatically faces the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarming.\nPumpkin farming strategies parallel those of &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s. Planted &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20seeds\"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt; grow a central &lt;a href=\"Pumpkin%20seeds%23Pumpkin%20Stem\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt; that, after maturing, generates pumpkins randomly on adjacent vacant dirt-based blocks (&lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coarse%20Dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rooted%20Dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20Mangrove%20Roots\"&gt;muddy mangrove roots&lt;/a&gt;). If a pumpkin is harvested without also cutting the central stalk, another pumpkin generates afterward without requiring replanting or waiting for the stalk to mature again. If a carved pumpkin is desired, simply use the shears on the pumpkin on the ground, and then harvest it as normal.\nPumpkin stems take around 10 to 30 minutes to fully develop. They require a light level of 9 or higher to grow. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used on pumpkin stems to become fully-grown, but this does not produce a pumpkin immediately.\nHelmet.\nA carved pumpkin can be equipped as a helmet without any actual &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; value. When worn, it limits the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s viewing area to a mask pattern that resembles the pumpkin's carved face. The pattern does not appear when using the &lt;a href=\"third-person%20view\"&gt;third-person view&lt;/a&gt; (toggled by by default). It also doesn't appear when the &lt;a href=\"heads-up%20display\"&gt;heads-up display&lt;/a&gt; is disabled by pressing .\nA player wearing a carved pumpkin does not aggravate &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; when looking at them.\nDispensers.\n&lt;a href=\"Dispenser\"&gt;Dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s can equip a carved pumpkin on a player, mob or &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt; with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing. It can also place the carved pumpkin as a block, if a snow or iron golem can be spawned after the pumpkin is placed.\nBuilding golems.\nCarved pumpkins can be used to make &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s as shown below. Snow golems require &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;s for their bodies, while iron golems require &lt;a href=\"iron%20block\"&gt;iron block&lt;/a&gt;s. The carved pumpkin must be placed last or the golem does not spawn. The orientation of the carved pumpkin does not matter while building an iron golem or snow golem.\nTrading.\nApprentice-level Farmer villagers buy 6 pumpkins for an emerald as part of their trades.\nApprentice-level Farmer villagers have a chance to buy 6 pumpkins for one emerald.\nEnchantments.\nCarved Pumpkins can receive the following enchantments, but only through an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposting.\nPlacing a pumpkin or carved pumpkin into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nNote blocks.\nPumpkin can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce didgeridoo sounds. This doesn't apply to carved pumpkins."}

Over time, a stem grows through several stages and, at its final growth stage, will produce &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s on any adjacent &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coarse%20Dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rooted%20Dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20Mangrove%20Roots\"&gt;muddy mangrove roots&lt;/a&gt;. If a pumpkin is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem it does not grow more pumpkins until the pumpkin is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of pumpkins. Pumpkin stems need a minimum light level of 10 in the block above the stem to grow and give pumpkins. Pumpkin seeds are affected by &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual pumpkins.\nBreeding.\nLike other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.\nTaming.\nLike other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to tame &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nComposting.\nPlacing pumpkin seeds into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nPumpkin stem.\nA pumpkin stem is the block that is planted on &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt; when pumpkin seeds are used on it. It starts underground, and rises up as the plant grows. The stem is colored green when young, and then yellow once fully grown.\nThe stem curves once a pumpkin has grown from it. A fully-grown single stem connects to any &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; in an adjacent square, thus there are 5 possible appearances to a stem. If there are multiple pumpkins it can connect to, it favors the east, then west, north, and south. When the pumpkin is removed, the stem returns to its straight shape."}

It is available to download from the &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for free. It was released on November 13, 2017.\nThe world is intended to serve as a tutorial to teach players how to use &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Stand\"&gt;Armor Stand&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Banner\"&gt;Banner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jukebox\"&gt;Jukebox&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"Fireworks\"&gt;Fireworks&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe player spawns in a wooden house containing several Chests. There is an &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Chest\"&gt;Ender Chest&lt;/a&gt; containing a &lt;a href=\"Written%20Book\"&gt;Written Book&lt;/a&gt;, which is an invitation to the player from Pete the Parrot to come to the Purple Palace. One Chest contains eighteen full stacks of &lt;a href=\"Firework%20Rocket\"&gt;Firework Rocket&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as five &lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;. A pair of signs right outside the house tell the player how to begin gliding with Elytra, as well as how to use Firework Rockets to move faster.\nTo get to the Purple Palace, the player must follow a trail of purple &lt;a href=\"Beacon\"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt; lights while flying. Optionally, off the course of the lights, the player can walk along a wooden bridge near the ground to find a small hut with a Chest containing several pieces of &lt;a href=\"Bread\"&gt;Bread&lt;/a&gt;. Further along the path of the Beacons, a statue of a &lt;a href=\"Parrot\"&gt;Parrot&lt;/a&gt; can be seen.\nThe Purple Palace is nearby. In it, the player can find several rooms containing tutorials demonstrating how to create and use various cosmetic items. A few rooms contain crafting recipes for various Banner patterns and &lt;a href=\"Firework%20Star\"&gt;Firework Star&lt;/a&gt;s, shown using &lt;a href=\"Item%20Frame\"&gt;Item Frame&lt;/a&gt;s with the necessary items provided in Chests alongside &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Table\"&gt;Crafting Table&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn another area, a Redstone contraption made of Jukeboxes is present. When activated, it plays a set of &lt;a href=\"Music%20Disc\"&gt;Music Disc&lt;/a&gt;s in order. Another area has several rows of Armor Stands, which are in various poses while holding various items. It is in this room where \u201cPete\u201d is found; Pete is a cyan Parrot.\nQuotes.\n\u201cHi there,\nYou have been invited to a Party at the Purple Palace.\nWe will be getting together later today.\nHope to see you there!\nPete the Parrot\u201d - the Invitation\n\u201dWith Elytra equipped, jump while in the air to fly!\u201d - First Sign outside the house\n\u201dWhile flying, use firework rockets to get a speed boost!\u201d - Second Sign outside the house"}

It also serves as a &lt;a href=\"weaponsmith\"&gt;weaponsmith&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"job%20site%20block\"&gt;job site block&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nGrindstones can be obtained using any &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.\nNatural generation.\nGrindstones naturally generate at &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trading%23Weaponsmith\"&gt;weaponsmiths&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nA grindstone can be oriented in different directions. In &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; it doesn't need a supporting block. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; it breaks if unsupported.\nRepairing and disenchanting.\nWhen , an interface is displayed with two input slots and one output slot.\nPlacing one &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; in an input slot forms a new \"non-enchanted\" item of the same type and durability in the output slot. Removing the item from the output slot consumes the input item and drops some &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlacing two &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s (enchanted or not) of the same type in the input slots forms a new non-enchanted item of that type and with a durability equal to the sum of the durabilities of the two input items, plus 5% of the maximum durability of that item (rounded down), up to its maximum durability. Both input items are consumed in the process. If either input item was enchanted, then removing the output item drops some &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe amount of experience dropped depends on the number of enchantments and levels of each, but it is partially random. For example, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; I gives 5-9 experience.\nAs with all non-enchanted items, the new item has no &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics%23Anvil%20uses\"&gt;prior work penalty&lt;/a&gt;. A grindstone cannot remove a &lt;a href=\"curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;. Grindstones also do not remove an item's custom name.\nIf the action is not applicable (e.g. only one non-enchanted item, or the two inputs are different items), the arrow displays a red cross like that of an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; and no item appears in the output slot.\nThe following tables show the durability bonuses of various items:\nChanging profession.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; has a grindstone that has not been claimed by a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, any villager who did not already pick a &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block has a chance to change their profession into &lt;a href=\"Trading%23Weaponsmith\"&gt;weaponsmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nExperience.\nWhen removing enchantments from items, the player gains experience equal to the minimum &lt;a href=\"Enchanting/Levels\"&gt;modified enchantment level&lt;/a&gt; of that enchantment. The final amount is a uniformly-distributed random amount between half the resulting sum (rounded up) and the sum itself.\nPiston interactivity.\nGrindstones cannot be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s or pulled by &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\""}

{"id": "56675", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=56675", "title": "Guardian", "text": "Guardians are pufferfish-like &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn in and around &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. They attack with a slow-charging laser beam, and &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;inflict retaliatory damage&lt;/a&gt; when damaged by a melee attack.\nSpawning.\nGuardians spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. They require &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, flowing or stationary, to spawn. \n guardians spawn less often in &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; open to the &lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt; than they do in covered areas (such as inside or underneath the monument). Specifically, spawning fails 95% of the time if the spawning water block is below sea level (Y=63 by default), all blocks between the spawning water block and sea level are &lt;a href=\"liquid\"&gt;liquid&lt;/a&gt; or fully transparent, and the block at sea level has a view of the sky. They can spawn only if the spawning &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; and the block below the spawning block are both water. \n, guardians are structure spawns, spawning in water source blocks in 25 pre-determined spawning columns. Guardians usually do not (or possibly never) spawn near a player. Also, guardians seem not to spawn below solid blocks such as the prismarine blocks of the monument unless there are no water source blocks available above the solid blocks. This means that guardians don't spawn inside an ocean monument until most or all of the spawning column blocks above it are unavailable (i.e., no longer water source blocks). Guardians can spawn between Y=39\u201361 (inclusive, from the monument floor to one block above its highest point). To find the X and Z coordinates of the columns, start counting from the northwest corner of the monument. That is, standing on the furthest corner prismarine block with the smallest X and Z coordinates, let's say (X, 41, Z). The coordinates of each spawning spot are in a grid at X+2, X+13, X+29, X+45, and X+55, combined with Z+2, Z+13, Z+29, Z+45, and Z+55. For example, the bottom of the most northwest column is at (X+2, 39, Z+2) and the top block belonging to the southeast corner column is at (X+55, 61, Z+55). The guardians spawn at the northwest corner of a spawning column block, which can be helpful for some guardian farming mechanics such as causing them to spawn inside of a portal where they are immediately sent to the nether.\nGuardians will spawn even if the monument has been destroyed by the player.\nDrops.\nWhen killed, guardians always drop 0-2 s. &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; increases the maximum prismarine shard drop by one per level, for a maximum of 5.\nThey also drop one of the following:\nWhen killed by the player Guardians have a 2.5% chance of dropping a random fish as an extra drop in addition to the normal fish drop. This chance is increased by 1% per &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; level, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III. This drop uses the same chances that &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; uses, resulting in a 60% chance for &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt;, a 25% chance for &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt;, a 13% chance for &lt;a href=\"pufferfish%20%28item%29\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, and a 2% chance for &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish%20%28item%29\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;. A guardian on fire drops cooked fish.\nGuardians also drop when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nGuardians swim around in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, attacking any &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt; that come into range of its laser. They swim in abrupt charges, moving their tail rapidly when doing so. When swimming, their spikes retract. When not swimming, they sink slowly and their spikes extend and quiver. \nThe guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players, and always looks directly at its target. In \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", the eye does not follow unarmored players under the effects of a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20invisibility\"&gt;potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and the guardians cannot attack them. A player can wear one piece of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; while under the effects of Invisibility and not be attacked.\nStationary guardians can be pushed by flowing water, but swimming guardians cannot. When pushed horizontally, they move significantly faster than other mobs pushed by water.\nWhen out of water, guardians squeak while flopping about. They do not suffocate in air and can live indefinitely out of water. Their spikes always extend when out of water.\nGuardians, as aquatic mobs, are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nCombat.\nGuardians have two methods of attack: a laser and a defensive attack analogous to the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Unlike most other hostile mobs, a guardian does not follow a player who moves out of sight. Instead, it simply continues swimming until the player becomes visible again to start charging its laser.\nGuardians attack players, axolotls, and squid. Otherwise, a guardian does not retaliate against mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, other than damaging the attacking mob with its natural thorns defense.\nThe laser takes 2 seconds to charge, doing no damage in the meantime. It starts out purple and fades to yellow. Once charged, the laser flashes green and deals regular damage and additional magical damage on normal difficulty. The latter bypasses armor. Guardians swim around for 3 seconds before firing again. If the target approaches while the guardian is loading its laser, it stops firing and swims away until it is at a comfortable range, at which point it continues attacking. The laser cannot be dodged or blocked by a shield and has a maximum range of 15 blocks.\nOnce the target is out of range, or if the laser is obstructed by solid blocks (including transparent blocks like glass), the guardian's laser disengages.\nGuardians deal damage each time it is hit with a melee attack while its spikes are extended, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; armor enchantment. If cornered, the guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at the player, even at point-blank range.\nSounds.\nGuardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nGuardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Suffering from amnesia, he washed ashore on a mysterious island within the Minecraft universe, and had to adapt to the internal logic to survive. After ridding the island of any hostile mobs, he decided to leave, and stumbled upon a mountain fortress owned by a second human, &lt;a href=\"Summer\"&gt;Summer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nThough not explicitly said, it is heavily implied at several points that he takes on the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;, in particular Summer (who resembles &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; herself) singling out his beard. From the perspective of Guy, he can\u2019t do anything that an actual Minecraft player wouldn\u2019t, so he never gets a full look at himself. However, he describes his body as \u201cpainted on,\u201d lacking the ability to move his fingers or position his arms in ways that aren\u2019t absolutely necessary for the game\u2019s mechanics. Most notably, instead of having a conventional inventory, he possesses a physical backpack and utility belt.\nPersonality.\nGuy is a survivalist, devoid of any memory of his origins or the world surrounding him. Initially, he starts off somewhat paranoid and bewildered, struggling to adapt to his situation and the rules that bind it. However, even early on he has a distinct sense of humor, often giving &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; and sights nicknames. A zombie, for instance, he calls \"Mr. Dead-Head\", a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; \"Boneyboy,\" a &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; a \"crabupine,\u201d &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt; a \"chick-duck,\u201d and a large hill is consistently referred to as \"Disappointment Hill.\u201d\nOver the course of his first two stories, he also becomes noticeably lonely and defensive. During the events of The Island, he befriends a number of animals; a cow he dubs Moo, a black sheep and white sheep named Flint and Cloud, and their gray offspring Rainy. He even gives his &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; the names Protector and Flash. By the time he meets Summer, he\u2019s become very attached to animals, declaring himself a vegetarian and seeing them as friends. As such, he jumps at the opportunity to meet a second human, and quickly befriends her.\nThroughout his adventures, him and Summer also notably recount scarce details of their origins. In particular, Guy instinctively recognizes &lt;a href=\"https%3A//kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/Graham\"&gt;King Graham&lt;/a&gt;, and recalls using a computer at multiple points. \u201cComputers didn\u2019t just help my life, they \"were\" my life.\u201d When he eats a &lt;a href=\"steak\"&gt;steak&lt;/a&gt;, he recalls eating another that was pink itself, \u201cand nothing past that.\u201d In Chapter 10 (\"Nothing Clears the Mind Like Sleep\"), he remembers his eyes burning, hand cramping, and sitting too much; a sleepless night."}

In this mode, the world is locked to Hard &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; cannot respawn after dying.\nFeatures.\nThe key feature of Hardcore mode is that the player is not given the option to &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt; upon &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; as they would in other game modes. Instead, there are two buttons on the death screen: \"Spectate world\" and \"Title screen\". \"Spectate world\" sets the player to &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode and respawns the player at the world's spawn point, making them able to view and explore the world only in that mode. The \"Title screen\" button simply leads the player to the main menu screen; re-opening the world simply returns the player back to the same death screen as before. &lt;a href=\"Respawn%20anchor\"&gt;Respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;s do not resurrect players in Hardcore mode. \nIn addition, Hardcore mode worlds are restricted to Hard difficulty, being the second key feature.\nWhen creating a Hardcore mode world, the \"Enable &lt;a href=\"Cheats\"&gt;Cheats&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Chest\"&gt;Bonus Chest&lt;/a&gt;\" world options are locked to OFF. On the world selection menu, Hardcore mode worlds display dark red text reading \"Hardcore Mode!\"\nHardcore mode is specific to worlds, not players; the variable determining whether the world is in Hardcore mode is saved in codice_1. Thus, the player can use (if cheats are enabled) to set themselves to &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode. Players in Creative mode while on a Hardcore mode world still see Hardcore mode's death screen upon death.\nIt is normally impossible to toggle Hardcore mode once the world has been created, though it is possible to use external programs such as &lt;a href=\"Programs%20and%20editors/NBTExplorer\"&gt;NBTExplorer&lt;/a&gt; to change it by setting the codice_2 tag to either 1 (hardcore) or 0 (normal).\nHowever, it is possible to enable cheats through the \"Open to LAN\" feature in the pause menu. From here, the player can, while spectating the world after death, type to bring themselves back to &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, being able to play again by cheating death.\nMultiplayer.\nHardcore mode is an option for &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, and its functions are similar to those in &lt;a href=\"singleplayer\"&gt;singleplayer&lt;/a&gt;. All players have Hardcore mode enabled \u2014 it is impossible to have some players in Hardcore and some not. Hardcore mode cannot be played in &lt;a href=\"Realms\"&gt;Realms&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Server\"&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; operators can use the command to change the game mode of themselves or another player."}

They also can generate under some &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; villages and as a part of targets/scarecrows in &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBreaking.\nHay bales can be &lt;a href=\"breaking\"&gt;mined&lt;/a&gt; using any &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, but a hoe speeds up the process.\nUsage.\nHay bales can be used as compact storage of &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;.\nFood item.\nAlthough players cannot eat hay bales, hay bales serve as a compact wheat supply for crafting food items during long periods away from other food sources. A full stack of 64 hay bales is equivalent to 192 loaves of &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; in a single inventory slot.\nAnimals.\nHay bales can be fed to &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;s to heal up to 10 hearts. They are an effective method to heal horses if the player wants to heal them in a short period of time. They also speed up the growth of foals by three minutes and baby llamas by 90 seconds.\nBreeding.\nHay bales can be used both to lead and breed llamas.\nFalling.\nFalling onto a hay bale reduces the fall damage by 80%, meaning whatever falls on a hay bale takes 20% of the normal fall damage.\nBelow are some example damages a player receives falling on a hay bale (assuming no fall damage reducing enchantments and/or status effects).\nSo it is possible to fall onto a hay bale and survive a 100 block fall (starting with full health) or even a 120 block fall (starting with full health plus 2 absorption hearts).\nCampfires.\nPlacing a hay bale under a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; makes it a signal fire, increasing the height to which its smoke particles can rise from 10 blocks to 25 blocks.\nComposting.\nPlacing a hay bale into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. Composting with hay bales is very inefficient, as the hay bale's chance to be composted is only slightly higher than wheat. For example, 900 wheat could be composted to yield 83 &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on average, but if crafted into 100 hay bales, they would only yield 12 bone meal on average\nPlacement.\nHay bales can be placed pointing in all three spatial dimensions, in the same way as a log is placed. However, there is no \"six-sided\" variant like that of the &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; block.\nNote blocks.\nHay bale can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce banjo sounds."}

The chance is increased by 1% per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III. , the chance is increased by 2% per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 8.5% with Looting III.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt; heads are always dropped by the respective mob if it dies due to a &lt;a href=\"charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creeper&lt;/a&gt;'s explosion. , if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however only one mob selected at random drops its head. If an &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is killed by a charged creeper, it does not drop its head.\nUsage.\nDecoration.\nMob heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.\nWhen placed and powered by redstone, the piglin and dragon heads plays an animation. The piglin head flaps its ears (2 times per second for the right ear and 2.5 times per second for the left ear) while the dragon head opens and closes its mouth repeatedly (2 times per second). The same animation occurs when worn by a (horizontally) moving player, zombie, skeleton, or &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt; (note: the animation does not play if the codice_1 tag is set to 1)\nWearing.\nThe player can wear heads, similarly to &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's &lt;a href=\"skin\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDisguise.\nWearing the corresponding mob head reduces the detection range for &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s (but not &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; and from the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\n, wearing any mob head or carved pumpkin makes the player invisible to other players on a locator &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithers.\n&lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;s can be spawned by placing soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, and putting 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the T. The T can be horizontal or vertical. The last block placed must be one of the three wither skeleton skulls. A dispenser can also create a wither, by placing the final skull onto soul sand directly in front of and below it.\nDispensers.\nA &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; can equip a mob head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.\n&lt;a href=\"Dispenser\"&gt;Dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s can also complete the construction of a wither.\nEnchantments.\nMob heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote blocks.\nPlacing a head above a &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt; causes the note block to play the corresponding mob's sound when activated. The only exception is the creeper head; as creepers don't make sounds, the note block plays the (hissing) sound instead.\nThe block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.\nPlayer skins.\nHuman heads have an extra usage for map makers, they can be given &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Entity%20Format\"&gt;NBT data&lt;/a&gt; so that they appear with the skin of any \"Minecraft\" account. This means if a player knows that a specific account has a head that is desired to display, the NBT data can be edited to make it appear.\nThe command to give the player a head with the skin of another player is . Commonly, this kind of head is called a custom head. \nAnother command to give the player a head with another player's skin is . \"SkinURL\" is a string encoded in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64\"&gt;Base64&lt;/a&gt; containing the URL of the player's skin. A player head saves the skin of the player from the time it was created, meaning if the player changes their skin, the head still displays the original texture.\nNote that it is therefore necessary to be connected to the internet to load the texture of a skin, whatever the property used.\nWhen they are loaded for the first time by the client, the skins textures are cached in .\nIf the client does not have access to the internet when it first loads, the player's head displays a regular head (Steve's skin) which is also cached.\nAfterwards, even if the client reconnects to the internet, in order to display the skin correctly, it is necessary to clear the cache manually by deleting the recently created files in , then restarting the game.\nWhen NBT-customized heads (with names and lores) are placed on the ground, they lose their names and given lores upon picking up. Therefore, using Ctrl + on a custom player head gives the player a head that still retains its textures, but with no lores and its name is reset to either (heads obtained by MHF-Marc's Head Format or existing players in the world) or (heads obtained by using skin URLs).\nMarc's Head Format.\n&lt;a href=\"Marc%20Watson\"&gt;Marc Watson&lt;/a&gt; created a number of accounts with specific skins so map makers could use common heads without the risk of someone changing their skins. Nowadays, since heads do not update the skin if a player changes their skin, this is not something map-makers need to worry about, though these skins are still useful. These accounts have names in the format codice_2, for example codice_3 is the name of a \"Minecraft\" user with a &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; head. MHF stands for \"Marc's Head Format\". There are also a few blocks and \"bonus\" heads, for more variety. These player heads have not been updated in compliance with the &lt;a href=\"Texture%20Update\"&gt;Texture Update&lt;/a&gt;, and are outdated.\nBecause these are names of player accounts, these heads are obtained or placed using the codice_4 tag, for instance: .\nThe following names/heads have been made available: \nData values.\nMetadata.\n, mob heads use the following data values:\nItem data.\nPlayer heads use item NBT to save the owner.\nBlock data.\nA mob head has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\"\n "}

Effects that run out sooner appear farther to the left, and effects that are about to run out start to flash. Additionally, positive effects are shown on the top, and other effects (neutral or negative) are shown on the bottom. Beacon effects have a blue (instead of gray) outline, and effects with particles hidden are not indicated in the HUD.\nRiding mobs.\nUpon mounting a &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;, the mob's health bar appears above the hunger bar. The former uses a different heart texture from the player's health bar. Upon mounting a horse or camel, the horse jump bar/camel dash bar also appears above the experience bar. When riding a &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20horse\"&gt;skeleton horse&lt;/a&gt; underwater, the oxygen bar, if necessary, appears above the mob health bar.\nOptions.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; menu, the GUI scale option changes the size of the HUD and GUI. The default setting, \"auto\", changes the size of the HUD and GUI depending on the size of the game window.\nThere is an option to hide the HUD. If the player is using keyboard controls, this can also be done with . , the \"Hide HUD\" option toggles the hotbar, crosshair, and if using touch controls, buttons. The hand, paper doll, and coordinates are separate options.\nPlayers can toggle the HUD, the effect on fancy graphics, the pumpkin \"view\" and the block hitbox by pressing the key. The key will also toggle the surrounding darkness when using the spyglass.\nThe HUD also contains the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;, which can be shown or hidden using . Pressing adds the additional pie chart showing resource allocation. Pressing shows the FPS and TPS chart.\nThe player can choose whether to use their right or left hand. This option also moves the off-hand slot to the opposite side.\nMinecraft China.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20China\"&gt;Minecraft China&lt;/a&gt;\", a \"2 button\" can be seen at the top of the screen. There is also a button to allow the player to take a screenshot or switch the camera and change voice settings.\nAt the right of the screen, a button can be seen that is used to lock walking, sprinting or sneaking. It can be useful in some situations."}

This increases the player's &lt;a href=\"exhaustion\"&gt;exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; by 6, of which 4 cost hunger. If existing, the player's saturation is used up first.\nSaturation healing.\nIf the player's hunger bar is \"completely\" filled and they have leftover &lt;a href=\"saturation\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;, this saturation gets drained, healing at a rate of every second. Just as with the hunger-based regeneration, every regenerated deducts 1.5 saturation. With the maximum amount of 20 saturation, the player can rapidly regenerate up to .\nPeaceful difficulty.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is set to Peaceful, the player regenerates at a standard rate of per second, additionally with every 4 seconds as the player's hunger bar is filled. &lt;a href=\"Chorus%20fruit\"&gt;Chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s, and suspicious stew can be eaten even when the hunger bar is full, increasing the player's regeneration even further. On the other hand, this also causes the player to lose &lt;a href=\"saturation\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt; even when changing from other difficulty levels to Peaceful mode.\nArtificial regeneration.\nPotions.\nThe player can drink a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; to regain health immediately or over time.\nPotion of Healing.\nThe potion of Healing &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;instantly regenerates&lt;/a&gt; . If it gets amplified with &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, this value increases to . In the upcoming &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Tests\"&gt;Combat Tests&lt;/a&gt;, it instantly heals per level.\nBrewing scheme:\nIt can also be turned into a &lt;a href=\"lingering%20potion\"&gt;lingering potion&lt;/a&gt; that heals up to when the player is inside an area effect. &lt;a href=\"Glowstone\"&gt;Glowstone&lt;/a&gt; amplifies healing up to .\nBrewing scheme:\nPotion of Regeneration.\nThe potion of Regeneration heals every 2.5 seconds over 45 seconds, resulting in in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to every 1.25 seconds for 0:22 seconds, whereas &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; increases the duration to 1:30/2:00 minutes, restores / \nBrewing scheme:\n Adding gunpowder to make splash potion decreases its duration, making healing less effective. Splash potion of regeneration heals every 2.5 seconds over 33 seconds, resulting in in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to every 1.25 seconds for 0:16 seconds, whereas &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; increases the duration to 1:30 minutes, restores .\nAdding Dragon Breath on splash potion to make lingering potion. Lingering potion of regeneration heals every 2.5 seconds over 11 seconds, resulting in in total. Amplifying the potion with glowstone increases this rate to every 1.25 seconds for 0.5 seconds, whereas &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; increases the duration to 0:22 / 0:30 seconds, restores .\nTipped arrow.\nTipped arrow shots from a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; inflict arrow damage and a status effect. Arrows of healing give the same effect as its potion ( for an arrow of healing I, and for an arrow of healing II). Regeneration I arrows last 5 seconds (restores ), the extended regeneration I arrows last 0:11 / 0:15 seconds (restores / ), and arrows of regeneration II give regeneration II for 0:02 seconds (restores ). However, arrow damage decreases or sometimes even nullifies the health recovered unless a weak bow shot is used or the player is wearing good armor.\nGolden apple.\nA &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; can heal the player in different ways:\nTotem of undying.\nWhen used, a totem of undying prevents the player's death and provides &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; II for 45 seconds, restoring . It also gives 40 seconds of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; II and 5 seconds of &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt; II.\nBeacon.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; is upgraded to the highest level, it can be configured to provide the Regeneration status effect. As long as a player is within the radius of such a beacon, they regenerate every 2.5 seconds.\nMob healing.\nIn contrast to the player, most &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s don't heal by themselves. Nevertheless, there are several ways to heal animals and monsters.\nPotions.\nMost mobs are healed by potions of Healing and Regeneration just like the player.\nOn the other hand, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs take \"damage\" from these potions, and healing them requires a potion of Harming. Potions of Regeneration or Poison don't affect undead mobs at all.\nRegeneration.\nRideable animals like &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20horse\"&gt;skeleton horse&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s automatically regenerate at a slow rate of about per minute.\nSpider.\n, spiders on Hard difficulty can spawn with permanent positive status effects, which can include regeneration, making the spider gradually recover health.\nVillager.\nVillagers gain 10 seconds of regeneration when new trades are unlocked. \nAdditionally , villagers recover health when waking up from bed every morning.\nIron golem.\nIron golems can be healed using &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s by right-clicking on them, restoring their health by . This cannot be done using &lt;a href=\"iron%20nugget\"&gt;iron nugget&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"iron%20block\"&gt;iron block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWitch.\nWitches use potions of Healing to heal themselves. \nAdditionally, witches throw splash potions of Healing or Regeneration at &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s during &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFeeding.\nSome animals can also be \"fed\" in order to recover a set amount of hitpoints. The following animals can be fed:\nFeeding wolf &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;pups&lt;/a&gt; not only restores \"lost\" health but can also increase their total health from the usual up to a maximum of .\nBoss healing.\nEnder dragon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; gets healed by the &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on the obsidian pillars in the End. If a crystal gets destroyed during the healing phase, though, the dragon takes 10 (5 hearts) &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nWither.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; permanently regenerates its health. If an undead mob (including a wither) gets hit by a blue wither skull, they also get healed by the provided &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither effect&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is usually based on a single row of 10 heart icons. Each full heart contains two halves, one health point each (the player normally has 20 maximum health points).\nHearts.\nHearts make up the health meter for the player in the &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; (with a different texture), and &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; modes, as well as for mobs. Each heart represents two hit points. Hit points are lost when players or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s take &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, which can be any percentage of those hearts. However, damage less than is not visible on the health bar.\nIf the health meter shows or less, it begins to shake violently, warning that the player is low on health.\nHealth can be recovered through several means, both \"naturally\" and through &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDamage is split between the health and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; bars. Each full armor point takes 8% of damage, to a maximum of 80%, rounded up. Armor points also protect less damage (and deal more hearts) with stronger attacks.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, hearts have a different texture ().\nThe &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt; effects turn hearts a sickly green color and black, respectively. On Hardcore, they turn when &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;ed and when &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;. Freezing in &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt; cause hearts to turn cyan ( on Hardcore mode).\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, the player is immune to all forms of damage. , this includes the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player's health bar is invisible while holding or wearing an item that gives negative health points that exceed the player's current health points. For example, the player's default health is 20, and if holding an item with the attribute \u221221 health, the player can take two hits before dying, regardless of how much damage these hits inflict. The first one deals enough damage to reduce health to , and the second one kills the player. If the player uses a modified item to reduce health, sometimes the death screen appears. After clicking respawn, the player would shake in the death position and this can be fixed by ceasing to use the modified item.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s are the only mobs that show their remaining health visually. &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; are the only mobs that regenerate health naturally over time.\nDeath.\nDeath occurs when all of a player or mob's health is depleted.\nUpon the death of a player, a &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; describing the cause of death is shown to everyone in that world. The death of a player's pet also creates a death message, but one that is shown only to its owner.\nThe &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; instantly brings about death, and a &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt; can be instantly killed by feeding it a &lt;a href=\"cookie\"&gt;cookie&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers and most mobs fall on their left side to the ground when killed; the death animation always lasts 20 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (1 second). &lt;a href=\"Squid\"&gt;Squid&lt;/a&gt; do not have a death animation; &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; flip upside-down; the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; ascends and explodes. When killed, mobs &lt;a href=\"Drops\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s at the location of death. they also drop &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; upon death. , once a fallen body disappears, it &lt;a href=\"Particles\"&gt;turns to dust&lt;/a&gt; and drops &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs at the disappearance location.\n, mobs still count toward the &lt;a href=\"mob%20cap\"&gt;mob cap&lt;/a&gt; during their death animation.\nPlayer effects.\nFor players, a \"You Died!\"/\"You died!\" screen (or \"Game Over!\" in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode) appears, displaying the player's &lt;a href=\"score\"&gt;score&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt;. The view of the world is tinted red, render distance is reduced to default, the camera-view slowly tilts as if falling over, shudders, and zooms in slightly. , it zooms in indefinitely. The following options appear on the screen:\nThe death screen is not shown upon death if:\nAny &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; or blocks that were in the player's &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; (except items enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Vanishing\"&gt;Curse of Vanishing&lt;/a&gt;) are &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;ped from their head, and scattered around the spot where the player died (unless the game rule is set to ). Like any &lt;a href=\"dropped%20item\"&gt;dropped item&lt;/a&gt;, these drops decay after five minutes while that &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; is loaded.\nThe player also loses any &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; accumulated, reverting the level back to 0 (unless the game rule is set to ) and drops experience orbs with a precise total value of \"player last level\" \u00d7 7 \"experience points\" (with a maximum of 100). After reaching between levels 7 and 8, the player always drops only 100 experience points regardless of level.\nThe player also loses all &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;s upon respawning, even when the game rule is set to .\nDespite the fact that dead players disappear like all other mobs, it is still possible for the player to see their own hand while in the first-person mode.\nMob health.\nSome mobs have a different amount of health depending on whether they are in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" or &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;\"Bedrock Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome mobs seem to take more hits before dying than their reported health points would suggest. This is due to the fact that these mobs have armor points, even though some cannot wear &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;."}

Walking is accomplished by pressing the assigned key to move forward, backward, or left and right. Multiple adjacent keys can also be used simultaneously to walk in a diagonal direction, but opposite keys cancel out. \nThe majority of land-based &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s move via walking.\nUsage.\nAssuming a non-slowing surface, no active status &lt;a href=\"effects\"&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, no active &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, and no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; is currently being used, walking speed is approximately 4.317\u00a0m/s, or minecraft:generic.movement_speed = 0.10000000149011612, which is about 30% slower than &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; but almost three times faster than &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalking speed can be modified by different factors. &lt;a href=\"Blocks\"&gt;Blocks&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s slow down walking, as does being inside a &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, or the liquid from \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Earth\"&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/a&gt;\". Walking speed can be increased by the &lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; effect, and is crippled or even halted by &lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; enchantment increases movement speed at a &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; cost for a player atop soul sand or &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Strider\"&gt;Depth Strider&lt;/a&gt; does likewise when under water. &lt;a href=\"Blocking\"&gt;Blocking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;eating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drinks\"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt;, charging back a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, or using an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt; also slows down player movement."}

If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.\nNatural generation.\n Cobblestone walls generate in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. They also generate in &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt; towers, and in some houses in &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20tundra\"&gt;snowy tundra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20taiga\"&gt;Snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt; villages also generate with cobblestone walls.\n Mossy cobblestone walls usually generate in pillager outposts, occasionally taking the place of cobblestone walls.\n Diorite walls may generate in snowy tundra villages.\n Sandstone and granite walls may generate in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; villages.\n Blackstone walls generate in &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s.\n Polished blackstone brick walls generate in &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s.\n Stone brick and mossy stone brick walls may generate in &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s.\n Cobbled deepslate, polished deepslate, deepslate brick, and deepslate tile walls may generate in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nWalls are one and a half &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s tall for &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; collisions, and one block tall for all other purposes, similar to &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s. This prevents players and mobs from jumping over them, while using only one actual block space. A wall occupies the center space of blocks. A wall block automatically connects to any adjacent solid block, and its top rises slightly to support any block immediately above.\nWalls are more efficient at fencing off mobs than a two-block high wall of cobblestone, costing half as many blocks, and being more space-efficient as well. However, a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; might shoot over the wall, a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; could explode if a player is standing near the wall, and a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; could still climb over the wall. \nUnlike fences, if two walls are placed one block apart diagonally, the player cannot walk between them.\nWalls connect to other walls to create a large, flat wall. They also connect horizontally to &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s. However, they do not connect to &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s can be connected though).\nNote blocks.\nWalls can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds."}

It can &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;, making natural &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s more available, less dangerous to obtain, and in some cases, &lt;a href=\"renewable\"&gt;renewable&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpawning.\nThe wandering trader appears randomly in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; with 2 &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;leash&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;trader llama&lt;/a&gt;s. They typically spawn within a 48-block radius of a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. , they also try to spawn by a claimed &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen the world is created (or updated from an older version), a counter is initialized to 24000 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (20 real-life minutes, or 1 Minecraft day). Each minute (1200 ticks), if is set to , the counter is decreased by 1200. When the counter reaches 0 it is reset to 24000 and, if is set to , an attempt may be made to spawn a wandering trader. The first time there is a 25% chance of making the attempt, which increases to 50% the second time and is 75% thereafter until a trader is spawned or no player is found for the attempt.\nWhen attempting a spawn, a random player is selected. If no player is found, no trader is spawned but the chance for future attempts is reset to 25%. If a player is found, then 90% of the time the spawn attempt immediately fails. \nIt should be noted, if there is a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; within 48 blocks of the player then the nearest such bell is used as the target location.\nAfter either of the above conditions are met: ten attempts are made to find a valid mob spawning location on the uppermost block of a random X/Z position within -48/+47 of the target location on each axis. If spawning the trader succeeds, an additional ten attempts are made for each of two trader llamas to find a position within -4/+3 of the trader. Wandering traders can still spawn if the passive &lt;a href=\"mob%20cap\"&gt;mob cap&lt;/a&gt; is full.\n, when using &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s or the &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; to spawn a wandering trader, llamas always spawn with it. Wandering traders never spawn if is set to .\nDespawning.\nA wandering trader despawns after being loaded for 48000 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (40 minutes, or 2 full \"Minecraft\" days), although ticks spent with the trading UI open are not counted. Naming the wandering trader with a &lt;a href=\"Name%20Tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; or placing the wandering trader in a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; does not prevent it from despawning. This also includes wandering traders as passengers of other mobs in \"Java Edition\", where the wandering trader still despawns if summoned on top of another mob.\nWhen a wandering trader is unloaded, either by moving into unloaded &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s or entering another &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;, its despawn timer freezes.\nBehavior.\nThe wandering trader has 6 random &lt;a href=\"trading%23Wandering%20trader%20sales\"&gt;trades&lt;/a&gt;. New trades are not unlocked after trading with it.\nAfter spawning, the wandering trader prefers to wander within 16 blocks of the initial spawning target location, even if that player leaves or the bell is removed, if not otherwise reacting to nearby players or mobs.\nThe wandering trader can sometimes form a caravan, due to wild &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s that follow the leashed trader llama(s).\nWandering traders drink a &lt;a href=\"Potion%23potion%20of%20invisibility\"&gt;potion of invisibility&lt;/a&gt; during dusk and as needed to renew the effect during the night. They also drink &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; if invisible during the day to remove the invisibility effect.\nWandering traders avoid &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and their variants, all &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt; variants, and &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es, staying at least 8 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s away. Unlike other &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, a wandering trader killed by zombies does not become a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;.\nWandering traders drink potions of invisibility if hurt by magic attacks or projectiles from hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (but not players), or when avoiding illagers, vexes, and zombies.\nWhen attacked by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, a wandering trader flees from the player as a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; would do. The &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s, however, attack the player by spitting if their master gets hit, except in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt;. The llamas stop attacking if the player is killed and respawns, if the llamas are leashed after the wandering trader is killed, or if the player gets far enough away from them for a short period of time. \nDespite their similarities to villagers, attacking or killing wandering traders does not anger &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most other villager-like mobs, wandering traders do not visually sit down when riding objects such as &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTrading.\nThe trading system is a &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; mechanic that allows &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s to buy &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, but from a wandering trader this time.\nA player can click on the wandering trader to view the items offered for sale, similar to a villager. Different offers are visible in a list, and clicking on one of the offers moves the corresponding items to the slots above the player's &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. All offers involve &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s as a currency.\nWandering traders typically sell items generated in the world or otherwise related to nature, such as &lt;a href=\"plants\"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Bucket%20of%20Mob\"&gt;buckets of fish&lt;/a&gt;. They can also trade less common items, such as &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Block\"&gt;coral blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Nautilus%20Shell\"&gt;nautilus shells&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, trades offered by wandering traders offer a way to obtain biome-specific materials, without having to travel to the specific biomes.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; purchases the same item several times, the wandering trader locks the trade, but unlike villagers, never unlocks the trade. The wandering trader can appear again around the player with new trades after a while.\nWandering traders do not have the novice-master trading system like villagers. Instead, the player can buy anything from the wandering trader without the need of unlocking the previous trades.\nWandering traders do not increase or decrease the prices of its items being sold if attacked by the player, or if the player has the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, wandering traders only sell &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, they do not buy items. Wandering traders do not have an experience bar and do not modify their offers or prices based on changing demand. This (the trade items or prices) can be changed by the player by editing the corresponding NBT data flag through the use of the command.\nWandering traders are the only &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resource\"&gt;renewable&lt;/a&gt; source of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Block\"&gt;coral blocks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Small%20Dripleaf\"&gt;small dripleaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wandering trader cannot work at a job site block and restock, even summoned with a villager profession or other villager data.\nDrops.\nA wandering trader is also a source of &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s, as it typically spawns with two leashed &lt;a href=\"trader%20llama\"&gt;trader llama&lt;/a&gt;s. These leads break and drop (at the location of the llama) if either trader or llama dies or if they are separated.\nWandering traders do not drop any loot when they despawn.\nWandering traders do not reward any experience when killed or when the player successfully trades with the wandering trader.\nSounds.\nWandering traders use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nWandering traders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

{"id": "141875", "revid": "48261769", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=141875", "title": "Warden", "text": "Warden is an extremely powerful hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; summoned by &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biome. It attacks by swinging its arms downward, dealing the strongest melee &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; of all mobs, and can also release a sonic boom attack that immediately strikes the target, piercing through obstacles and deals damage that cannot be reduced except by the &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect. Wardens are completely &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;blind&lt;/a&gt; and rely on &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor%23Vibration%20detection\"&gt;vibrations&lt;/a&gt;, smell, and touch to detect &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, and can therefore be evaded via , diversions (&lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.) and &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nWardens do not use standard mob spawning mechanics. They are instead spawned when a player activates naturally generated &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;s three times and if there isn't already another warden within 24 blocks of it. A warden spawns by emerging from the ground near the shrieker that summoned it, taking about 6.7 seconds to do so and being completely invulnerable until fully emerged. \nThe warning count for sculk shriekers is specific to each player rather than each sculk shrieker. This means that the player can activate three different shriekers in different locations and a warden emerges after the third activation. The &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; does not have an effect on warden spawning. \nUp to 20 attempts are made to spawn a warden within an 11\u00d713\u00d711 cubic area, which is centered on the shrieker. During each attempt, the game picks a random column from the y axis, then the game picks the topmost block in that column with a top surface with full collision and the block above must have no collision (the spawning warden cannot collide with any existing entities or &lt;a href=\"fluid\"&gt;liquids&lt;/a&gt;; wardens must not have water inside their spawn block, where their feet go, but they can spawn with water in the second and third block. For example, a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; flowing on top is still a valid location).\n, warden &lt;a href=\"spawning\"&gt;spawning&lt;/a&gt; can be toggled on or off with the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; .\nDrops.\nA warden &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; a single upon death, unaffected by &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;. It also drops &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; if killed by either a player or a tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nAfter spawning, wardens wander randomly around the world and move toward nearby vibrations originating from players, mobs and non-mob sources including projectiles and &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. A warden also periodically sniffs the area around it, allowing it to zero in on targets even if they don't create vibrations. As wardens sniff, pick up vibrations or are touched by other players or mobs, wardens become increasingly agitated.\nIdle.\nA warden can fit inside any space that is 1 block wide and 3 blocks tall, allowing it to chase players and mobs through small corridors.\nWardens are immune to damage from &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and do not take &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;. They pursue through blocks that are usually avoided by other mobs, including &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA warden, whether angered or not, gives 12 seconds of &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; to all players within a 20 block radius of it every 6 seconds. The souls in its chest make a low heartbeat that occurs in tandem with the Darkness effect. The heartbeat speeds up as the warden becomes increasingly agitated. A warden prefers to track down the most suspicious targets, rather than the ones closest to it.\nA warden listens to all vibrations within a 16 block radius, except those from other wardens, &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s, dying mobs and players in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode. Like with &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt;s, they cannot detect vibrations from a &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; player that is moving, &lt;a href=\"jumping\"&gt;jumping&lt;/a&gt;, falling or shooting a projectile. A warden has a 2-second cooldown between detecting vibrations.\nA warden is aware of all targetable entities within a 49\u00d751\u00d749 box around itself. If the warden has a targetable entity, is not investigating any disturbances, and is otherwise idle, it pathfinds toward the closest entity, prioritizing players over mobs. While pathfinding, the warden can begin a 'sniff' behavior and animation. This takes around 4.2 seconds and has a 5-10 seconds cooldown. A warden can still sniff out sneaking players, despite that they cannot detect vibrations from them.\nSuspense.\nWardens keep track of how angry they are at each suspect as a number from 0 to 150. When a warden notices a vibration, it adds anger to the player or mob that caused the vibration. It adds 10 anger if the vibration was from a projectile or 35 anger for other vibrations. However, if two projectiles from the same player/mob are heard by the warden within five seconds, it instead adds the full 35 anger toward that player/mob. Wardens do not add anger toward a mob/player if the projectile was shot from more than 30 blocks away, although the projectile does count toward the counter of two projectiles. Anger decays at a rate of 1 per second and immediately clears if the targeted player switches to &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; modes, the target or warden leaves the dimension, or if the target dies.\nA warden adds 35 anger toward any mob that directly touches it. This effect has a 1-second cooldown.\nWhen it finishes sniffing, a warden adds 35 anger to the nearest mob or player within 6 blocks horizontally and 20 blocks vertically, a cylindrical volume centered on the warden.\nOnce a warden reaches 80 anger with a target, it roars for 4.2 seconds, adds another 20 anger, and pursues the target. In this angered state, the warden chases the target normally despite being blind. A warden also enters its hostile state and adds 100 anger if directly attacked by a mob. If the attacking player or mob is within 5 blocks, it skips its roaring animation altogether and immediately gives chase.\nA warden is biased toward player vibrations, attacks, and contact - even if a warden is angrier at another mob, it still attacks the player first as long as they have angered the warden as well. This is not true of any other &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter 60 seconds of being \"calm\" and not detecting any vibrations or sniffing any mobs, a warden burrows back into the ground and despawns, unless it has been named. If the warden is floating on a liquid, it instead immediately despawns without any burrowing animation. During its emerging/burrowing animation, a warden cannot detect any vibrations, and can take damage only from , though it can still be pushed by entities, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, or liquids. &lt;a href=\"Name%20tag\"&gt;Named&lt;/a&gt; wardens do not dig or despawn. The only exception to this rule are wardens spawned as part of a team through the command immediately digs and despawn upon spawning, ignoring everything else in the process regardless of whether it spawned with a name, with or not.\nAttacks.\nA warden's melee attack has a cooldown of 0.9 seconds and disables &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s for 5 seconds, dealing to health points depending on the difficulty.\nIf a warden cannot reach its target, it switches to its ranged attack: a sonic boom. It does so when the following are true: \nThe sonic boom aims directly at the target, making it impossible to dodge, passing through &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and other mobs without damaging them. A warden takes 1.7 seconds to charge and unleashes the attack, which instantly hits the target as long as the target is within attack range. The attack takes an additional 1.3 seconds to cool down before the warden can use melee attacks again for a total of 3 seconds. The sonic boom is visible via green-blue &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; that are projected out of the warden's chest. This attack bypasses &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and even the wither armor of the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. Only the &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; can reduce this attack's damage.\nSounds.\nWardens use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nWardens have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nAdvancements.\nKilling a warden doesn't count for the &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Hunter\"&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/a&gt; advancement nor is it needed to receive the &lt;a href=\"Monsters%20Hunted\"&gt;Monsters Hunted&lt;/a&gt; advancement."}

This also happens with &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWater spends most of its time as stationary, rather than flowing \u2013 regardless of its level, or whether it contains a current downward or to the side. When specifically triggered by a block update, water changes to 'flowing', updates its level, then changes back to stationary. Water springs are generated as flowing, and oceans, and rivers are generated as stationary. This happens before most types of generated structure are created, and the main cause of water \"glitches\" is that generated structures do not trigger a block update to let water flow into them.\nUsage.\nAppearance.\nWater uses a translucent animated texture that is tinted differently in different biomes. , water in cauldrons is completely opaque.\nUnlike other translucent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tinted%20glass\"&gt;tinted glass&lt;/a&gt;, water shows the opposite sides of its external planes when viewed from within and from outside. However, it applies only to the top plane and four side planes; the bottom face is always unseen from above.\nSwimming.\nThe button for is the same as the button for jumping; non-swimming players and mobs sink slowly in water. Holding the swim button raises the player through the water, and when the surface is reached, the player bobs up and down. The button can be used to sink faster. The button can be used to put the player in \"swim mode\" when the player is completely submerged in water. When in swim mode, the player is horizontal and one block high. The player has an arm-waving animation when viewed in third person or by other players.\nSwimming in water is considerably slower against currents (see &lt;a href=\"%23Current\"&gt;Current&lt;/a&gt; below), but faster when going with the current.\nMost mobs that can stand can also swim any time they are in water, except for &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s and undead mobs. This can lead to drowning if the water is falling from above.\nWater of any depth prevents any entity, including the player, from sustaining falling damage if they fall into it, regardless of the distance fallen.\nBeing inside of water also imparts a &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; effect, tinted accordingly.\nSpreading.\nWater spreads horizontally and downward into nearby &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; blocks. Water can spread downward infinitely until stopped by a block, and 7 blocks horizontally from a source block on a flat surface. Water spreads at a rate of 1 block every 5 game ticks, or 4 blocks per second.\nWhen spreading horizontally, a weight is assigned to every direction water can flow. For each direction, this weight is initially set to 1000. Then, for every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. Finally, water spreads in the directions with the lowest flow weight.\nSpreading water extinguishes &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and washes away certain types of items or placed blocks, causing them to drop as items and then carrying them along in the flow until the edge of the spread. Affected items include &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s (except trees), &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; and some other redstone components, &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"end%20rod\"&gt;end rod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSource blocks.\nA water source block is created from a flowing block that is horizontally adjacent to two or more other source blocks, and sitting on top of a solid block or another water source block. This allows water spawners to exist, in which a new source block immediately forms in the space left by removing a source block with a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;. Pools of still water can be created by placing water source blocks in a confined area.\nWater spawners can be constructed by arranging for two source blocks to flow into a third block. Each of the examples below require two source blocks, each on opposite ends of the hole, to create a renewable water source block in between.\nWhile water source blocks only generate adjacent to solid blocks, they do not require a solid block to support them. Removing all adjacent blocks to a water source block only causes it to remain floating in the air.\n, the formation of new water sources blocks can be disabled when the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nA &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; loaded with a filled &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; places a water source block in an empty block in front of it when activated. A dispenser loaded with an empty bucket and a water source right in front of it sucks the source into the bucket when activated.\nIn snowy &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, water source blocks have a chance to turn into &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; if directly under the sky. Ice blocks under brighter light levels melt back into water source blocks (except in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;). Ice reverts to water when broken, but only if there is a solid block under it.\nCurrent.\nThe current in a water block determines both the direction it appears to flow and the direction an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; such as a player or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; is pushed from that block.\nWater with a current pushes players and &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s at a speed of about 1.39 meters per second, or 25 blocks every 18 seconds. Players that are in creative flying mode don\u2019t get pushed.\nThe horizontal current in a water block is based on a vector sum of the flows to and from that block from its four horizontal neighbors. For example, if a block receives water from the north and sends it both south and east, but borders a solid block on its west edge, then a south-southeast current exits from that block, because 2 southward flows (in and out) are combined with 1 eastward flow (out). Thus, 16 horizontal directions are possible. If a branch in a channel is 2 blocks wide at its entrance, then entities float into it rather than continuing in a straight line.\nWater blocks can create a downward current. A downward current in a water block is caused by the block below it. Most blocks that do not have a solid upper face cause downward current on above water blocks. Also, ice and falling water blocks (blocks created by spreading downward) cause downward current on the water block above. Falling water blocks have a downward current by default.\nLight.\n, every block of water reduces &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; by 1 extra level (in addition to the normal fading-out of light). , water does not cause any additional decrease for block light, but diffuses sky light, causing the light to fade with depth. Underwater visibility changes depending on the biome the player is in. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conduit%20Power\"&gt;Conduit Power&lt;/a&gt; effects increase underwater visibility.\nColor.\nWater has several colors, depending on the biome.\nBedrock Edition.\nBiome tints\n! Biome\n!Water Surface Color\n! Water Fog Color\n!Water Fog Distance\n!Water Surface Transparency\n!Block"}

The codice_1 parameter is the duration of the weather in seconds. also switches to inclement weather, or vice versa.\nWeather changing can be toggled on or off using the command. When is set to , the weather does not change indefinitely, unless altered using the command.\nEffects.\nInclement weather reduces the sky &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level, depending on the severity of the storm. Because of this, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s return to their homes until the storm passes.\nThe sky itself darkens, to the point where celestial bodies (including the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moon%23Stars\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt;) are no longer visible. The clouds darken depending on the severity of the weather; note that the clouds themselves do not precipitate. Although the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.\nRain.\nRain occurs only in biomes with a temperature of 0.15\u20130.95. Rainstorms reduce the light level to 12 in full daylight.\nRain extinguishes &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;flaming arrows&lt;/a&gt;). However, it does not extinguish fires on &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;solidify&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s that are on fire are extinguished on contact with rain; this prevents &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s from burning during the day. On the contrary, &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s may die due to their weakness to water. Endermen teleport randomly until they find a dry place. &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s that are brought into the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; take damage and eventually die from being in contact with rain.\nOther interesting effects caused by rain:\nRain &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s make noise when they hit a block, and this noise can be heard at any point within 16 blocks. These particles (along with the associated sound) can be disabled by setting Particles to \"Minimal\" in the &lt;a href=\"Options%23Video%20Settings\"&gt;Video Settings&lt;/a&gt; menu.\nSnow.\nSnowfall occurs only in biomes with a temperature less than 0.15, or above a sufficient altitude. Like rainstorms, snowfall reduces the light level to 12 in full daylight.\nAs it snows, &lt;a href=\"snow%20layer\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s regenerate over all non-transparent blocks. , these snow layers accumulate and grow over time. Snow does not cover &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;transparent blocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that any entities on fire are not extinguished upon contact with snow.\nThunderstorm.\nThunderstorms may occur in any biome. They reduces the &lt;a href=\"Light%23Internal%20light%20level\"&gt;internal sky light level&lt;/a&gt;. At noon the internal sky light level at surface is only 10. However, in mob spawning system, the light level from the sky is treated as if it were 5, allowing hostile mobs to spawn at any time of the day.\nLightning.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; occurs frequently during thunderstorms, if there is rain. It strikes randomly, creating &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;s where it strikes, igniting any nearby flammable materials, but the rain usually puts the fire out before it can spread. Note that lightning can strike only blocks that are exposed to the rain.\nLightning does not occur naturally in biomes that are too hot or dry to have rain or so cold that it snows instead of rains, but can still be summoned with a channeling trident.\nLightning deals damage to entities on normal difficulty, not including the damage done by the fire it causes. It turns creepers into &lt;a href=\"charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mooshrooms\"&gt;mooshrooms&lt;/a&gt; into their brown variants.\nLightning may randomly spawn a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Horse\"&gt;\"skeleton trap\" skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt;, with a chance of 3.75\u20137.5% on Easy, 7.5\u201320% on Normal, and 11.25\u201333.75% on Hard, depending on the &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nThunder is a sound that occurs every time lightning strikes. It can be heard by the player up to 160,000 blocks away from the position of the lightning strike. Thunder is heard instantly, regardless the player's distance from the lightning strike itself.\nLightning may be manually summoned with the command. While it is summoned as an entity, it cannot be referred to by &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Selectors\"&gt;selectors&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player throws a trident enchanted with &lt;a href=\"channeling\"&gt;channeling&lt;/a&gt; during a thunderstorm, it summons a lightning bolt at the thrown area."}

They have a 33% chance to drop a single weeping vine when broken, increased to 55% with &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; I, 77% with Fortune II, and 100% with Fortune III. They always drop a single weeping vine when broken using &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; or a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. Any segments left unsupported from above break with a 33% drop chance, regardless of the tool used. Accordingly, weeping vines are best harvested starting from the topmost block down.\nNatural generation.\nWeeping vines generate naturally inside crevices within the ceilings, or on &lt;a href=\"huge%20crimson%20fungi\"&gt;huge crimson fungi&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nPost-generation.\nA huge fungus grown by &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"crimson%20fungus\"&gt;crimson fungus&lt;/a&gt; generates weeping vines growing on it.\nEach random &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;, weeping vines have a 10% chance of growing one block downward. At default random tick speed, each fungus grows approximately every . Weeping vines stop growing once they reach the ground or when the block reaches an block state of 25, whichever is first.\nBone meal can be used to extend weeping vines and can be used anywhere in the chain to extend the whole chain. This can be useful for getting down from a high place in the nether. \nUsage.\nWeeping vines can be placed on, and grow from, the bottom of a block. The top-most vine block always has a starting age value of 0, which increments every time the block grows. If the bottom-most vine block has an age below 25, it continues to grow provided that there is free space below the vine. When the vine does grow, a new vine block with an incremented age value is placed beneath it.\nWeeping vines stop growing if &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; are on the tip.\u200c\nClimbing.\nWeeping vines can be climbed by standing in them and holding the key. If there is a solid block behind the weeping vines, the key can also be used.\nCompost.\nWeeping vines can also be used on a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;, with a 50% chance to raise the compost level by 1."}

Depowering the weird piston should make it safe again.\nIt is worth noting that this has a possibility of corrupting singleplayer worlds, and it is much safer to perform this on a hosted server as while this does still cause a server crash, there have been no recorded cases of world corruption originating from use of this method.\nAnalysis of the behaviour of metadata 6 weird pistons using 1.7 releases and 1.8 snapshots seems to reveal that they remain at data value 6 permanently, even upon loading a world, as opposed to converting to data value 14 - if they do indeed convert, this conversion is not saved."}

{"id": "106070", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=106070", "title": "Java Edition 1.3.1/List of broken features", "text": "This page details features which were broken by 12w18a's client-server logic split which remained broken into the full release of 1.3.1.\nStill broken features.\nAccurate dragon egg trails.\nWhen first implemented, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s would leave a trail of particles upon performing a teleportation. This trail of particles would lead from their initial position directly to the position they teleported to.\nLike many other particles, these stopped appearing in 12w18a for presumably similar reasons.\nWhile this functionality was said to have been fixed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.3\"&gt;1.4.3&lt;/a&gt;, the fix is flawed - the trail of particles is now completely deceptive, as while they lead away from the egg, the point it leads to is at all but a negligible subset of occasions completely different from the actual place it teleports to.\nDimension text.\nWhen entering the Nether or End, the screen would respectively display \"Entering the Nether\" or \"Entering the End\". Leaving either dimension would display \"Leaving the Nether\" or \"Leaving the End\". This no longer occurs.\nMob construction particles.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; was built, along with the snow golem, a cloak of snowflake particles would also be generated around it. Similarly, when building an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;, a burst of &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;-textured particles would also be created at the instant of its spawning. In 12w18a, these particles would no longer appear at all, and the mobs would just phase into existence with no further effects.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; was made spawnable, its spawning code also made it create snowball particles in much the same way that iron golems would. Being introduced after 12w18a, the particles produced by them never ended up able to be seen.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt;, due to changes to the breaking of blocks, particles would again be generated upon the creation of the golems and for the first time ever the wither. However, these particles are functionally and fundamentally different - where the particles were themed for the mob at first, these particles were simply the result of the constituent blocks being broken by the game, and as such were block breaking particles using the textures of the blocks in question. The actual particles for these three mobs still remain to be fixed.\nBefore:\nAfter:\nProgress bars.\nWhen generating or loading a world or entering a given dimension, a green progress bar would appear on screen under relevant text. This no longer appears. For world generation and loading this was effectively replaced with a chunk graph, but dimension loading screens still show nothing.\nGhast loading animation.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt;s were first added, they would expand slightly before shooting a fireball, similarly to a creeper about to explode. This created the effect of the ghast \"charging\" a fireball, rather than just opening its mouth and firing it. However, the effect was not properly networked from the server to the client, causing it to not work in multiplayer. As a result, when singleplayer was changed to use an internal server, the effect broke there too. The expand code was removed entirely in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinecart physics.\nPrior to the client-server split, minecarts were capable of pushing players, and would react immediately and change direction when pushed. However, minecarts no longer push the player, and turn very sluggishly.\nFixed features.\nPortal travel sound.\nTravelling to another dimension via the use of a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; would result in a dedicated sound being played on the dimension loading screen. This sound played as expected up until 12w18a, when it stopped playing completely, teleporting the player silently. In 16w02a, this sound would now play again, however after transport to the dimension rather than on the loading screen.\nMost server-side particles.\nCertain particles were created dependent on the server, and never showed up on clients connected to said servers. As a result, several particles simply stopped appearing in 12w18a and beyond. The majority of these were eventually fixed in 19w14a.\nThe following particles stopped appearing in 12w18a:\nBefore:\nAfter:\nSaving Level text.\nIn the pause menu, the bottom left would display \"Saving level...\" for a few seconds as it saved the level. As of 21w42a, the text \"Saving world\" shows in the bottom right whenever the game autosaves, regardless of if the player is in the pause menu. This can be toggled in the video settings.\nDirectional damage tilt.\nOriginally, taking damage would cause the camera to tilt towards the direction the damage came from. However, the direction value was not properly networked from the server to the client, causing the camera to always tilt left in multiplayer. As a result, when singleplayer was changed to use an internal server, the directional tilt broke there too. The code still existed and was broken until 23w03a, despite being marked as \"Won't Fix\" on issue tracker before.\nNether portal exit animation.\nExiting a nether portal originally showed a &lt;a href=\"screen%20effect\"&gt;screen effect&lt;/a&gt; combination, in which the nausea effect would ramp down and stop and the overlay would disappear. It was occurred since 12w18a until it was fixed in 1.20 Pre-release 1.\nAs of 12w34a, the nether portal screen effects and trigger sound will play even if the player arrives on the other side of a portal, making the brokenness of this exit animation hard to spot. It is still noticeable given that this wrong animation starts weak and gets more intense as if this were a newly entered portal, rather than beginning at full intensity.\nThe table below demonstrates the historical visual behavior of entering a nether portal, with time passing going to the right. Blank spaces show where the effect does not play, an opaque nether portal texture shows when the effect is at full intensity, and a transparent nether portal texture shows where the portal animation is either accelerating or decelerating. The behavior types shown in the table are used within the following version ranges:"}

{"id": "2421", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2421", "title": "Java Edition Alpha level format", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; introduced a new data storage challenge while under development: Terrain generated in infdev has the potential to be almost 235 petabytes, which is 240,640 terabytes, in size when stored in memory, due to the sheer size of the map (several times the surface area of the Earth). Therefore, to reduce file size and memory usage, Notch decided to split the terrain into 16\u00d7128\u00d716 chunks and store them on disk when not visible. In addition, terrain is only generated when it is within the drawing distance of the player's camera, significantly reducing save size, since most players will only be able to search a tiny fraction of the map in a reasonable time frame. &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; uses this technique, and both &lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%201.0\"&gt;Minecraft 1.0&lt;/a&gt; still use the general concept because of its success.\nThe first version to use this format was &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100327\"&gt;Infdev 20100327&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.3\"&gt;Beta 1.3&lt;/a&gt;, this format was superseded by the &lt;a href=\"Region%20file%20format\"&gt;Region file format&lt;/a&gt;, where chunks are stored in groups of 32\u00d732 in region files.\nThe save format was used for all versions between inf-20100327 and Beta 1.2_02 inclusive, with the important exception of inf-20100624, which used &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100624%20level%20format\"&gt;a new save format&lt;/a&gt; which was immediately scrapped afterwards due to creating absolutely massive world files.\nWorld folder structure.\nAn Alpha level is actually a single folder containing at least one file named level.dat. There is also a &lt;a href=\"%23session.lock%20Format\"&gt;session.lock&lt;/a&gt; file to make sure only one Minecraft opens the level at once.\nThe level folder may have up to 64 subfolders, each with up to 64 additional subfolders each. These folders contain the chunk files that hold the level's terrain and entities. Each chunk file is identified by its chunk position xPos and zPos. The varying parts of the chunk file's name are obtained by taking the representation of the xPos and zPos. The names of the folders that the chunk file is placed in are found by taking xPos and zPos, modulo 64 (or bitwise ANDing with 63), and converting to base36. Negative coordinates must be interpreted as positive numbers, bitwise, via . So, -13 is treated as 243 (if its size is a byte).\nAs an example, to find the chunk at position (-13, 44):\nEach chunk remembers its position independently of the file and folder names. See &lt;a href=\"%23Chunk%20Format\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; to find out how to read a chunk's position from the file data.\nDimensions.\nDimensions are saved in the same way normal worlds are, but instead of mixing the world files inside the save folder, the files are stored in an additional sub-folders with their own region and chunk data. Their names start with codice_1, followed by the dimension ID.\nThese dimension IDs were used in Alpha:\n&lt;samp&gt;session.lock&lt;/samp&gt; format.\n&lt;samp&gt;session.lock&lt;/samp&gt; contains the timestamp of when the world was last touched. The file is eight bytes long, and contains a single 64-bit signed integer in big endian format. The value of this integer is the timestamp, stored as the number of milliseconds elapsed since 1970, in UTC.\nUnlike typical lock files, &lt;samp&gt;session.lock&lt;/samp&gt; ensures that the LAST program to open a world is that one that owns it. The process goes something like this:\n&lt;samp&gt;level.dat&lt;/samp&gt; format.\nThe &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; file is a GZip'd &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; file that stores global level data (time of day, player health, inventory, velocity, and position within the map, etc.). Most importantly, it stores the Random Seed that the terrain generator uses to seamlessly generate more terrain on the fly.\nThis file has this structure:\nChunk format.\nChunk files, as described above, are GZip'd &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; files. They have this structure:"}

{"id": "1811", "revid": "55640242", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1811", "title": "Java Edition Classic", "text": "Classic was the second phase in the &lt;a href=\"development%20cycle\"&gt;development cycle&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" (), following &lt;a href=\"pre-classic\"&gt;pre-classic&lt;/a&gt; and preceding &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;, and was the first \"Minecraft\" development stage to have some of its versions released to the public. This phase was commonly named \"alpha\" during its development until June 28, 2010, when a blog post retroactively labeled it as \"Minecraft Classic\". &lt;a href=\"Creative%23Classic%20Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gameplay%23Game%20modes\"&gt;game modes&lt;/a&gt; were introduced in this phase.\nThe release of &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode in Classic was conducted in a series of tests named &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt;. It was a very early version of the game mode. The test had a point-based system, where the player could acquire points from killing some of the game's first &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. Even after Classic was phased out, Survival Test was still playable until the website received a major overhaul on December 16, 2010, where it was quietly removed.\nClassic does not support many of the main features in the current versions such as &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; or a proper &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7\"&gt;Beta 1.7&lt;/a&gt; did not contain a \"creative\" mode, so players continued to use Classic for building things that would take too long in newer versions. The addition of &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode in &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt; rendered Classic functionality obsolete.\nIn the narrow, most commonly used sense, \"Classic\" refers to all versions between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.2a\"&gt;0.0.2a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.30\"&gt;0.30&lt;/a&gt;. In the broadest meaning, it refers to all versions between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20pre-Classic\"&gt;0.0.1a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31\"&gt;0.31&lt;/a&gt;, thus including all of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20pre-Classic\"&gt;pre-Classic&lt;/a&gt; and most of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Java Edition Indev&lt;/a&gt;.\nWebsite availability.\nThe latest version of the Classic Creative game mode was playable for free on \"Minecraft\"s website. After the release of &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; it was no longer updated and only kept for historical purposes. According to &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt;, he planned on \"slowly phasing it out\", but \"won't remove it, though. Just hide it.\" It was playable in both singleplayer and multiplayer variations.\nWith the release of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt; on September 14, 2011, Mojang removed the Classic resources directory and the addresses it was referring to for saving, possibly as a step towards phasing it out. As a result, sounds no longer worked and saving levels to the online server became impossible. Worlds that were not backed up locally were lost.\nOn August 8, 2012, the link on the website to Classic was removed, but re-added after many complaints. On July 1, 2013, because of the new launcher being able to play Classic, the link to Classic was removed again, though the page remained playable. The Classic game at that page went unsupported for some time, meanwhile, several major browsers increased their default Java security to the point where the game became essentially unplayable, until at some point between September 10 and 12 2015, the page containing Classic was itself removed entirely.\nOn May 7, 2019, a recreated JavaScript version of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.23a_01\"&gt;Java Edition Classic 0.0.23a_01&lt;/a&gt; was made available to play on the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20website\"&gt;Minecraft website&lt;/a&gt; as part of the game\u2019s tenth-anniversary celebrations."}

Additionally, many features from 0.0.12a are still present, such as using the \"generating level\" screen from that version instead of the one from 0.0.13a. This is due to it being an early development version and not the final release (see &lt;a href=\"/Development\"&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt; for more info); as it displayed 0.0.13a in the top corner, this was what it ended up being labeled as proper.

{"id": "38232", "revid": "36156286", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=38232", "title": "Mojam", "text": "The Humble Bundle Mojam was an annual charity event in which the &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; team and other developers create a series of collections (\"bundles\") of video games that are sold and distributed online at a price determined by the purchaser. Sales of bundles are split between the developers/creators, the Humble Bundle operators, and one or more charities including Child's Play, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, charity: water, and the American Red Cross, with the buyer able to set the revenue split between these groups.\nHumble Bundle Mojam.\nThe first Mojam event took place on February 17, 2012 and lasted for 60 hours. During this time, &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; crafted a brand-new game from scratch, called \"&lt;a href=\"Catacomb%20Snatch\"&gt;Catacomb Snatch&lt;/a&gt;\". Using the results of a poll in which both the most and least voted for categories were mixed together, the game features an \"RTS-shoot 'em up\" genre and \"steampunk-Ancient Egypt\" theme. The Humble Indie Bundle website featured live-stream footage of the development, and took donations; those who donated received access to the game not only once it was completed, but when the developers released stable builds during the event. The bundle also featured \"Fists of Resistance\" from Oxeye Game Studio and \"The Broadside Express\" from Wolfire Games. Oxeye Game Studio's game used the secondary options from the poll, creating a \"dungeon crawler-beat 'em up\" with a post apocalyptic World War II theme, while Wolfire Games created a game with the same genre and theme as &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios'&lt;/a&gt; \"Catacomb Snatch\".\nThe 60 hours ended with a total of over $440,000 sales, and over 79,000 bundles sold. However, the sale was temporarily extended, allowing for \"last chance\" purchases. The sale officially ended with 81,581 bundles distributed for a total of $458,329.98. All funds were distributed to four charities: Child's Play, Electronic Frontier Foundation, charity: water and the American Red Cross.\nHumble Bundle Mojam 2.\nOn February 20, 2013, &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; announced the \"Humble Bundle Mojam 2\". Much like the first Mojam, &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; took suggestions for potential game ideas and developed a game from them in 78 hours. During this Mojam, other developers including Oxeye Game Studio, Wolfire Games, Vlambeer, Grapefrukt Games, and Ludosity also are making games for the event.\nDuring the event, &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; created Nuclear Pizza War, Endless Nuclear Kittens, and Battle Frogs, as well as Mojang employees &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Toivonen\"&gt;Markus Toivonen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aron%20Nieminen\"&gt;Aron Nieminen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jon%20K%C3%A5gstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Jon K\u00e5gstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt; creating Nuke the Dinosaurs.

Announced on March 2, 2011, it aims to combine elements from trading card games and traditional board games in the strategy genre.\nIn August 2011, Mojang had been threatened with legal action by the legal team representing , with the accusation being that the original title \"Scrolls\" infringes on the \"\" trademark, a series of role-playing video games published by (a ZeniMax Media subsidiary). In mid-October 2011, the court case was won by Mojang, and one employee described the outcome as \"the court saw it from our side\". No further action was taken against Mojang, and the name \"Scrolls\" was allowed to remain.\nThe game was first made available to a limited number of people through alpha keys giveaways, starting from July 5, 2012. It then hit beta on June 3, 2013 since when it is purchasable at a discounted price. The game was fully released on December 11, 2014, on PC, Mac, and Android devices, but on June 29th, 2015, Mojang announced that development of \"Scrolls\" would cease as \"the game has reached a point where it can no longer sustain continuous development\". Servers for the game didn\u2019t shut down, however, until February 13, 2018.\nOn June 20, 2018, it was announced that the game would be released for free, along with changing the name from \"Scrolls\" to \"Caller's Bane\".\n\"Cobalt\".\n\"Main Wiki: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//cobalt.fandom.com/wiki/Cobalt_Wiki\"&gt;Cobalt Wiki&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Cobalt\" is an action game developed by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.oxeyegames.com\"&gt;Oxeye Game Studios&lt;/a&gt; and published / co-developed by Mojang.

The game also includes a map editor, and an engine that can be used to make new modes and games within it.\n\"Cobalt\" is written in , allowing for the game to be easily modifiable. The game was first made available through an alpha, starting from December 16, 2011, when it was offered at a discounted price. On August 20, 2013, \"Cobalt\" was announced to be released on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, with FatShark AB assisting with the port. \nOriginally, the game was planned to be released for PC, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PS3 in 2014, but was delayed twice to allow for more development time. The game was ultimately released for PC, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on February 2, 2016.\n\"Cobalt W.A.S.D.\".\n\"Cobalt W.A.S.D.\" (short for \"Cobalt W.A.S.D. Aim Shoot Destroy\") is an action video game developed by Oxeye Game Studios and co-developed / published by Mojang. Announced on June 1, 2017, it is a spin-off of \"Cobalt\", focusing on the Team Deathmatch mode.\nThe game was first made available in a closed beta the same day, and was originally planned to be released in August of that year. However, it was delayed to allow for more development time. The game was ultimately released for PC on November 30, 2017.\n\"Crown and Council\".\n\"Crown and Council\" is a casual strategy game fully created by &lt;a href=\"Henrik%20Pettersson\"&gt;Henrik Pettersson&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally conceived in a 72-hour game jam, and was released on April 22, 2016. It was inspired by the games ' and ', although many compare it to \"\".\nThe game puts the player in control of a nation warring against others on a tile-based map. Each turn, the player earns income based on how many conquered tiles they have, and can spend earned money to conquer other tiles or improve their own through the construction of structures like forts, villages and universities, which all provide different bonuses. The player wins a map once they have vanquished all enemies, regardless of actual remaining neutral tiles. There are 75 maps, with additional maps being procedurally generated.\nHe originally said he planned on continuing working on the game to fix bugs and add features. An update released in January 2017 added a 99-map campaign and tweaks to the procedural generation and land-taking mechanics to improve balance. The most important change was in the calculations affecting the attack and defense of territories: the element of \"randomness\" was removed, and \"attrition\" was added, meaning that failed attacks improve the chance of future attacks succeeding. This update also added OSX and Linux versions.\nGame jam games.\n\"Catacomb Snatch\".\n\"Main Wiki: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//catacombsnatch.fandom.com/wiki/Catacomb_snatch_Wiki\"&gt;Catacomb Snatch Wiki&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Catacomb Snatch\" is a game developed by Mojang as part of the first annual &lt;a href=\"Mojam\"&gt;Mojam&lt;/a&gt; charity event, which took place on February 17, 2012 and lasted for 60 hours. During this time, Mojang Studios created a brand-new game from scratch, called Catacomb Snatch. Using the results of a poll in which both the most and least voted for categories were mixed together, the game features an \"RTS-shoot 'em up\" genre and \"steampunk-Ancient Egypt\" theme. The Humble Indie Bundle website featured live-stream footage of the development, and took donations; those who donated received access to the game not only once it was completed, but when the developers released stable builds during the event.\nThe objective of the game is to collect 50 batches of treasure from a Treasure Trove located somewhere on the randomly generated map before your opponent. Players can gather money by destroying enemies such as bats, cobras, mummies and pharaohs, and collecting the coins that they drop. These coins can then be used to buy automatic turrets, coin harvesters, bombs, and rails and railcarts from your Base Camp, in order to help you defend and expand your territory, earn money, destroy obstacles, and build railways. The game can be played both against an AI opponent in singleplayer or against another player in multiplayer.\nCatacomb Snatch features a soundtrack created by &lt;a href=\"C418\"&gt;C418&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with artist Anosou, or Mattias H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m Gerdt, who also created the music for \"Cobalt\".

On April Fools' Day 2012, Mojang launched a satirical website for \"Mars Effect\", citing the lawsuit with Bethesda as an inspiration. However, the gameplay elements remained true and on April 3, 2012, Mojang revealed it as a space sandbox title.\nThe game was eventually put on hold in April of 2013 because Notch had found creative blocks. However, at the time, he was still interested in expanding the development staff to push the game toward release. Eventually, the game was indefinitely shelved on August 13, 2013, but Notch added that it could be made in the future if another Mojang employee was interested in developing it.\nOn September 15, 2014, the soundtrack for the game was released by &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Rosenfeld\"&gt;Daniel Rosenfeld&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Brickcraft\".\nFrom September 5, 2011 to July 19, 2012, Mojang was co-developing a video game titled \"Brickcraft\" (codenamed \"Project Rex Kwon Do\") alongside . Before the title had reached a significant stage of development, Mojang cancelled the collaboration to focus on developing their own titles (\"Minecraft\", \"Scrolls\", and \"0x10c\" at the time). Despite the cancellation, The Lego Group briefly considered acquiring Mojang, but according to Ronny Scherer, the senior director for the LEGO Games Asia/Pacific division, they decided against it as \"Minecraft\" \"was still emerging\" and they had \"no guarantee that it would end up becoming the cultural phenomenon that it became\".\n\"RubyDung\".\n\"RubyDung\", short for \"Rubylands Dungeon Game\", was a \"Dwarf Fortress\"-inspired game being developed by Notch in early 2009. The game would have focused on being easier to play and more accessible than its predecessor, and would have featured both isometric and first-person viewing modes. Upon discovering \"&lt;a href=\"Infiniminer\"&gt;Infiniminer&lt;/a&gt;\", Notch decided a first-person block-based game would be a better choice for the kind of gameplay he had in mind, and code and art from \"RubyDung\" was reused to create \"Minecraft\".\n\"Zombie Town\".\n\"Zombie Town\" was a \"GTA: Chinatown Wars\"-inspired game being developed by Notch in early 2009. It would have been a zombie game based on one of Notch\u2019s earlier projects, \"Left 4k Dead\". The game was never completed, but Notch later reused its character models and textures for the player character in \"Minecraft\"."}

These monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly generate up to the height limit, with natural &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; generation.\nGeneration.\nMonoliths would generate in seemingly random locations throughout the world. They tended to generate around flattish terrain. They were caused by an error in the Perlin noise generator. Specifically, the hilliness of the terrain (the \"terrain scale\") was controlled by a noise map. The reciprocal of the value of this noise was then used as the intensity of a gradient applied to the terrain. Because the reciprocal is used, flatter terrain is caused by lower values (where the terrain bias gradient drops off faster), and hillier terrain is caused by higher values. Because the reciprocals of small negative numbers are very large negative numbers, the terrain abruptly changes when zero is crossed, causing the gradient to bias higher elevations towards being ground, and lower elevations towards being air. Thus, when terrain scale becomes negative, terrain generates upside-down, generating monoliths. This was possible in early Alpha because the noise map that determined terrain scale could return a negative value.\nStructure.\nThe monoliths would cause the terrain to abruptly generate up to the height limit, with natural &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; generation. They could theoretically generate infinitely upward, being stopped only by the height limit, which at this point in the game's development, was 128 blocks. The area below the monoliths was completely hollow, except for &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; generating at sea level and a layer of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom, making the normal terrain seem like inverse monoliths. It is possible to find small crevices in large monoliths, where normal terrain was generated.\nIssues.\nMonoliths \"are\" an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed."}

For example, raw iron can be smelted to produce iron ingots using coal as fuel. Like &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;, smelting uses recipes to determine what item is produced, but its recipes are simpler. Smelting also yields &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage and mechanics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt; share a similar interface: At the upper left is a slot for smeltable item input, below that is a slot for &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; input, and on the right is a slot where output items accumulate and can be removed by the player. Flames above the fuel slot act as a gauge showing the gradual consumption of the current fuel item, and an arrow in the middle gradually fills to show the progress of smelting the current input item.\nTo smelt, an input item and fuel must be placed into the input and fuel slots, respectively. The furnace then begins to smelt and continues even after the player closes the interface. (The player can still tell when a furnace is working by its block texture showing flames and fire &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; effects appearing.)\nThe furnace burns one fuel item at a time, taking 10 seconds to burn or 200 game ticks, with the fuel gauge indicating how much of that item's burn time remains. As each fuel item is fully consumed, another one is taken from the fuel slot and the gauge starts over.\nSmeltable input items are also processed one at a time but are not removed from the input slot while smelting is in progress. The arrow indicates how much of the smelting process has been completed. When the arrow is full, the input item is removed from the input stack and an output item is added to the output stack. Smelting of the next input item then begins immediately.\nSmelting stops under any of four conditions:\nIf smelting stops while a fuel item is still burning (a normal occurrence), the furnace continues to run visually but no more input items are processed. If the fuel has been exhausted (and the fuel gauge is empty) when an item has been partly smelted, the smelting progress is undone at double speed and the item remains in the input stack.\nSmelting will be suspended if players move far enough away from the furnace (including going to another dimension) that simulation stops in the chunk the furnace is in. It resumes when a player returns.\nIf the player sleeps in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; while a furnace is smelting items, the furnace's progress remains the same as if the bed had not been used and no additional time had passed. This is because when a player sleeps in a bed, no time actually passes; the game simply sets the time of day to morning.\nThe furnace keeps track of experience for each item as smelting is completed for it, accumulating it in a hidden counter. It remembers the total earned experience even if a hopper is used to remove the items from the output slot. This earned experience is awarded to the next player who uses the interface to remove items manually, after which the counter is reset (if the player takes some of the output but leaves some in the slot, the experience corresponding to those items is retained by the furnace and not awarded to the player).\nRecipes.\nAll smelting recipes can be used in the &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, but only subsets are available in the &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;, when available they will burn twice as fast (5 seconds or 100 game ticks), but will use the same amount of fuel.\nFor fractional &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; values, first multiply this value by the number of smelted items removed from the furnace, then award the player the whole-number part, and if there is a fractional part remaining, this represents the chance of an additional experience point.\nFoods.\nAll food recipes can be used in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;. Food can alternatively be cooked on a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't require any fuel and takes 30 seconds or 600 game ticks to cook an item, which is faster (when cooking at the maximum capacity of 4 items at a time) than a furnace, but this doesn't award any &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and is slower than a smoker.\nOres.\nAll ore recipes can be used in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following additional &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s \"can\" be smelted, but it's more efficient to mine them with an appropriate pickaxe. In most cases mining them saves fuel and yields more product and experience, especially if the pickaxe has a &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Smelting them, though, allows obtaining them from an automatic device. The ore blocks themselves can be obtained only via the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nGear.\nThese recipes can be used in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; to recycle unneeded gear (tools, weapons, armor and horse armor).\nFurnace-only.\nThese recipes are exclusive to the &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuel.\nThere are multiple fuels that can be used to smelt items. The type of fuel that should be used depends on the number of items in question.\nFor larger jobs, a single &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20coal\"&gt;block of coal&lt;/a&gt; can smelt more items than can fit in the furnace, a &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt; being able to smelt 100 blocks and a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20coal\"&gt;block of coal&lt;/a&gt; being able to smelt 80 \u2014both input and output are limited to a maximum of a &lt;a href=\"stack\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt; of 64 items (with some items not being able to be stacked or only being possible to &lt;a href=\"stack\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt; 16 of them).\nHopper automation.\nThe smelting process can be automated with &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s on the top and bottom of the &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;. For larger smelting jobs, a third hopper on the side of the furnace can feed in fuel and, in case of lava being used as fuel, any empty &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s come out of the bottom hopper. This automatically feeds and empties the furnace so that different materials can be smelted in the same batch with no loss.\nWhenever a hopper or minecart with hopper removes items from a furnace, any &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; earned from cooking or smelting the removed items is saved in the furnace and awarded to the next player who manually removes an item from the furnace's output slot. This saved experience is in addition to that earned for the manually removed item(s).\nHistory.\n "}

Therefore, one piece of armor cannot possess multiple trims at the same time.\nMost armor trims cover a small portion of the armor piece's surface with the trim material, except for the silence armor trim, which allows the trim material to cover a majority of the armor piece's surface.\nAll trims are purely decorative and do not affect the gameplay or durability (without the use of mods or plugins) of the armor to which they are applied. &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglins&lt;/a&gt; will not pick up any gold-trimmed armor pieces, nor will they be pacified by players wearing a full set of gold-trimmed armor\u2014unless the armor pieces themselves are made of gold.

They occasionally smell their surroundings and track ancient seeds by pressing their nose to the ground. When they find a seed, they sploot and use their noses to dig into the ground until they get &lt;a href=\"torchflower%20seeds\"&gt;torchflower seeds&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"pitcher%20pod\"&gt;pitcher pod&lt;/a&gt;. For a sniffer to be able to dig it needs to be doing nothing else, not in water, on the ground, not in a boat or minecart and the block underneath the head needs to be diggable and reachable for the sniffer. The head location is defined as 2.25 blocks in front of the center of the body. The sniffer also stores the last 20 locations it has dug up so it can't dig there anymore. After sniffing out seeds, an eight minute cooldown is activated before it can dig in again.\nThe following blocks are diggable by the sniffer:\n&lt;a href=\"Data%20pack\"&gt;Data pack&lt;/a&gt;s from \"Java Edition\" can change this list by modifying the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"Tag%23Blocks\"&gt;block tag&lt;/a&gt;.\nSniffers cannot dig on &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreeding.\nThe player can &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; the sniffers using &lt;a href=\"torchflower%20seeds\"&gt;torchflower seeds&lt;/a&gt;.

Explosions by &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s also cause snow to yield a snowball. Snow drops one item of itself per layer when mined using a shovel enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, except for 8 layers of snow, which drops a &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;.

The number of snowballs dropped is as follows: 1 snowball for 1-3 layers, 2 snowballs for snow 4-5 layers, 3 snowballs for 6-7 layers, and 4 snowballs for 8 layers. Unlike , shovels enchanted with Silk Touch cause top snow to drop snowballs. Top snow can also be removed by a shovel on it if there is no block directly above the snow layer, yielding 1-4 snowballs. One snowball is dropped if top snow falls into an invalid block space after its support block is destroyed, regardless of the number of layers.\nNatural generation.\nSnow naturally generates in &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Snowy%20biomes\"&gt;snowy biomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Cold%20biomes\"&gt;cold biomes&lt;/a&gt;, and other biomes depending on the elevation and temperature. Only blocks with direct access to the sky can generate snow layers naturally (with the exception of some buildings in snowy &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, which generate extra snow in areas inaccessible to the sky).\nTop snow generates where there is sky access atop buildings in snowy taiga &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSnow generates as &lt;a href=\"pile\"&gt;pile&lt;/a&gt;s and in multiple layers as part of many snowy plains village structures.\nBy default, snow generates exclusively in single layers . Top snow can generate in multiple layers .\nSnow also generates in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-generation.\nWeather.\nIn snowy biomes or in cold biomes at higher altitudes, the weather can produce snow instead of &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;. In snowy weather, snow generates on random blocks with a complete solid top surface at integer y-values, with a block &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 9 or less, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt;. The rate at which snow forms is affected by the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; .\nBelow are the &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;s at which rain ends and snow begins, depending on the biome. The exact height of the snow line is randomized. In taiga, for example, the lowest possible snow layer forms at y level 153, and the lowest height where snow forms at all locations is y=168, with snow lines ranging between y levels 153 and 168 across different locations.\n, up to two layers of top snow can build up during snowfall. , snowfall creates one layer of snow by default, and the number of layers that can accumulate can be altered by the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; : the default value being , while setting it to makes no snow form at all, and setting it to or above lets snow form up to the level of a full block.\nSnow layers do not generate if the game rule has been set to .\nSnow golems.\n&lt;a href=\"Snow%20golem\"&gt;Snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s generate a trail of snow in snowy, cold, and some medium &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, or any non-dry biome .\nUsage.\nSnow can be placed only on a solid block that is not &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;. , snow breaks if its support block is removed. , snow is affected by gravity and falls if it becomes unsupported, and breaks if it falls onto an unsuitable block. A player can jump up 1 block and 3 snow layers.\nCover.\nIf the snow is on a &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; ) the ground cover turns white on the top and around the sides. Snow does not damage tilled and hydrated field areas \u2013 it cannot be placed on farmland. A gravity-affected block like &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; does not fall if snow covers the block below it, but the gravity-affected block does replace a snow layer when falling onto it. The texture of the grass block changes to snowy when a single layer of snow is placed on top. Thicker layers of snow causes the grass block to revert to plain dirt when the block receives a random tick, similar to regular grass when covered by an opaque block. A plain dirt block with a single layer of snow on top gains a snowy texture if grass spreads to it.\n, if &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are topped with a layer of snow, &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s of snow appear to fall through the leaves from the snow layer.\n, snow layers &lt;a href=\"snowlogging\"&gt;can occupy the same space&lt;/a&gt; as one-block &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, and one-block &lt;a href=\"ferns\"&gt;ferns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, (however two-block tall plants do not work) and can be layered and mined normally. Placing snow on already-existing plant blocks causes snow to appear around them, but placing plants into an area where there is snow removes the snow.\nSnow layers can be used to kill &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt;.\nMelting.\nSnow melts if there is a &lt;a href=\"heat%20block\"&gt;heat block&lt;/a&gt;, or block light level of 12 or more. , it also melts in dry biomes, regardless of block light or daylight level. If there are multiple layers, layers melt gradually in Bedrock Edition, but they melt all at once in Java.\nSome light sources can melt snow but many cannot. The melt radius is &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoxes.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt; gets stuck in the snow after missing an attack on prey, it emits particles as it emerges from the snow."}

Snowfall also occurs in &lt;a href=\"frozen%20ocean\"&gt;frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt; biomes, where it only occurs in certain locations, while it rains in others, as a result of a temperature gradient within the biome. In lush biomes, snowfall can occur only at layers above the block height limit. Snowfall does not exist in hot/dry biomes and in other &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBelow are the &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;s at which rain ends and snow begins, depending on the biome. The exact height of the snow line is randomized: take taiga for example, the lowest possible snow layer forms at y level 153, and the minimum height where snow forms at all locations is y level 168, with snow lines ranging between y levels 153 and 168 across different locations.\nThe average snowfall lasts 0.5\u20131 &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle%23Conversions\"&gt;\"Minecraft\" day&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a 0.5\u20137.5 day delay between snowstorms.

The sky itself darkens, even in biomes where it does not snow, and , celestial bodies (the sun, moon, and stars) are no longer visible. , the sun and moon are still visible in biomes with no snow. The clouds darken from white to a light gray, but they do not precipitate. While the sun is not visible during snowfall, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.\nAs it snows, &lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;snow layers&lt;/a&gt; regenerate over all blocks with a solid top surface at integer y-values. , these snow layers accumulate and grow over time, until the accumulated snow makes a snow block and removes it self, repeating the cycle. , snowfall creates one layer of snow by default, and the number of layers that can accumulate can be altered by the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; : setting it to makes no snow form at all, and setting it to or above lets snow form up to the level of a full block.\nSnow particles.\nFalling snowflake &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; effects are visible through the air over all cold regions during snowfall. Unlike with rain, any entities that are on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; are not extinguished on contact with snow.

Polar bears, rabbits and strays spawn here; the latter is a variant of the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; that shoot arrows of &lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt;.\nSnowy plains are most commonly bordered by &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20beach\"&gt;snowy beach&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"grove\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;s. Regular snowy plains are often separated from ice spikes or snow taigas by frozen rivers.\nSurvival in snowy plains biomes is quite difficult due to the sparseness of the biome and the lack of &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s; only polar bears and &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s may naturally spawn here, though &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn as part of villages. Infrequent spruce trees are the only natural source of wood in the regular snowy plains biome and maintaining &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; sources, for farming &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; for example, can be tough due to water in this biome freezing into &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, if it is not protected by light or a roof. Strays often spawn in place of skeletons which can make dealing with &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s even more difficult due to their Slowness arrows, and aggravating polar bears, or even coming near one if accompanied by cubs, can lead to fatal consequences if the player is unprepared. The ice spikes variety can be valuable to late-game &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s due to the occurrence of ice spikes that can be used for a base or as a source of packed ice &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs the snowy plains is a snow-covered biome, &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; never strikes in these biomes.\nVariants.\nThere are two snowy plains biome variants.\nSnowy Plains.\nSnowy plains are grasslands covered with &lt;a href=\"snow%20layer\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Spruce\"&gt;Spruce&lt;/a&gt; trees, &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s and poppies generate infrequently. The exposed grass and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; take an aqua tone.\n&lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;s that generate in snowy plains are made of spruce wood, snow blocks, ice, &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; and packed ice. &lt;a href=\"Pillager%20outpost\"&gt;Pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s are also found. Igloos are difficult to spot in the plains due to the snow blocks camouflaging among the snow layers.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nIce Spikes.\nThis rarer variety ice spikes biome features large numbers of &lt;a href=\"ice%20spike\"&gt;ice spike&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ice%20patch\"&gt;ice patch&lt;/a&gt;es dotting across its landscape. Additionally, all grass blocks are replaced with &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;s so that no trees nor other vegetations can generate. Snow layers still form atop the snow blocks, making them seem taller than they actually are. No buildings may generate in this biome.\n, the ice spikes biome uses the same mob spawning chances as the regular snowy plains."}

The main distinction are the &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s that cover almost the entire landscape, save for the ground protected by the leaves of spruce trees. The gelid temperature of the snowy taiga means that any exposed &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; freezes into &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, though lakes that generate within the taiga are often partially protected by the leaves of the trees, meaning lakes aren't usually completely frozen. \nSnowy taigas are most commonly bordered by &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grove\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20beach\"&gt;snowy beach&lt;/a&gt;es, and regular &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, and often separated from &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Igloo\"&gt;Igloo&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"trail%20ruins\"&gt;trail ruins&lt;/a&gt; may generate here, but villages and outposts cannot , although they can. Villages generated here use the same architecture as normal taiga villages, but all of the roofs are covered by stacked snow. The water in village farms is frozen, leading to the crops uprooting. &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s wear the snowy plains outfit. Also, , most of the snow layers are stacked, the water has an unique tone and the &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; of the trees become white as in snowy plains during &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nSnowy taigas have the same mob spawning chances as regular taigas. The following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a"}

From ground level, this is anything the height of a chain or less.\nA player can fit through spaces as small as 1.8125 () blocks high, since players are 1.8 blocks tall.

In Bedrock, this allows players to fit through a 2-block gap with a floor as high as 3 &lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;layers of snow&lt;/a&gt;. In Java, players can fit through a 2-block space with a floor as high as a slab.\nWhen gliding with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, a player can fit through spaces as small as 0.625 () blocks high, since gliding players are 0.6 blocks tall. This allows players to fit through a 1-block gap with a floor as high as 4 layers of snow, a &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, although appearing to be one 2-meter-high block, are actually composed of two (top and bottom) 1-meter-high blocks.\nHere is a list of blocks with non-standard heights, from tallest to shortest in height:\nWidth.\nMany blocks are less than 1 meter wide on one or more sides.\nThe table below shows the widths of various blocks. If a block has several hit boxes of different sizes (for example: brewing stands), then each hitbox is listed separately.

It can replace only &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul sand is also found in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20cities\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;, making it the only location to find soul sand in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nSoul sand can be mined with any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; or by hand, but &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s are the quickest.\nBartering.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglins\"&gt;Piglins&lt;/a&gt; may &lt;a href=\"barter\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; 2\u20138 soul sand when given a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;\u200c.\nUsage.\nMovement on or just above soul sand is slowed down for any &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or player that is not wearing &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; by 50%, and standing on soul sand causes entities to &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;sink 2 pixels&lt;/a&gt; into the block. A cover with solid blocks of any non-zero physical thickness prevents sinking, and any solid cover thicker than half a block eliminates the slowing effect, too.\nThe effect applies to sneaking, walking, sprinting, and crawling (but not gliding), and to both regular and sprint-swimming. It also applies to riding mounts. Traveling by boat is slowed down, too, although this requires water no more than 2/8 a block in depth for the boat to sit low enough to be affected. Furthermore, it does not matter whether the player or mob moves actively or is being moved, like by flowing water.\nMost blocks that can be placed on full blocks can be placed on soul sand, with the notable exceptions of both types of &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, both types of &lt;a href=\"roots\"&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nether%20sprouts\"&gt;nether sprouts&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a &lt;a href=\"falling%20block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt; that lands on soul sand turns into an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; from replacing lava if soul sand is underneath.\nA &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; underneath a soul sand block can collect items that are dropped on it.\nSoul sand cannot be used in place of regular &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; as a falling block because it is not affected by gravity.\n&lt;a href=\"Strider\"&gt;Strider&lt;/a&gt;s are slowed down by soul sand underneath a layer of lava.\nGrowing nether wart.\nSoul sand is used for growing &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;, a primary base ingredient for many varieties of potions. Nether warts can be placed on soul sand like seeds on farmland and over time they grow through four growth stages (placing the nether wart on soul sand grants the \"A Seedy Place\" advancement). Nether warts can grow in any dimension and do not have any light-level requirements. Nether warts can also be placed only in soul sand (and cannot even be placed in &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;).\nWithers.\nFour blocks of soul sand (or &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;) are used in the construction of the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. The four blocks are arranged in a \"T\"-like formation (similar to the summoning of an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;) and 3 &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton%20skull\"&gt;wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt;s are placed in a row on top of the \"T\" to summon the wither.\nBubble columns.\nPlacing soul sand under source &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; blocks creates a &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column%23Upward\"&gt;lifting bubble column&lt;/a&gt;, which causes items, entities, players, and mobs inside the column to rise to the surface. The bubble column extends upward through any number of empty water source blocks (not &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; blocks).\nA player can restore breath by entering a soul sand's bubble column.\nNote blocks.\nSoul sand can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce cowbell sounds.\nFire.\nFire lit on soul sand becomes &lt;a href=\"soul%20fire\"&gt;soul fire&lt;/a&gt;, which burns indefinitely.\nBecause soul sand is not as high as a full &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, a player is set on fire if standing next to lava while on soul sand. Standing near water while on soul sand extinguishes the player."}

Unlit sparklers have normal lighting like most items, while lit sparklers appear to glow when held in the player's hand, similarly to &lt;a href=\"glow%20stick\"&gt;glow stick&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; uses another item while a sparkler is lit, or holds the sparkler in the off-hand, the sparkler's durability stops depleting.\nIf the player has a lit sparkler in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; and goes into the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, the sparkler is destroyed immediately. However, it does not get destroyed if dropped in water.
