A sequence of rails (including regular rails, &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s) is called a track.\nPlacement.\nTo place a rail, a rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the rail should occupy. A rail can be placed on:\nRails visually float blocks above the ground, with an blocks high.\nA rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a rail to the side of the fence causes the rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.\nMore information regarding placement on transparent blocks can be found at &lt;a href=\"Opacity/Placement\"&gt;Opacity/Placement&lt;/a&gt;.\nA placed rail configures itself to be straight or curved according to rail blocks around it. \nExisting tracks one block up and down are considered for adjacency in the same manner, and the new piece of track gets laid as a curve, but unless space is left for sloping track sections, minecarts can continue past the curve only on level or one-block-down corners. In one-block-up corners, the cart ends up buried in the ground.\nSome placement of rails produces track layouts that cause minecarts to collide and enter blocks.\nExisting sections of track may be re-oriented, become sloping, or even change into curved sections when the new rail is placed adjacent to it:\nPiston interactivity.\nRails can be pushed and pulled by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRedstone component.\nThe intersection rail at a T-intersection may be made to change its direction of curvature by applying redstone power using a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeparate tracks are laid adjacent, but at the next level, lower or higher can sometimes cause issues. However, normally they do not interact with the switched rail.\nMinecart behavior.\nSouth-east rule.\nA minecart travels straight through a T-shaped intersection when entering from the \"back of\" the curved rail. It follows the curve when entering from either of the other two legs.\nA minecart passes straight through a 4-way intersection constructed to have no curved rail. When entering the 4-way from east or west a cart turns according to the south-east rule.\nDownhill rule.\nAt non-curve track intersections, minecarts always travel downhill if they can. This is known as the downhill rule and overrides the south-east rule.\nRamp clearance/one-way effect.\nA block placed above the track at the downhill end of a ramp prevents minecarts from traveling down the slope, but not up. For a minecart to move down a diagonal tunnel, there must be clearance sufficient for a player to walk it.\nCurve intersections.\nIf a straight track piece leads to a curve block and isn't attached to the curve, a minecart runs over the gap and continues to go straight over the curve. This is not applicable to other types of rails.\nNotably, the minecart can exceed the normal 8\u00a0m/s speed limit while it jumps over the gap. For example, by placing intersections on every other block of a straight track, it is possible to travel (uncomfortably) at 10\u00a0m/s in a straight direction.\nAs with straight T-intersections and 4-way intersections, the practice of making a minecart jump track can be used to make one-way entries onto a track. On curve intersections the behavior is more intuitive because the cart simply proceeds in the direction it is already going, allowing designs that don't rely on knowledge of the south-east rule.\nRail performance.\nA minecart with no rider at full speed can climb 10 blocks on an unpowered track. This suggests that a powered track is needed at a height of only 10 blocks to keep a cart climbing. However, the cart slows so much that it can reach only another 5 blocks high with 2 lengths of powered track starting at 9 blocks high. The minimum number of powered rails to keep the cart climbing perpetually is 3 every 6 blocks.\nCarts with a rider, or &lt;a href=\"minecarts%20with%20chests\"&gt;minecarts with chests&lt;/a&gt;, have more momentum and so climb higher than carts that are unloaded. With a rider, a minecart can climb at least 24 blocks before needing powered rails to go higher. Also, to ascend from 0 to max speed, the player needs 7 powered rails.\nMob behavior.\n, some mobs (such as &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; and many others) avoid walking on rails, and walk off rails when pushed onto them."}

In &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Temperature\"&gt;colder biomes&lt;/a&gt;, and at certain &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;s, it &lt;a href=\"Snowfall\"&gt;snows&lt;/a&gt; instead. No rain occurs in warmer biomes such as the &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in other &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe average rainfall lasts 0.5\u20131 &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle%23Conversions\"&gt;\"Minecraft\" day&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a 0.5\u20137.5 day delay between rains. Rain has a small chance to worsen into &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRainy weather always clears at sunrise after sleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it stops after a random duration of time.\n, rain can fall tilted, and snow particles can fall twisting, bending, and moving around. rain and snow fall straight down.\nEffects.\nRainfalls darken the world, causing the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; to decrease by 3, bringing it to light level 12 in full daylight. &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt;light, however, is not reduced, and remains at light level 4. The sky itself darkens, even in biomes where it does not rain, and , celestial bodies (the sun, moon, and stars) are no longer visible. , the sun and moon are still visible in biomes with no rain. While flying, rain also decreases visibility on land. The clouds darken from white to a light gray, although clouds themselves do not precipitate. Although the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.\nRain extinguishes &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;flaming arrows&lt;/a&gt;), although it does not extinguish &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;lit campfire&lt;/a&gt;s or fires on &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s. Rain does not &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;solidify&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and does not empty &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;lava cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Mobs\"&gt;Mobs&lt;/a&gt; on fire are quenched on contact with rain, preventing &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s from burning during the day. During rain, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; can leave bodies of water when chasing a target, as if it were night time. &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s may die due to their weakness to water; they take damage at a rate of per half second. Endermen teleport randomly until they find a dry place. &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s that are brought into the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; also take damage on contact with rain.\nAt a certain biome-dependent elevation, the rain becomes snowfall, resulting in huge natural mountains having snow on the peaks while it is raining on the ground. Each biome has a certain temperature, and temperatures below 0.15 turn rain into snow. The temperature drops by 0.0016 per meter above sea level, so at high elevations, it can be cold enough to snow despite there normally being rain instead.\nOther effects caused by rain:\nRain particles.\nRain &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s make noise when they hit a block, and this noise can be heard at any point within 16 blocks. These particles (along with the associated sound) can be disabled by setting particles to \"Minimal\" in the &lt;a href=\"Options%23Video%20Settings\"&gt;video settings&lt;/a&gt; menu. Although rain particles are visible just in the immediate vicinity, their effects occur within all loaded areas. Note that raindrops fall only in the two middle lines of a block, thus do not visibly fall directly onto the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. At y=1 and below, rain does not generate particles and the associated sound event."}

They can be viewed as a forerunner to the &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biome seen in later versions of \"Minecraft\", specifically versions after Java Edition &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.2.1\"&gt;1.2.1&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their denser-than-average vegetation, there is a higher concentration of oak and birch trees, and Large oak trees are generated more often. They usually consist of low, flat plains and high cliffs and hills but can be very mountainous.\nDescription.\nRainforests were lush, wet biomes with many trees, which had a 1 in 3 chance of being large trees, instead of 1 in 10 like all other biomes. They were similar to forests but had a large amount of tall grass and ferns and lush green grass due to temperature and rainfall requirements. As the rainforest biome existed in versions prior to Java Edition Beta 1.6, the tall grass plant, along with ferns, were not yet added to the game and thus would not generate in this biome. \nA biome is classified as a rainforest if the temperature is greater than 97% and the rainfall is more than 90%. As a result of this, the rainforest could often contain a lot of cliffs and hills because the world generator reduces height variation at lower rainfall values and vice versa."}

After this period, it will open its mouth and roar, dealing damage and a knockback of 5 blocks to nearby entities. The roar knocks back nearby illagers without damaging them and has no effect on other ravagers (note that &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;vexes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; are not treated as illagers and will take both damage and knockback). Illagers that are knocked back by a ravager's roar can still take fall damage.\nRavagers do not attack &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s who shoot at them by accident, and do not attack &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s when &lt;a href=\"evoker%20fangs\"&gt;evoker fangs&lt;/a&gt; accidentally hit them. When a vindicator riding a ravager has been named \"Johnny\" it may attack the ravager while it is riding it, but the ravager does not attack the vindicator for any reason. When a ravager gets shot by a mob that battles with a projectile while it is attacking the player, the ravager first attempts to kill who shot it, then goes back to attacking the player once the deed is done. Any mob that doesn't battle with projectiles requires a ravagers to roar in order to aggro on it. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, a ravager who gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers or goats) or player will alert other ravagers to target the attacker unless the ravager was killed in one hit. \nRavagers take 75% less of knockback, but they still float in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. A ravager being ridden dismounts its rider if it moves into &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; two blocks deep. Riders cannot mount ravagers again after being dismounted.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", any ravager can join a &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt; if sufficiently near a &lt;a href=\"patrol%20captain\"&gt;patrol captain&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nRavagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nRavagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

{"id": "119217", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=119217", "title": "Raw JSON text format", "text": "Raw JSON text is the format Minecraft uses to send and display rich text to players. It can also be sent by players themselves using commands and &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;s. Raw JSON text is written in , a human-readable data format.\nJava Edition.\nRaw JSON text is made up of text components. There is a single root component, which can have child components, which can have their own children and so on. Components can also have formatting and interactivity added to them, which is inherited by their children.\nA raw JSON text component can be any JSON data type other than JSON null, including JSON string, JSON array, JSON object, JSON boolean, and JSON number. The game treats booleans and numbers as strings. Strings and arrays are both shorthand for longer object structures, as described below.\nDue to the tag, the above format may be recursively nested to produce complex and functional text strings. However, a raw JSON text doesn't have to be complicated at all: virtually all properties are optional and may be left out.\nContent types.\nRaw JSON text components can display several types of content. These tags should be included directly into the text component object.\nPlain Text.\nDisplays plain text.\nTranslated Text.\nDisplays a translated piece of text from the currently selected &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;. This uses the client's selected language, so if players with their games set to different languages are logged into the same server, each will see the component in their own language.\nTranslations are defined in &lt;a href=\"Resource%20pack%23Language\"&gt;language files&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s, including the built-in resource pack.\nTranslations can contain slots for text that is not known ahead of time, such as player names. When displaying the translated text, slots will be filled from a provided list of text components. The slots are defined in the language file, and generally take the form codice_51 (displays the next component in the list), or codice_52 (displays the third component in the list; replace codice_53 with whichever index is desired). For example, the built-in English language file contains the translation codice_54.\nScoreboard Value.\nDisplays a score from the &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntity Names.\nDisplays the name of one or more entities found by a &lt;a href=\"selector\"&gt;selector&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf exactly one entity is found, the entity's name is displayed by itself. If more are found, their names are displayed in the form \"Name1, Name2, Name3\", with gray commas. If none are found, the component is displayed as no text.\nHovering over a name shows a tooltip with the name, type, and &lt;a href=\"UUID\"&gt;UUID&lt;/a&gt; of the target. Clicking a player's name suggests a command to whisper to that player. Shift-clicking a player's name inserts that name into chat. Shift-clicking a non-player entity's name inserts its UUID into chat.\nKeybind.\nDisplays the name of the button that is currently bound to a certain &lt;a href=\"Controls%23Configurable%20controls\"&gt;configurable control&lt;/a&gt;. This uses the client's own control scheme, so if players with different control schemes are logged into the same server, each will see their own keybind.\nNBT Values.\nDisplays &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; values from &lt;a href=\"Entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Block%20entity\"&gt;block entities&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Commands/data%23Storage\"&gt;command storage&lt;/a&gt;.\nNBT strings display their contents. Other NBT values are displayed as SNBT, with no spacing between symbols. If is set to true, the game will instead attempt to parse and display that text as its own raw JSON text component. That usually only works on strings, since JSON and SNBT are not compatible. If is true and parsing fails, the component is displayed as no text. If more than one NBT value is found, either by selecting multiple entities or by using a multi-value path, they are displayed in the form \"Value1, Value2, Value3, Value4\".\nComponent resolution.\nCertain text content types (, , and ) do not work in all contexts. These content types need to be \"resolved\", which involves retrieving the appropriate data from the world, rendering it into \"simple\" text components, and replacing the \"advanced\" text component with that. This resolution can be done by &lt;a href=\"signs\"&gt;signs&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt;s when they are first opened, by &lt;a href=\"boss%20bar\"&gt;boss bar&lt;/a&gt; names, and by commands such as &lt;a href=\"Commands/tellraw\"&gt;codice_61&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commands/title\"&gt;codice_62&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be done by the &lt;a href=\"Item%20modifier\"&gt;item modifers&lt;/a&gt; set_name and set_lore, but only if their tag is set. Custom item names, custom entity names and &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt; objective names cannot by themselves resolve these components.\nAdditionally, resolution fixes a single value in place. Therefore, these content types are not dynamic, and don't update to reflect changes in their environment, while \"simple\" components usually do.\nBedrock Edition.\nThis sends a message to all players saying \"Hello World\" in English only. See the Translate action to see how to send localized texts.\nAppending.\nRaw text takes in an array of text objects. Each object in the list is added to the previous object. For example, \noutputs the same \"Hello World\" as the first example. Appending text can be useful to combine 2 different localized texts, or apply different colors to each word etc.\nBreaking lines.\nYou can go down a line by using \"\\n\". For example,\nTranslate.\nThe translate object allows creators to provide localized text to users. If translate is specified along with text, translate overrides the text object. The string to provide to translate is the name of the string in the language files. For example, in Vanilla Minecraft \"commands.op.success\" is the string that displays when /op is used on a player successfully.\nThis outputs \"Opped %s\" to all players. Note that because of text being ignored with translate specified, the following example outputs the same text:\nWith.\nIn the translate example above, it outputs \"Opped %s\". To have a name or other text show up instead of %s, \"with\" needs to be specified as well. Note that \"with\" only works with \"translate\" and also requires an array instead of curly brackets .\nIf you want to use a translated text inside the \"with\" component, instead of an array it needs to be another rawtext component (which consists of an array of JSON texts). The following example outputs \"Opped Apple\".\n%%s.\n\"translate\" and \"%s\" can be used without needing a corresponding string in the localization files. For example:\nThis outputs \"Hello Steve\" to all players.\nMultiple %s.\n%%s can be used multiple times. They are filled in, in the order specified\nOutputs: \"Hello Steve and Alex\"\nYou can again use a rawtext component to replace the plain string array, like so\nOutputs: \"Hello Steve and Apple\"\nOrdering with %%#.\nThe order to fill in %s to be filled in can be changed by instead specifying it with %%#, replacing # with an actual number. For example, to swap the position of Steve and Alex in the above example, instead run the following:\nOutputs: \"Hello Alex and Steve\"\nFormatting.\nString formatting is still possible, but not using the JSON tags used in Java Edition. Instead, &lt;a href=\"Formatting%20codes\"&gt;Formatting codes&lt;/a&gt; are used to change text color and style."}

Hosted by &lt;a href=\"Mojang\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt;, Realms provides a simple way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without knowledge of hosting on the internet. , Realms also allow players to choose from a list of minigames to play temporarily, as well as several pre-made world templates, adventure maps, experience maps, and inspiration maps, all made by Realms community map makers. Maps on \"Java Edition\" are updated by Mojang sporadically, ranging from a few days to as recently as one to two months. Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server.\nRequirements.\nRealms is a service that can be used only by players who meet these requirements:\nSubscriptions.\nRealms is a subscription-based service. The link above goes to the player's Minecraft account page, which offers options to extend a current subscription or buy a new one (3.99 per month in \"Bedrock Edition\", and US$7.99 per month in \"Java Edition\").\nThere are two types of subscriptions in Java Edition: a reoccurring monthly charge that automatically renews the subscription every 30 days (this can be canceled at any time), or a one-time charge that comes in 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day packages and needs to be renewed manually.\nAll players are able to have a 30-day free Realms trial, providing they have not already had a free trial on their account before.\nMaps.\nUsers can choose to temporarily replace their world with a Minigame or permanently replace their world with maps from the following categories: World templates, Adventures, Experiences, or Inspiration. Most commands or options cannot be used while the realm is running a minigame. These maps are selected from community submissions by the \"Minecraft\" Content Team. Certain maps may not be available on Realms due to being phased out or incompatible with the current update. Users cannot delete a map, but they can reset it.\n2023.\nMinigames.\nSome of the maps listed above are classified as minigames. Each Realm has a separate minigame slot in addition to the regular world slots, allowing minigames to be temporarily activated at any time with minimal disruption.\nUnlike regular worlds, minigames do not save players' progress, and they reset whenever all players log out.\nThe list of available minigames can be viewed in-game, along with the number of supported players. However the information about each minigame is limited and the list is not sortable.\nLimitations.\nAlthough Realms is hosted by Mojang, and therefore safe and secure, it has some limitations. These limitations can be avoided by using standalone server software or a third-party hosting website.\nHistory.\nRealms version history.\nJava Edition.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.10\"&gt;Java Edition 1.7.10&lt;/a&gt;, Realms has had its own versioning system. Below is a changelog of these updates:\n \n \nMinecraft version history.\nOriginally, Realms updates were tied into regular Minecraft updates, until the release of 1.7.10.

Every &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Furnace%23Usage\"&gt;blasting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campfire%23Cooking\"&gt;campfire cooking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smoker%23Smoking\"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonecutter%23Usage\"&gt;stonecutting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Upgrade\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; recipe uses this system. , &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt; recipes also use this system. &lt;a href=\"Cartography%20table\"&gt;Cartography table&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt; recipes cannot currently be controlled.\nObtaining.\nRecipes can be obtained in various ways. Using the recipe automatically makes the player discover it. Recipes can also be granted using the command or as a reward for completing an &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;. Vanilla survival has multiple advancements that grant recipes, which trigger when for example the player obtains an item required in the recipe.\nOnce a recipe has been discovered, it is added to the player's &lt;a href=\"recipe%20book\"&gt;recipe book&lt;/a&gt;. Discovered recipes are stored in the player's &lt;a href=\"Player.dat%20format%23NBT%20structure\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nDiscovered recipes can be found in the player's recipe book. However, recipes do not need to be discovered for the player to be able to use them, unless is set to codice_1.\nRecipes appear only if the player is using the recipe book in a block associated to the recipe's type; for example, furnace recipes only show up when the player use the recipe book in the furnace GUI. When the player is using the recipe book in the inventory, crafting recipes appear that can fit into the player's 2\u00d72 inventory crafting grid.\nJSON format.\nCustom recipes in the codice_2 folder of a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt; store the recipe data for that world as separate JSON files.\nA recipe with ID codice_3 would have its JSON file located at codice_4 within a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nRecipe JSON files have different structures dependent on their type, but they all have a tag in its root tag.\nList of recipe types.\nblasting.\nRepresents a recipe in a &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe default cooking time is 100 ticks, or 5 seconds.\ncampfire_cooking.\nRepresents a recipe in a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe default cooking time is 100 ticks, or 5 seconds, even though all vanilla campfire cooking recipes have a cook time of 600 ticks, or 30 seconds. Campfire recipes do not trigger the recipe_unlocked criteria.\ncrafting_shaped.\nRepresents a shaped crafting recipe in a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe key used in the pattern may be any single character except codice_5, the space character, which is reserved for empty slots in a recipe.\nCustom &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; data tags are not allowed for the recipe's output item.\ncrafting_shapeless.\nRepresents a shapeless crafting recipe in a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ingredients list must have at least one and at most nine entries.\nCustom &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; data tags are not allowed for the recipe's output item.\ncrafting_special_*.\nRepresents a crafting recipe in a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; that is handled with builtin logic instead of being data-driven.\nWhen the codice_6 &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt; is disabled, they can be used to reenable desired builtin crafting recipes.\nUnlike most other recipe types, they do not have a codice_7 field and cannot be displayed in &lt;a href=\"recipe%20book\"&gt;recipe book&lt;/a&gt;s.\nsmelting.\nRepresents a recipe in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe default cooking time is 200 ticks, or 10 seconds.\nsmithing.\nRepresents a recipe in a &lt;a href=\"smithing%20table\"&gt;smithing table&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe resulting item copies the NBT tags of the base item.\nsmoking.\nRepresents a recipe in a &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe default cooking time is 100 ticks, or 5 seconds.\nstonecutting.\nRepresents a recipe in a &lt;a href=\"stonecutter\"&gt;stonecutter&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike the field in shaped and shapeless crafting recipes, this field here is required."}

The item can then be crafted if the materials are available; otherwise, the button containing the item is highlighted red. Each click shows alternate patterns for the same crafting recipe, if there are several patterns (for example, each click on a &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; crafting recipe shows all the possible banners using different colored &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;s). Right-click on the item shows all the alternate patterns.\nShift-clicking an item in the list puts all available materials in the crafting grid.\nThe button in the top right corner of the recipe book toggles between \"Show all\" and \"Show craftable\"; the latter displays only recipes for which the player has the necessary materials in their inventory. The top-left corner also contains a search bar to further narrow the list.\nThere are also recipes for &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stonecutter\"&gt;stonecutter&lt;/a&gt;s, but they don't have a recipe book interface.\nTabs for specific categories can be hidden from the recipe book if there are no known recipes for that particular tab, but the search tab is always visible even if there are no known recipes.\nBedrock Edition.\nUnlike , the recipe book can only be displayed in &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode.

The tabs contain matching items from each tab of the &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Creative inventory&lt;/a&gt;, so an item found in a particular tab in Creative can be found in its equivalent tab in the recipe book, should it have a recipe.\nClicking on an item in the list puts all available materials in the crafting grid, displaying the recipe. The item can then be crafted if the materials are available; otherwise, the button containing the item is highlighted red. Right-click on the item automatically crafts it, and pressing crafts all items based on how many materials the player have in the inventory.\nThe button in the top right corner of the recipe book toggles between \"All\" and \"Craftable\"; the latter displays only recipes for which the player has the necessary materials in their inventory.

This texture atlas is generated via F3 + S and is saved into a folder titled \u201cdebug\u201d in .minecraft's screenshots folder.\nAll other textures are also available in their own respective texture atlases in said \".minecraft/screenshots/debug\" folder. For example, the particle atlas is minecraft_textures_atlas_particles.png_0.png, while the chest atlas is minecraft_textures_atlas_chest.png_0.png, minecraft_textures_atlas_decorated_pot.png_0.png.\nTrivia.\nThere is a file in \".minecraft/screenshots/debug\" called minecraft_missingno.png, titled as a reference to the infamous \"missingno\" pokemon in the original Pokemon Red &amp; Blue game. \nEach texture \u2013\u00a0i.e. minecraft_textures_atlas_blocks.png_0.png \u2013 has an accompanying _1, _2, _3, and _4 texture (such as minecraft_textures_atlas_blocks.png_4.png), each texture starting at _1 being at progressively lower downscaled resolutions (_0, the original, is 1024x512 pixels, whilst _4 is only 64x32 pixels).

They were files that had various images in them and a text document named . The native resolution of \"Minecraft\"'s textures were 16\u00d716 (measured pixels in block height and width). 32\u00d732, 64\u00d764, 128\u00d7128, 256\u00d7256, 512\u00d7512, and 1024\u00d71024 textures were referred to as \"HD\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.6.1&lt;/a&gt;, texture packs were replaced with &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s, which provide more control over textures and other game features, such as music and text.\nBehavior.\nTexture packs can be placed in the folder within the folder. Each texture pack is either a within the folder. Once in the folder, a texture pack can be added from the &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;.\nTexture packs load their assets based on the order of the packs on the list. The bottom-most pack loads first, then each pack placed above it replaces assets of the same name with its assets.\nContents.\nA texture pack is identified by \"Minecraft\" based on the presence of the folder of the root directory, which contain a text file called , which would contain a description of the texture pack which would appear in game.\nThe root directory also contains an optional image called , which shows as the thumbnail for the pack on the texture pack selection menu.\nInstalling a texture pack.\nInstallation tips.\nCurrent versions of \"Minecraft\" support higher resolutions of texture packs. Traditionally, textures in-game work on a 16\u00d716 block. Bigger texture packs can go all the way up to 512\u00d7512 (32\u00d7, 64\u00d7, 128\u00d7, 256\u00d7) but require better hardware to play smoothly.\nConverting texture packs to resource packs.\nConverting texture packs can be done with Mojang's converter tool (called \"texture ender\"). Converting texture packs from before 1.5 is a two-step process, requiring a converter to convert it to 1.5 first (called the \"unstitcher\") then the converter from 1.5 to 1.6.

{"id": "19060", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19060", "title": "The End", "text": "The End is a dark, space-like &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; consisting of separate islands in the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, made out of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt;. It is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; also spawns when the player first arrives. \nAccessing.\nTo access the End, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must go through the process of finding a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;, finding the portal room, and activating the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; in the end portal room. The room consists of a 5\u00d75 square of &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt;s, with the corners cut out, making a total of 12. The portal hangs over a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pool, with a staircase leading up to it. A &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; sits on top of the staircase. \nThe player can activate the portal by filling the 12 &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt;s each with an eye of ender. Each frame block has a 10% chance of generating with an eye in it already, meaning the player may not necessarily use 12 eyes to activate it. Once all the eyes of ender are placed, the portal activates and emits a loud noise. This noise is global and can be heard by all players on the server/LAN world. As soon as it is activated, the portal destroys all blocks in the central 3\u00d73 square, including &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; or another portal frame, and replaces them with the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20block\"&gt;end portal block&lt;/a&gt;s that can teleport an entity into the End dimension. Upon jumping into the portal, the player immediately arrives in the End (x = 100, z = 0), along with any prior entities that may have teleported.\nIf &lt;a href=\"cheat\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt;s are enabled, players can also teleport to the End without using an end portal: the command allows the player to select their teleportation destination in the End directly.\nEnvironment.\nThe End consists of one large island surrounded at a distance by many smaller islands, all mainly composed of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt;. There is a gap between the central island and the outer islands of about 1000 blocks with nothing but the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe starless &lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt; and the void of the End are both composed of a blank, static pattern. The &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;daylight cycle&lt;/a&gt; is absent in the End, similar to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, being replaced by a constant dim &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Weather\"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt; cycle does not exist in the End, meaning there is no &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMost &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s function in the End exactly as they do in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, with a few notable exceptions:\nBiomes.\nThere are 5 &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s that make up the End . Beds and &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;s still explode if the biome is set in the Overworld. , all End biomes are classified as a single biome, which is codice_1. In both versions, if the biome is set to \"the End\" in the Overworld, the sky appears as a light gray version of the normal Overworld sky. \nTerrain features.\nMain island.\nAll players begin their exploration of the End with the main island. Unlike &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s, entering the end portal instantly teleports the player to the End, giving no time to back out. Upon arrival in the End, the player is placed on a 5\u00d75\u00d71 &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;obsidian platform&lt;/a&gt; with 3 layers of air blocks above it, if there are any blocks in a 3 block space above the platform, they are broken and drop as an item upon a player entering an end portal. The platform can generate on the island, within it, or at a short distance from it, close enough to throw an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; to reach the island. It always generates centered on the coordinates (100, 49, 0) with the player facing west.\nOnce the player enters the End, the only way back is to &lt;a href=\"Health%23Death\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt; or defeat the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon spawns naturally and flies around above ten &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20pillars\"&gt;towers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; arranged in a circle around the central &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt;, which fills up at the end of the battle. On top of each tower lies an &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are protected by cages of &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt;. These crystals heal the dragon, but can be destroyed by hitting it (even with projectiles). Destroying the crystal while the dragon is healing damages the dragon.\nOnce defeated, the dragon goes to the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; at (0, 64, 0), rises into the sky and disintegrates, with bright beams of light flashing from its body. It then explodes, drops 12,000 (first dragon) or 500 (all subsequent dragons) &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs, activates the exit portal, and generates one &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt; (first 20 dragons only). This gives the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; access to the End's outer islands. Atop the exit portal lies four &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es and the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;. After killing the dragon, it can be &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;ed an unlimited number of times by placing four &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on the sides of the exit portal. Respawning the ender dragon regenerates any obsidian pillar blocks previously mined by the player, as well as the torches on the exit portal. However, the dragon egg does not regenerate upon killing a respawned ender dragon.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; enters the exit portal, the \"&lt;a href=\"end%20poem\"&gt;end poem&lt;/a&gt;\" is displayed, therefore \"completing\" the game. The player then &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;s wherever their spawn is set in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and may return to the End through the same portal (or a different portal from another stronghold); the End remains in the same state as the player left it. The obsidian platform is regenerated each time a player enters the End, meaning that any blocks or block entities placed in the 5\u00d75\u00d74 space on or above the platform are destroyed and replaced with obsidian and air blocks.\nOuter islands.\nThe End's outer islands are more diverse than the main island. When a player enters one of the &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;s that &lt;a href=\"Generated%20structures\"&gt;generate&lt;/a&gt; after killing the dragon, they are instantly teleported over the ~1000 block void to the outer islands. These gateway portals are easiest to enter through the use of &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, due to the one block tall gap between the &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; blocks, but can also be entered by placing water and swimming through, using a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; to force the player to crawl, or with skilled use of a pair of &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe outer islands vary in size. There are occasional \"mini islands\" in the gaps between the larger ones, generally with nothing on them (occasionally they generate &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;s that return the player to the obsidian platform). The larger islands can also vary in size but are generally a hundred to several hundred blocks wide. The gaps between these islands are generally short enough that players can travel between them via &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThese outer islands generate up to the &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt;. Some are topped with a forest of &lt;a href=\"chorus%20tree\"&gt;chorus tree&lt;/a&gt;s that may be harvested for its &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps &lt;a href=\"chorus%20flower\"&gt;chorus flower&lt;/a&gt;s, to grow it in the Overworld. The player may find &lt;a href=\"End%20City\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt; (which may generate &lt;a href=\"End%20City\"&gt;ships&lt;/a&gt; with them) on these islands, which hold exclusive loot. Pairs of &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20head\"&gt;dragon head&lt;/a&gt; can only be found on the end ships.\n, due to a bug, the outer End islands fail to generate in multiple concentic rings. The first ring ends at \u00b1370,719 on the X and Z axes, cutting off terrain generation in a doughnut shape. It continues empty, but the second ring starts at X/Z=(-)524,288, then disappears again at X/Z=(-)642,111 and comes back at X/Z=(-)741,456. It continues like this all the way until the world border, getting closer and closer. If the world border would be removed, going far enough would lead to world looking slightly like the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20distance%20effects%23Stripe%20Lands\"&gt;stripe lands&lt;/a&gt; of Bedrock Edition.\nMobs.\nThe End is home to three naturally occurring &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s:\nOther mobs except for the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; may be sent into the End through an end portal. (The &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; can still be built in the End as usual.)\nBlocks.\nNaturally generated.\nNaturally generated includes blocks that are created through the world seed and always generate no matter what.\nNaturally created.\nThese blocks are created through a combination of events that lead these blocks to be placed by natural causes such as summoning the ender dragon, not by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nStructures.\nThese blocks and entities are generated as part of &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, but only when the \"generated structures\" option is on.\nTechnical information.\nFolder.\n, the End is saved in the same way normal worlds are, in the codice_2 subdirectory of the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20level%20format\"&gt;world save&lt;/a&gt;. Deleting the DIM1 directory resets the End, including all player-made changes."}

There are five variants in the biome family. \nDescription.\nThis biome is exclusive to the End dimension. &lt;a href=\"End%20stone\"&gt;End stone&lt;/a&gt; is the only block to generate apart from those found in structures. &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s are the only mobs to spawn naturally. The terrain is almost completely flat and consists of separate islands floating in the void.\nVariants.\nThe End.\nThis biome is used to generate the circle of radius 1024 centered at the 0,0 coordinates in the End. The End central island is generated at the center of this circle, surrounded by emptiness all the way to the edge of the biome. Most of the End features are exclusive to here, including the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20pillar\"&gt;obsidian pillar&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, the 5\u00d75 spawn platform, the exit portal, and the 20 central end gateways. Only &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; spawn in this biome, but at much higher rates than the Overworld. There is no weather or daylight cycle in the biome, like the Nether. &lt;a href=\"End%20gateway\"&gt;End gateway&lt;/a&gt; portals generate after the ender dragon has been defeated. If the biome is used for a &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; world, the sky appears nearly black, no exit portal generates and endermen are the only mobs to spawn at night.\n, this is the biome that occupies the least part of the map in the game: a circular radius of 1000 blocks, making it cover 3.5 billionths of the entire dimension, even less than the &lt;a href=\"modified%20jungle%20edge\"&gt;modified jungle edge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;.\n, this biome is instead the biggest, as it is used to generate the whole dimension.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nEnd highlands.\nThis biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End, forming the hilltops in the center of each island. This is the only biome where &lt;a href=\"chorus%20tree\"&gt;chorus tree&lt;/a&gt;s naturally generate. &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;End cities&lt;/a&gt; also generate here.\nEnd highlands use the same mob spawning chances as The End. &lt;br clear=all&gt;\nEnd midlands.\nThis biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End, forming the gradual slope from the hilltops of each island down to the cliffs around the edge. End cities generate here, but chorus trees do not.\nEnd midlands use the same mob spawning chances as The End. &lt;br clear=all&gt;\nEnd barrens.\nThis biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End, forming the outer edges of end midlands and highlands, with steep cliffs below the edge. Neither end cities nor chorus trees can generate in this biome.\nEnd barrens use the same mob spawning chances as The End. &lt;br clear=all&gt;\nSmall end islands.\nThis biome generates as part of the outer islands of the End which consists of the empty expanses between the larger islands, populated only by smaller, circle-shaped islands. Neither end cities nor chorus trees can generate in this biome.\nSmall end islands use the same mob spawning chances as The End.\nEnd city.\nEnd cities are found in the outer End islands, and are made out of &lt;a href=\"purpur\"&gt;purpur&lt;/a&gt; blocks. They have valuable loot such as emeralds, enchanted iron and diamond tools, and &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; which are used for gliding."}

It's important to note that portals created in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; will not function for this purpose. To assemble the portal, the player's initial task involves building a rectangular frame using blocks of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. The frame's dimensions can vary, with the smallest permissible size being 4 blocks \u00d7 5 blocks, and the largest being 23 blocks \u00d7 23 blocks. Once the frame has been properly constructed, it can be activated by introducing &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; into the frame. This can be accomplished using various ignition methods such as &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, or any substance capable of setting fire ablaze.\nThe portal allows most &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and entities riding or being ridden by another entity) to be transported to a corresponding portal in the Nether. In &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, the player must stand in a nether portal for 4 seconds to get to the Nether. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. The portal plays a sound effect while the player is inside it. If there is no corresponding portal, a new 4\u00d75 portal is created. The portal can be destroyed by breaking the obsidian frame, by a nearby explosion, or by placing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in the Overworld or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; into it with a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;. Any of the &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s in the corners can be destroyed without destroying the portal.\nIn the former &lt;a href=\"Old\"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt; world type, it is impossible to construct a nether portal. The portal block must be placed using cheats. When done, the Nether has the same 256\u00d7256 borders as the Overworld, and if a nether portal is then made in the Nether, it can spawn the player outside the world barrier.\nIf &lt;a href=\"cheats\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; are enabled, players can also teleport to the Nether without using a nether portal: the syntax is , and .\nTraits.\n&lt;a href=\"Bedrock\"&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; comprises the top (including and below &lt;a href=\"layer\"&gt;layer&lt;/a&gt; 127) and bottom 4 layers in a rough pattern, essentially making the Nether 128 blocks high unlike the Overworld's 384. In the infinite worlds of the \"Java\" and Bedrock Editions, the Nether is also horizontally infinite. , the build limit in the Nether is 128 blocks, despite it being 256 in the End, and 320 in the Overworld. \nThe Nether has no &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;daylight cycle&lt;/a&gt; and no &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;. Natural sources of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; include &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shroomlight\"&gt;shroomlight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;. Even with a light level of 0, the Nether has a dim ambient light (roughly equivalent to light level 8 in the Overworld). Light otherwise functions exactly the same as it does in the Overworld and the End.\nThe majority of flora in the Nether is fungus-based as opposed to plants. The Nether \"grass\" consists of specialized Nether mycelium (known as \"&lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt;\"). The Nether features its own unique &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; (including nether wart), as well as equivalent &lt;a href=\"Huge%20fungus\"&gt;huge fungi&lt;/a&gt; which serve as &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s. The stems of the huge fungi function as &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s. Also present are a number of native vines and roots.\nWith the exception of the Strider, all creatures found in the Nether are hostile and potentially dangerous.\nLocations in the Nether correlate to Overworld &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt;, but horizontal Overworld distances are scaled down by a ratio of 8:1 for travel in the Nether. Therefore, traveling one block in the Nether means traveling eight blocks in the Overworld. For example, in a perfect scenario, a player who enters a portal in the Overworld at x=0, z=0 and travels in the Nether to x=1000, z=1000 returns to the Overworld at x=8000, z=8000. This makes portals a useful tool for traveling long distances in the Overworld.\nMost items and blocks in the Nether function the same as they do in the Overworld, with a few notable exceptions: \nEnvironment.\nThe Nether features unique cave-like terrain with no sky. Lava and fire are common hazards everywhere in the Nether. Areas distant from the player are shrouded in &lt;a href=\"Fog%23Nether%20fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; of red or blue. The shape of the terrain in the Nether is independent of the biome distribution; instead, the biome alters the surface material and adds terrain features to the netherrack terrain. \nBiomes.\nThe Nether is divided into several biomes just like the Overworld, each featuring unique terrain, mobs, structures, ambience, etc. There are currently five &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in the Nether.\n&lt;a href=\"Generated%20structures\"&gt;Generated structures&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nether contains a variety of unique generated structures. Though equally vast, it contains far fewer types of generated structures than the Overworld.\nTerrain features.\nThe Nether has a lot of different &lt;a href=\"terrain%20features\"&gt;terrain features&lt;/a&gt; which generate within the biomes of the Nether. \nMobs.\nThe Nether is home to its own share of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, most of which are fire- and lava-proof. &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; are the only Overworld mobs that can naturally spawn in the Nether; , baby &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt; may spawn as chicken jockeys.\nOther Overworld mobs do not naturally spawn in the Nether but can be teleported through portals (with the exception of withers and ender dragons).\nBlocks.\nNaturally generated.\nNaturally generated blocks includes those that are created through the world seed.\nNaturally created.\nNaturally created blocks are created through a combination of events that lead these blocks to be placed by natural causes, not by the player.\nStructures.\nThese blocks are generated as part of nether fortresses, bastion remnants, and ruined portals, but only when the \"&lt;a href=\"Structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;\" option is on.\nTechnical information.\nFolder.\n, the Nether is stored in codice_1. Deleting this folder resets the Nether, so that all player-made changes and buildings in that dimension are undone.\n, the codice_2 folder contains several collections of chunks. Some of these files are used for the Nether, but it is impossible to tell which ones simply by reading the file name.\nAdvancements.\nThere is a whole tab dedicated to the Nether in the advancement system, all involving visiting the Nether in some way in order to advance.\nHistory.\n "}

However, this only affects melee damage, whereas the enchantment applies to all direct attacks, including ranged.\nUsage.\nWhile wearing any piece of armor with the Thorns enchantment, the wearer has a codice_1 chance of inflicting \u2013 damage on anyone who attacks them, regardless of whether they were hit by a melee attack, arrow, or other projectile. If the entity dies as a result of this damage, the death message, codice_2 is displayed. The entity also gets knocked back when being attacked by the enchantment.\nMultiple worn armor items with the Thorns enchantment do stack. Each piece confers an independent chance to deal damage to the attacker as described above. The total amount of damage that can be dealt this way is capped at . \nProbabilities of inflicting maximum damage and average damage dealt depending on the number of items with Thorns III worn are as follows: \nThorns applies a durability penalty to the armor. It reduces durability by an additional 2 points when inflicting damage. If multiple armor pieces are enchanted with Thorns, the durability penalty is applied to one piece chosen at random, regardless of what level of Thorns that piece has. If the item is also enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt;, the damage penalty has a chance of being ignored. \nIf a projectile is launched toward an opponent equipped with Thorns, using a shield damages the shield instead of the player when the projectile hits the opponent.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s, the enchantment level can be increased. The maximum possible chance of dealing damage is 100% (at level 7). If the level of Thorns exceeds 10, then it deals codice_3 damage.\nObtaining.\nIn addition to normal &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, Thorns I and II can be obtained naturally from drops, fishing, &lt;a href=\"Trading%23Librarian\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; or as loot from &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;.\nThorns III cannot be directly obtained using an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;, but can be obtained by using an anvil to combine two Thorns II enchantments. It is also possible to obtain Thorns III as a trade from a &lt;a href=\"Trading%23Librarian\"&gt;Librarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Thorns III enchanted book can be found within the following structures:\nUnderground structures \nUnderwater structures\nAboveground structures\nMiscellaneous structures\nPieces of armor enchanted with Thorns III can be found within the following structures: \nUnderwater structures \nSmall structures \nThe Nether \nThe End\nUnaffected mobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt; fangs, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s with sonic boom attacks are not affected by this enchantment."}

The exact type of precipitation during a thunderstorm varies depending on the &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Temperature\"&gt;temperature of the current biome&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the current &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nThunderstorms can be skipped entirely with the use of a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of the time of day.\nEffects.\nAs with rain and snow, the sky is darkened and the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moon%23Stars\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; are no longer visible. Thunderstorms darken the world, causing the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level from the sky to visually decrease to 10. The clouds darken from white to dark gray, although clouds themselves do not precipitate or create lightning. While the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.\nUnlike during regular rainstorms or snowstorms, the light level from the sky is treated as if it were 0 for the purposes of hostile mob spawning, which allows hostile &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; to spawn at any time of the day.\nLightning.\nLightning is a lethal element to thunderstorms. Lightning momentarily increases the sky light's brightness to slightly greater than full daylight.\nLightning strikes randomly and creates &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;s (only on normal and hard difficulty) in a 2 block radius where it strikes. Such fires act normally, igniting all flammable materials, detonating &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, and even activating &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s. The lightning itself, however, is not destructive and does not destroy blocks. While most fires are extinguished by the rain, areas that block rain can allow the fire to spread, and any &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Block\"&gt;magma blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; lit by lightning is not extinguished by the rain.\nMost &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; struck by lightning are dealt damage (sometimes twice in succession) and are set on fire, which may cause additional damage.\nIf the player is killed by a lightning strike, the &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; appears: \"&lt;player&gt; was struck by lightning\". This message does not display if the player was killed by the fire created by a lightning bolt.\nLightning changes color from white to orange at sunset, and appears brighter during the daytime.\nLightning may be manually summoned with the command. It is summoned as an entity, and it can be referred to by &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Command%23Selectors\"&gt;selectors&lt;/a&gt;. \nLightning is also spawned when a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; is thrown and strikes a mob or a &lt;a href=\"lightning%20rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt; during a thunderstorm.\nEffects on mobs.\nA lightning strike affects certain mobs differently:\nLightning mechanics.\nFor each loaded chunk, every tick there is a chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm. From this probability, if \u2248201 chunks are loaded (from a radius of 128 blocks from the player to the center of each chunk) then 90% of the time up to 5 lightning strikes occur in the world each minute, with an average of approximately 2.4 lightning strikes each minute.\nWhen lightning is to strike, random X and Z coordinates within the chunk are chosen, and the block just above the highest block that is liquid or obstructs movement is chosen for the lightning strike. If a &lt;a href=\"lightning%20rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt; is nearby, it strikes the rod instead. Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3\u00d7\"h\"\u00d73 region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity stands in.\nThe target block is checked again for the following conditions:\nIf these conditions pass, lightning strikes.\nWhen lightning strikes, all entities within a 6\u00d712\u00d76 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning. Multiple passes are made over this region, so items dropped during an earlier pass may be destroyed during a subsequent pass; &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Damage%20immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt; usually prevents struck mobs from taking more than damage. &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;Non-solid&lt;/a&gt; blocks (such as &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"snow%20layer\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s) are not directly affected by lightning.\nThunder.\nThunder is a sound event that occurs every time lightning strikes. Every player within 160 thousand blocks and the same dimension hears the thunder. \nThe ability to hear thunder affects multiplayer, as it is possible to hear lightning strike at someone else's base or use a modded Minecraft client to determine the direction of every strike in the world the player is in. Using the direction of strikes, it is possible to the coordinates of lightning strikes.\nLightning rods.\nLightning strikes within a radius of 128 blocks (\"Java Edition\") or 64 blocks (Bedrock Edition) of a &lt;a href=\"lightning%20rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt; are redirected to the rod, emitting a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;Redstone&lt;/a&gt; signal. This can be used to prevent flammable structures from being struck by lightning, or intentionally direct lightning toward or away from mobs. When lightning strikes, all entities within a 7x12x7 region centered on the lightning rod, with the bottom affected block being 2 below the lightning rod and the topmost affected block being 9 above the lightning rod, are affected. During a thunderstorm, they emit spark-like particles, even in biomes where lightning doesn't strike.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nLightning bolts have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nHistory.\n "}

The game normally runs at a fixed rate of 20 ticks per second, so one tick happens every 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds, or five hundredths of a second, or one twentieth of a second), making an in-game &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; last exactly 24000 ticks, or 20 minutes. However, if the computer is unable to keep up with this speed, there are fewer game ticks per second (TPS). As the vast majority of actions are timed based on tick count rather than on wall clock time, this means that many things take longer on a slower computer.\nA statistic related to ticks per second (TPS) is milliseconds per tick (MSPT), the time a server actually uses to compute a tick. The TPS can be maintained at 20 only if the MSPT is no higher than 50. The following often contribute to server-side lag:\nThe MSPT value is displayed in the F3 &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; as \"ms ticks\" . The frame time graph () shows the TPS value. Both displays are available only as a multiplayer host or singleplayer since the stats come from the integrated \"server\" of your \"Minecraft\" game.\nGame process.\n, in each game loop the following actions are processed in order:\nChunk tick.\nAs a part of a game tick, specific &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s are ticked on every game tick.\n, chunks with loading type of entity ticking (see &lt;a href=\"Chunk%23Level%20and%20load%20type\"&gt;Chunk#Level and load type&lt;/a&gt;) \"and\" with horizontal distance between its center and a player (not in spectator mode) less than 128 blocks are ticked on every game tick. A few things should be noted here: first, the chunk should be loaded as an entity-ticking chunk. Second, if the chunk receives chunk tick, even if some blocks in the chunk are out of the 128-block radius, they can receive random tick as normal. Third, because 128 blocks is the horizontal distance, the player's position along the y-axis does not matter.\n, all chunks inside &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt; (or specified in the /tickingarea command) are ticked on every game tick. Random ticking randomly occurs in blocks in ticking chunks, regardless of player position inside the chunk. The 128-block distance used in Java does not apply.\nIn both editions, the following things will happen when a chunk gets ticked:\nRandom tick.\n&lt;a href=\"Chunk\"&gt;Chunk&lt;/a&gt;s consist of one subchunk per 16 blocks of height, each one being a 16\u00d716\u00d716=4096 block cube. Sections are distributed vertically starting at the lowest y level. Every chunk tick, some blocks are chosen at random from each section in the chunk. The blocks at those positions are given a \"random tick\".\n, the number of blocks chosen from each section is specified by (defaults to 3), and one block can be chosen multiple times in one chunk tick. , it also depends on (defaults to 1), but it specifies only relative speed instead of the exact number.\nMost blocks ignore this tick, but some use it to do something:\nBecause random block ticks are granted randomly, there is no way to predict when a block can receive its next tick. , the \"median\" time between ticks is 47.30 seconds (formula_1 946.03 game ticks). That is, there is a 50% chance for the interval to be equal or shorter than 47.30 seconds and a 50% chance for it to be equal or longer than 47.30. However, sometimes it is much longer or shorter: for example, there is a 1.38% chance for the interval to be less than one second and a 1.23% chance for the interval to be over five minutes. On \"average\", blocks are updated every 68.27 seconds (formula_2 1365.33 game ticks). For the math behind these numbers, see the Wikipedia entries for the .\nScheduled tick.\nSome blocks can request a tick sometime in the future. These \"scheduled ticks\" are used for things that have to happen in a predictable pattern\u2014for instance, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s schedule a tick to change state , &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; schedules a tick when it needs to move.\nAs a part of a game tick, each block position that has requested a scheduled block tick gets ticked on the specific game tick.\n, there are two types of scheduled ticks: block ticks and fluid ticks. Block ticks are executed first based on priority, and then based on scheduling order. A lower value for priority results in earlier execution during the scheduled tick phase. If a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt; is facing the back or side of another diode, its block tick will have a priority of -3. If a redstone repeater is depowering, it will have a priority of -2. Otherwise, the repeater will have a priority of -1. If a redstone comparator is facing the back or side of another diode, it will have a priority of -1. All other block ticks will have a priority of 0. Then, each block with a scheduled fluid tick will tick. Fluid ticks do not use priorities and are only ordered based on scheduling order.\n, the maximum number of scheduled ticks per game tick is 65,536. , the maximum number of scheduled ticks in a chunk per game tick is 100.\nRedstone tick.\nThe term redstone tick is a unit of time that describes a delay of two game ticks, creating a of a second delay. Do note that redstone ticks are actually not a \"real\" thing that's handled by distinct game logic, but a term coined by the community to make communication about redstone easier, since most redstone components have delays of multiples of 2 game ticks. For example, a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt; can have a delay of 2, 4, 6, or 8 game ticks, which could instead be described as having a delay of 1 to 4 redstone ticks."}
{"id": "91553", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=91553", "title": "Ticking area", "text": "A ticking area is a player-specified group of &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s that continues to be updated even when there is no player nearby. Because the chunks remain active, processes such as growth, decay, &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;ing, movement, and &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; operations aren't suspended in them when no players are present, provided at least one player remains somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nNormally, only the chunks closely surrounding a player are updated by the game. These chunks are said to be in the player's chunk update range. As the player moves through the world, new chunks that come into range are added to the list of updated chunks and older chunks that pass out of range are removed. Only the chunks in the list are updated to reflect the passage of time. This means, for instance, that if a player spends time exploring or in another dimension, &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; won't grow and any &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, or automated &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; underway when the player left remains unfinished when the player returns.\nTicking areas solve this problem by keeping player-designated chunks from being suspended. Each chunk in a ticking area is updated exactly as if it were perpetually in a player's chunk update range.\nEvents processed.\nThe following time-related events occur without interruption in ticking areas, provided there is at least one player in the same dimension (the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;) as the ticking area:\nSuspended events.\nMany of the above events involve entities moving or spreading, which raises the possibility of updates in a ticking area affecting blocks in outside chunks. If an outside chunk is within any player's chunk update range, of course, the chunk is active and these events proceed as usual. However, if the outside chunk is inactive the effects are suspended in most cases. Specifically,\nSpawning.\nMob spawning does not occur in ticking area chunks without the presence of a player, as all forms of mob spawning attempts are done in a radius centered on a player. However, when a player is present in those chunks, the ticking area does not prevent mob spawning. Pigmen spawning from portals is an exception; it solely relies on randomtickspeed.\nCreation and management.\nA player creates and manages ticking areas by executing a &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;. Up to ten ticking areas, each containing up to 100 chunks, can exist at one time in a world. Note that commands can be used in a world only if cheats are enabled. This makes the world ineligible for earning &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt;, so ticking areas and earning achievements are mutually exclusive.\nTo create a ticking area, specify its location and size in a command. There are two forms:\nOptionally, specify a name for the ticking area to identify it in subsequent commands.\nNote that the Y coordinate is checked for validity but otherwise ignored. This is because a chunk encompasses an entire column of blocks from the bottom of the world to its top, so it includes every possible Y value.\nTo display a list of current ticking areas, execute a command. This shows each ticking area's name (if provided) and corner coordinates (for the first form) or center coordinates and radius (for the second form). The coordinates shown in the list may not match those entered because the game adjusts them to the actual corner or center coordinates of a chunk. By default, this command lists only ticking areas in the player's current dimension; the optional codice_1 argument can be used to see all ticking areas in the world.\nTo remove a ticking area from the list, execute a command specifying either the ticking area's name or the coordinates of a point in the world. Specifying a name deletes only that ticking area. Specify a point deletes all ticking areas in the current dimension containing that point. An optional codice_2 argument removes all ticking areas in all dimensions."}

This action pauses any pathfinding the entity was doing. If the entity takes &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; while trading, the trading menu closes.\nAll transactions involve &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s. Villagers buy or sell goods for emeralds, and wandering traders sell items for emeralds but do not buy items. Trading is the only legitimate method of acquiring the &lt;a href=\"globe%20banner%20pattern\"&gt;globe banner pattern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20explorer%20map\"&gt;woodland explorer map&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20explorer%20map\"&gt;ocean explorer map&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode. It is also the only &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resource\"&gt;renewable&lt;/a&gt; way to obtain &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; gears (unless if the \"Villager Trade Rebalance\" data pack is turned on for diamond gears), &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bottle%20o%27%20Enchanting\"&gt;bottles o' enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, red sand, &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Small%20Dripleaf\"&gt;small dripleaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nVillagers have five career levels that can be increased by trading with them. Each villager starts at the \"novice\" level. A villager's level can be seen in the trading menu. The badge they wear can also be identified: stone for a novice, iron for an apprentice, gold for a journeyman, emerald for an expert, and diamond for a master. Trading until the villager's trading bar gets full unlocks the next level of trades. When a player trades with a villager, both the villager and the player gain experience. All villager trades reward the player with 3\u20136 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, plus an additional 5 experience if the villager levels up thanks to that. Trading with a wandering trader also rewards the player with some experience, although the trader does not give the player extra experience since wandering traders cannot level up. A villager levels up when its experience bar becomes full and gains up to two new trades, along with keeping their old ones. Additionally, a villager receives &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt; for 10 seconds.\nA villager's &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Professions\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; dictates the trading pool used to determine its trades. For example, villagers wearing straw hats are farmers, so their trades are based on the Farmer trade pool. Each profession unlocks a pre-defined and finite set of offers. Different professions are assigned to each villager based on their job-site block. This profession is indicated by their appearance and in the trading interface. Novice villagers who have not traded can lose their profession and change back into unemployed villagers if their claimed job site block is removed. Removing and then replacing a job site block can alter the trades offered, and a villager with no experience resets its trades every so often. Once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever and subsequently locks in the offered trades.\nVillagers run out of stock after a certain number of trades, the exact number is different for each item and referenced in the tables below. When villagers work at their job site blocks, they activate their offers again, up to twice per day. When an offer is disabled, a red \"X\" appears in the trading interface, and the villager displays the same particle effect as an offer being created.\nVillagers distinguish between data values, so damaged &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be traded in place of fully repaired tools. &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; data, however, is ignored, so the content of a &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt; does not matter. However, written books can no longer be sold to villagers, and no villagers currently buy any tools that have &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;.\nEconomics.\n, villagers can have a maximum of 10 trades. Each level unlocks a maximum of two new trades. If a level can pull from more than two trades, the two offered trades are chosen randomly from the set.\n, villagers have 7\u201311 trade slots. Some slots with multiple possible trades display only one trade; for example, farmer villagers have 4 potential trades in their first trade slot, so each trade has a chance to be chosen.\nEach trade can be used a maximum number of times, after which the trade becomes disabled. Once trades are disabled, villagers must work at their corresponding &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Job%20site%20blocks\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block to resupply their trades.\nThe price of an item rises and falls depending on three factors. Items with a high price multiplier (0.2) are affected by these changes more than items with a low multiplier (0.05). All price fluctuations affect only the first item involved in trade; for example, for an initial trade of 32 sticks for 1 emerald, the price might be driven down to 1 stick or up to 64 sticks for 1 emerald, but never for 2 emeralds. Additionally, no quantity can go lower than 1 or higher than the stack size.\nThe first factor is demand. An item that was sold out gets a price increase for all players when resupplied. If a player does not trade for a higher-priced item, the price is reduced the next time the villager resupplies. Demand is tracked per item, not per villager, so a villager can offer a higher-priced trade for a single item while other items are cheaper. Trades that have a price multiplier of 0 are not affected by demand.\nThe second way to affect prices is the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; effect, which temporarily reduces prices for the affected player depending on the level of the effect.\nFinally, players get personal discounts or fines based on their reputation with that particular villager. A positive reputation is gained by &lt;a href=\"Village%20mechanics%23Curing%20zombie%20villagers\"&gt;curing zombie villagers&lt;/a&gt; (the villager that was cured gives a permanent discount much larger than the temporary discount in nearby villagers). To cure a zombie villager, a player must splash it with a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; and then feed it a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;. The permanent discount is capped at one cure, while the temporary discount is capped at 8 cures. , players can also gain negative reputation by hitting or killing villagers, and positive reputation by trading.\nNon-trading villagers.\nIf the player attempts to trade with a non-trading villager , they grunt and shake their head because they do not have a job.\nNitwit.\nNitwits are green-coated villagers. They are unable to gain a profession and have a job, and therefore cannot trade.\nUnemployed villager.\nVillagers without a job overlay cannot trade. They only wear their biome outfits. An unemployed villager gains a profession by claiming an unclaimed &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Job%20site%20blocks\"&gt;job site block&lt;/a&gt;. For example, an unclaimed &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt; converts an unemployed villager into a cartographer when the villager claims it, and both the villager and the table emit green particles. An inaccessible (or destroyed) job site block causes the connected villager to lose its profession, but that does not affect the player's &lt;a href=\"Village%23Popularity\"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; in the village.\nJava Edition offers.\nThe villager pictured on the right is from the plains biome. To see villager professions dressed for other biomes, see .\nStarting from Novice, at each level two more trades become available, unless there is only one trade within that level.

Therefore, the following tables' leftmost column is how many emeralds the player needs to give to receive the items listed in the middle column of the table.\nJava Edition sales.\nThe wandering trader offers six trades in total: five random ordinary trades and one special trade.

This page is about villager_v1 trading , or before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt; was released.\nMechanics.\nPressing use on an adult villager would open a GUI allowing a player to trade with the villager. Villagers would make offers based on their profession and career, and would only make trades based on what offers they were making. Different offers could be viewed by pressing the left and right buttons next to the currently displayed offer. All offers involved &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; as a currency, and some item pertinent to the villager's career.\nCareers were assigned to each villager as they spawned, with multiple careers being part of the same profession, and sharing textures. For example, brown-robed villagers could be fletchers or fishermen and blacksmiths could be armorers or weaponsmiths. These careers were viewable in the trading GUI, but the villager's level was not. Every villager spawned at tier 1 of their given career, which ranged from 2\u20134 initial unlocked trades (i.e. all shepherds spawned with only two options, buying wool and selling shears). Each tier consisted of a defined set of trade offers, and the tiers were the same for any given career (see the chart below). They could unlock new tiers when an existing offer was traded. Note that the trading GUI had to be closed before a villager would unlock a new tier. When they did, they would receive Regeneration I and become surrounded with purple and green particles for a few seconds. Each career had a fixed sequence of tiers, and would only unlock a finite number of offers.\nVillagers would deactivate an offer if the offer had been used some number of times. The chance of an offer's deactivation was random, but an offer had to be used at least 2 times before it was eligible for deactivation. After an offer had been used 12 times, it was guaranteed to be deactivated. Trading a different offer would sometimes activate an offer again. When an offer was disabled, a red X would appear in the trading interface, and it had the same particle effect as an offer being created.\nAn offer was guaranteed to reactivate available deactivated options (and unlock a tier, if some had not yet been unlocked) the \"first\" time it was traded. On subsequent trades, it would only have a 20% chance of doing so, per trade. For example, if a farmer villager had a trade of 8 &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s for 1 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;, and the player traded a stack of 64 pumpkins, this would count as 8 attempts with each attempt having a 20% chance to reactivate the villager's trades, and come to about 83.2% chance of reactivation (1 - 1/0.88).\nVillagers would distinguish between data values, so different colors of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; \"could not\" replace white wool, charcoal could not be traded in place of &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, and damaged &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; could not be traded in place of fully repaired tools. &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; data, however, was ignored, so the content of a &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt; did not matter.\n, all trades rewarded the player with 3\u20136 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, or 8\u201311 experience if the villager was in a state where it is willing to &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt;. This was also true in Bedrock editions, except that certain trades didn't reward any experience: the first-tier trades of a Farmer, the &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; trade of a Cleric, the &lt;a href=\"porkchop\"&gt;porkchop&lt;/a&gt; trade of a Butcher, or the &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; trade of a Fletcher.\nTrades.\nThe full list of careers and tiers is below:\nNitwit (green robe).\nNitwits were generic green-robed or green coated. They offered no trades.\nStone Mason (black gloves with black apron).\nNote: This stone mason trade table below only used in Bedrock Edition from villager which are not converted to villager_v2 (from template world)"}

The server contains attractions including multiple mini-games in three different themed sections.\nTrails and Tales Theme Park.\nThere are three different sections present in the theme park for players to venture in. Mini-games are one of the main attractions in the theme park. Multiple attractions are present in every section.\nCherry Grove.\nThe Cherry Grove contains a &lt;a href=\"cherry%20grove\"&gt;cherry grove&lt;/a&gt; and some bamboo.\nRiver Raft Racers.\nPlayers can compete in a race and try to finish the race as fast as possible by riding a &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;bamboo raft&lt;/a&gt; around the Cherry Grove river. Coins also appear on the water to be collected. There is only one lap and players are given up to 1 minute and 30 seconds to complete the race.\nBiome Trail Maze.\nA medium difficulty maze that is made to be like a cave system. The themes are the &lt;a href=\"end\"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biomes and the &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt; structures. Two hidden mobs can be found in the maze.\nCherry Tree Parkour.\nA medium difficulty parkour that goes above and through the Cherry Grove section. It has two checkpoints.\nHot Air Balloon.\nA hot air balloon that takes players in the sky to view the whole park.\nRaft cutout.\nA cutout of two rafts is present next to the Cherry Tree Parkour for players to take pictures. Walking up behind it changes the camera perspective to be in front of the cutout so players can take a picture of themselves.\nCamel Canyon.\nThe land in the canyon is a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; with an archaeology site.\nDesert Dash.\n&lt;a href=\"Camel\"&gt;Camel&lt;/a&gt;s are ridden by players to compete in a race to get the fastest time. Speed balloons appear floating above the track. When a balloon is popped by punching it, is applied to the player's camel for 3 seconds. 2 minutes are given to complete two laps around the desert track.\nDig Site Duster.\nThis mini-game has players use a &lt;a href=\"brush\"&gt;brush&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Block\"&gt;suspicious sand&lt;/a&gt; to uncover items to earn points.\nDesert Town Parkour.\nAn easy difficulty parkour that goes above and through the Cacti Canyon section, through the desert village with gift shops. It has some checkpoints.\nDesert Cave Parkour.\nA medium difficulty parkour that goes beneath and through the Dig Site Duster attraction. It has two checkpoints.\nCamel cutout.\nA cutout of two camels is present in the desert village area for players to take pictures. Walking up behind it changes the camera perspective to be in front of the cutout so players can take a picture of themselves.\nThe Lost World.\nThe Lost World is themed around the &lt;a href=\"sniffer\"&gt;sniffer&lt;/a&gt; in a lush environment.\nMob Head Mania.\nThere are four small areas that hold one player each, Players have to memorize a note melody with mob sounds from a , , , , and a head, which starts off with one note with one note being added to the melody after each round. After the melody is played, the player must repeat the same melody by pressing the buttons on the note blocks. There are more than thirteen rounds.\nJungle Tree Parkour.\nA medium difficulty parkour that goes above and through the sniffer exhibit, through the volcano with &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;. It has two checkpoints.\nAncient Cave Parkour.\nA hard difficulty parkour that goes around the sniffer exhibit. It has some checkpoints.\nSniffer cutout.\nA cutout of two sniffers is present at the bottom of The Lost World section for players to take pictures. Walking up behind it changes the camera perspective to be in front of the cutout so players can take a picture of themselves.\nCarousel of Tales.\nThis carousel is located in the central area where the three sections meet. There are two sniffers and two camels players can ride on at anytime.\nMinecart Madness.\nNext to the park entrance is a booth where players can ride in a custom modeled &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; around the edge of the map. The track occasionally breaks off into a small pond of water with &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column\"&gt;bubble columns&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; which then launches the minecart over obstacles. A hidden mob, the creeper, can also be found when passing through the &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;.\nMerch and Food.\nThere are various different shops that can be found throughout the park which are run by named NPCs where players can collect items. There are two kinds of shops: Merch and Food. At Merch shops, NPCs sell items such as balloons, hats, and masks. At Food shops, NPCs sell items such as popsicles and ancient popcorn. These items are not saved in inventories upon players exiting the server.\nKinsley's shop.\nKinsley's Merch shop, named Gift Shop! on a sign, is located across from the Minecart Madness attraction near the park entrance. Kinsley offers the following items:\nBella's shop.\nBella's Food shop, named SELF SERVICE on a sign, is located between the Carousel of Tales and the Minecart Madness attraction near the park entrance. Bella offers the following items:\nGideon's shop.\nGideon's Food shop, named SELF SERVICE on a sign, is located between the Carousel of Tales and the Minecart Madness attraction near the park entrance. Gideon offers the following items:\nJasper's shop.\nJasper's Merch shop is located across from the Mob Head Mania attraction in The Lost World section. Jasper offers the following items:\nEverett's shop.\nEverett's Food shop is located at the end of the small tunnel between the Mob Head Mania attraction and Jasper's shop. Everett offers the following items:\nOrson's shop.\nOrson's Merch shop, named PANDA TIME! on a sign, is located in the Cherry Grove section. The shop is made with bamboo and themed around &lt;a href=\"Panda\"&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt;. Orson offers the following item:\nRosalind's shop.\nRosalind's Merch shop, named HATS ON HATS! on a sign, is located on the path near the River Raft Racers attraction. The shop is made with cherry wood. Rosalind offers the following item:\nLila's shop.\nLila's Merch shop is located in the desert village area of the Camel Canyon section of the park. Lila offers the following items:\nWinston's shop.\nWinston's Food shop is located in the desert village area of the Camel Canyon section of the park. Winston offers the following items:\nSecret hunt.\nTen minature versions of mobs, referred to by the name Secret, are scattered around the park for players to find.\nRewards.\nPlayers get the Cherry Wood Tee &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creator\"&gt;Character Creator&lt;/a&gt; top item for joining the server.\nUnused Content.\nVolcano.\nVolcano rocks were found in the resource pack that included a model, texture, and a volcano erupting sound."}

While it was rendered translucent as expected in prior versions, this seems to be inconsistent and possibly hardware-dependent, and when it fully stopped is currently unknown. Its opacity is also a parity issue, as cauldron water appears translucent as expected . This persists to the present day.\nSimilarly, while tripwire itself is translucent, the region of tripwire which connects to a &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt; is not. This causes the region of tripwire attached to the tripwire hook to appear much darker than the rest of it."}

With adequate food and potion supplies, sprinting can be more cost-effective than building high-speed transportation systems.\nCommands.\nUsing the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;, extremely high or low speeds become reachable. At exceedingly high levels (100+), the player moves faster than the &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt; can load.\nVertical transportation.\nThere are some examples of purely vertical transportation methods:\nFalling speed is : Every tick ( second), non-flying players and mobs have their vertical speed decremented (less upward motion, more downward motion) by 0.08 blocks per tick (1.6 m/s), then multiplied by 0.98. This \"would\" produce a terminal velocity of 3.92 blocks per tick or 78.4 m/s. However, the sky isn't quite high enough for that: Falling from layer 256 to bedrock takes about 5.5 seconds, with impact at 3.5 blocks per tick (70 m/s). It is possible to fly higher in Creative mode, or by flying with elytra and then removing them, reaching terminal velocity falling from \"above the sky\".\nAn exact function to calculate the speed of a (free)falling player is the following:\nformula_1\nWhere formula_2 is the , the velocity formula_3 is in blocks/second (or meters/second), the time formula_4 is in seconds, initial velocity is zero and downward motion is negative. formula_5 is floored because Minecraft updates once each tick.\nAn exact function to calculate the displacement of the player is the following:\nformula_6\nWhere the displacement formula_7 is in blocks (meters), the time formula_4 is in seconds, initial velocity and displacement is zero and downward displacement is negative. Or:\nformula_9\nwhere formula_10 is the number of game ticks elapsed. Formula with initial conditions formula_11 where formula_12 is the starting height and formula_13 is the upward speed in [m/tick]. Or formula_14 where formula_15 is given in m/s.\nAn approximate function to calculate the time it takes to fall from some height is the following:\nformula_16\nWhere the height formula_7 is in blocks (meters), the time formula_4 is in seconds, downward displacement is negative and formula_19 is the .\nTrivia.\nSprinting with Soul Speed 3 on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; while having &lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; 2 is almost as fast as the fastest possible &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; (12.6896 m/sec)."}

Iron trapdoors require a pickaxe to drop as items. Copper trapdoors require a stone pickaxe or better to drop as items. Trapdoors remain in place if their attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed.\nNatural generation.\nMost types of trapdoors can be found in &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s. Specifically:\nWaxing.\nCopper trapdoors can be turned into the respective waxed copper trapdoors by a &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; item on them. Waxed copper trapdoors do not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.\nScraping.\n an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; on a waxed copper trapdoor turns it into the respective non-waxed copper trapdoor. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized copper trapdoor reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper trapdoor respectively.\nLightning strike.\nNon-waxed copper trapdoors are completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed copper trapdoors nearby are deoxidized randomly.\nUsage.\nProperties.\nWooden trapdoors and copper trapdoors can be opened and closed by players or redstone pulse. Iron trapdoors can be opened only by redstone pulse.\nTo place a trapdoor, a trapdoor item while pointing at the block it should be attached to. Once it is placed, the attachment block can be removed without breaking the trapdoor.\nWhen placed, a trapdoor either occupies the top or bottom part of a block, depending on where the player placed the trapdoor. If a trapdoor is placed on the top part of a block, it opens downward. If placed on the bottom part of a block, it opens upward.\nA trapdoor's \"hinge\" is located on the block attached to it.\nTrapdoors can be moved by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. Trapdoors block flowing water and lava. Waterlogged trapdoors release water from all sides apart from the top or all sides apart from the side that is blocked by the trapdoor itself (and the top) Lava can create &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; in air blocks next to wooden trapdoors as if they were flammable, but the trapdoors do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either).\nSingle trapdoors are climbable if they are opened and placed directly above a ladder against a wall. This means if an opened trapdoor is placed in the middle of two ladders, players can climb through it directly. However, if there is more than one trapdoor between two ladders, players cannot climb through (they are stopped at the top of the first trapdoor).\nTrapdoors can act as a solid block when in the closed position and thus certain items can be placed above or below it. When trapdoors are opened, they act like a non-solid block resulting as a non-placeable area. &lt;a href=\"Lantern\"&gt;Lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, for example, can be placed on top and below the closed trapdoor.\nThe sound of opening and closing of a trapdoor can be heard up to 16 blocks away, like most &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; sounds.\nTrapdoors can be opened or closed with a player or mob inside.\n, closing a trapdoor one block above the ground while standing under it causes the player to crawl, and continue crawling until reaching a block with two empty spaces above, at which time the player stands automatically. This can be used to enter small secret tunnels or otherwise inaccessible terrain. This functionality is not available unless the \u201cCrawling\u201d experimental feature is enabled.\nBarrier.\nA trapdoor can be used as a switchable barrier to entity movement. Although primarily used to block movement by mobs and players, a trapdoor can also be used to control the movement of boats (for example, a top trapdoor placed in a two-wide water flow stops a boat when closed (extended out into the water flow), but allow it to move again when open), items and minecarts (a trapdoor can stop a falling item or minecart, then allow it to drop again when the trapdoor opens), etc.\nTrapdoors are 0.1875 () blocks thick. The rest of a trapdoor's space can be moved through freely and provides a breathable space if placed underwater and not waterlogged.\nTo open or close a wooden trapdoor or a copper trapdoor, use the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;. When a trapdoor opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it \"passes through\". Moving trapdoors don't push entities the way that pistons do.\nIron trapdoors can be opened only with redstone power (a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt;, etc.).\nMobs consider all trapdoors closed, resulting in pathfinding mobs falling through open trapdoors. A player can take advantage of this behavior to construct mob traps.\nRedstone component.\nBoth wooden and iron trapdoors can be controlled with redstone power.\nA trapdoor is a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Mechanism%20components\"&gt;redstone mechanism&lt;/a&gt; and can be activated by:\nWhen activated, a trapdoor immediately rotates around its hinge side to its open state. When deactivated, a trapdoor immediately returns to its closed state. Each change of state takes one game tick.\nAn activated wooden trapdoor can still be closed by a player, and does not re-open until it receives a new activation signal (if a trapdoor has been closed \"by hand\", it still needs to be deactivated and then reactivated to open by redstone).\nFuel.\nOverworld wooden trapdoors can be used as a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nNote blocks.\nWooden trapdoors can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds."}

Items contained in the chest are dropped when the chest is broken. If one half of a large trapped chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed trapped chest are dropped and the remaining trapped chest continues to function as a small trapped chest.\nNatural generation.\nTrapped chests naturally generate in \"fake end portal rooms\" in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nTrapped chests can be used as containers and as &lt;a href=\"redstone%20components\"&gt;redstone components&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo place a trapped chest, the face of a block adjacent to the space the trapped chest should occupy.\nPlacing two adjacent trapped chests side-by-side typically joins them to create a large trapped chest. To avoid them joining and instead place two single trapped chests side by side, the player may while placing the second trapped chest, or place the second trapped chest facing a different direction from the first one. Alternately, normal &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s do not combine with trapped chests.\nTrapped chests can be moved by pistons. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow around without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to trapped chests as if they were flammable, but the chests do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either).\nTrapped chests can also activate buried &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, destroying themselves, their contents and any &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s or players near them. They need to be opened twice for the TNT to be activated.\nContainer.\nA single trapped chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large trapped chest has 54 slots of inventory space. In a large trapped chest, the top three rows in the interface correspond to the western or northern chest block and the bottom three to the southern or eastern chest block.\nTo open the trapped chest GUI, use the control. To move items between the trapped chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the trapped chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the trapped chest GUI, use the control.\nBy default, the GUI of a trapped chest is labeled \"Chest\" and the GUI of a large trapped chest is labeled \"Large Chest.\" A trapped chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the trapped chest in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; before placing it, or by using the &lt;a href=\"Commands/data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; command (for example, to label a trapped chest at (0, 64, 0) \"Loot!\", use codice_1). If half of a large trapped chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large trapped chest, but if the named half is destroyed, the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large trapped chest have different names, the GUI label takes the name of the northernmost or westernmost half of the large trapped chest depending on its orientation (the half with the lowest coordinate in the appropriate axis).\nA trapped chest can be \"locked\" by setting the trapped chest's codice_2 tag. If a trapped chest's codice_2 tag is not blank, the trapped chest cannot be opened except by players holding an item with the same name as the codice_2 tag's text. A trapped chest's codice_2 tag can be set or unset with the &lt;a href=\"Commands/data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; command. For example, to lock a trapped chest at (0, 64, 0) so that only players holding an item named \"Alice's Key\" can open the trapped chest, use codice_6.\nRedstone component.\nTrapped chests can be used to detect when their inventory is accessed by players.\nA trapped chest is inactive while not being accessed, but activates when accessed by a player (see above). Accessing either part of a large trapped chest activates both halves of the large trapped chest. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s cannot access/activate a trapped chest, and a trapped chest is activated by items moving into or out of it by &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhile active, a trapped chest:\nAn active trapped chest does \"not\" power any adjacent &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;s facing away from it. Redstone comparators can &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20comparator%23Measure%20block%20state\"&gt;measure&lt;/a&gt; the block state of the trapped chest, producing a power level from 0 to 15 proportional to how full the trapped chest is. Anything else powered by an active trapped chest (including a block beneath it) can power redstone comparators normally.\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s become hostile toward players who open, break or interact with trapped chests.\nFuel.\nTrapped chests can be used as a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per chest.\nNote blocks.\nTrapped chests can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sound.\nChristmas chest.\nAs with normal chests, on December 24, 25, and 26, trapped chests and large trapped chests have their textures changed to Christmas chests that look like presents. Christmas trapped chest and their large version look identical to Christmas chest and their large version respectively.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nEvery trapped chest has a &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; associated with it that holds additional data about the trapped chest."}

{"id": "304", "revid": "48900764", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=304", "title": "Tree", "text": "A tree is a common &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"feature\"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; that mainly consists of &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nStructure.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe trees found in \"Minecraft\", excluding the jungle bush, azalea trees, mangroves, and cherry trees.\nTrees vary widely in height, from a bare minimum of 1 log block for jungle bushes, ranging up to a maximum of 30 blocks for mega jungle trees.\nTree canopies are composed of leaf blocks and grow 1 block higher than the highest log block (except those of the fancy oak, whose leaves grow 3 blocks higher). The canopy may begin from the ground and go up to 6 blocks from the ground. Tree canopies are generated from roughly spherical clusters of leaves about 5\u20137 blocks across, centered on sections of trunk or branches. Leaves must be supported by an adjacent trunk (or leaf blocks connected to the trunk); otherwise, they disappear.\nFancy oak, dark oak, and mega jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to the trunk or other branches). Most of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and six logs. Acacia tree branches do not cover their branches in this way. Regular oak, jungle, birch, spruce, pine, mega spruce, and mega pine lack branches.\nGrowth and characteristics.\nTrees are created when &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s are generated, and can also be grown from &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTree saplings have a chance ( if they are jungle saplings) of dropping from &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaf&lt;/a&gt; blocks when they decay or are destroyed. There are seven species of saplings, corresponding to seven of the eight main trees: oak, birch, spruce, jungle, acacia, dark oak, and cherry.\nThe sapling can be planted on any variant of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; (except &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;) a &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;, and must have a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of at least 8 in the sapling block. \nA sapling uproots with light level 7 or less in the sapling block itself unless it has a view of the sky that is unobstructed (except by &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;other transparent materials&lt;/a&gt;). The sapling must have at least 6 blocks of space above it to grow; the amount of required space varies between the different species of trees. A ceiling above sapling limits the \"maximum\" height of the tree that can grow from that sapling. However, dirt blocks and logs may not prohibit tree growth, and in some cases may be replaced as a sapling attempt to grow through them. However in Bedrock edition, logs prohibit tree growth.\nIf multiple saplings are planted next to each other, each one grows as long as the leaves from the other grown saplings do not block too much of the sunlight. Artificial light (torches, etc.) can still be used to grow them if this happens.\nAll trees in the active &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; radius around the player make attempts to grow at random intervals. For any given tree this can work out to about one growth attempt per minute. When a tree attempts to grow, it first checks that it has enough light, then randomly chooses which variant of that species of tree to become; for example, an oak sapling chooses to grow as either a normal or fancy oak tree.\nOnce a tree has passed a light check and chosen size to attempt, it checks if there is enough space for its chosen size. If it encounters an obstruction during this check, it fails to grow and must wait for the next pass before it can attempt to grow again. This means that a tree in an open field with enough light grows relatively quickly, but a tree in a cramped tree farm that stunts its size may make several attempts before finally growing.\n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, when on a sapling, has a chance of forcing it to grow, so long as all of the normal checks (light, space, dirt, etc.) have passed. It does not \"guarantee\" growth, but forces an \"attempt\" to grow.\nAll saplings grow normally in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, although they must be planted in &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; transported from the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and provided with sufficient light and space. Leaf blocks in the Nether have the same color as if they were placed in a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; biome. In the End, they are a dull bluish-green, as in the &lt;a href=\"windswept%20hills\"&gt;windswept hills&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nIn order to grow a 2\u00d72 tree (be it spruce, jungle or dark oak), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. The &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used on any of the saplings. The largest mega jungle trees, mega spruces, and mega pines reach 31 blocks tall. Dark oaks are typically 6\u20138 blocks tall.\nLeaves and logs removed from a tree do not grow back over time.\nWhen a sapling on a grass block or mycelium grows into a tree, the grass block or mycelium is instantly converted to dirt.\nTypes of trees.\nThere are nine types of trees \u2013 &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20tree\"&gt;jungle tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"acacia\"&gt;acacia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dark%20oak\"&gt;dark oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"azalea%20tree\"&gt;azalea tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mangrove\"&gt;mangrove&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cherry\"&gt;cherry&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther structures are loosely defined as trees: the &lt;a href=\"huge%20fungus\"&gt;huge fungus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"chorus%20plant\"&gt;chorus plant&lt;/a&gt;.\nOak.\nOaks are among the most common trees in the game. They have the smallest space requirements, and along with &lt;a href=\"dark%20oak\"&gt;dark oak&lt;/a&gt; trees, they can drop an &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; when a leaf block is destroyed. In &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; biomes, a slightly larger variant of the regular oak tree with &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt; is generated, which can naturally generate in shallow water. Fancy oaks may also grow or generate in place of regular oaks; these are taller and may feature branches. A rare variant is its smallest configuration, colloquially known as a \"balloon\" oak.\nSpruce.\nSpruce trees grow from spruce saplings and have growth patterns and requirements similar to birch trees, although they appear different. They are mainly found in the &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; biome, but they may also generate in &lt;a href=\"windswept%20forest\"&gt;windswept forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"old%20growth%20taiga\"&gt;old growth taiga&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Spruce logs have the same texture as oak logs, but it is a darker shade of brown; its leaves are denser, with a darker and more bluish tone.\nBirch.\nBirch trees look fairly similar to small oaks in terms of height and are most commonly found in &lt;a href=\"Birch%20Forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt; biomes. There are two types of birch: a shorter tree that can be grown by the player with birch saplings; and a taller, rarer variety that generates only naturally in &lt;a href=\"Birch%20Forest%23Tall%20Birch%20Forest\"&gt;tall birch forest&lt;/a&gt; biomes.\nJungle.\nJungle trees are one of the rarest naturally generated trees in Minecraft because they are native to the &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes, which are themselves rare. Jungle tree leaves drop jungle tree saplings. When planted in grass or dirt they grow into a jungle tree with a 1\u00d71 trunk, but the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can place them in a 2\u00d72 formation to grow a jungle tree with a 2\u00d72 trunk like the trees found naturally in the jungle biome. Jungle bushes also generate in the jungle biome, featuring oak leaves and a single jungle log.\nAcacia.\nAcacias are found in the &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biome. They are about 8 blocks tall and feature unique diagonal trunks, and may occasionally have multiple canopies.\nDark oak.\nDark oaks are found in the &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt; biome. They have thick 2\u00d72 trunks. A dark oak always generates with dirt blocks under its trunk, even on a steep cliff. Irregular logs, representing large branches, are nearly always present and connected to the trunk. The canopy of a dark oak filters enough light that a dense forest of them is sufficiently dark for hostile mobs to spawn during the daytime.\nAzalea.\nAzalea trees generate on any empty space above a &lt;a href=\"lush%20cave\"&gt;lush cave&lt;/a&gt;, with roots consisting of &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hanging%20roots\"&gt;hanging roots&lt;/a&gt; that reach down to the lush cave. The tree usually appears at the surface, but they can generate inside caves if there is enough room and a lush cave below.\nAzalea trees can be manually grown by applying bone meal to an &lt;a href=\"azalea\"&gt;azalea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"flowering%20azalea\"&gt;flowering azalea&lt;/a&gt; block (\"bush\"). Unlike most trees, they do not have their own wood type (the trunks are composed of oak logs), but they have two types of leaf block: &lt;a href=\"azalea%20leaves\"&gt;azalea leaves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Flowering%20Azalea%20Leaves\"&gt;flowering azalea leaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nMangrove.\nMangroves are found in muddy &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20swamp\"&gt;mangrove swamp&lt;/a&gt;s, growing in water or on land. They are grown from &lt;a href=\"propagule\"&gt;propagule&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be found hanging from the trees. A mangrove converts any mud around it to &lt;a href=\"muddy%20mangrove%20roots\"&gt;muddy mangrove roots&lt;/a&gt;. The wood has a deep red-orange color.\nCherry.\nCherry trees are found in &lt;a href=\"Cherry%20Grove\"&gt;cherry groves&lt;/a&gt;. They have distinct pink leaves and curved branches. They also have a unique petal falling particle effect.\nHuge fungus.\nHuge fungi come in many shapes and sizes, from really small to really huge. Their trunks are composed of \"stem\" blocks which are nearly identical to wooden logs, except for being non-flammable. In place of leaves they have &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart%20Block\"&gt;nether wart blocks&lt;/a&gt; or warped wart blocks, with occasional &lt;a href=\"shroomlight\"&gt;shroomlight&lt;/a&gt;s embedded within them. Crimson huge fungi often generate with &lt;a href=\"weeping%20vine\"&gt;weeping vine&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHuge crimson fungi are found in the &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt; biome; huge warped fungi are found in the &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nThey can be grown from crimson or warped &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt;, placed on &lt;a href=\"crimson%20nylium\"&gt;crimson nylium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warped%20nylium\"&gt;warped nylium&lt;/a&gt;. To grow into a huge fungus, the original fungus must be planted on the matching type of nylium, and then bone meal applied to it.\nHuge mushroom.\nWhile loosely defined as a tree, these are structures generated in certain biomes. Instead of logs and leaves, they consist of mushroom stems and mushroom blocks, which don't decay. When harvested without &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, they drop &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThey come in two variants, brown and red.\nChorus plant.\nWhile loosely defined as a tree, these are structures generated on the outermost End islands. Instead of logs and leaves, they are instead comprised of chorus plant trunk blocks and flowers on the tip. They do not drop their own block but instead &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are usually extremely tall, with multiple branches. When the bottom of the chorus tree is cut, the whole chorus tree falls apart, dropping their fruit. The branches are tipped with \"chorus flowers\", which do not drop when the tree is broken, but can separately be broken (and dropped) by any tool, bare hands, or the impact of any projectile. When a chorus flower is placed on &lt;a href=\"End%20stone\"&gt;End stone&lt;/a&gt;, it grows into a chorus tree over time \u2014 unlike most trees, this is a step-wise process as the chorus flower generates branches one block at a time.\nVariant trees.\n, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.\nDying trees.\nThese trees have the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;. They can generate as dark oak, jungle, spruce, small oak trees or be grown from saplings.\nFallen trees.\nThese trees consist of a single upright log, or stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump.\nOak, spruce, birch, tall birch, and jungle trees can generate as fallen trees.\nRemoved.\n\"Cold-en\" oak trees.\nThe \"cold-en\" oak was a tree formed by a rare glitch in older versions of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; prior to &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.9.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.9.0&lt;/a&gt;. It was a small tree with a shape identical to that of a small oak or birch tree that is generated on the border of a forest and a snowy area (one of which is usually mountainous). It was made of spruce &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; and spruce &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s (seen in both the \"lite\" and paid versions prior to v0.9.0) or, rarely, oak logs (paid only). Its rarity is compared to the &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;modified jungle edge&lt;/a&gt;.\nFoliage colors.\nDepending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, if an oak tree is in a colder biome, such as a taiga or windswept hills biome, it has a blue-green hue. In a snowy taiga, the leaves are white with a slight grey tint. However, if it is in a dry biome, such as a desert or savanna, it has a mustard yellow hue. Spruce, birch and cherry leaves do not follow these rules; they always have the same color regardless of the biome.\nLeaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side."}

The player's position does not matter; the player can be in the water, underwater, sitting in a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;, or standing on adjacent land. &lt;a href=\"Fish\"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt; can be caught just as readily in small, shallow, and/or player-created pools, both aboveground and underground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wiktionary%3Abobber\"&gt;bobber&lt;/a&gt; must be watched closely. Small splashes can be seen around the bobber. \nOnce the bobber hits water, the wait time is determined, and the player must wait for a random period between 5 and 30 seconds (100 to 600 ticks at 20 &lt;a href=\"Tick\"&gt;ticks&lt;/a&gt; per second) before the hook catches something.\nAfter the wait period has passed, a trail of fishing &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; appear, approaching the bobber in a serpentine path (provided that the Particles &lt;a href=\"Options%23Video%20Settings\"&gt;Video Setting&lt;/a&gt; is not set to Minimal). After 1 to 4 seconds the particles reach the bobber, the bobber dips below the surface, and the player has a approximately half a second or evenly-distributed one to two seconds to reel in the line before the waiting time resets. Removing the bobber from water during this interval secures the caught item on the line.\nUpon a successful reel-in:\nIf the player wanders more than 32 blocks away from the bobber, or if the player stops holding a fishing rod, the bobber and fishing line disappear with no durability reduction to the rod.\nThe bobber floats up to the water's surface even if the fishing rod is used from underwater unless it hooks onto a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; or is obstructed by a block.\n&lt;a href=\"Fish\"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt; mobs do not attempt to bite the fish hook and bobber, but can be hooked and reeled as with other mobs.\nJunk and treasure.\nThe fishing rod can occasionally catch treasure or junk instead of fish. A fishing rod without the &lt;a href=\"Luck%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Luck of the Sea&lt;/a&gt; enchantment has an 85% chance of catching fish, a 10% chance of catching junk, and a 5% chance of catching treasure. Each level of the Luck of the Sea enchantment increases the chance of catching a treasure at the expense of reducing the chances of catching fish and junk. The &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; status effect grants the same benefit.\nTo catch items in the treasure category, the bobber must be in open water, defined as the 5\u00d74\u00d75 vicinity around the bobber resting on the water surface (2 blocks away horizontally, 2 blocks above the water surface, and 2 blocks deep). Each horizontal layer in this area must consist only of &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;s \"or\" &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source blocks, &lt;a href=\"waterlogged\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; blocks without collision (such as signs, kelp, or coral fans), and &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s. These conditions are checked every &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; to determine if the player is eligible to receive treasure from a fishing attempt. If the conditions are not met, only items in the fish and junk categories can be obtained from fishing.\nFishing rod durability.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; has 64 units of durability in \"Java Edition\" and 384 units in \"Bedrock Edition\". Each use costs 1 point, and the rod breaks when all durability is consumed. The number of uses can be increased if the &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; enchantments are applied.\nThe durability cost is subtracted on reel-in, rather than on hooking. Therefore, no penalty is levied for switching to another item or dropping the rod instead of reeling in."}

If the rod is reeled in once the particles \"bite\" the bobber, the player obtains a fish, junk, or possibly a treasure item. If the fishing rod was in the player's hand and is no longer, the fishing bobber &lt;a href=\"Entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; despawns, unless the fishing rod to the off-hand or it's been swapped with another fishing rod.\nHooking mobs and other entities.\nThe fishing rod can be used to hook &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s. The fishing rod can then be reeled in, dragging the hooked object toward the player without dealing damage. Reeling in a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or entity costs 5 points of durability, and reeling in an item costs 3 points. Reeling a mob pulls it toward the player with a speed of the distance between mob and player.\nBesides mobs and items, entities that can be reeled in include: \nSome entities can be hooked, but cannot be reeled in: \nAttempting to reel in said entities still costs durability to the rod.\nThe rest of the entities cannot be hooked at all: \nUsing it on a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; lowers the player's popularity and causes any naturally-spawned &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s nearby to attack.\nFuel.\nA fishing rod can be used as fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per fishing rod.\nOther usage.\nThe hook can also be used to activate wooden &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"weighted%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;weighted pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEnchantments.\nA fishing rod can receive the following enchantments:\nA fishing rod with the &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; enchantment has infinite durability if used for fishing only. The rod incrementally repairs itself using the experience gained each time a player reels in a fish, even if starting from nearly 0% durability.

The generated flower depends on both the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; and the X/Y/Z coordinates. Double flowers cannot be obtained this way.\n, when bone meal is applied to any single high flower (except wither roses) that has been placed or generated on top of a grass block, more flowers appear around it without grass. With the exception of dandelions and poppies, the flowers that form around are the same type as the original flower. In the case of dandelions, poppies occasionally appear, and vice versa for poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7\u00d77 square.\nApplying bone meal to a double flower results in the flower dropping a copy of itself. This is the only renewable way to obtain double flowers.\nFlower biomes.\nThe following table is those which can spawn when using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. See also &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt; for the types of flowers which can naturally spawn in each &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; when a new &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; is generated. \nUsage.\nAll kinds of flowers can be used as decoration and planted on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;.

One-block-tall flowers can be planted in a &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost kinds of flowers can be crafted into &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s or used to craft &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause flowers are non-solid transparent &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s, they can be used (like &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es) to break blocks that fall on them, such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBees.\n&lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;s engage in a pollinating behavior with flowers, increasing the honey level in &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;s by 1.\nNavigation.\nSunflowers always face east, making them useful for navigation if the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; is not visible. This also works in the Nether and the End.\nBreeding.\nDandelions can be used to &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt;, grow, and lead &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s. Any flower can be used for &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, including wither roses.\nDamaging.\nWhen not in &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, wither roses inflict the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt; status effect to any &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s or non-immune &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s touching it, dealing damage every half second or two seconds. The effect lingers for 1 second after the player/mob leaves its &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; space. &lt;a href=\"Wither%20skeleton\"&gt;Wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; are not affected due to their &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt; immunity.\nWhen placed in a flower pot, wither roses do not cause damage to any entity.\nSuspicious stew.\nAll small flowers can be used to create &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;. When a flower is used on a brown &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;, the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that flower the next time it is milked with a &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt;. The mooshroom returns to producing mushroom stew until fed another flower. Eating one restores &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; and 7.2 hunger &lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Mechanics\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as producing a brief status effect.\nUsing different flowers results in different effects.

There are two blocks of this type in the main versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\": &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother fluid, , also existed .\nThere are other in-game substances which show fluid properties but cannot be placed as fluid blocks, mainly &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, dyed water, &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt;.\nProperties.\nFluids can be placed like solid blocks, but cannot be picked up without a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"bottle\"&gt;bottle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen placed in open terrain, fluid blocks are a source for a flow, unless they are confined by other blocks. A completely confined fluid renders as still.\nSource blocks that are at least partly liberated &lt;a href=\"%23Spread\"&gt;begin to flow&lt;/a&gt;, spreading according to the flowing rules, and render as flowing, with animated lines demonstrating their direction of flow.\nA source block appears as being \"full\" nearly to the top of its containing blocks (if any) while flowing fluid blocks appear to be \"emptier\" the further they are from their source.\nFluids can interact &lt;a href=\"%23Mixing\"&gt;with each other&lt;/a&gt;, and with other &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s they are placed next to or flow over or past, according to the properties of the affected block.\nFlowing fluids exert pressure on &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; pushing them in the direction of the flow. Item &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s that fall into a flowing fluid are carried along until they get caught in an eddy or the flow reaches its maximum extent. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s that are able to float in fluids do not drown, but cannot swim upstream. The minority of mobs that swim (such as &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;) can also swim upstream.\nFluid blocks are non-solids in the same way that &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; is, so placing a solid into a fluid block, source or flowing, succeeds if placement detects the side of a solid block through the fluid.\nWater source blocks placed such that they create a &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; non-solid block behave as any source block would, with the exceptions noted in the following sections.\nWater cannot be placed in the Nether, in both &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; mode and &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; mode. The only way to get water into the Nether is by using the or &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen two fluid sources are directly adjacent to an air block (or a waterloggable block for water), the block is filled with the corresponding fluid. This only happens if the corresponding &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to codice_1 (codice_2 for water, set to codice_1 by default; codice_4 for lava, set to codice_5 by default).\nMechanics.\nDepth.\nFluid blocks have a depth value that measures how \"empty\" it is. A source block is \"full\" with a depth value of 0. Flowing fluids have a depth value equal to their source's depth + 1, with a maximum possible \"emptiness\" value where the flow stops. Thus, a flowing block next to a source has depth value 1, the next further away 2, and so on until the flow stops. If the flow travels down in elevation, the depth resets to 0 at the new elevation.\nThe maximum emptiness depth for water is 7. Lava in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; has a maximum depth of 3, but in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; its maximum depth value is 7. The maximum distance a fluid can flow from its original source block is a &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt; corresponding to the maximum depth of that fluid.\nThe rendering of fluids is controlled by their depth values both in the height of fluid level and the direction of flow displayed.\nSpread.\nOnce a source block is placed, the fluid spreading procedure begins. It does not matter if the source placed makes a waterlogged block or is placed into a block of air; both work the same way.\nThis block is the first of a list of blocks involved in the spreading procedure.\nThe fluid spreading procedure also begins when a fluid block that has stopped flowing receives a block update.\nFirst, each open side of a fluid block starts a flow. A water block in a flat plain spreads out in all four directions until it reaches the depth limit, forming a diamond shape spanning fifteen blocks point-to-point. A water source floating in midair flows out to each of its four sides and then down. Each flowing block created is added to a list of blocks to be considered for further spreading.\nNow the blocks directly below each source or flowing blocks on the \"spreading list\" are checked:\nFlowing fluid has a speed value that governs how fast the spreading effect takes place. Water in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; moves at 1 block every 5 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s, or 4 blocks per second. Lava in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; moves at 1 block every 10 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s, or 2 blocks per second. However, lava in the Overworld is much slower, and moves at only 1 block every 30 game ticks, or 2 blocks every 3 seconds.\nFlow direction.\nThe shape of the ground around a flow is considered when evaluating its spread, giving preference to the creation of water or lava falls, for aesthetic purposes. During the evaluation of horizontal spread, the 5-block area around source and flowing blocks is checked for air one block below the fluid block. These air blocks, and the blocks preceding them, are all converted to fluid blocks with depth level of 1 greater than the current block to establish a simple flow, but are not added to the collection for later consideration.\nFor example, the flow of water from a single source placed within 5 blocks of an edge is only one block wide to the edge, and then falls as a one block wide stream, as demonstrated in the image to the right. Otherwise it would spread evenly first, and then start descending if possible.\nDirectional flow.\nWater normally spreads equally in all directions from a waterlogged block, as seen to the right.\nIn the same test setup the water flow from a stair or banner is one-directional.\nDripping.\nIf &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; are fully enabled in the &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; menu, solid blocks that have air below and fluid above &lt;a href=\"particles%23dripWater\"&gt;drip&lt;/a&gt;, as a visual indication that only one layer of blocks separates the player from the fluid above. Dripping &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; does not cause damage or start fires. It can take several seconds before dripping starts.\nBlock updates.\nThese actions cause a fluid block to update:\n&lt;a href=\"Generated%20structures\"&gt;Generated structures&lt;/a&gt; never cause block updates to adjacent fluids when they generate. For example, a cave entrance that is created partly below water level at the edge of a body of water or lava does not cause the fluid to flow until it receives a block update. On the other hand, fluids created as \"part\" of a structure flow immediately if not completely confined; this includes holes in the bottom of an ocean that open into a &lt;a href=\"Cavern%23Ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt; below.\nMixing.\nWhen the two fluids interact, the results vary depending on the position of the fluid source."}

While traditionally referring to &lt;a href=\"render%20distance\"&gt;render distance&lt;/a&gt;, there are many other types of fog that can be encountered in-game under specific circumstances.\n\"Java Edition\".\nFog types.\nThere are four fog types four different circumstances.\nDistance fog.\nThis refers to fog which is rendered in normal circumstances, and becomes the most notable with low render distance.\nThe sight distance in the distance fog is equal to the render distance, and the shape is a cylinder. Its color depends mainly on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; the camera is in, and is affected by:\nWater fog.\nWhen the camera is in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated fog in the shape of a cylinder is applied to simulate this. Underwater fog progressively recedes with time spent underwater. The color is depends on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; the camera is in. The color of the water fog changes gradually for 5 seconds when the camera travelled in water into another biome. Notably, &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20swamp\"&gt;mangrove swamp&lt;/a&gt;s have a thicker fog than most other biomes, which is controlled by the biome &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt; codice_1.\nLava fog.\nWhen the camera is in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, an even thicker fog in the shape of a sphere is applied. Its color is RGB(0.6,0.1,0.0). With this fog, normally the player can see only 1 block away. The &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect can mitigate the fog so that the sight distance becomes 3 blocks. In &lt;a href=\"spectator\"&gt;spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, the fog becomes more thinner so that things within half of the render distance are visible.\nPowder snow fog.\nBeing beneath &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt; imparts another fog in the shape of a sphere. Its color is RGB(0.623, 0.734, 0.785). With this fog, normally the player can see only 2 blocks away. In &lt;a href=\"spectator\"&gt;spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, the fog becomes more thinner so that things within half of the render distance are visible.\nFog modifiers.\nHeight.\nIf the world is not a &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; world, and the camera is not in lava and not in powder snow, the brightness becomes codice_2 of the original, which means that the color changes to pure black gradually from codice_3 to codice_4.\nBlindness and darkness.\n&lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"darkness\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt; set the color to pure black. The sight distance with blindness is 5 blocks, while the sight distance with darkness is 15 blocks. And the shape of the fog becomes a sphere.\nA difference between the two is that darkness has fade-in and fade-out, while blinding has only fade-out.\nBlindness has a higher priority than darkness. The two effects do not work if the camera is in lava or powder snow.\nWither.\nIf there is a &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; boss event, the color becomes darker and slightly redder.\nNight vision.\nIf the camera is not in water, and the entity has no &lt;a href=\"darkness\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt; effect, &lt;a href=\"night%20vision\"&gt;night vision&lt;/a&gt; makes the color brighter.\nNether and ender dragon.\nIf the entity has no blindness or darkness, in a dimension with the nether &lt;a href=\"Effect%20%28dimension%29\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;, or a dimension where there's an ender dragon boss event\uff0cthe sight distance in the distance fog (not water, lava, powder snow fog) is half of the rendering distance, and the maximum sight distance is 96 blocks. The shape becomes a sphere.\nRemoved.\nVoid fog.\nIn prior versions of \"Java Edition\" (specifically Beta 1.8 Pre-release through 14w34b inclusive, up to its removal in 14w34c), a thick black fog was introduced. As the player descended below Y=26, this fog would start to appear. As the player traveled deeper, the fog at the edge of the render distance would become closer until the player reached the first layers of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, where visibility was reduced to just a few blocks, beyond which was complete darkness. The gray void particles started appearing below Y=8, as well as in the void.\nThe existence of this fog depended on a lack of sky lighting. If vent holes were opened up to allow sky light to enter an otherwise secluded underground space, void fog would no longer be present so long as the player kept near this sky light source.\nVoid fog was removed late into 1.8's development for performance reasons and general community distaste.\n\"Bedrock Edition\".\n, fogs has six types used in six different circumstances:\nIn a fog setting file in a resource pack, one or more of above types can be specified. Active fog settings are determined from three aspects:\nWhenever the game needs to get the current fog, it checks the fog settings from these three aspects from the top (the newest fog setting in the fog stack from the command) to the bottom (default fog setting) in order, until it finds a fog definition for the current fog type. If it finds no matching setting, the game uses the hardcoded defaults of the engine.\nIn other words, this is equivalent to that all fog settings from the three aspects are applied one by one from the bottom (default fog setting) to the top (the newest fog setting in the fog stack from the command) in order. The fogs defined in the later fog setting overrides the earlier's. Each fog type works independently. Hardcoded default setting of the engine is applied before settings from these three aspects.\nSee also &lt;a href=\"https%3A//learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/fogsreference/examples/fogsintroduction\"&gt;this official document&lt;/a&gt;.\nVanilla fog settings.\nHere are all the fog setting IDs that are currently in the vanilla game.

They are essential to survival, as going without them eventually causes the player to starve, causing damage until reaching in Easy &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, and on Normal. &lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Effects%20of%20hunger\"&gt;Starvation&lt;/a&gt; damage kills the player in Hard and &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; Mode.\nFood is eaten by holding while having the food item selected in the hot bar or in the off-hand.\n&lt;a href=\"Cake\"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt; cannot be eaten this way, and must instead be placed on a surface before being eaten.\nWith the exception of &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Golden%20Apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apples&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;, food cannot be eaten when the hunger bar is completely full. In &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; Mode, any food can be consumed at any time.\nAll food items and ingredients can be stacked in the inventory slots, except for &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit%20stew\"&gt;rabbit stew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot%20soup\"&gt;beetroot soup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis page covers food items for players; blocks and items that can be eaten by other &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s are not included here.\nHunger and saturation.\n&lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s have two different food statistics, one of which is visible: The hunger level is visible, and the saturation level is not.\n&lt;a href=\"Saturation\"&gt;Saturation&lt;/a&gt; is the first statistic to decrease when a player performs energy-intensive actions, and it must be completely depleted before the visible hunger meter begins decreasing. Although the current saturation level is generally hidden, the player can tell that their saturation level is completely depleted if the visible hunger meter begins displaying a jittering effect.\nEating a food item replenishes a fixed number of hunger points and saturation points, based on the item. Some foods have a better ratio of saturation to hunger points replenished than others. Overeating the hunger bar does not overflow to saturation.\nA player's current saturation level can never exceed their current hunger level. A player at a hunger level of 5, for example, can be at a maximum of 5 saturation. Food always restores hunger (raising the saturation limit) \"before\" supplying saturation. The most efficient use of food is to eat low-saturation food to fill the hunger bar, followed by high-saturation food to fill saturation. While a few hunger points may be wasted when eating nourishing food when nearly full, eating nourishing foods on a low hunger bar wastes even more points of saturation. Maximizing saturation increases the length of time (and/or the amount of damage healed) before the player needs to eat again.\nUsage.\nMost foods can be eaten by holding down the right-click button with a food item in hand. It takes 1.61 seconds to eat most foods; dried kelp takes 0.865 seconds to eat. Additionally, a player can hold food in their &lt;a href=\"offhand\"&gt;offhand&lt;/a&gt; .\nWhile eating, food &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; form from the player's mouth correlated with their respective food item, and produces a munching noise. Eating also slows the user significantly.\nUnlike other foods, &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; has to be eaten by placing it, then right-clicking on its block form. Eating cake is instant and it has 7 edible slices, each giving hunger and 0.4 hunger &lt;a href=\"saturation\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;.\nNourishment value.\nNourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored. Foods with higher nourishment values should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full.\nThe \"nourishment\" table below can help by categorizing foods by their saturation-to-hunger restoration ratios. See the more detailed &lt;a href=\"%23Foods\"&gt;Foods&lt;/a&gt; table for the exact hunger and saturation statistics of each food.\nFoods.\nIngredients.\nThe following items cannot be eaten on their own. Instead, they are used to craft consumable food items."}

The forest holds some useful resources for players. There is an abundance of trees that can be harvested for wood. However, this also makes the biome dangerous, as they lower a player's visibility, making it more difficult to spot hostile mobs. There a total of two variants in the biome family, the regular forest and the flower forest.\nDescription.\nForests feature dense &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s compared to other biomes. &lt;a href=\"Lily%20of%20the%20valley\"&gt;Lily of the valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rose%20bush\"&gt;rose bush&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"peonies\"&gt;peonies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lilacs\"&gt;lilacs&lt;/a&gt; generate in this biome family along with the usual &lt;a href=\"poppies\"&gt;poppies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;Grass&lt;/a&gt; takes on a dark but vibrant green color. Bees from bee nests on trees are found as well. \nLike almost every other overword biome in the game, &lt;a href=\"lava%20lake\"&gt;lava lake&lt;/a&gt;s can generate here, which can cause locally destructive forest &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;s, due to the density of flammable &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;; the same goes for &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes that hit the &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s during &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s, though the &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;s caused by the strikes are usually quickly put out by the &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;.\nVariants.\nThere are two forest biome variants (forest and flower forest), with one removed variant (wooded hills) in previous versions. Not included are &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt;s, as they are considered separate biomes.\nForest.\nThe forest biome is common and densely wooded with &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt; trees. &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; spawn here.\nForest is one of the most preferred &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s to start a survival world, serving abundant amounts of wood, grass and flowers, water and passive mobs, and they do not have many dangers aside from the usual hostile mobs. Tamed wolves can help fight against hostile mobs, making them especially useful when players lack resources for armor. The density of the trees, however, can obstruct vision and get a player lost quickly; random surface-level &lt;a href=\"lava%20lake\"&gt;lava lake&lt;/a&gt;s are possible, albeit rare, and start forest fires when close to trees. Building &lt;a href=\"shelter\"&gt;shelter&lt;/a&gt; here might be frustrating, due to having to clean up the zone before.\nThe following &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nFlower forest.\n The flower forest variant has fewer trees and grass than the regular forest but boasts large quantities of &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s across its landscape. The probability of generating a beehive on each tree is ten times higher than in a regular forest. All types of flowers except for sunflowers, blue orchids, torchflower and wither roses generate in the flower forest. The vast number of flowers makes this biome variant an excellent source of &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlower forests are rarer than standard forest biome and are most commonly bordered by &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; biomes or separted from &lt;a href=\"sunflower%20plains\"&gt;sunflower plains&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUnlike regular forests, wolves do not spawn in flower forests. However, they can occasionally spawn &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, which do not spawn in regular forests. &lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;s also spawn in this biome more commonly. The following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSoundtrack.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the forest.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the flower forest.\nHistory.\nIn versions before alpha 1.2.0, forested areas existed within various landforms which were randomly generated across the world, as true biomes did not exist yet. Trees are generated in abundance within \"woods\" and \"Woods Mountain\" terrain, and more sparsely in \"Original\" and \"Original Mountain\" terrain. Along with &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, it was one of the first biomes in the game."}

A \u00a7 symbol followed by a hex digit in the message tells the client to switch colors while displaying text. , the \u00a7 symbol can be used in any text input, while , it may be used in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;, &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"pack.mcmeta\"&gt;pack.mcmeta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;, &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; files, world titles, and server names.\n, if a color code is used after a formatting code, the formatting code is disabled beyond the color code point. For example, codice_2 displays as XY, whereas codice_3 displays as XY. Therefore, when using a color code in tandem with a formatting code, ensure the color code is used first and reuse the formatting code when changing colors. Also, you could put; e.g. \"\u00a7#04280D NVBIS\", in a anvil to rename an item it will be non-italic.\n, formatting codes persist after a color code. Furthermore, if an obfuscated code is used and a reset code is not used before the end of the line, the client GUI continues to obfuscate text past the MOTD and into the version number display.\nColor codes.\nMessages sent from the server to the client can contain color codes, which allow the coloring of text for various purposes.\nFormatting codes.\nThe random characters placed after codice_4 are always the same width as the original characters. For example, any random character cycled through where the letter \"m\" would be wide characters while any random character in the spot of an \"i\" would be narrow characters.\ncodice_5 resets the styles of following characters; e.g., codice_6 displays as XXXYYY.\nTyping.\nWhen part of &lt;a href=\"JSON%20text\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; text, the symbol can be written as or .\nAlternatively , the character can be copied from this page (codice_1) and pasted into virtually any text field by pressing (Windows) or (macOS). If pasting does not work it may be necessary to use the JSON format or another method.\nWhile in chat in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, usage of this character disconnects the user, even in 'offline' single player mode, and thus cannot be used directly in commands such as codice_9.\nIn early &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic\"&gt;Java Edition Classic&lt;/a&gt; versions, the character used was instead of .\nSample text.\nThe following text can be pasted into a &lt;a href=\"book%20and%20quill\"&gt;book and quill&lt;/a&gt; (prior to 1.14) to produce what is shown in the picture:\nUse in &lt;samp&gt;server.properties&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;pack.mcmeta&lt;/samp&gt;.\nIn order to get an MOTD colored or formatted, codice_10 must be used instead of codice_1; for example, codice_12 would be codice_13. The full list of them is listed below.\nColors can be used in conjunction with formatting. The formatting must be done after the color.\nGiven that codice_14 files accept &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Raw%20JSON%20text\"&gt;raw JSON text&lt;/a&gt; as descriptions, the usage of codice_1 can be replaced by text components with different color and style, though using codice_1 still works.\nCompatibility with older versions.\nFormatting codes can be used in the codice_17 line in a file, but the section signs must be escaped as codice_10. If a section sign is entered directly, the server replaces it with codice_19 (); clients display the codice_20 character as a question mark. Delete the codice_20 character in the MOTD if it comes with a bunch of question marks: this happens if something is not compatible.\nUse in custom language packs.\nFormatting codes can be used to color names and description in language files by using &lt;samp&gt;\u00a7&lt;/samp&gt; then any of the numbers/letters displayed above. This is also used in &lt;samp&gt;end.txt&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;credits.txt&lt;/samp&gt;. An example of this is codice_22 to make the name of a diamond appear as Diamond.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16&lt;/a&gt;, codice_5 can no longer be used to remove italics from custom translation tags within language files. For example, if the translation tag codice_24 is applied to the codice_25 display data of a custom item (codice_26), it still appears as codice_27 rather than simply codice_28. This is not true of any other formatting options.\nUse in world names.\nWith the use of external tools, such as &lt;a href=\"Programs%20and%20editors/NBTExplorer\"&gt;NBTExplorer&lt;/a&gt;, world names can have custom colors and formatting codes. To modify the name, choose the &lt;samp&gt;LevelName&lt;/samp&gt; tag in the world's &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;. In this example, &lt;samp&gt;LevelName&lt;/samp&gt; is set to codice_29.\nAdditionally, the player can rename the world's folder to contain one of the codes. In the world selection menu, the specified color or effect appears.\nThe player can also use a resource pack with a &lt;samp&gt;\u00a7&lt;/samp&gt; already in the world name when creating a world and all the user has to do is to change or alter the color code after the &lt;samp&gt;\u00a7&lt;/samp&gt;.\n, the player is allowed to use a &lt;samp&gt;\u00a7&lt;/samp&gt; inside of the world name when creating the world. This allows for using custom colors and formatting codes inside of the world name without having to modify the game.\nUse in server names.\nWith the use of a third party tool such as NBTExplorer, server names can have custom colors. To utilize this functionality, select the attribute in the file inside the directory using a third party tool. In the following example, the tag is set to\ncodice_30:\nHistory.\nObfuscated format codice_31 has changed 3 times after being introduced in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;. On the right is an image of how the obfuscated text of codice_32 looks in 4 different versions. At first glance, they might look similar, but in reality, there are some differences. One major difference is that as font textures get updated with new characters and symbols, the obfuscated character cycles through more characters. That change can be clearly seen when any character gets obfuscated in versions 1.6.4-1.12.2. However, when 1.13 came out, if the obfuscated format was used on any character, it looped only through the character set. Nevertheless, an obfuscated character can still add a character to its loop. If a character that matches its dimensions was written into the chat by a player, it is inserted to the loop automatically. As for 1.13+, the whole system got reworked. All characters cycle through all characters that can be written in the game no matter what kind of character is getting obfuscated. The difference is that the condition that identifies similar characters, became more diverse in its identification, which made it include several unicode font characters. This can be spotted in one pixel width characters codice_33, which are the most used characters by players, as they display a unique effect when used with obfuscation rather than it being what it's for, \"Obfuscation\". Followed by codice_34 in older versions."}

In short, when an ore is mined, the chance for no bonus drops is formula_1 and if a bonus is applied, there is an equal chance for any number of drops between 2 and formula_2\nThe formula to calculate the average drops multiplier is formula_3, which means Fortune II gives 1.75x (1) drops on average, Fortune III gives 2.2x (2) drops on average, etc.\nWith admin commands it is possible to get higher fortune levels.

Fortune increases the maximum number of drops by 1 per level. However, maximum drop limitations may apply: glowstone has a capacity of 4 glowstone dust, sea lanterns have a capacity of 5 prismarine crystals, and melons have a capacity of 9 melon slices. If a drop higher than these maximums is rolled, it is rounded down to the capacity.\nGrass, ferns and large flowers.\n&lt;a href=\"Grass\"&gt;Grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s have a fixed chance, unaffected by Fortune, to drop wheat seeds.

Fortune increases the number of tests for the distribution, and thus the maximum number of drops, by 1 per level.\nThe binomial distribution in the default case is created by rolling three times (n=3) with a drop probability of 57% (p=.57), creating the typical drop of 1-4 seeds. Carrots and potatoes include one more fixed drop, as their seed and item are the same.\nTabulated probabilities.\nFortune increases the probability of &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; dropping from &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s dropping from &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s dropping from oak and dark oak leaves and &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s dropping from &lt;a href=\"gilded%20blackstone\"&gt;gilded blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"twisting%20vines\"&gt;twisting vines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weeping%20vines\"&gt;weeping vines&lt;/a&gt; dropping from themselves.\nIncompatibilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; and Fortune are mutually exclusive.

Each chunk has two attempts within y-coordinates 0 to 320 or -63 to -8 underground to generate a fossil, each with a chance of . They have an equal chance to generate as any of the four variants of skull or four variants of spine.\nFossils first generate the pure-bone layer with a &lt;a href=\"structure%20integrity\"&gt;structure integrity&lt;/a&gt; of 0.9, meaning 10% of the &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;s are removed and will not override original terrian blocks, leaving 90% &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;s. Next, the ore layer generates with a structure integrity of 0.1, replacing 10% of the existing fossil with coal ore for fossils that generate above Y level 0, or &lt;a href=\"deepslate%20diamond%20ore\"&gt;deepslate diamond ore&lt;/a&gt; for fossils that generate below Y level -8. The locations of these ore blocks do not always correspond with the voids generated in the initial bone fossil, so the resulting combination of both generations will usually result in an incomplete fossil structure composed of bone blocks and ores.\nBecause fossils are features instead of &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;s, they generate even when the \"Generate Structures\" option is turned off.\nStructure.\nNaturally-generated fossils are composed of a mix of bone blocks and coal or diamond ores, as detailed above.

They are able to carry a single &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; in their mouth, but prefer &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; over other items.\nSpawning.\nFoxes spawn in groups of two to four in taiga, old growth taiga, snowy taiga and grove &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. 5% of them spawn as baby foxes.\nThey can spawn on grass, coarse dirt, podzol, snow blocks, or top snow.\nFoxes that spawned in a snowy biome are white.\nHolding items.\nFoxes have a 20% chance to spawn (via spawn egg or naturally) with one of the following items in their mouth:\nDrops.\nAn adult fox drops / &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Upon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, are dropped. Killing a baby fox yields no experience. \nFoxes always drop any item they pick up and are still holding (they cannot drop food that they have eaten, for example) and drop items they spawn with naturally with a 100% chance, so:\nIf a fox is killed while holding a , then the fox consumes the totem and revives itself instead of dropping the totem.\nBehavior.\nFoxes occasionally make loud screeches during nighttime, unless a trusted player is near them. Baby foxes follow adult foxes.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle%23Night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt;, foxes sometimes go to &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s. Snow foxes go to snow villages and red foxes go to any other type of village, preferably taiga villages since foxes spawn in the taiga biome.\nFoxes flee from nearby wolves, &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s or players unless the player approaches them while &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;. They take no damage or speed reduction while moving through &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt;es.\nFoxes attack &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;, and baby &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s while they are on land. Foxes don't attack &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; even if they are being attacked by them.\nFoxes attack either by running against or by pouncing. Like &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s, foxes can pounce more than one block high without status effects or player input. A fox prepares to pounce by tilting and lowering its head and lowering its body to become shorter. Then it leaps two blocks into the &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, jumping over &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;s if needed. If the target mob moves from its location during this sequence, the pounce misses the target. , foxes also shake side to side before pouncing and their legs wave while in midair.\nWhile foxes are capable of jumping over fences and walls, they cannot see through them. A fox will not try to attack a mob on the same y-level if there is a fence between them.\nRed foxes prefer to attack chickens, rabbits and baby turtles, all of which are on land, over cod, salmon, and tropical fish; conversely, snow foxes prefer to attack cod, salmon and tropical fish over land-dwelling creatures. \nA fox that pounces into a &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt; becomes momentarily stuck, remaining face-down, emitting &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; while shaking, and returning to normal shortly after.\nFoxes swim to attack fish in water for food. Baby foxes following adults into the water cannot swim and may eventually drown.\nFoxes attempt to run toward the closest attackable &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, even if attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, but do not attempt to break the lead. A fox wakes up from sleeping to attack a mob.\nWild wolves are aggressive toward foxes when within 18/16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s. , adult &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s also sneak toward foxes to attack them; adult polar bears attack foxes within 16 blocks. , baby polar bears, though normally passive to players, also attempt to attack foxes within 16 blocks or when their adult polar bear attacks one.\nSleeping.\nFoxes are one of the few mobs in the game that can sleep, along with &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle%23Daytime\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;, if a &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt; is not occurring, foxes attempt to find a space with a sky &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of 14 or less and sleep. Block light has no effect on this. While it sleeps, it slowly moves its head up and down. A fox wakes if approached by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;. Foxes do not flee if the player approaches while &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; until the player gets on an adjacent &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the sky &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; at the fox's position becomes 15 or above, either due to a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; above being destroyed or the fox being moved, the fox wakes up.\nFoxes can drop and pick up &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s in their sleep.\nTrusting foxes can fall asleep even if attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be moved with leads while sleeping.\nFoxes do not sleep if they are within 12 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s of an &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;.\nSitting.\nA fox sits down sometimes during the day if the fox cannot find a shaded area to sleep. The fox sits for a short time, then hops back up. Foxes sit down even when attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; or in a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. Foxes that have not been bred by the player always sit while in the Nether, even while attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nHolding items.\nIf any &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; is on the ground near a fox, it travels to the item and picks it up, and the item appears in the fox's mouth.\nHowever, usually a fox chooses to attack a mob over picking up an item. This behavior is not limited to &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and animal products; a fox can pick up any item that the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can pick up. However, they prefer to pick up food items, and if they have already picked up non-food items, they drop the non-food items to pick up food instead. A fox can also swap a food item it is holding for a different food item. \nA fox eats any food item it picks up (besides cake) after 30 seconds and the fox is affected by any side effects from the food, such as poison or teleportation. For example, if a fox eats an &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt;, it obtains the &lt;a href=\"absorption\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt; and effects of the enchanted apple. If a fox eats any type of soup or stew, an empty &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; is dropped. If a fox is holding a &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;, it eats the fruit and teleports accordingly.\nIf there is a stage 3 or 4 &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt; within a 16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; radius of a fox, it sprints toward the bush and eats the &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berries\"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; it was holding. It is the only mob not damaged by the sweet berry bush. \nIf a fox picks up a &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; or an item with &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, such as Looting and Fire Aspect, these items affect the fox's attack as if the fox is wielding the weapon in its &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Dual%20wielding\"&gt;main hand&lt;/a&gt;, although the item retains its &lt;a href=\"Item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; when used by the fox. If a fox is holding a &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt;, it receives the effects after taking fatal damage. , if a fox wields a sword with the Fire Aspect enchantment while attacking a mob on a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; or a soul campfire, it ignites the campfire and does critical &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to the entity.\nFoxes do not pick up items when codice_1 is set to codice_2.\nBreeding.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berries\"&gt;sweet berries&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glow%20berries\"&gt;glow berries&lt;/a&gt; are on two foxes, the foxes &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt;, producing a baby fox. If a red fox is bred with an snow fox, the baby has a 50% chance of being either red or snow.\nTaming.\n&lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;Breeding&lt;/a&gt; two adults with &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berries\"&gt;sweet berries&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glow%20berries\"&gt;glow berries&lt;/a&gt; produces a kit that trusts the player. The baby fox trusts the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; that bred it and does not flee from that player as it grows up; however, because baby foxes also follow nearby adult foxes, an adult running away from the player may cause the baby to do the same. \nNaturally spawned kits do not trust players. Foxes attack specific &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that hurt a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; they trust.\nA &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; can be useful during this time to keep the baby fox from fleeing until it has finished maturing to an adult itself, or the player can simply kill the adult foxes with a ranged weapon.\nA fox that trusts the player flees from &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s unless the wolf or polar bear attacks the player, in which case the fox attacks in defense of the player.\nWhen attacking phantoms, foxes do not jump to attack.\nA trusting fox does not attack a tamed wolf unless the fox doesn't trust the player who tamed the wolf.\nFoxes that trust the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; attack &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s, when those mobs attack the player. They do not attack any mob the player attacks, unlike tamed wolves. They also do not attack &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s despite the fact that they are a zombie variant. \nTamed foxes retreat from polar bears and wolves but not tamed wolves. A tamed wolf whose owner attacks a tamed fox also attacks the fox.\nSounds.\nFoxes use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nFoxes have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

Frogs eat small &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s. A frog can produce one of three kinds of &lt;a href=\"froglight\"&gt;froglight&lt;/a&gt;s from eating &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on the type of frog. \nSpawning.\nGroups of two to five frogs can spawn in &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; and mangrove swamp biomes. Frogs can also be spawned by growing from &lt;a href=\"tadpole\"&gt;tadpole&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere are three frog variants, determined by the biome in which the tadpole grew up:\nDrops.\nFrogs drop when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, while is dropped upon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nOn land, frogs will slowly wander, jumping at random. They can jump 8 blocks high and take less damage from falling than most other mobs. They prefer jumping on &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Dripleaf\"&gt;big dripleaves&lt;/a&gt;, and will usually jump to blocks that are higher up. \nIn water, frogs move much faster. They will generally swim upwards and remain at the water's surface, but will swim downwards if lured by a player. Frogs cannot be hurt by &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccasionally, they may croak and inflate their vocal sac.\nBreeding.\nFrogs will follow any player holding a &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt; within 6 blocks of them. \nFeeding two frogs a slimeball causes them to enter &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;love mode&lt;/a&gt;, causing one of the frogs to become pregnant, similar to &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s. The pregnant frog then searches for a water block with at least one adjacent water block (flowing or source) with air above to lay &lt;a href=\"frogspawn\"&gt;frogspawn&lt;/a&gt;. This spawn later hatches into &lt;a href=\"tadpole\"&gt;tadpole&lt;/a&gt;s, which subsequently grow into frogs.\nUnlike all other mobs with baby variants, the tadpole is treated by the game as a completely different mob from the frog.\nAttacking.\nFrogs attack by using their tongue to pull certain mobs into their mouth, whereupon the mob instantly despawns without a death animation.\nFrogs attack small &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, which drop &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s when killed.\nFrogs also attack small &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, leaving a &lt;a href=\"froglight\"&gt;froglight&lt;/a&gt; block. When the magma cube gets targeted, the frog will walk towards it at a faster pace before attacking. The color of froglight that drops depends on the type of frog that attacks the magma cube:\nSounds.\nFrogs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nFrogs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

When a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; stops walking on the &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; created by the enchantment, the ice gradually melts from around and under the player (at which point the player falls into the water).

It can be placed with commands in Bedrock Edition.\nBreaking.\nFrosted ice does not have a preferred &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it breaks at the same speed regardless of the tool used to mine it. Breaking it with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; drops nothing, while breaking in any other manner produces water in the same way &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; does.\nPost-genereation.\nFrosted ice is generated by players or mobs walking near water while wearing boots with the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.

The block is created with an age of 0, and is ticked every 1\u20132 seconds. If a chance succeeds or the block has fewer than 4 frosted ice blocks in the 6 blocks surrounding it, and the light level (including light from the sun) at the block would be greater than 11 minus the age, the age is incremented. When the age reaches 4, the block turns into water and all adjacent blocks have their age incremented (but if these blocks melt also, the effect does not continue to cascade). This does mean that in places with low light levels, such as inside caves or at night, it never melts naturally.\nThe melting speed of frosted ice is only semi-affected by the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt;: setting the value to results in frosted ice melting at the same speed as default, while setting it to higher than default \"does\" increase the melting speed.\nWhen a frosted ice block melts or is broken, any adjacent frosted ice block immediately melts if it has fewer than 2 frosted ice blocks remaining in the 6 blocks surrounding it.\n&lt;a href=\"Sugar%20cane\"&gt;Sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; do not break when frosted ice is formed, and frosted ice does not form on water occupied by another entity."}

Being text files, they are easily modifiable and less likely than &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s to induce lag when used in large quantities.\nThis page covers how functions are defined and invoked in \"Java Edition\".\nDefinition.\nA function is a text file with the file extension codice_1. The recommended encoding for function files is ANSI or UTF-8, without BOM.\nAs with all other data pack files, the codice_2 folder may also contain subfolders to further organize the function files within a namespace. These subfolders must be referenced when invoking the function.\nWithin the codice_1 file, one valid command is placed per line, without the usual forward slash (codice_4). Players can add comments within the function text file by beginning a line with codice_5. Multiple spaces between command arguments are not allowed but a line can have tabs and spaces before and after the command.\nAllowed commands.\nIndividual commands in functions can be longer than the 32,500 character limit in command blocks but the total number of commands run inside a function still obey , which is 65,536 commands by default; any commands beyond this limit are ignored.\nIn a singleplayer or a LAN world, like a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;, a function can run any command that is no more restrictive than permission level 2.\nOn the default multiplayer software, a function can run any command that is no more restrictive than the permission level prescribed in &lt;a href=\"Server.properties%23function-permission-level\"&gt;codice_6&lt;/a&gt; setting in codice_7.\nInvocation.\nFunctions can be invoked in several different manners from other data pack files.\nInvocation from commands.\nFunctions can be invoked using the command.\nA single function can be invoked by specifying its resource location.\nUnlike other data pack files, functions are supported by &lt;a href=\"tags\"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to be grouped together. codice_8 also accepts a function tag's resource location, invoking all listed functions.\nInvocation from advancements.\n&lt;a href=\"Advancements\"&gt;Advancements&lt;/a&gt; can run a function once as a reward for completing them. The commands in the function are run through the player who completed the advancement.\nReward functions are called within advancement &lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; files using the following format:\n \"rewards\": {\n \"function\": \"namespace:subfolder/function\"\nInvocation from function tags.\nFunctions can be grouped together using &lt;a href=\"Tag\"&gt;function tags&lt;/a&gt;. Functions in a tag get executed in the defined order, but only the first occurrence of the same function if it occurs multiple times.\nIn addition, there are two function tags within the codice_9 namespace that have special behavior:\nNote: The first instance of functions tagged codice_11 run \"before\" codice_10 runs. This means that when reloading or loading, the order of execution is codice_14, codice_15, codice_14, codice_14, codice_14, \u2026\nWhen invoked.\nFunctions run all their commands in a single &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; and other functions called from within also run their commands in the same tick as their parent. Functions use the execution context of whatever called the function. This includes executing entity, as well as execution position, rotation, dimension, and anchor. Contextual parameters are preserved for every command in the function. An command can change the context, but that change does not carry through to any following commands in the same function.\nFor example:\n execute as @p at @s run function foo:bar\n # function foo:bar\n teleport @s ~ ~5 ~\n setblock ~ ~-1 ~ emerald_block\n execute at @s run setblock ~ ~-1 ~ diamond_block\nWhen invoked, this function teleports the nearest player 5 blocks up, place an &lt;a href=\"emerald%20block\"&gt;emerald block&lt;/a&gt; one block below their original position \"before\" the teleport, and place a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20block\"&gt;diamond block&lt;/a&gt; one block below their new position \"after\" the teleport.\nAs seen in the above example, contextual parameters can be changed as usual by their respective sub-commands."}

Furnaces also generate in some houses in &lt;a href=\"snowy%20tundra\"&gt;snowy tundra&lt;/a&gt; villages, and in one of the &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt; village houses. They also appear in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trail%20ruins\"&gt;trail ruins&lt;/a&gt;, and one furnace generates in every &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nA furnace can be mined using any pickaxe. A furnace will also drop all of its contents when broken, including XP from smelting items that were extracted by hoppers.\n, a furnace mined without a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; drops nothing. , a furnace drops itself when mined by hand or with any tool.\nCrafting.\nThe lit furnace can be obtained only with commands such as }}, although it does not appear lit in the inventory. , the lit furnace block can be obtained only by inventory editing. It always stays lit, despite containing no items.\nUsage.\nFurnaces cannot be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s .\nSmelting.\nThe main purpose of a furnace is &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;. Its interface can be opened by pressing the button on it. A fuel source (up to one stack of fuel items) is placed in the lower slot, and the items (up to one stack) to be smelted are placed in the upper slot. A furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every or six items per minute.\nThe number of items that a fuel source can smelt depends on the type of fuel. As soon as smelting begins, the fuel slot is decremented immediately and that unit of fuel begins burning. The fuel continues burning until it is consumed, regardless of whether the upper slot has any items remaining to smelt. For example, a piece of coal burns for 80 seconds and can smelt eight items, but if only one item is smelted (or if the item is pulled out before smelting is complete), the coal still continues burning for the full 80 seconds, wasting seven items worth of smelting. After it burns out, no additional fuel is decremented from the fuel slot if the upper slot is empty. If the fuel slot is empty and the burning fuel is consumed before an item completes smelting, the smelting stops, the smelted item is unchanged, and smelting must be restarted with new fuel.\nLight source.\nFurnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, as well as smoke and flame &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt;.\nCustom name.\nBy default, the GUI of a furnace is labeled \"Furnace\", but this name can be customized by naming it in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; before placing it, or by changing the codice_1 tag using the command.\nLock.\n, a furnace can be \"locked\" by setting its codice_2 tag using the command. If a furnace's codice_2 tag is not blank, the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the codice_2 tag's text. For example, to lock a furnace at (0,64,0) so that the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Furnace Key\", use .\nNote Blocks.\nFurnace can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA furnace has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block."}

In practice, there are most commonly considered to be four:\n&lt;a href=\"Demo%20Mode\"&gt;Demo Mode&lt;/a&gt;, which may also be counted as a game mode, is Survival with the codice_1 attribute, which defines if the game is from a trial version or not.\nTrue game modes.\nThe following game modes are controlled by the \"gameType\" variable, and all/some are accessible in-game via the command as well as the game mode switcher.\nSurvival.\nIn this mode, players have to gather all their materials to build, &lt;a href=\"craft\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; and gain &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; points. There is a &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; bar, an &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, and also a &lt;a href=\"Health%23Drowning\"&gt;oxygen bar&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;underwater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocating&lt;/a&gt;, or in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. If a player runs out of hearts (health), the player dies and returns to the &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; point. Upon death, the player emits smoke, loses all experience and items, and a &lt;a href=\"Death%20messages\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt;. Maximum reach is 5 blocks.\nCreative.\nThe player has access to an infinite amount of almost all &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s available, and can destroy them instantly. Players are invulnerable, unless they fall into the void, and do not have health, armor, or hunger, and can &lt;a href=\"fly\"&gt;fly&lt;/a&gt;. The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, e.g. &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s. The player cannot see command blocks if they look through the Creative GUI - they need to spawn command blocks with the or commands. Max reach is 6 blocks.\nAdventure.\nPlayers can interact with objects such as &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s, and can interact with &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. However, they can break &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; only with &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s having a CanDestroy data tag, and place blocks only if the block they are holding has a data tag, making this mode good for adventure maps. Max reach is 5 blocks.\nSpectator.\nWhen in Spectator mode, players can clip through blocks and fly freely. The player can't interact with blocks, entities or their inventory.\n, the player can enter the perspective of other entities by left-clicking on them, and are invisible to all players and mobs except for other spectators. When in third-person mode, they look like a transparent, floating head with no body. The player can use the scroll wheel to adjust the speed at which they are flying, unlike flying in Creative mode.\n however, the player can access this game mode by typing . The Spectator game mode has slightly different mechanics from the Java version, because the feature is still in development.\nOther game modes.\nDefault.\nThe \"Default\" game mode can be access by typing . The player can set game mode based on what default game mode is set. In a world setting, there's a dropdown to select the default game mode. The player can override the default game mode by setting the game mode to another game mode.\nInvalid game mode.\nAny invalid game mode will be a mix of &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode and &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode. They are only accessible with &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Programs%20and%20editors\"&gt;third-party software&lt;/a&gt; so using the command will not work because the game is preventing the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; from doing it.\nLike in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, the player has the ability to fly, can't take any damage and they're not affected by &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bars are still visible. &lt;a href=\"Tool\"&gt;Tool&lt;/a&gt;s have infinite durability and can't break.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23Creative%20inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; is like the one in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, except it's broken and you will not be able to take blocks nor items from it.\nGame states.\nHardcore.\nIn this mode, which plays in the same way as Survival mode, the difficulty level is permanently set to \"Hard\", and when the player dies, they must either delete the map or permanently switch to &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, effectively preventing them from interacting with the world ever again.\nHardcore is not technically a game mode, but rather a game mode modifier, as it cannot be enabled with the command. However, without cheating, it is possible to get only \"Hardcore Survival\". To obtain \"Hardcore Creative\" mode, the player must edit the game world with external tools, or opening to LAN, and turning on cheats. There is almost no visible difference between \"Hardcore Creative\" and \"Non-Hardcore Creative\". Because of this, \"Hardcore\" usually refers to \"Hardcore Survival\". On a server, a player who dies gets put into &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, while all other players remain in Survival mode. When looking at a Hardcore singleplayer world, the gamemode is \"Hardcore Mode!\" and the color is red.\nDemo Mode.\nDemo Mode functionally serves to allow the &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; to try out the game before deciding to buy \"Minecraft\". It allows players to play on a single world for a 100-minute (5 in-game days) period before the map is locked and required to be reset. The game is locked to &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode and cheats are off by default. While the demo version does not expire, it comes with certain restrictions, by others, as its sole purpose is to allow new players to try out \"Minecraft\".\nDemo Mode is not technically a game mode as it cannot be enabled with the codice_2 command.\nSummary.\nBelow is a brief summary of the different available features in each game mode.\nChanging game mode.\nThe &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; can be used to switch between true game modes. For example, (or , in \"Bedrock Edition\") puts the player into Creative mode. As Hardcore is handled differently, it cannot be set via commands.\n, a player with operator permissions on a server or &lt;a href=\"cheat\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt;s enabled is able to open a GUI by pressing and , which then allows the player to cycle through the four available gamemodes available with by pressing .\n, the gamemode can also be changed by quitting the world, going to Edit World, tapping either Creative or Survival, and then returning to the game if cheats are enabled.\nData values.\nIn the &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; file, Survival mode is codice_3, Creative is codice_4, Adventure is codice_5, and Spectator is codice_6. Hardcore is Survival with the addition of codice_7 (a normal world uses codice_8 instead). This knowledge allows hacking to change game modes by editing the world's level.dat."}

An example of this is the \"Minecraft\" minigame, &lt;a href=\"Spleef\"&gt;Spleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nGame modes.\n\"Minecraft\" has four basic game modes: &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt;.

They are &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Hostile%20mobs\"&gt;hostile mobs&lt;/a&gt; that live in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and shoot explosive &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpawning.\nTo spawn naturally, a ghast requires a solid block below it and a free space 5\u00d75 blocks wide and 4 blocks high. They spawn only in the &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, all three of which exist only in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; dimension, and in any light level. ghasts cannot spawn in soul sand valleys if another ghast is within 16 blocks of spherical distance to the intended spawning location; , two ghasts can spawn within any 4 &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; span.\nGhasts do not spawn in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es, but they can wander nearby.\nDrops.\n. &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; increases the maximum ghast tears dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 4 ghast tears with Looting III.\n. &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; increases the maximum gunpowder dropped by one per level, for a maximum of 5 gunpowder with Looting III.\nBehavior.\nGhasts float around the Nether with their eyes and mouth closed and periodically make crying sounds, which can be heard from up to 80 blocks away. They have a &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt; of 4\u00d74\u00d74 blocks, as well as nine tentacles that are not included in the hitbox.\nWhen within range, a ghast faces the player and shoots a fireball every 3 seconds, opening its eyes and mouth and making a screeching sound. A ghast requires a line of sight to the player before firing, which can be blocked by any solid block including transparent blocks. , they target players within 64 blocks horizontally and 4 blocks vertically, and continue attacking as long as they are within a 64 block sphere and have line of sight. , a ghast normally targets a player within a sphere of 28 blocks, increasing to 64 blocks if the player damages it.\nGhasts can cause other mobs to attack them, but they never target other mobs, only the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most other hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, ghasts do not attempt to approach the player once aggravated, but instead fire at the player from their position within firing range.\nWhen at close range, ghasts may take damage and die from their own fireball &lt;a href=\"Explosion\"&gt;explosions&lt;/a&gt;.\nGhasts can be set on fire, but &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; does not harm them. When a ghast sinks into lava, or crosses a lava fall, its speed drops and it is immobilized for a while, making it more vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; shots.\nDespite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs. This means they can drown, are damaged by &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Instant Damage&lt;/a&gt; and healed by &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt;, are affected by &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, and are not affected by &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough they are not undead mobs, ghasts are never targeted by &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s deliberately.\nDespite that they are flying mobs, ghasts can destroy &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s when on top of them.\nFireball.\nGhasts shoot fireballs at players, dealing damage to nearby &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nGhasts use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nGhasts have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

It was meant as an educational version of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn the beginning, \"MinecraftEdu\" was developed by \"TeacherGaming\", consisting of three developers and three teachers, located in the United States and Finland. Later, \"TeacherGaming\" expanded into a team of eight.\n\"MinecraftEdu\" focuses on allowing the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated &lt;a href=\"The%20Overworld\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; made of &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so the student with the help of the teacher is supposed to learn a variety of subjects. The teacher can change settings to define where students can place and destroy &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; used on the server.\nOn January 19, 2016, Mojang announced that they would be acquiring MinecraftEdu from TeacherGaming. At the same time, a new educational version of the game was announced: has since launched to schools around the world.\nPurchase and availability.\n\"MinecraftEdu\" could be purchased for 18 per student (24 or less) or US$14 (25 or more) for the User license and US$41 for the server license. The server license could be bought as a one-time purchase. Once purchased, the game could be played by downloading the launcher. \"MinecraftEdu Hosting Beta\" was also available for US$20/month and did not require the user to pay the server software license again.\nHardware requirements.\nAccording to http://minecraftedu.com/faq#question_2-13 and https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/325948-minecraft-system-requirements:\nMinimum Requirements:\nRecommended Requirements:\nSoftware Requirements:\nDiscontinuation.\nAs of April 5, 2016, \"MinecraftEdu\" is no longer for sale. However, customers that have already purchased \"MinecraftEdu\" licenses may continue to use \"MinecraftEdu\". Since then, \"MinecraftEdu\" no longer receives new updates from TeacherGaming, and Mojang no longer supports \"MinecraftEdu\". Worlds built in \"MinecraftEdu\" cannot be ported over to &lt;a href=\"Education%20Edition\"&gt;Education Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay.\nThe objective of the game remains the same as regular &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. However, \"MinecraftEdu\" also has the goal of an educational use to teach a variety of subjects. \nFeatures.\nMinecraftEdu differs from the regular version in a variety of ways, such as a tutorial mode, teacher &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; and exclusive &lt;a href=\"Blocks\"&gt;Blocks&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlocks / Items.\nThese IDs are in the namespaced ID format, with their codice_1 namespace omitted."}

She decides to go after another player\u2019s house that is made out of wood. After she kills the player with her sword, she starts placing TNT around the house when a mysterious figure appears, saying that if the house is destroyed that there will be \"consequences in both worlds\", referring to Minecraft and the real world. The girl asks for an explanation, but the figure suddenly disappears. The girl then sets off the TNT anyway, logs out of Minecraft, and shuts down the computer for the night as she notices a house burning right next door to her own. Later, after firefighters extinguish it, the girl is relieved to hear that nobody had lived in the house; her father specifically says that things would\u2019ve gone differently if she hadn\u2019t seen the flames. Just then, the girl notices the mysterious figure at the entrance to the house, but her parents don\u2019t see anything and think that her mind is playing tricks on her. Later, in Minecraft, the girl then decides to make up with the girl that had her house destroyed, suggesting that she could build a new one using a different material or build one underground. The mysterious figure then appears again, but the girl that had her house destroyed says that she heard something despite not seeing anything.\n\"Changes\".\nA girl, later named Penny, says to the reader that her mom had said to her that puberty would bring changes to herself. One day, she wakes up with a grass block from Minecraft on her forehead. As Penny arrives at Jackson Middle School with a plaid hat to cover it up, she meets up with Phillip and shows it to him in an empty classroom. She wonders as to how it happened, and Phillip says that although he plays Minecraft a lot, he hadn\u2019t seen anything matching her situation. He wonders if there are any symptoms with the grass block, so Penny punches at a classroom desk, turning it into several blocks of wooden planks. She wonders as to how to get rid of the symptoms as she thinks that people will make fun of her, but Phillip says that she should find it to be fun to be different from anyone else. He asks Penny if she can open an inventory like in Minecraft. She does, and takes some diamond armor out of it, making it drop in the classroom. As Phillip puts the armor on, Penny also places down a block of obsidian and tosses out an egg, which hatches a chicken. She then tosses out spawn eggs for mobs such as sheep and cows, before thinking of spawning a creeper. Phillip warns Penny to not do so, but she tosses it when she hears his voice. A creeper then spawns from the spawn egg and explodes, seemingly killing her. Penny then respawns in her bed and calls Phillip from her smartphone, himself relieved that it wasn\u2019t hardcore mode. Penny then suggests that they play some more, seemingly happy of being different from others."}

His mom asks as to how school goes, but he says that he can\u2019t talk as he is running late to join some of his friends on a Minecraft server. Once Tyler makes it to his room, he turns on his computer and texts his friends in a group chat (named Evan, Candace, Grace, and Tobi) that he is logging into Minecraft. He then joins a multiplayer server known as \"The EverRealm\" and uses an ender pearl to teleport to his friends\u2019 house, known as the \"Hibiscus House\". Unbeknownst to Tyler, his friends throw a \"welcome back\" party. They ask Tyler as to how life is going over at his new place, and he says that not only is his house bigger, but that he has to wear a uniform to school. Tyler does say, however, that he still needs to adjust to it. His friends then show off everything that they had done for Hibiscus House while he was away, including updates to the strip mine and an arena under construction for when they fight the wither, complete with soul sand in a T-shape in the middle and a wither skeleton skull on each end. Tyler then logs off as it is getting late and heads off to bed, promising to his friends that he\u2019ll be on by next weekend.\nSeveral days later, the arena is still being worked on by Tobi and Evan, with the latter mentioning that Tyler plans to be on after soccer practice. Just then, Candace and Grace return from the Nether with the third wither skeleton skull, and everyone is excited that they\u2019ll be able to fight the wither. Just then, with Evan holding the skull, the soul sand comes to life and wraps around his arms, forcing him to place the skull on the T-shaped soul sand, inadvertently creating the wither. The wither focuses on attacking the four, but fortunately, Tyler soon appears and kills it, but begins to think that his friends wanted to fight the wither without him. His friends try to explain that it was an accident, but Tyler leaves in frustration, saying that his friends can make the beacon without him. As he lies down in bed, he gets text messages from Evan about what is going on in the Minecraft server, asking him if he can come on for something important. After some hesitation, Tyler decides to rejoin the server to find out what is going on.\nUpon entering the Hibiscus House, Tyler notices a sign telling him to head up to the balcony. He does, noticing a beacon pyramid set up. Evan then offers Tyler the nether star that was dropped by the wither to finish the beacon, who happily takes it and places it in the beacon, activating its beam of light. Evan then apologizes for what happened earlier with the wither, but Tyler also apologizes for being upset due to his situation with moving out because of a time zone change. Evan hopes to make it up to him and the two head inside to meet up with everyone else, who suggest that they travel to the End to kill the ender dragon, knowing that nobody else on the server had done it yet. After some pep talk from his friends, Tyler decides to come along, and everyone prepares for next weekend. By then, everyone is back in Minecraft as they head off toward a stronghold. After traveling thousands of blocks and through several biomes, they decide to rest in a clearing in a roofed forest. Their break is cut short, however, as a creeper explodes right by them, destroying their beds and some of their supplies.\nDespite the setback, the group (Tyler, Evan, Candace, Grace, and Tobi) continue toward the stronghold, eventually finding one underneath a desert biome. The group then find the end portal room and place down the five eyes of ender into the empty portal frames, making an end portal. As the group make a plan for how to kill the ender dragon, they are soon attacked by silverfish, leaving them no choice but to jump into the portal. Upon arriving in the End, the ender dragon roars at the group. Candace and Grace decide to distract the ender dragon while Tyler, Evan, and Tobi destroy the end crystals surrounding it. Eventually, after a lengthy battle, the end crystals are destroyed. Candace and Grace then fire two arrows into the ender dragon\u2019s mouth, killing it. The group then take the dragon egg from the exit portal and take it back to the Overworld, in which the exit portal places them back at the original spawn point of the server. The others greet the group as they talk about their adventure, while Grace thanks Candace in private for saving her from an enderman. She then suggests to her that they go out on a date in real life, and Candace happily accepts.\nTyler then says to the group that he found a few people on the server that go to his new school, which also has a gaming club that meets on Wednesdays. He then asks Evan if they would be free to check out the Hibiscus House, and Evan says that they are all welcome. As Tyler, Evan, and the others discuss about going to an ocean monument, the server celebrates the killing of the ender dragon with a fireworks display. Later, back in the Hibiscus House, Tyler gives a tour of the place to the others, but they soon leave, with Tyler promising to meet up with them during gaming club. Evan and Tobi then place the dragon egg on a shelf, with the latter happy that he and his friends are able to overcome any obstacle they face. Evan then asks as to what adventure they\u2019ll go on next.\nVolume 2.\nOne day, Evan is walking home from school, texting to his group of friends (Tobi, Tyler, Candace, and Grace) about getting back onto \"The EverRealm\", a multiplayer Minecraft realm. Everyone is eager to do so except for Candace, who is busy with soccer practice. The group wish her luck. Just then, a person with a muscular physique approaches behind Evan, asking as to who he is texting. Evan says to the person that it is none of their business, but the person ends up accusing Evan of making Tyler move out because of how Evan appeared to be \"annoying\" to him. Evan quickly shouts down the accusation and the person soon leaves, much to Evan\u2019s own relief. On the way home, he texts Tyler, mentioning how much he misses him and that it isn\u2019t the same without him being here. Tyler concurs and also says that he\u2019ll be on the realm once he gets home, hoping to talk about learning trombone in marching band. Evan then greets his mother as he enters his house. Meanwhile, Tyler is in free period in his school\u2019s library, talking with his group of friends from gaming club, named Stef, Rus, and Ethan, about heading out to the ocean monument on the realm.\nEthan says that the ocean monument was left basically untouched, allowing Tyler and his group to head out to it. Stef also suggests that Tyler meet at their base to stack up on maps and potions of water breathing, while Rus mentions about ocean-related biomes and mobs. Tyler feels content about the offer and accepts, happy to know that his gaming club friends are here to help. The next day, at school, Evan notices a piece of paper taped to his locker with the word \"LOSER\" written on it, shocking him. Things don\u2019t get better throughout the week as Evan gets picked on by the person with the muscular physique every day, going as far as to dangle Evan\u2019s phone in the air. Fortunately, Evan is able to get the phone back without incident and soon receives a text from Tyler about meeting up on the realm that night, leaving a subtle hint as to what he has planned, and Evan replies that he is looking forward to it. Later, Evan joins everyone else on the realm as they start walking toward Skeleton Cove, home to Tyler\u2019s gaming club friends. Tyler mentions to the group that his gaming club friends had found the ocean monument, but are allowing them to take their maps so they can find it themselves. The group begin to wonder about what they\u2019ll be able to find inside the monument, but they soon come across Skeleton Cove.\nAs the group head inside, they immediately notice that Skeleton Cove had been ransacked, with holes in the walls, tools laid out everywhere, empty chests, and the beds nowhere to be found. The group begin to wonder as to who or what could\u2019ve done such a thing, but Tobi notices a path in the sand just outside which leads to the ocean, soon noticing the items from Skeleton Cove floating out in the ocean. The group begin to wonder as to what happened with Tyler\u2019s friends from gaming club, so they decide to use boats to row toward the items floating out in the ocean. Evan begins to wonder that this may have been the result of a bully, but Tyler reiterates that no such person would be found in The EverRealm, while also hoping that it would be a big misunderstanding. Grace soon comes across a map which leads to a stone island, so the group decide to head over to it, admiring the ocean life along the way. As they come across the stone island, Evan begins to suggest that they take shelter in a shipwreck as it is getting late, but the group is then attacked by several drowned.\nThe group barely escape and soon find a huge pirate ship on a corner of the stone island. As they walk up to the deck, they notice two people who wonder as to where \"the good loot\" is on the server, with the one in the black shirt mentioning that they (referring to Tyler\u2019s friends from gaming club) will not be able to get away thanks to their gear being stolen, as well as using mining fatigue on them, which makes Tobi realize that the two have are holding them captive. Tyler considers confronting the two directly, but Grace instead considers on making a plan. Unfortunately, the two people, named Cleo and Aiden, along with their parrot, Pips, overhear everything, but allow them onboard the ship to discuss the situation. Tyler once again tries to confront, but Candace calmly says that they are looking for some of Tyler\u2019s friends. Cleo says that she had seen them, walking toward a plank which is connected to a platform, which has Tyler\u2019s friends from gaming club tied together by rope. Tyler attempts to cross the plank, but is stopped when an elder guardian jumps out of the water to sway it around.\nCleo says that she and Aiden lured the elder guardian out of an ocean monument, and also says that she\u2019ll keep Tyler\u2019s friends from gaming club hostage until they tell here as to where \"the good loot and rare drops\" are on the realm, as well as take stuff away from Evan, Candace, Grace, and Tobi. Evan considers killing Cleo and Aiden, but Tobi mentions that it's against the rules of the realm to do so. Evan then asks Cleo as to how she would feel if anything of hers got destroyed or taken away, and she says that she could just rebuild and make new stuff. Candace objects to that reasoning, saying that everyone works hard to be able to get what they need, but Cleo shrugs it off and says that nobody will be able to stop her and Aiden. She and Aiden then decide to make Tyler and his friends their prisoners, but Tyler instead throws a splash potion of harming at them. Evan then pulls a lever, which, unbeknownst to him at first, fires off TNT cannons on the side of the ship, freeing the elder guardian from its enclosure.\nStef, Rus, and Ethan are safe, however, but the elder guardian starts tracking Evan with its laser beam. Tyler ducks him out of view in the nick of time as the elder guardian starts circling the ship. Aiden considers firing the TNT cannons again, but the elder guardian\u2019s laser beam tracks and wounds him. Grace then considers calling a truce in order to take out the elder guardian, and everyone eventually agrees. Cleo decides to have Tyler and Evan distract the elder guardian, much to their objections, while the others rescue Tyler\u2019s friends from gaming club. Meanwhile, Cleo and Aiden will use tridents in an effort to kill the elder guardian. The plan is a success, and the elder guardian is killed, dropping prismarine shards everywhere. Tyler\u2019s friends from gaming club thank everyone for saving them, and Cleo suggests that she and Aiden actually work together with them. Stef agrees and requests that the two come help rebuild Skeleton Cove, which they happily accept. Stef then also gives Tyler the map to the ocean monument as she, Rus, Ethan, Cleo, and Aiden head back to shore. Tyler and his friends then follow the map to the monument and explore it to their own delight.\nThe next day, at school, Evan and his friends sans Tyler confront the person with the muscular physique, saying to it that they should consider making friends and to stop picking on Evan. Happy that the threat is now behind him, Evan and his friends consider as to what adventure to go on next.\nVolume 3.\nTyler and his group of friends (Candace, Grace, Tobi, and Evan) work together to take down several phantoms. Afterward, the group come across a clearing and decide to set up camp. Candace then asks if anyone has plans for summer vacation; Grace says that she\u2019ll be heading off to soccer camp in a few weeks, Tobi says that he\u2019ll get in touch with his tabletop RPG group, and Evan and Tyler say that they\u2019ll hang out in real life next week when the former flies out to visit. Tobi then informs the group that he saw something, so everyone decides to follow him, soon coming across a ruined portal. Evan and Tobi wonder if someone else was already here, but Tyler says that the portal had spawned naturally. The group decide to ask Grace for help, but hold off until the next time they play as Evan prepares to watch the latest episode of \"Skeleton Duels\", which is based off a comic series of the same name. After everyone leaves the server, Evan texts Tyler about visiting him, with the two seemingly excited. A few days later, Evan meets Tyler at his local airport, and the two, along with Tyler\u2019s mom (later named Ms. Collins), soon head back to Tyler\u2019s house.\nDespite objections from Evan and Tyler, Ms. Collins suggests that the two rest up and play Minecraft tomorrow. After eating dinner and brushing their teeth, Evan and Tyler are soon in the latter\u2019s bedroom. After saying goodnight to Ms. Collins, they decide to log on and play Minecraft anyway, soon joining the others. Grace helps repair the ruined portal and goes through it, followed by everyone else. The portal spawns them in the Nether, in this case, a soul sand valley. However, the group is soon attacked by skeletons and ghasts, and they decide to take shelter in a crimson forest nearby. The group sans Grace begin to ask about the soul sand valley and and the trees in the crimson forest, with Grace becoming visibly more frustrated every time someone says that she is a \"Nether expert\". Tyler and Evan soon disconnect for the night, and Grace gives out a big sigh of relief. The next morning, she mentions to her mom about what happened before deciding to practice some soccer in her backyard. The next day, the group are back on Minecraft, this time attacking a hoglin and soon come across a bastion remnant.\nJust then, a piglin appears, and Candace dies after supposedly touching its nose. The rest of the group sans Grace all soon die after being attacked by piglins, with Tyler asking Grace to do something, seeing as she as a \"Nether expert\". Frustrated, Grace leaves the game, making everyone else visibly worried about her. Candace decides to check on her, while Tyler and Evan decide to head out to a local comic book shop, hoping that Grace will be OK. The next morning, Evan wakes up to texts from the group chat, with Grace saying that she doesn\u2019t want to play Minecraft anymore. Tyler mentions about the stuff in the Nether, but Grace says that she had \"a really lousy time\" playing with everyone yesterday and soon leaves the group chat. Tyler feels upset, thinking that he was a jerk for making Grace upset, but cooler heads prevail as Tyler and Evan soon have pancakes for breakfast, with the former hoping to talk to Ms. Collins for advice. Elsewhere, Grace is at her home kicking a soccer ball in her backyard when she is greeted by Candace and Tobi, who brought slushees and snacks to eat.\nGrace apologizes for her actions in the group chat, but also says that everyone was relying on her too much regarding the Nether, and decides to take a break from playing Minecraft for a bit. Some time later, the group sans Grace are back in Minecraft, building a base in the Nether. Although Tyler hopes that Grace will be back on before summer is over, Tobi says that they can\u2019t really rush on that possibility. Evan says that perhaps maybe they could be able to raid the bastion remnant themselves now that they are getting used to the Nether. Just then, Candace notices some striders, but ghasts soon appear nearby. Over the next few days, the group explore the Nether while finishing up their base, succumbing to piglins every time. Just then, Grace shows up at Candace\u2019s house, and the two decide to hang out. Candace then shows Grace the Nether base that she (Candace) and the group have been working on in Minecraft. Tyler also shows off a pair of boots enchanted with Soul Speed. Evan and Tobi then mention that they still weren\u2019t able to check out the bastion remnant because of the piglins, thinking that it\u2019s another mystery that\u2019ll never be solved.\nIt soon gets late in the day, and Grace gets ready to leave to head back home. Tyler then apologizes to her for his actions from before, and she accepts. After Grace heads home, she decides to head into her bedroom and log into Minecraft, soon entering the Nether base. Realizing that she has no armor, she finds a chest nearby, only for it to have gold armor and some potions. Grace decides to use the armor anyway and soon starts exploring the Nether, coming across creatures such as a strider, and biomes such as a warped forest. Not long after, Grace bumps into some piglins, but they don\u2019t attack her. Realizing that the gold armor is preventing them from being hostile, she soon leaves the game, excited to tell the others. Later, Tyler and Evan are woken up by their phones, with a text from Grace saying that she is ready to play Minecraft again. Everyone else joins the game and puts on a piece of gold armor, with Grace mentioning to everyone that piglins won\u2019t attack them if they are wearing gold. The group then explore the bastion remnant, bartering with piglins and avoiding piglin brutes along the way. Soon reaching the center of the remnant, they destroy a magma cube and soon find a chest with the \"pigstep\" music disc. The piglins then start attacking the group as they hear the chest opening, but the group quickly escape on their striders, with Grace feeling excited about what else could be in the Nether."}

A creeper then explodes behind the woman, causing the fence to break apart. A man is then seen pouring water on some lava that had breached the moat thanks to the creeper. The woman, now named Sarah, survives the creeper explosion and heads further into the man\u2019s base. The man offers Sarah an apple, but she walks past him, instead being amazed by the base that he had made. The man immediately makes Sarah leave, not before giving her the apple. Sarah attempts to eat it, but asks for help. The man then tells Sarah to right-click to eat the apple, and she happily gulfs it down. Sarah then asks for the man\u2019s name, and the man says that he is named Hector before he asks Sarah to leave. Sarah turns to leave, but then asks Hector if there is anything else that he can give her. Hector says that he can give her a nether star, much to her own amusement. Sarah then looks up information about the nether star, and thinks that she can obtain one by defeating a wither underground. She begins to dig down, but is stopped by Hector, who asks Sarah if he can teach her the basics, and she happily agrees. Sarah then says that her mom bought the game so she could make some new friends, but Hector says that he doesn\u2019t need friends and that he wasn\u2019t actually serious about giving her a nether star. He then reiterates that he\u2019ll just reach her the basics and then ask her to leave, and Sarah agrees, much to her own bereavement. Hector then explains to Sarah one-hundred-and-three rules of Minecraft over several hours before asking for her to leave again. Sarah then asks about the wither, and Hector asks Sarah as to why they would fight something as dangerous as that. Sarah then says that he wants to do something for him after he did so much for her. Hector agrees, simply because he would like to get a nether star, and Sarah squeals in delight.\nThe next morning, Sarah shows up at Hector\u2019s base. Hector prepares to give her some diamond armor, but she soon leaves, much to Hector\u2019s surprise. Sarah shows up again the next morning, mentioning that she had to leave because her mom came home early from work and bought pizza. Hector then says that he doesn\u2019t think fighting the wither will work out, and asks Sarah to play with someone else, as he doesn\u2019t want the risk of someone bailing randomly on him. Sarah then leaves in a huff, mentioning that she only bailed once (yesterday) and proceeds to dig straight down, much to Hector\u2019s disgust. He then calls out for Sarah moments later, but gets no response. Hector then rushes to the hole and hears the sound of a zombie, followed by Sarah screaming, and he jumps down to check on her. Sarah fends off several hostile mobs before the two escape by breaking the surface, but Hector asks for her to leave again, saying that she is reckless and almost got herself and him both killed. This time, Sarah leaves without incident. Hector then returns to his base, but a creeper explodes directly in front of him, causing the entrance (and part of a structure) to be destroyed. Meanwhile, Sarah eventually walks to a cliff with a forest and river down below, and throws down her shovel in frustration. Back at Hector\u2019s base, Hector fixes up the building as night falls, but he says that still feels broken. Hector then finds Sarah sitting by a campfire in a fenced-off area and apologizes to her about his actions, saying that he is afraid of being left alone. Sarah then goes off in a fit about not letting her explain what happened, and she reiterates that she logged off because her mom came home from work early and bought pizza. Hector then apologizes to Sarah for not listening to her, saying that he was scared and only thinking about his problems. He then says that his mom and dad helped build his base together, which is the only memory he has left of them, and again apologizes to Sarah for taking out his anger on her. The two reconcile as Hector explains that the emerald pyramid at his base is for a beacon, which is why he wanted to find a nether star, but he is considering in leaving it behind to start fresh. Sarah immediately questions this and offers to help him in getting the nether star, and Hector accepts. After gathering some weapons, buckets of milk, food, and potions, the two create a nether portal and go through it, spawning in the Nether. Luckily, they appear close to a nether fortress and climb toward it, not to forget about collecting soul sand.\nThe two (Sarah and Hector) soon arrive at the nether fortress and start walking through it. Sarah is soon attacked by a wither skeleton, but it is killed by Hector, who says that going through the fortress won\u2019t be easy. He then notices that Sarah was inflicted with the wither effect and asks for her to drink some milk, which she does, curing her of the effect. The two soon come across a blaze; Hector kills it and obtains the blaze rod that it dropped, but inadvertently makes Sarah fall to the floor below him. Sarah then walks around to find Hector, but soon reaches a dead end. Upon hearing the sounds of a wither skeleton, Sarah then takes out some dirt and creates a wall in-between herself and the wither skeleton. She then takes out a block of dirt for curiosity, only to see three wither skeletons on the other side. Sarah then stabs her diamond sword through the hole in the wall and kills two of the three wither skeletons before going up against the last one by herself. Meanwhile, Hector is looking for Sarah as he kills a magma cube nearby, but Sarah soon rejoins Hector and shows him a wither skeleton skull that she got, much to his excitement. Hector then gives Sarah an apple to help her regain health, while also acknowledging her skills and thinks that he himself is a \"scaredy cat\". Sarah then says that it isn\u2019t true and that she only acts brave the whole time as it\u2019s easy to do so when she isn\u2019t alone. Hector then says that he feels the same way and states that he wouldn\u2019t have come down here again if she weren\u2019t here. The two then prepare to head back to the nether portal, but come across several wither skeletons. They decide to retreat as Hector fires an arrow at one of the wither skeletons, making it drop its skull as it is killed. Hector then places some cobblestone blocks on the ceiling of the area they are in so the wither skeletons can\u2019t attack them, but says that they need to get the wither skeleton skull before it despawns. Sarah then uses some cobblestone to make a path on the side of the walkway, before mining through the wall so Hector can get the skull. He is able to do so despite being attacked by a wither skeleton, and the two soon make it out of the nether fortress.\nOn the way back to the nether portal, Sarah considers fighting the ender dragon once she and Hector get back to the Overworld. She flails her diamond sword to mimic attacking the dragon, but she inadvertently hits a zombified piglin, causing her and Hector to take cover underground just over a lava lake. Sarah then notices the nether portal on the far side of the lava lake and begins placing down gravel so it can fall to the lava below. Hector wonders as to why she is doing this, and Sarah says that it is safe. She then falls through the hole onto the gravel pillar with Hector following suit, but they are soon attacked by a ghast. Sarah mines out the pillar and then uses the gravel to make a path toward the portal. Hector then uses his last arrow to kill the ghast just before they go through the portal. Back in the Overworld, Sarah and Hector repair their tools and armor and replenish their supplies before they decide to fight the wither. They end up finding a pit with stone at the bottom and then place down the soul sand in a T-shape, followed by placing down the wither skeleton skulls, which spawns the wither. It isn\u2019t long before the wither is killed, and Sarah and Hector use the nether star that it dropped to craft a beacon. Hector then places the beacon on the emerald pyramid at his base, having finally completed his task. Sarah then prepares to leave, but Hector says that there is one more thing that they can do together. He heads into his house, but soon reappears with TNT, saying that he forgot about what really mattered about Minecraft when he put up walls to protect himself. Hector then blows one of the walls to his base. Sara asks why, and he says that he wants to open up the base to everyone. Hector then places down a sign at the entrance which reads \"TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD ANYTHING\"."}

The day, which coincidentally is his birthday, goes terrible from the start. Julian ends up missing the 7-AM train to work, so he takes a taxi instead. Another man named Nick calls Julian on his smartphone, asking if he\u2019ll be on to play Minecraft tonight. Julian says that he won\u2019t be able to as he is working late. Upon arriving at work, he is asked by his boss if he got the message about working late. Julian says that he did and starts to bring up his birthday, but the boss says that he can talk to human resources about arraigning a cake, noting that it would be six to eight weeks before one is delivered. Julian ends up working through the whole day, finishing up a quarterly report before 8-PM. He then rushes back home and starts playing Minecraft on a VR headset. Nick meets up with Julian, and soon the two head down into a mine to find some lapis lazuli.\nAs Nick and Julian head down the mine, they get attacked by numerous hostile mobs such as spiders and skeletons. The two then find some lapis in a cave on the other side of a canyon and start collecting it. Just then, some slimes begin to fall down from the ceiling of the cave, causing the floor to crack underneath. Nick holds on to the edge of the canyon as Julian fends off the slimes. The latter then grabs onto Nick as he tries to grab the bag of lapis lazuli, but the two end up falling down to the base of the canyon. As they head back up to the surface, Julian is greeted with cake and the phrase \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" made out of blocks of lapis lazuli. He, Nick, and their friends then continue working on their tower of lapis, with Julian mentioning to the reader that perhaps sometimes his birthday can be okay.\n\"A Creeper\u2019s Tale\".\nA creeper is seen in a forest, befriended by a spider and a wolf. The three end up building a small house out of dirt and decide to meet up tomorrow. That night, the creeper is asleep in the house when two skeletons appear, saying that she is useless for acting like a person. The skeletons then break a glass window, drawing the attention of the spider and the wolf, who end up attacking the skeletons. They run off as the spider and the wolf calm down the creeper, saying to her that she can explode, but only if she either gets too excited or tries to talk to someone. The next morning, the spider and the wolf meet the creeper once again, surprised to see that the house is surrounded by a lava moat, in which a pressure plate is connected to a dirt circle on top of it. The spider and wolf are amazed at the creeper for setting it up, and decide to gather their other animal friends to show it off. As the spider and wolf are away, a person then appears, walking toward the house. The creeper starts to warn the person about the lava moat as it approaches the person, causing itself to explode and the dirt circle to give way to the lava moat. The person, blown back by the explosion, soon notices the pressure plate on the ground, suggesting that the creeper was trying to warn the person, and starts walking toward a ridge. Later, the spider and the wolf return, with no creeper in sight.\n\"The Witch and The Pillager\".\nA witch, later named Denise, prepares to throw a potion at an unsuspecting villager, but the villager ends up being shot by a pillager named Darnell. He and Denise then have an argument about who would\u2019ve been responsible for going after the villager. Denise then throws a potion of poison at the villager in frustration before it scurries off. Denise and Darnell then hear construction off in the distance and decide to head over to it, realizing that its a fortified village. They have a bet, where whoever takes out the least villagers moves away and forfeits all hunting rights. The village is then ransacked by Denise and Darnell, and the two barely escape when an iron golem tries to attack them. A few days later, Denise suggests ransacking a village nearby, but Darnell says that he has to get back to his pack of pillagers. The two once again have a brief argument before parting ways, with Denise going to ransack the village alone. She is lost in thought about Darnell, however, and a villager suggests that she communicate with Darnell and be open to compromise. Denise responds by throwing a potion of poison at the villager, saying that she\u2019ll never work on a compromise, but she leaves the ransacked village visibly sad. Just then, Darnell appears, making Denise wonder as to where his pack of pillagers went. Darnell says that he ditched them to look for her, as he states that raiding a village isn\u2019t as fun without her. The two apologize and reconcile as they raid the village. Afterwards, the two kiss as they look around for more villages to raid.\n\"A Pig\u2019s Tale\".\nA player spawns in the Overworld, determined to build an empire of his own. By the next day, the person\u2019s health and hunger run low, and soon notices a baby pig. The person doesn\u2019t have the courage to kill it, however, so the pig ends up following the person wherever they go. The pig then knocks the person off a cliff into water, with the person vowing revenge on it. By day sixty-five, the player has built their empire, with several traps set up for the pig. Unbeknownst to the player, the pig oinks right behind the player, who ends up falling down the side of the castle. A week after that, the player sets up a trap involving doors and a pressure plate, but the pig knocks the player into it. Four weeks after that, the player gives up on killing the pig, knowing that it had destroyed the empire and dodged everything the player could think of, and decides to start anew. Now over a million blocks from spawn, the player builds a shelter underground, soon reaching the bottom of the world, open to a void below. The player begins to sense that the pig might\u2019ve followed them here, and it has, much to their own belief. The pig begins to explain why it followed the player, but the player says that it can\u2019t speak pig. The pig then pulls out a sign which says that the player had a carrot in its back pocket. The player then tosses the carrot to the pig, who munches it down and then holds up another sign asking for more carrots. The player then decides to head back to the empire with the pig. Some time later, the empire is rebuilt with carrot farms and statues of pigs everywhere, and the player also has a new friend, that being the pig.\n\"A Strange Shore\".\nA man washes up on a shore, soon finding a village. He is not greeted warmly by the villagers at first, but as he accepts a flower offered by a baby villager, they welcome him. Another villager gives the man a bowl of mushroom stew. Just then, another villager warns that the sun is setting, so everyone heads inside a house to sleep. That night, the man notices several hostile mobs, only to duck for cover underneath his bed when he notices an enderman. The next morning, the man discovers that a majority of the village was destroyed, so he decides to help rebuild it. He makes a pickaxe at the blacksmith\u2019s shop and then heads off into the world unknown, doing whatever he can to help rebuild the village while also getting stronger himself. Later, with his diamond armor equipped and the village not only rebuilt, but expanded, he notices a woman washed up on the shore. The man helps the woman toward the village, where she is greeted warmly by the villagers."}

A man, who calls himself \"Senan the Thorough\", says for the two girls to either share the orbs or he\u2019ll take them himself. The girls question Senan\u2019s request, with Cahira saying that Senan is already at the highest level possible. Just then, a skeleton fires an arrow, which pierces through Senan\u2019s map. Senan has his pet wolf, Wilkie, kill off the skeleton as the others rummage a nearby chest. Senan finds a totem of undying and says that it is valuable, but thinks there is more stuff abound inside the mansion. The three then search throughout the mansion, only to get in combat with numerous hostile mobs. One of the rooms is of a prison cell. After Orion opens the door, several zombies emerge, but they are killed with ease. Senan enters the cell, followed by Cahira and Orion. A door in the cell leads to a room that has soul sand in a T-shape, with wither skeleton skulls on the left and right ends. Orion finds a lever, but Cahira asks him not to pull it as she is jokingly worried about zombies. He pulls it anyway, unbeknownst to Senan, who shouts at Orion to not do so, realizing that it had already been too late. A wither skeleton skull drops from the ceiling and lands on the center of the T-shape soul sand, which spawns a wither.\nThe three start attacking the wither, but soon it ends up eating Senan and escapes the woodland mansion. Cahira and Orion wonder as to what to do, but Wilkie soon notices a path of wither roses and starts following them. Cahira and Orion decide to follow Wilkie, hopeful that they can beat the wither and save Senan. That night, the three stumble upon several hostile mobs, which are killed with ease. A creeper explodes close to a house nearby, startling another girl, who at first believes that Cahira, Orion, and Wilkie are monsters and then hides underneath her house. Cahira and Orion explain to the girl that they are actually \"monster hunters\", saying that they killed off the hostile mobs that surrounded her house. Relieved, the girl introduces herself as Atria and thanks them. Cahira and Orion introduce themselves to Atria as she shows them around her house. As it is getting late, Atria decides to build out a guest space for the three, where they rest for the night.\nThe next morning, Atria serves up cake for breakfast, and says regarding the hostile mobs from last night that she feels like that she is cursed, as she says that hostile mobs follow here wherever she goes. Atria also shows off her personal mine which has a tunnel that leads to her mother\u2019s house. Orion asks Atria as to how she got cursed, and she says that she doesn\u2019t know. Cahira then suggests for Atria to come along, saying that they could use her as bait for the wither, but she refuses, saying that she needs to deliver iron ingots to a village with assistance from her mother. Cahira and Orion leave feeling frustrated; the latter thinks that Atria will end up slowing them down. The two then have a light argument just as a spider shows up nearby. Cahira notices the spider and a plan hatches in her head. With Orion\u2019s help, they lure the spider to a hole created just above the doors in Atria\u2019s personal mine. The spider falls to the ground below and the hole is quickly patched up. Later, Atria screams upon noticing the spider, and the two mine through the dirt wall to kill it.\nAtria thanks the two for saving her once again and also apologizes for kicking them out. Cahira mentions that Wilkie was looking for the trail of wither roses and that their mentor, Senan, taught her and Orion techniques on tracking. Atria wonders as to where Senan is now, so Cahira retells as to how he ended up inside the wither that they are tracking. She also says that Senan knows everything, hoping that he can help Atria with her supposed curse. Atria decides to help them find the wither, but has to inform her mother about the situation. Atria\u2019s mother wholly objects to Atria leaving because of her curse, but after some discussion, she decides to enchant her turtle shell before she is allowed to leave, promising that Cahira and Orion keep her safe. Atria then introduces the two to her town of Woodhaven as they continue to follow the trail of wither roses. The sun begins to set as they approach a savanna biome, and soon they are attacked by hostile mobs. Atria takes shelter in a cobblestone structure as Cahira, Orion, and Wilkie fight off the mobs. Atria then decides to assist by firing an arrow at a skeleton, killing it. She then builds out a shelter from the structure, but realizes that she left her bed at home. Cahira leaves to find some sheep and soon returns with three red wool for a bed. After cooking some mutton, they all rest for the night.\nThe next day, the four (Cahira, Orion, Wilkie, and Atria) are in a desert biome. Cahira starts teaching Atria on how to use a sword. As they approach a plains biome, Atria crafts some buckets to collect milk from nearby cows. Coming to a forest biome, they discover wheat, but Atria gets attacked by a zombie from a cave. She ends up killing it, however. As the four approach an ice spikes biome, they find a nether portal next to an area that they dub as the wither\u2019s nest. Atria considers finding a shelter, but then calls out the wither. Although she thinks it had left, the wither soon appears above her, albeit a bit bigger than before. Atria takes shelter behind some ice while Cahira and Orion attack the wither. Soon, Cahira appears to accidentally fire rotten flesh at the wither, in which the head on the wither\u2019s right ends up eating it. The head starts becoming queasy from the rotten flesh and soon vomits out Senan, much to the relief of Cahira, Orion, and Wilkie. Cahira asks Senan as to how he survived for that long, and he says it was because he had the totem of undying. Orion then apologizes to Senan for pulling the lever that caused the wither to spawn in the first place, but just then, the wither starts to go after Atria.\nCahira, Orion, Senan, and Wilkie try their best to fight the wither off with swords now that it is down to half of its health, making it immune from arrows. Atria, realizing that she can help, decides to talk to the wither and asks what it wants. Her eyes are able to see inside the wither\u2019s mind, showcasing the wither in the Nether, happy to be back with the hostile mobs there. Atria then says to the three to light up the nether portal, which they do after crafting flint and steel. As the wither disappears through the portal, Orion destroys it with a water bucket, followed by Senan mining out the obsidian frame. Atria and Senan then introduce themselves to each other. Atria mentions to Senan about her curse, but Senan mentions that although he had been cursed numerous times, he wouldn\u2019t consider himself an expert on curses. Atria begins to feel like that she\u2019ll end up keeping her curse as the group head off to somewhere new. Unbeknownst to them, however, a new nether portal spawns in the ice spikes biome, allowing the wither and the mobs of the Nether to come back into the Overworld.\nVolume 2.\nCahira, Orion, Senan, Atria, and Wilkie are walking through a forest biome when they notice the wither off in the distance. As they figure out what to do, Senan says that they are heading to Whitestone City to upgrade their tools and armor. Cahira asks for diamonds to make a diamond sword, but everyone else in the group doesn\u2019t have any. Atria says that she still has the curse on her, so Senan mentions to her about a \"sorcerer friend\" in Whitestone City that could help remove it. Just then, a blaze attacks them, but it is killed with ease. The group then stock up on apples from a nearby tree and soon arrive at Whitestone City. A sign nearby reveals the \"sorcerer friend\" to be named Lucasta, who lives in a yellow house just outside of Whitestone City. The group are allowed to come inside her house, which is also home to several cats. Lucasta wonders as to why Senan is here, and he mentions that Atria needs help with lifting her curse.\nLucasta then mentions to the group about how Senan and her had a rivalry about getting rid of hostile mobs; Senan would generally used combat while Lucasta thought of more \"creative methods\" to do such a task. The people of Whitestone City preferred Senan over her because of this, so she and Senan had a mob-fighting contest in the city square. Lucasta had set up a dispenser with spawn eggs, and Senan ended up succumbing to the horde of hostile mobs that followed. It was because of this that he left Whitestone City to, in Senan\u2019s words, train himself and improve. Lucasta also says that when the city was later attacked by hostile mobs, it was herself that took care of it. Cahira asks Senan as to why he would give up and leave, and Lucasta says to never worship someone as a hero. She then shows off a room filled with dungeons\u2013a mob farm\u2013and starts to wonder why the mobs are more active than usual. Atria mentions that it is because of her curse, and also asks Lucasta as to why she has a mob farm.\nLucasta says that a mob farm is simply what she loves, knowing that she doesn\u2019t have to do any work outside the home. Cahira and Orion wonder if they can work to become Lucasta\u2019s \"personal mob grinders\", but Lucasta objects, saying that they\u2019ll get in the way, but takes a special interest in Atria as the group check out the rest of her house, including a music room and a brewing lab. Lucasta then says to Atria that she would like to study her curse, so she brings her to a platform overlooking the water-lava room. Lucasta feels like the mobs have a strong connection to her, but Atria says that she doesn\u2019t really feel the connection, with the exception of supposedly telepathically communicating with the wither about going to the Nether. Lucasta feels like that is odd as Atria sits down in a chair. Lucasta sets up a camera to \"analyze\" Atria\u2019s curse as she leaves to check on the rest of the dungeon chambers. Atria begins to feel terrified and bored. That night, Cahira and Orion decide to head down into the dungeon chambers to get some mob loot as Atria falls asleep in her bed.\nBy daybreak, Lucasta notices that Cahira and Orion are down in the chambers and orders them to leave, which they do. Atria then heads back to the water-lava room with a book to keep her occupied as her curse is studied even more, but later, she ends up getting bored and soon leaves to check out Whitestone City. Meanwhile, Cahira and Orion are checking out a store there; Cahira buys a custom cape, while Orion buys a pair of boots enchanted with Frost Walker and the Curse of Vanishing. Just then, someone named Elvicks snitches at the two, calling them \"tourists\" while showing off his golden sword. Cahira decides to show off the rotten flesh she had gotten from killing zombies, which a villager decides to trade in exchange for emeralds. Elvicks then says to the two that they can\u2019t beat him in combat. Orion starts to walk away, saying that he\u2019s not going to fight him unless he turns into a zombie. Enraged, Elvicks prepares to attack Orion with his gold sword, but Cahira attacks with her iron sword in defense, breaking the gold sword. Elvicks then challenges Orion to a swimming contest, which he accepts, but easily wins thanks to the Frost Walker enchanted boots.\nAtria soon arrives in Whitestone City, soon finding Cahira and Orion in a milk bar. As she opens the door, she overhears Cahira mentioning to a villager about putting the spider in Atria\u2019s house. She leaves in disgust, with Cahira following behind her. Atria mentions to Cahira that friends shouldn\u2019t manipulate others into doing what they want, saying that she doesn\u2019t want to be used anymore and that friendship actually is about treating people with respect, while also hurt that their friendship started with a lie. Cahira apologizes and the two quickly reconcile. They start to head back to Lucasta\u2019s mansion as Orion notices them leaving. He too soon leaves to catch up, but doesn\u2019t notice Elvicks and a villager friend of his sneaking up behind him. Later, Atria and Cahira are back in the water-lava room, but Lucasta soon appears, wondering as to what Cahira is doing. Cahira stumbles into the lava below, but is saved thanks to her cape. Atria then says to Lucasta that Cahira was just here to keep her company and says that she doesn\u2019t want to be used for mob grinding anymore.\nLucasta feels ashamed, saying that her contraptions never impressed anyone in Whitestone City, with some people calling her \"creepy\". She then says that the city was attacked by hostile mobs because she had loaded a dispenser with spawn eggs for the mob fighting contest, not realizing that it was getting dark, so she concocted an enchantment that would let her change time at will, and makes the sun rise, killing off the horde of mobs. Lucasta then says that nobody cared about what had happened because they were allegedly concerned about what happened to Senan, but at least she plans to help concoct a cure for Atria\u2019s curse. As Orion reads a farmer\u2019s almanac, Lucasta hears that someone had infiltrated her home and heads upstairs, only to find out that everything in the armory had disappeared, including Atria\u2019s map to Woodhaven. Lucasta then has everyone follow her to a room directly underneath the armory, which is a zombie trap set up by her for any thieves that attempt to steal stuff. Inside the trap, Orion and Cahira soon recognize Elvicks and his villager friend, with the latter having been turned into a zombie.\nLucasta grudgingly decides to help them out, ordering them into a room directly next to the trap. Orion then mentions about a cure for zombie villagers, which consist of a potion of weakness and a golden apple, and everyone heads out to prepare it. Elvicks then says to his zombie villager friend that they are here to help. Just then, an enderman appears and takes out a block of cobblestone before teleporting away, allowing the zombie villager to leave. Elvicks chases after it by mining out a tunnel from the trap, but soon notices that the sun is setting. The zombie villager goes after everyone in Whitestone City, turning regular villagers into zombie villagers. Elvicks is able to climb to the top of a bell tower and warn everyone to head inside. Cahira, Orion, Senan, Atria, Wilkie, and Lucasta soon hear the bell ringing from the tower, realizing that the zombie villager had escaped, and so they decide to make more potions of weakness and golden apples; the latter uses up numerous gold blocks from the exterior of Lucasta\u2019s home. With their inventories full, they run toward Whitestone City.\nThe group do everything they can: splashing potions of weakness at the zombie villagers, feeding them golden apples, and sheltering them to keep them still as they heal. Despite their efforts, Cahira and Orion are attacked by phantoms, but easily avoid them. Wilkie also helps out by saving a cat from being killed by a zombie villager. As the zombie villagers close in on the town square, Atria makes a platform to shield them from the sun as it rises while the rest use the potions of weakness and golden apples. Elvicks also assists the group in their efforts. As it becomes morning, Orion uses his last potion of weakness on Elvick\u2019s zombie villager friend, who flees into daylight, engulfing it in flames. Elvicks throws a golden apple at his zombie villager friend, followed by Lucasta dousing water on it and sheltering it so it can heal. Elvicks then apologizes to the group for stealing their stuff and gives everything back. The cat that Wilkie had saves earlier also befriends the group after eating some fish. The townspeople of Whitestone City commend Elvicks for warning them about the zombie villager, but Lucasta insists that she was the one that helped out in the first place. The townspeople overwhelmingly disagree, however, saying that the zombies came from her house.\nAlthough the townspeople praise Elvicks for his efforts, he insists that it was the others (Cahira, Orion, Atria, Senan, and Lucasta) that helped save the city. Despite Senan being in disbelief that nobody remembered him, Cahira and Orion still think that he is a good person. Senan then gives Cahira a diamond sword enchanted with Smite, while Lucasta gives Atria an enchanted golden apple that is said to free her of her curse. The group (Cahira, Orion, Senan, Atria, Wilkie, and the cat) decide to head back to Woodhaven as Elvicks mentions to the townspeople that Lucasta has a \"cat fountain\" inside her home; Lucasta decides to prove the townspeople that she does have such a fountain. As the group are en route to Woodhaven, the wither is seen in the distance, high atop a mountain.\nExtras.\nSenan notices that there is a discount in the weapon shop for so-called \"champions\". He says that he is one to the villager that runs it, but the villager points to a sign that says that the discount only applies to current ones (in this case, Cahira and Orion). Senan mentions to the villager that he is shopping on behalf of Cahira, saying that he taught them about everything and that he is like a father to them, and asks about the discount.\nAtria decides to use some emeralds she had gathered to trade for a bell, some suspicious stew, and a scute, complementing each item she gets while saying that she loves it when villagers level up. Cahira mentions to Orion that Atria is a hoarder.\nWith a cat fountain set up in the center of Whitestone City, it gets overrun with cats in about six months. Lucasta doesn\u2019t feel like there is such a thing as too many cats.\nThe wither destroys a house, soon noticing that a painting of the wither is inside of it. It adores the painting, but it is soon engulfed in flames, shocking the wither.\nVolume 3.\nCahira, Orion, Senan, Atria, Wilkie, and the cat are all en route to Woodhaven. Orion asks Atria if she thought of a name for the cat, and Atria is considering on naming it \"Cali\". Cahira then asks Atria if she is going to eat the enchanted golden apple in her possession to lift her curse, and Atria says that she wants to show it to her mother first, mentioning that she had attempted to cure Atria of her curse for years. Orion wonders if Atria will still be able to communicate with hostile mobs without the curse, with Cahira butting in and saying that Atria will \"just be a normal, unspecial, but still completely awesome, talented, and smart person\", much to their disgust. Orion then asks Atria if she can communicate with mobs besides hostile ones, so she decides to test it on the cat. As the cat meows, Atria translates it to the cat wanting some fish. Atria then asks the cat as to what he wants to be called. The cat meows, with Atria translating that the cat\u2019s name is \"Fernando\". Orion then has Atria talk to Wilkie, and she says that Wilkie says that she loves everyone and wants some food. A chicken then appears, taking a peculiar interest in Orion; he wonders as to what the chicken will be named. Atria translates the chicken\u2019s bawking to say that he is named \"BeakBoy58\", which is apparently \"a family name with a long lineage\". Eventually, the group find a village named \"Rockaway Village\", but soon realize that the wither had already destroyed it. Nonetheless, the group decide to repair a house and rest there for the night. During the night, Atria is awoken by \"KRAHHH\" sounds outside the house, but eventually falls asleep. The next morning, everyone decides to search through the rubble of the houses in the village and take whatever they can, such as books and music discs. Senan then mentions to Cahira and Orion that they will need to destroy the wither once they drop off Atria back at her mother\u2019s house.\nCahira insists that they bring Atria along to help with defeating the wither, but Senan says that it is Atria\u2019s choice whether to do so or not, and says to Atria that she can tell them about it once they get back to Woodhaven. Just then, the \"KRAHHH\" sounds from last night are heard once again, revealing that they have come from an iron golem . Atria decides to use some of her iron ingots to help the iron golem heal, and also asks the golem as to what happened, which shows a vision of the iron golem protecting two villagers from the wither. Cahira then says to the iron golem that it can come with them, mentioning that Orion was responsible for spawning the wither in the first place. Cahira and Orion then get into an argument, causing the iron golem to attack both of them and their pet animals.\nEventually, Atria says for everyone to stop fighting and to work together so they can take down the wither, and also says that the iron golem will come along with them to avenge her village. As the eight (Cahira, Orion, Senan, Atria, Wilkie, Fernando, BeakBoy58, and the iron golem) continue toward Woodhaven, Atria asks Senan as to why he ended up at Woodhaven in the first place. Senan tells her about his time being a monster hunter and how he\u2019d gain experience from taking down zombie sieges and illager raids; he was kicked out of Woodhaven because the illagers managed to escape with the village\u2019s beacon. Senan thinks that being kicked out was caused by the \"many curses\" that Lucasta had placed on him, and despite constantly being in villages that were sieged by hostile mobs, he eventually drank milk to help lift the curses off of him. By nightfall, the group decide to build a small shelter in a desert.\nInside the shelter, Atria asks Cahira and Orion as to what happened to their parents. Orion says that their parents had just decided to log off the server and never came back on, so they decided to search for them to no avail. As they were about to be killed by zombies, Senan rescued them, and although originally bringing them back to their village, his wolf, Wilkie, wanted them to come along, so he relented and allowed Cahira and Orion to train under his mentorship. Atria wonders if eating the enchanted golden apple is really necessary as Cahira and Orion are both supposedly good at taking down hostile mobs. Orion then states that they can\u2019t tell Atria as to whether to eat the apple or not, reminding her that it is her decision alone. All three soon sleep for the night. The next day, the group eventually make it back to Woodhaven, with Atria running toward her mother\u2019s house. Her mother is happy for her to be back and thanks Cahira and Orion for looking over her. As Atria\u2019s mother looks over the enchanted golden apple, Senan slips that Atria\u2019s mother\u2019s name is \"Ventra\", much to everyone\u2019s surprise. Ventra then says to Orion that Senan had arrived at her village once only to quickly leave, but she pushes that aside as Senan mentions about how Atria saved him from the wither. Ventra then asks Atria as to why she hasn\u2019t eaten the enchanted golden apple yet, and Atria says that she plans on using her curse to become a monster hunter, much to Ventra\u2019s shock. Atria then recounts her entire adventure up until now, but she inadvertently causes the wither to appear when she quotes \"C\u2019mere wither\". As the wither starts destroying Woodhaven, Ventra orders Atria to take shelter in her bunker. Atria refuses and instead runs toward the local quarry, with the wither giving chase. As the wither closes in on Atria, who is climbing some scaffolding, Orion throws an ender pearl, landing in front of Atria, and then attacks the wither.\nThe others (Cahira, Senan, Wilkie, Fernando, the iron golem, and Ventra) soon shows up to assist in taking down the wither once and for all. Orion and Atria set off a pack of TNT above the wither using a fire charge and a conveniently placed lever; Cahira uses a diamond sword enchanted with Smite; Ventra downs a potion of strength before throwing a trident and creeper at the wither; the iron golem helps protect Atria from some wither skulls; and Senan uses a diamond sword. Eventually, Atria runs toward a small wood shack and is finally convinced by Cahira to eat the enchanted golden apple. A wither skull hits Atria just as she bites down on the golden apple, making everyone else believe that she may have died; they all attack the wither in a fit of rage. Senan and Ventra are knocked back by a wither skull as Cahira combs through the fire looking for Atria. Fortunately, Atria is safe and unharmed, and Cahira is also healed with a splash potion courtesy of Ventra. Cahira wonders as to how Atria survived the blast from the wither skull, and Ventra mentions that the golden apple was enchanted with Blast Protection IV and Regeneration II. Atria then runs off with a diamond sword enchanted with Smite toward the wither, while Ventra gives Cahira potions of healing, blast protection, and a bucket of milk. Wilkie is able to assist the iron golem by giving it some iron ingots to help it heal. Cahira then gives Orion a bucket of milk to cure him from the wither effect, while she drinks the potion of blast resistance. The two then realize that the wither is starting to fly away, so everyone goes after it. Eventually, one of the heads of the wither inadvertently fires a wither skull at another head, ultimately killing it and dropping a nether star. Senan gives the nether star to Ventra as a means of making a new beacon in Woodhaven.\nAs the group head back to Woodhaven proper, the villagers given them a warm welcome. Atria herself still has the supposed curse despite eating the enchanted golden apple, and translates an iron golem\u2019s \"KRAH!\" to saying that the iron golem wants to stay in Woodhaven, making the villagers cheer. Eventually, the group make it back to Ventra\u2019s home and have dinner, with Ventra breaking the news that she wasn\u2019t attempting to chase Senan out of the village at all, but was instead trying to say to him that he has a daughter, that being Atria, much to everyone\u2019s shock and surprise. Everyone eventually decides to stay in Woodhaven and work as monster hunters part-time, while Cahira, Orion, and Atria work out ideas and locations for themselves and their pet animals. The three are then seen fighting off hostile mobs, mining diamonds, and also doing their separate things; Orion is feeding some chickens in a nearby forest, while Cahira and Atria start building a mansion.\nExtras.\nOrion notices that Atria is working at a crafting table and wonders what she is up to. Atria says that she is working on \"plein air painting\" as she crafts a painting, which turns into \"Graham\".\nAtria and Cahira are in the Nether, using fungus on a stick to lure striders. Cahira asks Atria as to how much her strider loves her. Although Atria\u2019s thoughts show that the strider wants to eat the mushroom, Atria cautiously says that the strider loves Cahira very much."}

As Birch and Byte play around in some sunflowers nearby, Emmy plans to climb to the top of a nearby mountain dubbed \"Mount Farview\", with Birch concurring. The two then punch out some logs from a nearby tree to craft into planks, which in turn are used to craft a crafting table. After Emmy crafts some wooden tools, everyone starts heading toward Mount Farview. They notice a spider nearby, but it doesn\u2019t attack as the sun is still out. Not long after, Emmy, Birch, and Byte arrive at the base of the mountain, and decide to gather some more supplies. Emmy uses her axe to knock apples off a nearby oak tree, while Birch uses his wooden pickaxe to gather cobblestone. The pickaxe soon breaks, but Emmy then crafts Birch a stone pickaxe. As everyone begins to climb Mount Fairview, the sun begins to set, so they decide to build a shelter. Birch mines out cobblestone while Emmy uses it build a house. Just then, a skeleton fires arrows at them, but is killed with ease. More hostile mobs soon appear, like zombies and creepers, but all are killed by daybreak. Emmy, Birch, and Byte then finish climbing up Mount Farview, overlooking numerous biomes in the distance as the narrator mentions that their adventure was just getting started.\nMobs in the Overworld!\nAs Birch plays fetch with his tame wolf, Byte, near a village, Emmy plans on getting a pet of her own, so they decide to go exploring around the Overworld. They first come across mobs such as cows and chickens, but Birch remarks that they belong to the villagers as they are in an enclosed space. Emmy agrees, and so the two continue exploring. Coming to a taiga biome, they find some rabbits and a fox. Emmy acknowledges that the rabbits are cute, but is worried about taking one from a family. Byte ends up scaring away the fox. Birch then spots a bees' nest and starts to knock it off of the tree with his pickaxe. Emmy warns him to stop, but by then, it was too late. A group of angry bees then chase everyone out of the woods and into a nearby cave, where they come across spiders, silverfish, bats, and numerous hostile mobs such as zombies and slimes. Exiting the cave, the three (Emmy, Birch, and their tame wolf, Byte) then come across a panda in a jungle, who sneezes at them, leaving behind a slimeball.\nThey soon head into the ocean, where they find mobs such as dolphins and drowned, and then into the ice and snow, finding a stray and some polar bears. Not long after, Emmy, Birch, and Byte come across a swamp, where they notice a black cat, but a witch begins throwing potions at the three from nearby, leaving them no choice but to run off. As they leave the swamp, a creeper blows up right by them, making a crater in the ground. Emmy begins to worry that she might not be able to find an animal to be her pet, but a horse just happens to be nearby. Birch crafts a lead using string from a spider and the slimeball from the panda, while Emmy walks slowly over to the horse. Emmy then takes the lead from Birch while he feeds the horse an apple. As Emmy puts a saddle on the horse and climbs on it, she decides to call the horse \"Ink\". Emmy and Ink then gallop across the Overworld as Birch and Byte run alongside them.\nEscape from the Nether!\nEmmy, Birch, and their wolf, Byte, are in the Overworld. Emmy is wearing a golden helmet and some golden boots, while Birch has an iron sword. The two decide to play fetch with Byte by throwing a stick into a nearby forest. Although Byte chases after it, Emmy and Birch soon realize that Byte has disappeared and start calling its name as they head toward the forest. Beneath some trees, the two soon find a nether portal. Feeling that Byte may have gone through it, Emmy and Birch decide to go through it as well, spawning in a warped forest in the Nether. Climbing a vine to get a better view of their surroundings, the two also notice a crimson forest, a huge swath of netherrack, and \"an ocean of lava\". Emmy then puts some warped fungus into her inventory as she and Birch head over to the crimson forest. Suddenly, the two are surrounded by piglins. They attack Birch but avoid Emmy as she is wearing a gold helmet and a pair of gold boots. Emmy then gives Birch her gold helmet so she no longer can be attacked by piglins.\nThe two then follow the piglins over to a bastion remnant, where the two soon find \"a treasure room filled with gold\". Opening a chest in the room ends up provoking the piglins, however, so Emmy and Birch escape by making a hole in the wall. The escape quickly becomes tricky, however, due to them ending up in a soul sand valley. As skeletons fire at them, the two find a nether portal across a river of lava. Birch feels as if they are trapped, but Emmy soon notices some striders. They saddle them and climb on top, but the striders don\u2019t move. Emmy then attempts to use a carrot on a stick, but it doesn\u2019t work. As the mobs close in on them, Birch suggests to use the warped fungus to craft a warped fungus on a stick. Emmy does so, and just as she has the fungus in front of the strider\u2019s face, they begin to run across the lava. Emmy and Birch quickly head toward the nether portal, where they notice Byte on the other side, and soon go through it. Now safe in the Overworld, the two decide to play fetch with Byte once again.\nThe Sky\u2019s the Limit!\nEmmy and Birch are seen jumping on their beds in their house, as their wolf, Byte, happily watches them. Birch feels like that they could jump higher, and Emmy says that she has an idea. She gathers sixteen slime blocks and then places them outside on the ground. The two them jump on the slime blocks, realizing that they can bounce really high. Birch, however, feels like he wants to fly, so Emmy heads back in the house and takes out a pair of elytra from a chest. Birch happily puts them on as Emmy says that he\u2019ll be able to fly with them. Birch is so excited that he leaps off the cliff before Emmy could warn him that the elytra were broken, and Birch ends up falling to the slime blocks below. Emmy then realizes that they would need to kill a phantom in order to repair the elytra, so Birch destroys the beds in their house before the two go on an adventure, killing numerous mobs. On the third night, the two have a picnic with Byte under the moon and stars, but a phantom soon swoops down at them. It is soon killed, however, and drops a phantom membrane, which Emmy uses to repair the elytra. Birch then happily flies around with it, noticing several things such as a mountain and a desert pyramid. He then heads back to Emmy to inform her of everything he saw, and the two decide to go on another adventure."}

It features many music tracks that were \"silently\" added to \"Minecraft\" in the &lt;a href=\"2013%20Music%20Update\"&gt;Music Update&lt;/a&gt; a few days after the album's release, as well as the &lt;a href=\"music%20discs\"&gt;music discs&lt;/a&gt; that were missing from the first album (except for \"11\"). Similarly to \"Volume Alpha\", \"Volume Beta\" includes short bonus tracks that are not in the game.\nWith a less minimalistic style, longer track lengths with more complex structures, and a much greater emphasis on lush, ambient synth sounds, the album has a noticeably darker and more dramatic tone than \"Volume Alpha\", which C418 acknowledges on his website, saying:\n\"The big difference of Volume Beta is that the tone is both more positive and at times very dark. Some of the songs even have percussion, which is something that was a complete rarity with Volume Alpha. For example 'Taswell' or 'Aria Math'.\" \nC418 considers \"Volume Beta\" to be \"dedicated to America and Asia\", while \"Volume Alpha\" \"might be a love record to Europe\". One can notice the Asian influence on tracks such as \"Aria Math\", \"Biome Fest\", \"Dreiton\", \"Haunt Muskie\", and \"Flake\".\nOfficial description.\n\"The second official soundtrack of Minecraft. 140 minutes in length and extremely varied.\"\n\"Featuring the all-new creative mode, menu tunes, the horrors of the nether, the end's odd and misleading soothing ambiance and all the missing record discs from the game!\"\n\"It's my longest album ever, and I hope you'll love the amount of work I crammed into it.\""}

An update on December 4, 2009, changed the controls and added widescreen, more &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s, and the ability to place and destroy blocks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.mojang.com/notch/j4k/minecraft4k/\"&gt;original page&lt;/a&gt; hosting the game was removed in November 2014. Its archive can still be accessed using the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20141101124251/https%3A//www.mojang.com/notch/j4k/minecraft4k/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;. The executable is also available on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.org/details/Minecraft4K\"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; and some unofficial launchers.\nOn December 2, 2012, Notch released &lt;a href=\"http%3A//jsfiddle.net/uzMPU\"&gt;a JavaScript version of \"Minecraft 4k\"&lt;/a&gt;. It is not possible to move or look around in this version, though the camera or world does move by itself, and there is a blue water-like block in addition to the other block types.\nGameplay.\nGeneral.\nThe &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can place and destroy &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s. The only block the player can place is &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, reminiscent of the very early builds of \"Minecraft\" internally called &lt;a href=\"RubyDung\"&gt;RubyDung&lt;/a&gt; that are available from the \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Leaves\"&gt;Leaves&lt;/a&gt; do not decay.\nWorld.\nThe same 64\u00d764\u00d763 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; world is generated every time the game is loaded. The only blocks in the game \u2013 &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bricks\"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 are scattered throughout the world. No &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s exist.\nThe initial build of the game only has one type of block, which uses a XOR fractal as a texture.\nAn invisible wall surrounds the world, preventing the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; from escaping, similar to &lt;a href=\"invisible%20bedrock\"&gt;invisible bedrock&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"old\"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; world.\nControls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can move around using standard controls, as well as jump using .\nLeft- and right-clicking controls are reversed from traditional \"Minecraft\" controls; left-click places &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and right-click destroys them. Middle-click also places blocks weirdly enough. Moving the mouse turns the camera \"smoothly,\" similar to the cinematic camera , and cannot be changed in this version.\nThe camera acts differently to \"Minecraft\"'s. The camera only moves when the player moves the cursor a considerably large distance away from the center of the game's . Blocks in the world are selected by the cursor, rather than the center of the viewport.\nThe game lacks any sort of options menu or HUD.\nGraphics.\nThe graphics appear pixelated as a result of the game rendering at a low resolution. Even when running at a higher resolution, the game does not scale the resolution properly and the noisy appearance is retained. &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; textures are similar to those used in &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Classic%200.30%20%28Creative%29\"&gt;Classic 0.30 (Creative)&lt;/a&gt; was the most recent version of \"Minecraft\" at the time. Most blocks appear noisier than their \"Minecraft\" counterparts, although some blocks, especially stone, are very different. The &lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt; is black due to the lack of a skybox.\nWhen hovering the cursor over a block, the outline of the block is thick and white, as opposed to \"Minecraft\"'s thin gray selection outline.\nBlocks.\nThe first version of the game has a single non-air block.\nIn the second version, block IDs are stored with four bits, resulting in 16 possible IDs. The majority of these are filled in by slightly differently textured dirt."}

In the game, players \"mine\" resource cards so they can be used to \"craft\" craft cards, which in turn can be used to \"craft\" tools to collect points.\nCards.\nA set of the \"Minecraft Card Game\" includes:\nA set of one hundred cards, split into two sets: resource cards and craft cards. Twenty-five of them are craft cards. The resource cards are split as follows:\nThere are also four card holders, in which one is to be used by each player.\nRules.\nThe objective of the game is to be the first player to earn the most points.\nSetup.\nShuffle all resource cards, and then deal them face down into five piles of fifteen cards each. Then, turn each pile over so that all cards in each pile are face up.\nNext, shuffle the craft cards and then deal them into four piles of six cards each, with the \"crafting\" side up. One card is left over, which is used for the discard pile.\nDiscard pile.\nCards are put into the discard pile if any of the following occur:\nActions.\nA player may perform two actions during their turn, even if they are the same action. Play proceeds to the next player once the other player has completed their actions. There are three types of actions a player can perform:\nMine.\nIf a player decides to mine a resource card, they are to take one resource card from the top of one of the five resource card piles.\nCraft.\nIf a player decides to craft, they trade in any resource cards they have available to acquire the respective craft card (e.g. if a player wishes to obtain a craft card with three diamond icons and two wood icons, they are to turn in their resource cards that are equivalent to two wood and three diamonds to \"craft\" it; however, if the player's resource cards don't match the required resources exactly, the player is allowed to \"overpay\" for the card, but is given nothing in return).\nEach craft card has a point value, which is used by the player for adding points. The tool associated with the craft card can also be used by the player during the game (see &lt;a href=\"%23Using%20tools\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt; for more info).\nReserve.\nIf a player desires a craft card but is unable to pay for it, they are allowed to place their card in \"Reserve\", which simply involves taking the craft card they want and placing it in their card holder. Then, when the player has mined the required resources, they are allowed to use an action on their turn to trade the resources in and get the card out of \"Reserve\", which is then placed with the player's other craft cards.\nUsing tools.\nEach tool a player \"crafts\" has a special power. A player may use the powers at any time, and using one does not count as an action. When a tool's power is used, the player is to flip the craft card face down to show that the tool was used. Points on the card are counted even if the tool is used. The tool can only be used once. The tool powers are as follows:\nEnd of the game.\nThe player who accumulates the required number of points wins, depending on the number of players:"}

Unlike \"Minecraft\", which is a sandbox, the game features a linear, story-driven campaign, and cinematics. The opening cinematic tells the story of an outcast Illager named Archie, who was rejected by all those who he met. One day, he stumbled upon a powerful artifact known as the \",\" which granted him great powers but also began to influence his decision making. The power-hungry \"\" then sought vengeance on all those who wronged him, and soon subjugated the world with his new army, raiding villages, forcing villagers to work as slave labor, and leaving only chaos behind. It's now up to the hero to stand up against the Arch-Illager's tyranny in order to defeat him and save the world.\nThe hero explores various locations in their quest to stop the Arch-Illager, fighting his army and completing quests in order to pass on to the next mission. Ultimately, they face the Arch-Illager in his castle, defeating him and shattering the Orb of Dominance in the process, which frees Archie from its influence. Afterward, they show kindness to Archie, much to his surprise, and together they celebrate that evil has been defeated and the world saved, though the Orb is later shown to be rebuilding itself.\nThe DLC packs continue the story as follows:\nDevelopment.\nThe game was announced at &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Earth%202018\"&gt;MINECON Earth 2018&lt;/a&gt;.

The game was about building structures and collecting materials by traveling to real-life locations. \"Minecraft Earth\" was released in closed beta on July 16, 2019, and gradually expanded its available countries over the rest of 2019, being released worldwide on December 11, 2019. The game received its final update, , on January 5, 2021, and was discontinued on June 30, 2021, due to restrictions on outdoor activities as a result of the . The next day, all players that had a remaining paid balance of &lt;a href=\"Rubies\"&gt;Rubies&lt;/a&gt; were given &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Minecoins&lt;/a&gt;, and players who purchased anything in the game received a copy of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; in return.\nDesign.\n\"Minecraft Earth\" was an \"adaptation\" of the traditional \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" experience to an augmented-reality setting, similarly to \"Ingress\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\". The game itself was built on the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; engine. It featured many unique gameplay aspects and similar interactions to the main game.\n\"Minecraft Earth\" required an Xbox Live account.\nThe game used Microsoft Azure Spatial Anchors along with OpenStreetMap to power location-based gameplay. The technology synced the position of buildplates in multi-player by referencing objects in the real world, creating a seamless experience.\nIt was announced that &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; were planned for \"Minecraft Earth\" in a future update, but these plans were scrapped due to the game being discontinued on June 30, 2021.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Minecraft Earth\", players were allowed to build structures with other players and \"place them in the real world at life-size\".\nIn the , players were allowed to see their character, which was able to be changed with skins owned from the marketplace or generated using the Character Creator. Scattered around the maps were . If a was within a player's collection range, the player could tap it and collect items. There were multiple types of tappables, including stone, grass, ponds, chests, and mobs.\nAdventures.\nAdventures appeared on the map but were also allowed to be spawned using Adventure Crystals. Adventures were the survival aspect of \"Minecraft Earth\". Players were allowed to fight mobs, collect additional resources that are unavailable with , and collect rewards. Adventures were only allowed to be played in life-size mode.\nBuildplates.\nBuildplates were worlds that players used to build on. They were shared remotely for viewing, and worked on by invited players in the same location.\nBuildplates were 8\u00d78, 16\u00d716 or 32\u00d732 blocks in size, and their build height limit was 221 blocks. From ground level, a buildplate also extended downward in varying depth, depending on the buildplate. The minimum depth before bedrock appeared after digging down was 3 blocks and the buildplate with the maximum recorded depth was 12 blocks\nUsing the shop, players were allowed to buy new plots using . Plots were also earned via a leveling system.\nBuildplates functioned like personal realms and were used anywhere. They ran in the Bedrock Engine, meaning redstone, physics, and other mechanics were identical to \"Bedrock Edition\". Players were allowed to invite friends to build with them locally and then share the world to others via a link.\nA player was allowed to interact with a buildplate in miniature and life-size modes. In miniature mode, the buildplate functioned the same as &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; mode in Minecraft, allowing the player to build structures and populate the buildplate with mobs. In life-size mode, the buildplate functioned the same as &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, in which the player must use tools to interact with blocks. Hostile mobs on the buildplate attacked the player, and the player could lose health and life.\nA planned feature for buildplates that was announced but never implemented was the ability to pin buildplates on the map for other players to view its publicly.\nBuildplates were also allowed to be shared via a link, so players didn't need to be in the same location as the creator to see creations. The links shared were either temporary or never expiring. Mojang Studios claimed to have a 24/7 moderation team, reviewing and looking at reports of inappropriate builds.\n had their own buildplates, with predefined above-ground and underground structures and hostile mobs. Like user buildplates, an adventure plate was only allowed to be placed somewhere on the ground before interacting with it. Adventure buildplates weren't able to be saved or moved by a player although multiple players were allowed to interact with the same adventure at the same time.\nChallenges.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, challenges were tasks given to player to guide the player. Unlike &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;s, there were 3 types of challenges: Daily, Seasonal, and Tappable challenges. These challenges involved individual tasks; the player obtained rubies, experience, and credit after completing. For example, if player's task is to collect 6 ferns, and another challenge is to collect 4 ferns, and the player gets 2 ferns, it would apply to both tasks.\nGameplay differences from regular \"Minecraft\".\n\"Minecraft Earth\" offered somewhat different mechanics to players more familiar with \"Java\" or Bedrock editions of \"Minecraft\". These differences included:\nOther differences:\nMicrotransactions.\nThe game had full microtransactions.\nThe in game currency was \"\", which was not to be confused with \"Minecoins\".\nRubies were used to:\n\"Minecoins\" were also used as a secondary currency in \"Minecraft Earth\", for purchasing skins and clothing.\nIn , the final update to \"Minecraft Earth\", all microtransactions had been removed in preparation for the game's shutting down on June 30, 2021.\nDevelopment.\nDuring Microsoft Build 2015, Microsoft's HoloLens team unveiled an augmented reality version of \"Minecraft\", internally codenamed \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Genoa\"&gt;Minecraft Genoa&lt;/a&gt;\". On May 6, 2019, Microsoft released a video on , where some features from \"Minecraft Earth\" were shown. On May 8, 2019, a trailer was released, showing some AR mods in \"Minecraft Earth\". On \"Minecraft\"'s 10th anniversary (May 17, 2019), \"Minecraft Earth\" was officially announced.\nMusic.\nMinecraft Earth (Original Game Soundtrack) is the soundtrack released for \"Minecraft Earth\", featuring compositions by Shauny Jang, which features all of the music exclusive to the game. The soundtrack was released on February 19, 2021. These tracks were also used as music for the &lt;a href=\"Mob%20Vote%202022%20Server%20Event\"&gt;Mob Vote 2022 Server Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelease.\nClosed beta.\niOS and iPadOS.\nThe closed beta for \"Minecraft Earth\" was launched for AR-compatible devices running iOS and iPadOS in the cities listed below.\nAndroid.\nThe closed beta for \"Minecraft Earth\" was launched for AR-compatible devices running Android in the same five cities the iOS closed beta was launched in.\nEarly access.\nThe early access of \"Minecraft Earth\" was launched for everyone to download in the and in the countries listed below.\nDiscontinuation.\nOn January 5, 2021, Mojang Studios released the final update to \"Minecraft Earth\", , and announced that the game's servers would be taken offline after June 30, 2021, citing the current global situation. On that day, the game was removed from the respective app stores. Players who open the app after that date are greeted with this message, which includes a link to information about the shutdown:\nReturning players who logged in before the discontinuation received an exclusive &lt;a href=\"Character%20creator\"&gt;Character creator&lt;/a&gt; \u201cHero\u201d outfit set. Moreover, any returning player who had a remaining paid ruby balance before the shutdown would receive a free copy of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Minecraft: Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nSystem requirements.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20201205060718/https%3A//help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360033744412-Minecraft-Earth-FAQs\"&gt;the FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;:"}

It was created on November 16, 2015.\nAbout.\nHour of Code is focused on introducing basic programming skills in a simple, accessible way. It was created by Mojang Studios and Microsoft.\nThe Minecraft Hour of Code takes about 1 hour to complete and will introduce the player to programming logic like Repeat Loops and If Statements.\nThe tutorial is designed for ages six and up, and the player can choose to play as either Steve or Alex. It does not need to be downloaded or installed, and it is completely free.\nGameplay.\nThe player can pick one of four scenarios. First, the player will have the option to watch a short video, and then the player will be able to begin. In each scenario, there is an objective for the player to complete in order to complete the first level. There are 12 - 14 levels in each scenario, which are more complex the higher the level. The final level is always a freestyle level, in which the player can do whatever they want.\nScenarios.\nThere are four scenarios in Minecraft Hour of Code: \"Minecraft Adventurer\", \"Minecraft Designer\", \"Minecraft: Hero's Journey\", and \"Minecraft: Voyager Aquatic\".\nIn \"Minecraft Adventurer\", the player must perform certain actions that interact with the world around them, such as shearing a sheep, planting crops, or building a house. This scenario has 14 levels.\nIn \"Minecraft Designer\", the player must perform an action on a mob, or have the mob perform an action, in order to complete the level. In higher levels, the player has to spawn mobs in a certain way. This scenario has 12 levels.\nIn \"Minecraft: Hero's Journey\", there is an agent at every level. The player can program the agent to help Steve / Alex in the levels. For example, in the first level, the game tells the player how to move the agent to a pressure plate, which will open an iron door for Steve / Alex, so that he/ she can escape from a tiny house that he's in. This scenario has 12 levels.\nIn \"Minecraft: Voyage Aquatic\", the player must perform actions that revolve around underwater ruins. This scenario has 12 levels."}

The legend itself tells of a great hero who saved the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; by uniting every mob against an invasion by the ravenous before their &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; corruption devours the Overworld and everything with it.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay of \"Minecraft Legends\" is that of a real-time strategy game. While strategy is the core of the game, some of its mechanics were inspired by action games. In the game, the player takes on the third person perspective of a great hero who must defend settlements &amp; villages, create outposts, make allies with mobs, and fight hordes of to stop the spread of the Nether corruption. The game allows the player character to direct and give directions to allies. The game includes random world generation that is different from \"Minecraft\" with mobs and biomes. The player character\u2019s primary objective is to gather resources in the world to build defenses against the piglins. The game supports multiplayer gameplay with up to 8 players, 4 on each team, where they can either challenge other player characters for a battle or team up to defeat opponents.\n\"Minecraft Legends\" began first as an idea before Mojang Studios decided to collaborate with a Vancouver-based studio called &lt;a href=\"Blackbird%20Interactive\"&gt;Blackbird Interactive&lt;/a&gt; (who also developed \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Earth\"&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/a&gt;\") to develop the game as a \"Minecraft\" strategy game. In Minecraft Legends, maps are made procedurally. Land and resources must be used to beat the opposing team.\nBosses.\nMinecraft Legends has a total of 4 bosses. 3 of them appear after you clear all of the bases of each horde, and one appears after you defeat the other three. They are:\n is a boss enemy and the leader of . It can be fought after all of the Horde of the Hunt bases are destroyed. It is very fast and highly destructive with it tearing through structures. Sometimes at night, it will launch an attack on a random village.\n is a boss enemy and the leader of the . It has lots of overgrowth and fungi growths coming off its body and resemble that of a zombie-like life form. It can be fought after all of the Horde of the Spore bases are destroyed.\n is a boss enemy and the leader of the . It can be fought after all of the Horde of the Bastion bases are destroyed. The Unbreakable is a large Piglin with lots of gold trimming, including a golden Mohawk, shoulder guard, and gauntlet. It also carries a large pack on its back which acts as a flamethrower. It also has an iron jaw. \n is the final boss enemy of Minecraft Legends and the leader of all three Piglin hordes. It can be fought after all of the hordes are defeated. This boss will appear at The Well of Fate. It has red skin, a magic weapon in one hand, a spear in the other. Defeating it will complete the game and will result in all remaining piglins and their structures disappearing.\nPurchase and availability.\nThe \"Standard Edition\" of the game is available for 39.99 (49.49, 39.69, 34.99, 49.45, 59.90, 56.85).

She then introduces the teams and informs them that they have to reach a target, get the most points, and defeat the other teams to win a grand prize of whatever they want. The teams then work to build shelter before sunset, yet only a few teams are successful. Team Tundra attempts to build a shelter, but they are cornered by hostile mobs, and are forced to make shelter inside a cliff. Team Mesa digs a hole in the ground to avoid being killed by zombies. Team Stone Beach builds a ladder to an opening in a cliff. Team Mooshroom takes shelter inside a giant mushroom, and Team Woodland (as they are hostile mobs) makes no shelter at all. Team Mesa wins the challenge and is rewarded a set of golden tools.\nEpisode 2: The Abandoned Mineshaft.\n The teams then work to build their camp, in which they are successful. The teams then go into an abandoned mineshaft, and are informed that the team with the most gold will win the most prizes. Teams Stone Beach and Mooshroom run into some cave spiders, and they barely make it out alive. Teams Mesa, Tundra, and Woodland come across a huge amount of gold over a lava pit. Team Tundra begins making a bridge, Team Mesa splits off, with River going around the pit, and Durango attempting to jump over it. Team Woodland summons numerous Vexes to help them fly over the pit, but is then eliminated after the vindicator falls into lava. Team Tundra wins the challenge and are rewarded fishing rods. In 2nd place, Team Mesa is rewarded with a painting of a fish. CommuniKate then blows up the camp, and the remaining teams use their boats to swim over to Eerie Island.\nEpisode 3: The Well Wisher.\n The teams make it to Eerie Island and build camp. The teams are then surrounded by hostile animals, but find shelter underground. The teams then go down a well which is inhabited by an evil spirit, and are informed that they have to fit four different types of items into item frames without repeating any items, while attempting to avoid being eaten by the evil spirit. Team Stone Beach wins the challenge and are rewarded a jukebox with music discs.\nEpisode 4: The Sham.\n The teams build a treehouse in the jungle. The teams are then informed that they have to complete a challenge: Use the beds to collect the feathers on the slime blocks. Team Tundra wins the challenge and are rewarded diamonds. CommuniKate blows up the treehouse, and Team Mooshroom is eliminated after CommuniKate alleges that Mo sacrificed herself (it is revealed later, however, that Mo was hiding underground). The remaining teams use their boats to swim over to Scatter Island.\nEpisode 5: The Ender Cave.\n The teams make it to Scatter Island, which is home to numerous endermen, and are informed that they have to kill the endermen and collect their pearls (a total of ten). Team Stone Beach then goes up against \u201cThe Enderal\u201d, but come out victorious, win the challenge, and are rewarded with two bread, two pumpkin pie, and two cooked chicken, which they split upon the remaining teams. It is also revealed that Mo is alive and in hiding.\nEpisode 6: The Challenge of Ice and Magma.\n CommuniKate blows up the shelter and the teams go to higher ground, eventually making it to a snow biome. The teams are then informed that they have to cross a frozen lake, and then create a snow golem in order to win the challenge. Mo informs Quinn that the other players (who had been previously eliminated) are prisoners on the final island (later revealed to be Arena Island), and Quinn thinks this is a good opportunity to expose CommuniKate. Quinn, Durango, and River take the detour on the frozen lake to obtain Frost Walker boots, which they use to their advantage in creating a snow golem. Team Tundra is eliminated after Sacha dies from stepping on magma blocks. Quinn attempts to use a ender pearl to her advantage, but CommuniKate considers that to be cheating. Team Mesa wins the challenge and are rewarded a dozen steaks, which they split with Team Stone Beach. The teams then use their boats to swim over to Arena Island, while Quinn looks for an opportunity to get to CommuniKate\u2019s codebook.\nEpisode 7: The Desert Maze.\n The teams make it to Arena Island, and are shown the obsidian cube that players go to when they are eliminated. CommuniKate then shows that the obsidian can\u2019t be broken, but Toby realizes that obsidian can be broken with a diamond pickaxe. The teams are then informed that they have to go through a desert maze, with splash potions hidden through to aid them. Mo sneakily gives Quinn a book on chickens. Team Stone Beach uses splash potions of harming and leaping to their advantage, while Team Mesa uses splash potions of swiftness and strength. Team Stone Beach wins the challenge and are given five points, having a 16-12 lead over Team Mesa.\nEpisode 8: The Finale.\n The teams enter the Nether, and are informed that they have to make it to the portal on the other side while avoiding zombie pigmen, blazes and ghasts. Before the challenge can begin, the teams go back through the nether portal, with CommuniKate following pursuit. Toby reveals that he swapped the codebook with the book on chickens, and CommuniKate summons iron golems in anger. Nonetheless, the teams (including teams that have been previously eliminated) get the upper hand, trap the iron golems in cobwebs, and also trap CommuniKate and Zed in obsidian. Toby begins to send the teams home, but CommuniKate breaks free, thanks to an enchanted diamond pickaxe. Unbeknownst to Team Mesa and Team Stone Beach, CommuniKate sent them to a \u201csurprise location\u201d, which is to be revealed \u201cnext season\u201d."}

Then, Poseidon spawns the teams that were eliminated from the first season on top of sand pillars above water. Quinn tries to save them, but is stopped by the Kraken.

Zed creates a barricade of lava, and they make it to a room containing a chest, but are cornered by Medusa.

Quinn is about to get trapped in stone, but CommuniKate uses her mirror to get Medusa trapped in stone, allowing the group to obtain the first ender eye.

Theseus explains that Poseidon is using the group for his own glory, but scurries off out of fear that Poseidon may be eavesdropping.

Eventually, the group defeat it and obtain the second ender eye. As Poseidon sends the group to their next location, Theseus meets with the eliminated players and explains that he is working on a plan to free them.\nEpisode 4: Clash in the Canal.\n The teams are sent to a canal, but CommuniKate realizes the sun is setting, and plans to have the night off.

Zed then changes his mind and goes along with Quinn as Durango and CommuniKate unsuccessfully attempt to build a shelter. Quinn and Zed come across a cave containing a chest, but are met by a Harpy. Durango and CommuniKate arrive, with Durango using a fishing rod to hold the Harpy in place from its foot. The group obtain the third ender eye, but Poseidon interrupts them and tells them to make haste. Quinn realizes that River and Toby are missing, and Poseidon realizes that Theseus has made the two escape.\nEpisode 5: Stagecraft.\n River and Toby are teleported to a theater by Theseus, with the rest of the group following soon after. They are greeted by Chimera, who has the group go through three events: improvisation, mine &amp; movement, and acting. Although Chimera wins at both improvisation and mine &amp; movement, CommuniKate excels at acting, allowing the group to obtain the fourth ender eye. Poseidon is mad at Theseus about River and Toby escaping, and decides to keep a close eye on him as the \u201cshow\u201d is almost over. Poseidon then sends the group to their next location, a labyrinth.\nEpisode 6: Maze of the Minotaur.\n The group make it through the labyrinth, with Zed mining underground and Durango using the creepers to make a shortcut. Eventually, the group make it to the end of the labyrinth, but not before being met by Minotaur, Cerberus, and Cyclops. As the group gets ready to fight them, Zed mines the blocks from below, making the Minotaur and Cyclops fall toward certain death, while Cerberus retreats. The group obtain the fifth ender eye, but Poseidon steals them all in order to make him more powerful than Zeus and teleports the players onto a sand tower to be fed to the Kraken.\nEpisode 7: The Kraken Attacks!\n Poseidon reveals that the eyes of ender make a portal to the Overworld, which is where he plans to use his powers. Quinn questions as to why Poseidon couldn\u2019t get the ender eyes himself, and he replies that the chests that held them were created by Zeus, and thus couldn\u2019t be opened by Greek gods. Theseus realizes that he was wrong to have Poseidon defy Zeus, so he steals an ender eye to destroy the portal. While Poseidon chases after Theseus, River and Toby throw fish to distract the Kraken, allowing the players to get to safety. The players and Poseidon fight over the final ender eye, but Poseidon gets the last laugh and obtains it. Durango attempts to use the trident to turn him into a chicken, but the trident turns out to be a dud. Theseus explains that Poseidon isn\u2019t a Greek god, but is actually mortal. Poseidon reveals that he has a trident made out of command blocks, and uses it to make something that destroys the players.\nEpisode 8: Poseidon\u2019s Last Play.\n Poseidon uses the command blocks to make a Phoenix, but despawns it after Durango begins riding it. Poseidon and Theseus have a duel with two raw fish, and Theseus explains to Quinn that the command blocks have a self-destruct code. After a few attempts with CommuniKate, they are successful in entering it, and run for cover just as the trident erupts. Poseidon attempts to use the eyes of ender again, but Zeus arrives and uses his lightning bolt (powered by command blocks) to steal them from him. Zeus explains that he found out about Poseidon\u2019s plan by binge-watching the entire series, and allows the players to return home. However, he also offers a show in which \u201cthose need [the players\u2019] help.\u201d"}

It dramatically affected gameplay, such as the availability of water, sand and gravel. The further the player traveled toward the end of the map, the slower they moved. \nThere were four kinds of map types:\nWorld shape and size.\nThe map shape refers to the general dimensions the level generator used to create maps. It was added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31%2020100106\"&gt;Indev 0.31 20100106&lt;/a&gt; and it altered the length, width, and height of the map.\nThere were three kinds of shapes:\nThere were three kinds of sizes:\nWorld themes.\nThe map theme refers to the general style the level generator used to create maps. It dramatically affected game mechanics, such as monster spawn zones and boundary liquid. These themes were comparable to biomes in Alpha, Beta and current \"Minecraft\" versions.\nNormal.\n\"Normal\" was the default map theme. Above ground, one would find sporadic trees and generally favorable space. The weather was constantly partly cloudy, and the lengths of night and day were equal. Underground, ores of all types could be found and lava was generally found near the &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; layer. The boundary liquid was water.\nHell.\n\"Hell\" was the second map theme introduced within the map theme feature. Hell featured significantly less &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;ing during the day, where &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s of all types would spawn at any time. All water was replaced with lava, grass was replaced with &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and grass would spawn in place of sand only during map generation. Mushrooms were abundant on the surface. &lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt; worked at a much slower rate (one plant stage per day cycle). This map theme was comparable to the later added &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The boundary liquid was lava.\nParadise.\nThe third map theme, \"Paradise\", was more relaxed than the other themes. It featured larger beaches and plentiful flora compared to the \"Normal\" theme, and the time is always set to \"Noon\" (the sun never sets); hostile mobs spawn only underground. Farming works at a much faster rate (from planting to harvestable in 30\u201345 minutes). The boundary liquid was water.\nWoods.\nThe fourth map theme, \"Woods\", was a middle-ground of challenge between \"Normal\" and \"Hell\". It provided constant overcast during the day that reduces light, and tree density was higher than the other themes, resulting in the land space becoming smaller. Additionally, mushrooms were spotty throughout the above-ground areas. The boundary liquid was water."}

Silverfish hide in these blocks, and emerge when a nearby silverfish is attacked in order to attack the aggressor. Infested blocks cannot be obtained in item form.\nObtaining.\nInfested blocks are not obtainable by &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, and are only available through the Creative inventory or &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;. However, they can be &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Obtaining%20discontinued%20blocks%20and%20items%23Blocks\"&gt;retained from worlds played in versions where they were legitimately obtainable.&lt;/a&gt;\nBreaking.\nWhen the block is broken, whether by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or by an &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; spawns where it was broken unless the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is Peaceful or the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 is set to codice_2 (codice_3 is irrelevant).\nInfested blocks take less time to break than their normal counterparts. When breaking them with a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, they take half as much time to break as their normal counterparts.\nWhen mined with anything other than a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted tool, an infested block drops nothing and spawns a silverfish that immediately attacks the player. If the player attacks a silverfish directly with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion of Harming&lt;/a&gt;, or when a silverfish takes &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; damage, nearby infested blocks break, spawning more aggressive silverfish. If the silverfish is killed in one hit, then nearby infested blocks do not break, and no silverfish spawn from them.\nWhen mined with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, however, the equivalent non-infested block is dropped without spawning a silverfish on all game difficulties. Any Silk Touch-enchanted &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s) will cause an infested block to drop its non-infested equivalent (that is, a pickaxe is not required). A player wishing to collect &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; safely should use Silk Touch-enchanted pickaxes.\nNatural generation.\nInfested stone bricks are occasionally found in &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basements in place of normal stone bricks. Infested mossy and chiseled stone bricks also spawn in igloos, but they do not generate naturally in strongholds.\nInfested &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; is found in the rarely generated &lt;a href=\"Woodland_Mansion%23Rooms\"&gt;\"End portal\" room&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nInfested &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt; can generate in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Ore%20%28feature%29\"&gt;blob&lt;/a&gt;s. Infested blocks attempt to generate 14 times per &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; in ore features of size 0-13, from &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;s -64 to 63 or 0 to 64 , within one of the following &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, or within a chunk that is at least partially occupied by one of these biomes:\nInfested stone blob can replace &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, polished andesite\u200c, polished diorite\u200c, polished granite\u200c, &lt;a href=\"tuff\"&gt;tuff&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt;. If it replaces tuff or deepslate, it becomes infested deepslate.\nPost-generation.\nInfested blocks are generated when a &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; enters the respective normal block form.\nUsage.\nWhen mined, an infested block spawns a silverfish that immediately attacks the player. If the player attacks a &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; directly with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Harming\"&gt;potion of Harming&lt;/a&gt;, or when a silverfish takes poison damage, nearby infested blocks break, spawning more aggressive silverfish. If the silverfish is killed in one hit, then nearby infested blocks do not break, and no silverfish spawn from them.\nIdentifying.\n&lt;a href=\"Note%20block\"&gt;Note block&lt;/a&gt;s placed on infested blocks produce flute sounds or harp sounds, while those placed on the non-infested stone, cobblestone, or stone bricks produce bass drum sounds.\n, a player can distinguish infested from normal blocks by observing that an infested block takes a bit faster to break when using a pickaxe than the stone it appears to be, but without a pickaxe, it still breaks faster.\nA silverfish does not spawn if the block is destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\n, using the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;, a player can identify whether or not a block is infested."}

{"id": "1348", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1348", "title": "Infiniminer", "text": "Infiniminer is an open source multiplayer block-based sandbox building and digging game, inspired by the games \"Infinifrag\", \"Team Fortress 2\", and \"Motherload\", in which the player plays as a miner searching for minerals by carving tunnels through procedurally generated block-based maps and building structures. \"Infiniminer\" is commonly associated with \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" for giving &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Persson\"&gt;Markus Persson (Notch)&lt;/a&gt; the idea for where to go with \"Minecraft\", and is often regarded as a direct forerunner.\nHistory.\n\"Infiniminer\" was developed by Zach Barth of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.zachtronics.com/\"&gt;Zachtronics Industries&lt;/a&gt; with the help of his friend Chris Gengler in their spare time, and released in steps of incremental updates during late April and early May of 2009. It quickly garnered a following on message boards around the internet, and inspired Notch to start working on \"Minecraft\" shortly after it was discontinued.\nLike \"Minecraft\", \"Infiniminer\" is a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;-based mining and construction game. Players can play on one of two teams, Red or Blue, as one of four classes: Miner, Prospector, Engineer, or Sapper. Each class has their own set of abilities, tools, and blocks they can build with, with each costing a certain amount of metal ore to place. Many building blocks are team-colored, and most exist to serve a specific function rather than being purely decorative. Players and tools are represented by flat sprites rather than three-dimensional objects. The sky is perpetually dark, and the landscape is made up entirely of bare &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; blocks which flow similarly to liquids in \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"classic\"&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt;. The maps are limited in size, and walking off the edge or digging through the bottom causes the player to fall into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; and die.\n\"Infiniminer\" was originally intended to be played as a team-based competitive game, where the goal is to locate and excavate precious materials such as &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, and bring the findings to the surface to earn points for one's team, until the winning team reaches a certain amount of points. However, as the game gained popularity, many players decided it was much more fun to build things than to compete for points.\nZachtronics discontinued development of the game less than a month after its first release, after a major source leak was discovered due to the developers forgetting to obfuscate a new release, which allowed players to make unauthorized modifications to the game. Soon, there were players using modified clients to cheat on servers, and multiple communities arose each with different versions of the game, and it was hard for the developers to maintain \"Infiniminer\", resulting in further development ceasing and the game becoming open source. In 2015, the Google cloud server for the game was shut down, making the server browser nonfunctional, but direct connection to servers is still possible. The game is still available for download, and the source code of \"Infiniminer\" is available under the MIT License. Building \"Infiniminer\" requires Visual Studio 2008 and XNA Game Studio 3.0. Infiniminer is also included in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.zachtronics.com/zach-like/\"&gt;Zach-Like&lt;/a&gt;, a Zachtronics book and game bundle.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt;, \"Infiniminer\" was \"the game I wanted to do\". Notch enjoyed the game, but found it flawed, noting that while building was fun, there wasn\u2019t enough variation, and he thought that the big red and blue team-colored blocks were \"pretty horrible\". He believed that a fantasy game in that style \"would work really really well\", so he created a simple first-person engine in the \"Infimininer\" style, reusing some art and code from multiple earlier projects, to create the &lt;a href=\"cave%20game%20tech%20test\"&gt;cave game tech test&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually go on to become \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

It is available to download from the &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for free. It was released on November 13th, 2018.\nThe world is intended to serve as a tutorial to teach players how to play the game in &lt;a href=\"Creative%20Mode\"&gt;Creative Mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThis world is intended to be played in Creative Mode. Players begin in a small room preceding a long hall with several chambers beside it. The game tells the players to walk forward and uses a &lt;a href=\"Sign\"&gt;Sign&lt;/a&gt; to inform them about tutorial text and challenges.\nThe Signs inform players on how to use the Mine and Place buttons with different control schemes. A brick wall is provided to allow players to practice mining, while two &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;Chest&lt;/a&gt;s containing &lt;a href=\"Concrete\"&gt;Concrete&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Written%20Book\"&gt;Written Book&lt;/a&gt;s are provided to allow players to practice placing blocks and read the entire control schemes. Along the chambers lining the sides of the hall, there are &lt;a href=\"Button\"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Lever\"&gt;Lever&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Tripwire%20Hook\"&gt;Tripwire Hook&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn different mobs inside the chambers.\nAt the end of the hall, there is flowing &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; blocking the door. Text appears informing players that it can be safely crossed in Creative Mode. Beyond it, there is another room, which has a set of tall steps. Signs on the steps inform players about using Flying to cross them. After these, players can leave the room through an opening near the ceiling by flying up.\nAt the top, a brick wall seals the exit; it can be mined instantly. The rest of Inspiration Island is now accessible, with a set of colored buildings surrounding the location of the main tutorial; each one shows a unique feature.\nBeyond the town, there is a map showing the entirety of the world and the locations that players can visit. Behind it, an unfinished house and garden are present, intended for players to complete; both are next to Chests containing items that can be used to do so.\nAlso surrounding the area is a line of purple lamps; five secrets must be found across Inspiration Island to light these up.

When broken, the item would inherit the exact metadata that the block had, rather than be converted into one of the four valid states. This can be done from Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 onwards.\nThe bug allowing for this was fixed in 12w49a, making invalid data value leaves unobtainable from this version onwards.\nIn summary:\nWhen placing leaves for the latter two cases, it is recommended that valid data value leaves are placed, as the placement of invalid data value leaves has not been fully researched.\nUsage.\nPlacement.\nIn 14w11b, placed invalid data value leaves will always place leaves that do not decay. Leaves items with damage 4, 5, 6 and 7 will place leaves with metadata 4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively. Similarly, items with damage 12, 13, 14 and 15 will place blocks with metadata 12, 13, 14 and 15. Items with damage 8, 9, 10 and 11 will respectively place blocks with metadata 12, 13, 14 and 15.\nConversion to future versions.\nIn 1.13 (17w47a) onwards, distinguishing between block and item variants using metadata and damage was formally abolished. As a result of this, existing items would be converted over to the new ID system automatically. Invalid data value leaves behave anomalously in that instead of converting to their respective parent species, they all convert to oak leaves instead. Despite these items often being unknowingly collected and stored in older versions in such a way that conversion like this would end up being undesirable, Mojang have decided to not fix this.\nNomenclature.\nLeaves items with data values higher than 3, particularly oak leaves with a damage value of 4, are often referred to as \"alpha leaves\". This is a particularly egregious misnomer, as any of the twelve extreme data values can be obtained in versions as late as 1.4.5, with absolutely no involvement from Alpha or even Beta versions of the game. How exactly this specific term reached common usage remains unknown, although it may be tied to the existence of \"alpha trees\", in which trees generated or grown before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.2\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.2&lt;/a&gt; would be comprised of multiple species of leaves if upgraded to this version or beyond, as metadata which was previously reserved for &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20leaf%20decay\"&gt;leaf decay&lt;/a&gt; was now used for distinguishing different species of leaves from each other.\nSimilarly confusingly, &lt;a href=\"petrified%20oak%20slab\"&gt;petrified oak slab&lt;/a&gt;s are sometimes referred to as \"alpha slabs\", despite the fact that the block was introduced in Beta 1.3, several months after the end of the Alpha era of the game.\nIssues.\nInvalid data value leaves \"are\" an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed."}

These blocks can be mined from Beta 1.3 to 12w08a to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.\nIf a large quantity is desired, transmuting double slabs is recommended as this allows for slabs to be converted twice as fast.\nBreaking upper slabs ().\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.6.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.6.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, breaking slabs which were placed in the upper half of a block space would drop an invalid data value slab item, corresponding to the top-half slab which had just been broken.\nUsage.\nPlacement.\nFrom the January 31, 2010 Indev release up to Beta 1.2_02, damage on slab items would not indicate that the item should place a block with additional metadata, and as such a normal smooth stone slab would be placed regardless of the damage on the item.\nFrom Beta 1.3 up to 14w27b, invalid data value stone slabs would place a slab block with metadata matching the item's damage. From Beta 1.3 up to 12w08a, this would be a lower-half &lt;a href=\"Seamless%20Stone%20Slab\"&gt;seamless stone slab&lt;/a&gt;, as the metadata variants of stone slabs from 8 to 15 were unused, and upper-half slabs were yet to be implemented. From 1.2 up to 14w27b, due to the implementation of upper slabs, this would result in the item placing an upper-half slab, regardless of how the supporting block is targeted.\nInvalid data value stone slab items could also be used to create double slab blocks for placed slabs of the same material, however were more restricted in their ability to do so; in order to yield a completed double slab, the top face of a lower slab or bottom face of an upper slab must be targeted. Targeting the side or other face of another block in ways that allow for completion when using valid items does not work for invalid data value slabs. In addition, the space above the lower-half slab or under the uper-half slab must be either air or a replaceable block; any block that cannot be directly replaced will block the double slab from being completed.\nFrom 14w28a to 17w46a, invalid data value slabs now place either a bottom-half or top-half slab depending on the targeted half of a block, like valid slab items. However, their behavior with regard to completing double slabs from earlier versions still persists until an unknown version before 17w43a.\nConversion to future versions.\nIn 1.13 (17w47a) onwards, distinguishing between block and item variants using metadata and damage was formally abolished.

The data value of vines dropped would correspond to the data value of the block it came from, allowing 15 different variations to be obtained, while also rendering the default item with data value 0 completely unobtainable due to it corresponding to a vines block with no connections. The \"up\" state is ignored due to not being determined by metadata. As multiple vines cannot be manually placed into the same space in this version, they should instead be positioned above each other and given time to grow into a block space corresponding to the desired data value.\nFrom Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 onwards, breaking vines would always return an item with damage value 0, rendering invalid data values unobtainable.\nStacking.\nAs vines as an item do not track their damage value for any purpose, invalid data value vines can be created by picking up dropped normal vines with an incomplete stack of invalid data value vines already in the inventory, as well as merging together existing item stacks. This can also result in invalid data value vines being converted to non-anomalous vines in the same way, and therefore care should be taken when transporting such items.

Wool with a damage value of 0 is white, and white wool's texture is located above this rectangle somewhat, and the game's code regards a damage value of 0 as a special case. However, if a wool item with a metadata value of \u00b116, \u00b132, \u00b148, \u00b164, ... is obtained as an item, which cannot be done in normal Survival gameplay or in Creative without commands, the game does not special-case these values due to them not being intentionally obtainable, resulting in this sixteenth texture in the rectangle being selected as the item's texture.\nIn Beta 1.9's development, the then-new nether wart required a texture to be used in-game. Where exactly a texture is in &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; is ultimately arbitrary, as the game's code can be made to point at any desired region. Ultimately, the textures used by nether wart were placed at a position in &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; which resulted in the first stage's texture being within the 2\u00d78 rectangle used by most wool items, resulting in the invalid cases using the newly-planted nether wart texture as if it were any other texture.\nPlacement.\nWhen placed, invalid data value wool will place normal white wool blocks. As these placed blocks are proper white wool, they will drop white wool when broken, rather than invalid data values of wool.\nIssues.\nInvalid data value wool items \"are\" an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed."}

Held armor can be equipped by it, exchanging it with any armor already occupying that slot.\nItems have tooltips if the cursor is hovered over them, displaying their name, &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s, lore, and some item-specific information such as the version of a &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Debug%20screen%23More%20debug-keys\"&gt;Pressing&lt;/a&gt; causes items to display additional information, such as their &lt;a href=\"Data%20values\"&gt;ID, data values&lt;/a&gt;, and some item specific information.\nPressing on a block with an inventory, such as a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; opens its GUI and allow items to be transferred between the 27 main slots, the 9 hotbar slots, and the block's GUI.\nThe only available slots for setting attributes are \"mainhand\", \"offhand\", \"head\", \"chest\", \"legs\", and \"feet\".\nRecipe book.\nThe recipe book is a mechanic in \"Minecraft\" that serves as a catalog of &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s and as a &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; guide. It shows every crafting recipe that the player has had materials for.\nCrafting recipes are organized in several different categories, as follows:\nIn Bedrock Edition, the tabs are:\nManaging inventory.\nStacks can be grabbed by pressing left-click on the stack and split by pressing right-click. If the stack is an odd quantity, then it leaves the smaller half (for example, a stack of 7 leaves 3 items in the slot and grabs 4). Conversely, while holding a stack of items in the inventory, left-clicking places the full stack in the slot, and right-clicking place just one item. Double-clicking an item grabs up to a full stack from all the items within the inventory.\nHolding and clicking on the item sends the item from the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s hotbar to the main 27 slots, or vice versa. Doing so, while a block's inventory (chest, dispenser, etc.) is open, sends the item stack immediately from the player's inventory into the block that they have open or vice versa. Holding and double-clicking a stack moves all items of that kind between the player's inventory and the block, or their inventory and their hotbar. However, the player's cursor must already be holding an item for this to work. The item held is irrelevant.\nPressing \u2013 switches the item hovered over with the cursor with the item in that slot of the hotbar, or moves the item from one to the other if either slot is empty.\nHowever pressing does a similar thing but only affects the &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; slot.\nWhile an item stack is grabbed, dragging items around with the left mouse button divides the stack equally over the dragged-over slots (with the remainder staying on the cursor), while dragging item stacks around with the right mouse button places one of that stack in each dragged-over slot. Regardless of which mouse button is used (left or right), this occurs only if the slot is empty or contains the same item being dragged.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, middle-clicking an item grabs a full stack of the item while leaving the item in the slot, and dragging items with the middle mouse button places a full stack of the item in each dragged-over slot.\nPressing + (hold down while pressing ) in Creative mode saves the current toolbar in the \"Saved Toolbars\" tab. It can be loaded with +.\nPressing while the cursor is hovering over an item in the inventory or a container drops one item. Holding and pressing while hovering over a slot in the inventory or container that has one or more items drops the entire stack of items. While venturing without the full inventory open, the same can be applied for the selected item(s) from the hotbar. Items can also be dropped into the world by clicking outside the inventory window while holding an item with the cursor.\nCreative inventory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, the inventory contains all of the blocks and items from Survival mode, and a few more (such as &lt;a href=\"spawn%20eggs\"&gt;spawn eggs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;). The player can pick up blocks from here to use endlessly. In the search tab found above the Creative inventory, players can search for the items they want to use. If the \"Operator Items Tab\" option in the controls menu is enabled, the creative inventory will show operator items (like command blocks and barriers) in a separate tab. Wither and ender dragon spawn eggs are not obtainable in the Creative inventory.\n\"Java Edition\".\nA single item can be grabbed also can be used by pressing shift 4 times in a row using left-click, increasing with continued left-clicks on that item. Left or right-clicking with an item or stack of items while hovering over any item other than the one held gets rid of the held item. Right-clicking an item also picks up one item, but the second click then puts it back down as opposed to picking up more. Shift-clicking an item grabs a full stack of items. Pressing a number key while hovering over an item instantly places one full stack of that item into the hotbar slot that corresponds with the number.\nThe Creative inventory screen is sorted into 11 sections: \"Building Blocks\", \"Colored Blocks\", \"Natural Blocks\", \"Functional Blocks\", \"Redstone Blocks\", \"Tools &amp; Utilities\", \"Combat\", \"Food &amp; Drinks\", \"Ingredients\", \"Spawn Eggs\", and \"Operator Utilities\". The latter tab is only available if cheats are enabled and the \"Operator Items Tab\" option in the controls menu is turned on. Blocks are grouped by material and the same item can appear in multiple tabs, which the latter are indicated with an asterisk (*) below. In the case of the search tab, those that appear in multiple tabs are only be listed once in the first section. There is also a \"Search Items\", \"Saved Hotbars\" and \"Survival Inventory\" tab.\nUsing the search tab, one can access enchanted books of any level, whereas only books of the maximum levels can be found in the \"Ingredients\" section. \n \nBedrock Edition.\nA stack of items from the Creative inventory can be sent to the active hotbar slot by tapping on that item. This is the case on mobile devices; on other platforms, it sends only one item.\nThe Creative inventory screen in Bedrock Edition is sorted into 4 sections: \"Construction\", \"Equipment\", \"Items\", and \"Nature\". These 4 tabs appear along the right-hand side of the inventory (along the top in Windows 10 Edition). The Creative inventory screen also includes the usual armor, crafting and Survival inventory tabs along the left (along the bottom in Windows 10). The recipe book is also present.\nSome items in the Creative inventory are grouped together in sub-sections with other similar items. These sub-sections can be opened by selecting the item with a + icon next to it. Selecting the sub-section with a - icon closes the subsection. These sub-sections exclusively appear in the individual 4 categories and do not appear in the \"All\" tab.\nExternal inventories.\nMany blocks and some non-player entities have their own inventory-like windows that pop up to allow manipulation of items.\nNote: Despite the fact that ender chest, crafting table, beacon, anvil, enchanting table, and villager inventories are actually internal behind the scenes, they are listed here as external because they require clicking on something external.\nMob inventory.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s have inventory slots, used for various purposes."}

These changes were implemented in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.19.3\"&gt;1.19.3&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelow is the Creative inventory in Java Edition in 1.19.2, immediately prior to the Creative inventory overhaul:\nJava Edition Creative inventory before 1.13.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13/Flattening\"&gt;The Flattening&lt;/a&gt;, the order of blocks and items in the Creative inventory on \"Java Edition\" was fixed directly based on numerical block and item IDs. This meant that the layout and order of items in the Creative inventory remained fixed since the introduction of the tabbed categories for blocks and items in Creative in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.3.1\"&gt;1.3.1&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2012w21b\"&gt;12w21b&lt;/a&gt;.

From the introduction of the tabbed categories for blocks and items in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20Alpha%200.8.0\"&gt;Pocket Edition Alpha 0.8.0&lt;/a&gt;, the layout of the Creative inventory remained identical up until &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.1.5\"&gt;Pocket Edition 1.1.5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.1.7\"&gt;Pocket Edition 1.1.7&lt;/a&gt;, with only a few changes and no major sweeping changes up until that point.

It did not generate above or below the &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;height limit&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to travel beyond it by flying over or under it, or by pillaring up and walking over it.

Iron golems created by &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s or spawned in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s patrol their village, and may attack players that attack it or have a low &lt;a href=\"Village%20mechanics\"&gt;popularity or reputation&lt;/a&gt; with their village.\nSpawning.\nVillages.\n, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s can &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Iron%20golem%20summoning\"&gt;summon iron golems&lt;/a&gt;, either when they are gossiping or panicking and the following criteria are met:\nIron golems still spawn even when the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nTo find a valid spawn point, up to 10 attempts are made to spawn a golem within a 17\u00d713\u00d717 box centered on the villager (villager block position \u00b18 blocks along x/z axes and \u00b16 blocks along y axis). A random y column is picked and then the topmost block in that column is selected that is air or liquid and has a \"&lt;a href=\"Materials%23Materials\"&gt;solid-blocking&lt;/a&gt;\" block underneath. The target location then goes through the following checks: \nThis means the iron golem can spawn inside 1-deep water or inside blocks like slabs, fences, and carpets, if other checks pass. Adjacent blocks are irrelevant, so golems can spawn partially-inside adjacent solid blocks. However, the spawning iron golem still must not collide with any existing entities.\n, an iron golem can spawn naturally when a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; first generates in the world. Iron golems also spawn in villages having at least 20 &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s and 10 villagers. The golem attempts to spawn in a 17\u00d713\u00d717 volume, \u00b18 blocks horizontal and \u00b16 blocks vertical from the village's center block, which can be (but isn't necessarily) a bed pillow or a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;. First, X and Z coordinates are randomly chosen within the spawn volume, then the highest block at those coordinates within the spawn volume is found. If it is a block with a full top surface\u2014which includes upside-down stairs and top slabs (does not include glass)\u2014and there is no obstruction above it by a block above the spawn volume, then the golem is spawned there. Otherwise the spawn attempt is canceled.\nFor a village to spawn iron golems, 75% of the villagers in the village must have worked (i.e. stood beside or atop their workstation) in the past day, 100% of the villagers must be linked to a bed, and the village center must be within a player's &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt; volume.\nThe maximum distance the player can be from the village for iron golems to spawn can be calculated with the following formulas. These are only approximate because they yield a volume with a rectangular cross section, but the simulation distance volume is roughly rounded and omits the corner chunks.\nformula_1\nformula_2\nIf the village's original iron golem is killed, a new one cannot spawn unless all of the conditions are met. Therefore, a small village does not regenerate an iron golem unless the village is expanded.\nIf the spawn conditions are met, then the chance of attempting a spawn is per game tick, which averages to one spawn attempt every 35 seconds. Iron golems can spawn provided the 2\u00d73\u00d72 space above the spawn point (that is, horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the block it spawns on) contains only non-full blocks, and the block it spawns on is solid.\nCreation.\nIron golems are created by placing four &lt;a href=\"iron%20block\"&gt;iron block&lt;/a&gt;s in a T shape (as shown in the image), and then placing a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt; on top of the center upper block. The pumpkin may be placed by the player, a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;, but it must be placed last. It needs at least one block of space around the bottom iron block to be able to spawn and cannot spawn in a confined area; even grass can prevent an iron golem from spawning. Alternatively, the blocks can be placed in any order with an uncarved pumpkin; the player can &lt;a href=\"shear\"&gt;shear&lt;/a&gt; the pumpkin to spawn the golem. When successfully transformed, it is naturally passive toward all players under all circumstances. It can, however, attack the player\u2019s tamed wolves, if punched accidentally, but it never directly attacks the player. The constructed golem attacks hostile mobs like a naturally spawned iron golem.\nThe block arrangement can be placed upright, lying down, or upside-down. The four empty spaces in the diagram (above and below each of the arms) must be &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; blocks. Any non-air block (including blocks such as &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; layers, &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;) present in any of the empty spaces prevent the golem from spawning. \nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", the player can place a pumpkin on the four blocks of iron, then shear the pumpkin. The iron golem still spawns like normal.\nLike other constructed &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, iron golems always spawn facing south. Their large size may cause them to take suffocation damage from nearby solid &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s at the level of their head.\nDropping a pumpkin on the correct arrangement of iron blocks does not spawn a iron golem.\nPillager outposts.\nIron golems can also be found surrounding &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, confined inside dark oak cages. When freed, they can help the player by attacking any nearby &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s. Pillagers do not attack iron golems in cages, although the iron golem can attack any pillagers that are one block near the cage, because iron golems can attack through a one-block wall.\nDrops.\nIron golems drop when they &lt;a href=\"die\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;:\nKilling an iron golem with a weapon enchanted by &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; has no effect on the number of iron ingots or poppies dropped.\n&lt;a href=\"Trading\"&gt;Trading&lt;/a&gt; prices are unaffected by the killing of iron golems; however, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Village%23Popularity\"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; decreases by 10, affecting village iron golem behavior if the popularity ranges below -15.\nBehavior.\nIron golems wander around a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; in a patrol-like fashion, staying close to buildings and other structures. Like &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, iron golems do not wander away from a village, regardless of how they were spawned, but sometimes stand at the border of the village. \nAn iron golem sometimes faces a villager as if they are conversing. Iron golems can spawn &lt;a href=\"poppies\"&gt;poppies&lt;/a&gt; in their hands and offer them to villagers, symbolizing the friendly relationship between villagers and iron golems. Baby villagers accept the poppy offered by the iron golem. Attacking an iron golem that is not player-built while the iron golem is holding out a poppy causes it to take back the poppy and attack the player instead. If the iron golem sees a target while it is offering the poppy, it runs toward the target and kills the target instead.\n, iron golems completely ignore villagers, pushing them aside while walking if a villager is in the iron golem's path, but they still offer poppies if possible.\nIf not within a village, iron golems slowly wander around attacking hostile mobs (skeletons, zombies, etc.), usually making their way to a nearby village. If in that village, the iron golem doesn't leave.\nIron golems can walk up a full &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; height without jumping and walk over a 1 block wide hole without falling in. They avoid &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;. Iron golems are immune to both &lt;a href=\"drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;. When in water, they sink, but can still move freely. \nWhen an iron golem's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; reduces to 75%, cracks appear on its surface. An iron golem can be healed when the player right-clicks the chest of the iron golem with an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;. This action consumes the ingot.\nAs with all utility mobs, iron golems can be &lt;a href=\"leash\"&gt;leash&lt;/a&gt;ed. The leashed iron golem does not try to break from the lead when it sees a hostile mob. Instead, it looks at the mob while moving. An iron golem that is leashed in mid-air moves its arms and legs while moving. If an iron golem is leashed to a fence, it attacks the hostile mob but does not follow the mob if the hostile mob goes out the attack range, as the iron golem cannot break free from fence leads.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", when iron golems move when provoked, they look like if they're taking strides toward the mob. Iron golems that aren't provoked move slower in Java Edition. Iron golems move faster , as it walks like its normal walking speed, either when provoked or not provoked. \nIron golems cannot pick up weapons or armor, but the player can use NBT commands in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" to give the iron golem weapons or armor, although the armor or weapons are not visible. \nAttacking.\nWhen attacking, an iron golem moves quickly toward its target and swings its arms up violently to attack, flinging the target into the air, and dealing to damage in Normal difficulty. Iron golems have a large attack range, allowing them to attack through a solid 1 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; thick wall, even without a line of sight to the target. When an iron golem attacks, it also deals a long knockback range. Iron golems cannot attack targets that are three blocks high above the same ground level as the golem.\nIt is possible for multiple golems to hit the same target simultaneously, flinging the victim to a height proportional to the number of golems that attacked. The mob/player flung can die from fall damage.\nIf an iron golem attacks a group of zombies, for example, it targets one zombie to attack until that zombie dies before it attacks a different zombie, even while other zombies are attacking at the same time. The iron golem attacks hostile mobs that attack it in order.\nIf the mob is flung out of sight, the iron golem attacks the next mob that attacks it. Sometimes, the iron golem might attack the nearest hostile mob if they are in groups.\nWhen an iron golem kills any mob, the player can obtain items dropped by the mob, but no experience orbs. Iron golems that kill a raid mob also causes the mob to drop its raid loot, even when the mob wasn't attacked by the player before it is killed.\nIron golems never attack each other, as iron golems cannot \"accidentally\" hit another iron golem when attacking.\nProvocation by players.\nAn iron golem built by a player never attacks players, even when hit or when the player attacks another villager or another golem in front of the player-built golem. A player-built golem attacks the player's tamed wolf if the wolf attacks the golem.\nA naturally-spawned iron golem becomes hostile toward a player who attacks a villager near an iron golem. Also, if a player has -15 &lt;a href=\"popularity\"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; or less in a village, or has -100 or lower reputation with any nearby villager, naturally-spawned iron golems become hostile to that player until the player's popularity climbs above -15 \"and\" reputation with all nearby villagers goes above -100.\nA village iron golem retaliates when attacked by a player (even throwing an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; at an iron golem provokes it). If a village has more than one naturally-spawned iron golems and a player attacks one in front of the other(s), all of iron golems in that type may become hostile to the player.\nIron golems are not provoked by players who attack &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf a golem spawns from its &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;, it will behave in the same way as &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; golems.\nThrowing a positive splash potion or a positive lingering potion does not anger iron golems.\nProvocation by other mobs.\nAlthough they are guardians of villages, iron golems are not actually provoked when a mob attacks a nearby villager (in contrast to a player attacking a villager). With the exception of &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"goats\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt; (although they still can attack ghasts if close), they are provoked when attacked by any mobs, and by the \"presence\" of nearby monsters. Even if a witch accidentally throws a positive splash potion at an iron golem during a raid, this does not stop the iron golem from attacking the witch. Iron golems are ineffective against flying hostile mobs that don't venture into the iron golem's reach, such as phantoms.\nThe list below contains mobs (including players) that can have hostile interactions with iron golems. The iron golem also attacks neutral mobs or hostile mobs that attack the player such as piglins or zombified piglins.\nA naturally-spawned iron golem knows where raiding &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt; locations are from behind solid walls and from underground and attempts to move toward them. An iron golem created by the player or summoned by a &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; cannot detect raiders through obstructions. Iron golems also looks down or looks up if the hostile mob is above or below the iron golem.\nBeing attacked.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s (and variants), &lt;a href=\"Zoglin\"&gt;zoglins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s (and variants), &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es naturally attack iron golems on sight and may cause major damage, especially if the mobs attack in groups.\nIron golems have 100% knockback resistance from normal attacks. They can still be knocked back by the &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Punch\"&gt;Punch&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCracking.\nIron golems have different stages of being cracked to show their health. When their health is above , they do not have any cracks. When their health is between and , some cracks appear. When their health is between and , they appear more cracked. When their health is lower than , many cracks are visible.\nHealing.\n an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt; on an iron golem restores its health by .\nPreferred path.\nLike villagers, iron golems use a strategy of pathfinding that prioritizes walking on certain \"low-cost\" blocks.\nIron golems attempt to walk on a one-block-wide path, despite them being two blocks wide. An iron golem favors a wider path if it sees one.\nClimbing.\nIron golems can climb ladders or vines if the ladder or vine is in its path, or if pushed onto a ladder or vine.\nSounds.\nIron golems use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nIron golems have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

This update overhauled the combat system, among other additions and changes.\nThe official name for the update, the \"Combat Update\", was discovered on April 1, 2015, by Reddit user &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.reddit.com/user/3dDeters\"&gt;3dDeters&lt;/a&gt; (and several others independently) who found a QR code hidden in the snow falling pattern of the April Fools &lt;a href=\"15w14a\"&gt;15w14a&lt;/a&gt; snapshot.\nDevelopment on the Combat Update began at least a month before the &lt;a href=\"Bountiful%20Update\"&gt;Bountiful Update&lt;/a&gt; was released. The development period was over twice as long as the development period for 1.8 at 576 days; 2015 became the first year where a major update to \"Minecraft: Java Edition\" was not released. Snapshots began the day after &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8.8\"&gt;1.8.8&lt;/a&gt; was released. 56 development snapshots were released, from &lt;a href=\"15w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"16w07b\"&gt;16w07b&lt;/a&gt;, making it the update with the most snapshots so far. The time between releases of 1.8 and 1.9 represent the longest time span between major updates, at 545 days. Fifteen iterations of the launcher were released during this period, from 1.5.2 to 1.6.59. &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8.9\"&gt;1.8.9&lt;/a&gt; was also released during this period.\nThe development team called the release feature-complete by the end of October 2015, and started a lengthy period of gameplay balancing and bug-fixing. They later announced that 1.9 would not be released in 2015, as the developers \"want to fix more bugs before release, and keep the game stable over the holidays\".\nMojang released the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9-pre1\"&gt;first pre-release&lt;/a&gt; on February 17, 2016. The date for this was hinted at by the image in the blog post that announced snapshot &lt;a href=\"16w06a\"&gt;16w06a&lt;/a&gt;. The data values of the wool in the image were (1, 7, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 6), having a possible (though never confirmed) interpretation of \"17-02-2016\", a date just one week from 16w06a. The &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9-pre2\"&gt;second pre-release&lt;/a&gt; was released on February 18th, the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9-pre3\"&gt;third pre-release&lt;/a&gt; was released on February 24, and the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9-pre4\"&gt;fourth pre-release&lt;/a&gt; was released on February 26."}

Multiple subcommands can be chained after codice_1. Subcommands are divided into 4 / 3 categories: modify subcommands, condition subcommands, store subcommands, and codice_3 subcommand.\nAll needed subcommands can be concatenated together. Subcommands other than the codice_3 subcommand can be arranged arbitrarily and used multiple times. But the codice_3 subcommand can be used only once and must be put at the end of the subcommands chain. A codice_3 subcommand or a condition subcommand finalizes the chain, otherwise the command is unparseable or parseable but does nothing (except codice_8 subcommand, see also and ) .\nSubcommands and forking.\nThe game processes subcommand chain in order from front to end, for example, the following commands are different:\nSome subcommands can fork the command execution, that is, they cause subcommands following it to be executed multiple times. It is possible to fork with zero branches, that is, terminate. For example, when subcommand selects multiple entities, the subcommand following it will execute once per entity.\nIf the /execute command hasn't ever forked, we describe it as having only one branch \u2014 the main branch.\nA branch may terminate halfway and does nothing (including and store subcommands). For example, the condition in a condition subcommand doesn't met, or subcommand selects zero entities. When terminating, an red message is shown . If all branches terminated, we describe the /execute command itself as terminating.\nNote that codice_11 has no effect at all in both and . For example, the following commands work the same:\nHowever, the way to fork is different in and . (See also and )\n, depth-first can be achieved via , for example:\n, there is no way to achieve breadth-first.\nOutput values.\nStored values.\n, a branch returns a codice_20 value and a codice_21 value (see &lt;a href=\"%23Store%20subcommand\"&gt;#Store subcommand&lt;/a&gt; for details) after it fully executed (if it does not terminate halfway). These two return values come from the last subcommand (may be a condition subcommand or a codice_3 subcommand). The codice_20 value is always 0 or 1. The codice_21 value must be an integer, if not, it is rounded down. If the last subcommand fails, both the two values are 0. The two values can be stored through storage subcommands.\nNote that all commands except the execute command have these two return values. The execute command itself does not have them.\nIf the command execution is forked after a storage subcommand, the storage operation will be applied on each branch. Each branch's return value will be stored. Since the stored values will not be accumulated, after the whole execute command is executed, the stored value is the return value of the last executed branch.\nIf executing a command after a storage subcommand, the storage operation will be applied on each command in the function file. For each command (except /execute command) in the function file, its return value will be stored after being executed. For commands in the function file, return value of each branch will be stored after being executed. The return value of command itself will be also stored after the whole function file is executed. Since the stored values will not be accumulated, after the whole execute command is executed, the stored value is the return value of the command itself.\nSuccess count.\nLike amost commands, codice_1 command itself also has a success count (whether or not terminates halfway), which is different from codice_20 and codice_21 value. It is similar to the codice_20 value, but is accumulated. This is usually codice_29 or codice_30. If the command is forked or a function is executed, success count can be a number higher than codice_30. When executing it with a command block, the success count is returned to the command block, which can be checked by a conditional command block or be read with a redstone comparator.\nSyntax.\nThere are fourteen / eleven instructions (aka. subcommands) for the codice_1 command, and each has its own special syntax, so describing syntax takes a large branching tree.\nCondition subcommands.\nThe particular use of the codice_204 and codice_205 subcommands are to restrict command execution to happen only under specified conditions. In most cases, codice_205 is a negation of codice_204, equivalent to \"if not...\". The two commands have identical argument structures.\nThere are nine / four different types of conditions:\nStore subcommand.\nStore the final subcommand's codice_21 or codice_20 value somewhere. It is first processed along with other subcommands, recording the location to store in. After the last subcommand (may be a condition subcommand or a codice_3 subcommand) is executed, return values are stored in the recorded location. Note that the return values of commands must be an integer. If a decimal, it is rounded down.\nThere are five different modes of storage:\nRun subcommand.\nThe command's single argument is the command to be executed, the context variables of which may be modified by the subcommands used."}

{"id": "136093", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=136093", "title": "Commands/playanimation", "text": "Sends an animation request to clients to make one or more &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; play an &lt;a href=\"animation\"&gt;animation&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; has an equivalent function in the script API: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/server/entity%23playanimation\"&gt;Entity.playAnimation&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nThis command only sends an animation request to client sides. The server side doesn't process the animation at all.\nIf the target entity is not loaded on the client, the client cannot receive the animation request.\nThe client processes the request based on the contents of &lt;a href=\"resource%20packs\"&gt;resource packs&lt;/a&gt;, so players using different resource packs in the same &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; may see different animations.\nAnimation controller.\nAnimation controllers are state-machines. State machines are a special kind of logic management, that relies on a series of states. Each state has two properties:\nA state machine can only be in one state at a time. For example if you play an animation on the animation controller codice_1 on a player, then any other player animations such as sneaking, walking, hand moving, swimming, sleeping, jumping etc. won't play on that player, until this controller returns to a vanilla state. \nIn an animation controller, there are two types of states:\ncodice_2 command cannot interact with resource pack defined states, except to set codice_4 (of an animation specified state) to it.\nAnimation controllers can be defined for an entity type by resource packs with several resource pack defined states (see also &lt;a href=\"https%3A//learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/animationsreference/examples/animationcontroller\"&gt;official doc&lt;/a&gt;). Animation controllers can also be created by this command as described below. There are also animation controllers in behavior packs running on the server side, but they do not control the animation.\nAnimation controllers on an entity are not saved and are cleared when the entity becomes unloaded on the client, or when the player leaves and rejoins the game.\nAnimation controllers on an entity become their default states when the resource pack is reloaded by minimizing or taping out the client game, but states of the animation controllers won't be cleared.\nAnimation controller codice_1 on a player becomes its default state when the player opens the dressing room, but states of the animation controller won't be cleared.\nBehavior.\nWhen the client receives the request, it first creates the specified animation controller on this entity if not existing. Then, the client adds a new animation specified state of the specified codice_3 into the controller and sets the codice_4, codice_6, and codice_5 for this state. Finally, it sets the currently state to this new state.\nIf the specified controller already exists on the targeted entity, and the animation specified state of the specified codice_3 already exists in the controller, when the client receives the request, the codice_4 dosen't change, the codice_6 is updated, and the codice_5 becomes codice_22. Finally, it sets the current state to this state.\nIf specifying an animation controller defined by resource packs, the command work the same as described above. But note that because this command cannot interact with resource pack defined states (except to set codice_4 to one of them), after playing an animation, to make the controller return to a resource pack defined state, you have to make sure an animation specified state has a codice_4 that is a resource pack defined state.\nExample.\nMake the foxes sit down until they leave the ground. Once leaving the ground, the foxes become in sleep state:\nTo make a player sit down until they move:\nTo make a players legs flip upside down into their body until they jump:\nTo make a player's body freeze and stop all player animations from playing on that player (Note: the animation controller has to be codice_1 for this to work):\nFor some cool combinations you can do with /playanimation go to &lt;a href=\"Playanimation%20Combinations\"&gt;playanimation combonations&lt;/a&gt;.

When a command is executed, the command returns one or more \"command stats\": the success count, number of &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; affected, number of entities affected, number of &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; affected, and/or a query result (such as from ).\nThe stats command allows \"selectors\" and \"objectives\" to be set (or cleared) for each of these command stats for specific blocks or entities. Selectors (for example, codice_1) are stored exactly as entered, and don't get evaluated immediately. When a command is later run by the block or entity, the stored selector is then used to target (other) entities and update their &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt; objective with the value of the command stat. That value can then be displayed or operated on, just like any other scoreboard value.\nThe success count from a command block can also be acquired with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;, but that is capped at a maximum value of 15, while scoreboard objectives can hold any value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Success counts and query results are also usually displayed in the chat."}

Endermen normally ignore &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; and lazily amble about, but they will swiftly walk to attack those that damage it or look directly at its face. Endermen &lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; to avoid &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; (which harms them), projectiles and some other damage sources, and they occasionally pick up certain &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;. They will also teleport more rapidly in &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nEndermen can spawn on any solid surface that has at least three empty spaces above, at the &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 0 in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, or a light level of 7 or less in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. They are the only mobs that spawn in all 3 dimensions.\nOverworld.\nEndermen spawn uncommonly in the Overworld in all biomes except &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt;. They often spawn in groups of two, and rarely in groups of three.\nNether.\nEndermen spawn rarely in &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt;s, uncommonly in &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt;, and most commonly in &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEnd.\nEndermen spawn commonly in groups of up to four anywhere in the End dimension.\nDrops.\nEndermen drop:\nBehavior.\nAn enderman can be provoked by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or other mob attacking them. They can also be provoked by a player looking them in the eyes for 5 &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt;s ( second) from up to 64 blocks away. Endermen open their mouths and begin to shake angrily if provoked; they also make loud and lengthy sounds while being stared at. If the player continues to maintain eye contact, the enderman does not move, although it may teleport away. Once the player stops looking at the enderman, it runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob. An aggravated enderman runs fast and often teleports to the location of a player or mob up to 32 blocks away (orthogonally). Endermen are not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn aggravated enderman pursues the player until it is either killed or distracted by external elements, such as rain or fire. They do not take damage from sunlight like &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs, but when at a sufficient light level under the sky during the day they teleport randomly, typically winding up in caves (although certain non-full blocks, such as &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;, also register as \"dark\" when the enderman is standing in them).\nEndermen can be harmed by melee attacks, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"splash%20water%20bottle\"&gt;splash water bottle&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;. They are not damaged when standing in a filled &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. Endermen teleport away when they take damage from any of natural sources (), continuing to do so until they find a safe location. They also teleport while taking damage from other sources, such as &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;. \nRanged attacks are largely ineffective against endermen, as they teleport when hit by a projectile instead of taking damage. Endermen that are hit by projectiles do not become hostile. &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s appear to bounce off an enderman who is unable to teleport. , arrows go straight through endermen that are unable to teleport (but the effect still goes through if it's a tipped arrow).. Rocket crossbows do affect endermen and can trigger endermen hostility toward the shooter. \nEndermen can step up one full block without having to jump.\nEndermen are hostile to &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s within 64 blocks but are passive to other mobs unless provoked.\nAn enderman in a player's vicinity prevents the player from sleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; at night as if any hostile mob were nearby. If the player is already asleep in a bed, it is possible for an enderman to teleport on it and wake players by pushing them off.\nThe endermen's aggression range for being looked at is reduced when the player is sneaking, or under the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; effect depending on the number of armor pieces currently worn. The detection range in blocks for invisible players is shown in the following table:\nTeleportation.\nThey play a sound exclusively at the teleportation destination.\nEach teleportation attempt chooses a random destination 32 blocks along each axis (i.e. a 64\u00d764\u00d764 cube centered on the current position). It then applies the following checks:\nThus, endermen need at least three non-solid blocks above the destination to successfully teleport, and do not teleport to waterlogged blocks unless the ceiling above is made of a non-waterlogged movement-blocking material.\nBlocks that have a large enough collision box but are not made of a movement-blocking material, such as &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt; that is not above a block made of a movement-blocking material, &lt;a href=\"snow%20layer\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s 10 or more deep, and &lt;a href=\"azalea\"&gt;azalea&lt;/a&gt;, can be used to prevent teleportation. Endermen always teleport an integer Y distance, so an enderman at Y=70.0 cannot teleport onto a movement-blocking block covered by a single carpet, snow layers only 2 deep, or many other short blocks, while an enderman at Y=70.99 could teleport onto snow layers 8 or 9 deep.\nEndermen always attempt to teleport upon taking damage. Most melee attacks are successful, but the enderman usually teleports a few blocks behind the player when hit, if there is space behind the player. Endermen can be attacked with projectiles if they are in a boat or minecart. If all available blocks within teleport distance are removed or unavailable as a destination, it is possible to hit endermen with a projectile, although arrows may simply bounce off, dealing no damage. When teleporting due to damage, it makes 64 attempts to teleport. \n, an enderman cannot teleport while it is in a minecart or boat, although in rain and water it attempts to do so, always teleporting back repeatedly until death. This does not occur .\nMoving blocks.\nUnlike any other mobs, which cannot hold blocks except as items, endermen have a unique ability to pick up, carry and set down certain blocks. They silently pick up blocks in a 4\u00d73\u00d74 (xyz) region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically encompassing it. An enderman cannot pick up blocks in a completely flat area. Endermen drop the block they are holding upon death as an item, although they do not visually let go of the block when dying. It does not despawn while holding a block. Endermen cannot place blocks onto &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;.\nEndermen can pick up the following blocks:\n&lt;a href=\"Data%20pack\"&gt;Data pack&lt;/a&gt;s from \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" can change this list by modifying the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"Tag%23Blocks\"&gt;block tag&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"behavior%20packs\"&gt;behavior packs&lt;/a&gt; can not modify these as the list is hard-coded behind the method. \nWhile carrying a block, the enderman sometimes silently places it in a 2\u00d72\u00d72 region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically at the same level as the enderman itself if the target location is &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; with a non-air block beneath and the block is allowed to be placed at the target location.\nEndermen cannot pick up or place down blocks if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nEndermen can randomly breach walls, bridge &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, break &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; circuitry, set off explosions and kill themselves if they place a block of TNT on a power source and even construct &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s by removing or placing blocks.\nEndermen can pick up or place down blocks even when angry.\n, users can summon an enderman holding any block (including the ones not listed above) using the codice_2 NBT data. For example, to summon an enderman holding a with no AI where the player is standing:\nSounds.\nEndermen use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nEndermen have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Some entities can be renamed by a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; on them. Entity tiles, &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, shot or thrown projectiles, area effect clouds, and &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s do not have a current &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. Entities that do have a health status include &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boat%20with%20chest\"&gt;boat with chest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEntities cannot pass through &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;s, excluding &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;vexes.&lt;/a&gt; Most types of entities prevent blocks from being placed in the space they occupy, except for resources (dropped items) and experience orbs, which are automatically pushed out of the block to open air. If a solid block enters an entity's space, such as falling &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or a swinging &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, then it is free to move out of the solid block but not back in. For example, if a door is closed on you, you can jump up and stand on top of the bottom-half door block, if there is air above the door.\nEntities are lit according to the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of the block their position is in. For example, if a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; runs over a non-straight track directly into a solid block, it turns black because solid blocks always have a light level of 0; &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s are also sometimes seen to turn black, especially if fired shallowly into the ceiling.\nFurther notes.\n&lt;a href=\"Item%20frame\"&gt;Item frame&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glow%20item%20frame\"&gt;glow item frame&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; knots, unlike most entities, align to the block grid, and are completely immobile.\nArrows, TNT and falling sand (and its variants, including other falling blocks like anvils and dragon eggs) are assumed to have infinite health because they are neither destroyed by explosions (although they can be \"moved\" by explosions, and they can also be fired out of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mechanisms%23Mechanisms\"&gt;TNT cannons&lt;/a&gt;), nor by being on fire for long periods. However, they can still be \"killed\" with the use of the command.\nBoats, boat with chests and minecarts.\nBoats, boat with chests and minecarts appear to recover health over time. For example, they can be broken by hitting them quickly, but cannot be destroyed by hits with unarmed hand with a pause after each hit. The amount of wobbling displayed by boats and minecarts when struck appears to indicate their current health. All minecart, boat and boat with chest variants have .\nGravity-affected blocks.\nGravity-affected blocks include &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;snow layers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nA gravity-affected block normally exists as a block, but when its support is removed, it becomes a &lt;a href=\"falling%20block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt; entity and falls down until hitting the top surface of another block. If there is valid space, it places itself as a block at the nearest on-grid position, or drops as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; if that position is occupied by a block without a solid top surface, such as a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; or a bottom &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile a falling block ordinarily falls straight down, its trajectory can be affected by &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;reeling&lt;/a&gt; it in, and moving &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, and can slide down the side of &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s. It is also possible to modify the velocity and direction of a falling block by using &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; such as or third-party programs. A falling block despawns and drops as an item if it does not land after existing for 600 &lt;a href=\"ticks\"&gt;ticks&lt;/a&gt; (30 seconds), or 100 ticks (5 seconds) if falling into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a cave generates underneath sand, gravel, or red sand, the blocks remain stationary until it receives a &lt;a href=\"block%20update\"&gt;block update&lt;/a&gt;. If a single block is updated and falls down, neighboring blocks will be updated in a chain reaction which can cause the collapse of an entire region of gravity-affected blocks.\nInteractions with \"use\" control.\nEntities with interactions (such as &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boat%20with%20chest\"&gt;boat with chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, tamed &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s, and tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;) do not stop the action of a tool you are holding. For example, a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; on a tamed wolf causes the wolf to sit, but also empties the bucket near or onto the wolf.\nRiding.\nEntities may be riding on, or attached to, other entities. When this is the case, only the lower/\"outer\" entity's volume collides with other things, and only that entity can control movement. However, there are exceptions: players riding &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boat%20with%20chest\"&gt;boat with chest&lt;/a&gt;s, or saddled &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, baby &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s riding &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s riding horses or boats.\nThe only current legitimate combinations of riding entities are:\nNote that a &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; shoulder isn't considered as riding.\nIt is possible to have multiple levels, such as a baby &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt; on another baby &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt; who is riding a &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"boat%20with%20chest\"&gt;boat with chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntities can also be stacked on top of each other with the use of the and commands . For example, using summons a &lt;a href=\"spider%20jockey\"&gt;spider jockey&lt;/a&gt;, or using .\nIf an entity is riding another entity, the top entity cannot teleport because as soon as the teleport is made, the entity is teleported back to riding the other entity.\nStarting from the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Update\"&gt;Nether Update&lt;/a&gt;, entities that are riders or passengers of other entities cannot &lt;a href=\"despawn\"&gt;despawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of entities.\nThe table below lists types of entities that currently exist in Minecraft. \nEntities listed as \"solid\" obstruct the passage of other entities. \nMotion of entities.\nGravity works differently in Minecraft than the real world, as not everything is subject to the same acceleration. Additionally, there is a drag force proportional to velocity, again dependent on the entity.\nStarting at an initial upwards velocity formula_1, an entity's velocity after falling for a number of ticks formula_2 can be given by the formulas:\nData values.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20level%20format/Entity%20format\"&gt;Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format&lt;/a&gt;."}

It uses two spells to attack; one that summons &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;-piercing fangs and one that summons &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es.\nSpawning.\nWoodland mansions.\nAn evoker &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;s during the generation of particular &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; rooms. They do not respawn after their initial spawn.\nEvokers spawned with mansions do not naturally despawn (unless the world &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is switched to peaceful.) \n, evokers can spawn in peaceful difficulty, and will not attack the player.\nRaids.\nEvokers can spawn during &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;raids&lt;/a&gt; by themselves or riding &lt;a href=\"ravagers\"&gt;ravagers&lt;/a&gt;. Evokers cannot spawn in raids in easy difficulty, because such raids have only three waves, while evokers appear in the fifth wave and above.\nJava Edition.\nEvokers spawn during raids starting at wave 5. Up to 5 evokers spawn on hard difficulty. During these events, they can be a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn hard difficulty, evokers can also spawn riding a ravager at wave 7. They may also rarely spawn as a raid captain.\nBedrock Edition.\nUp to 5 evokers spawn during raids, with 1 evoker spawning during waves 5 and 6, and 3 evokers spawning during wave 7. One of them rides a ravager during wave 7.\nBehavior.\nAn evoker moves at the &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;player's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; speed, crosses its arms and does not show its hands. An evoker visually does not sit down when sitting in a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;. If an evoker is riding a &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;, its legs appear to sink in the ravager's body. This only happens in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, as evokers put their legs in front of them while sitting on any entity .\nEvokers attack &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, adult &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s within 12 blocks by rising and waving both of their arms while looking at their target and summoning magical fangs or &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;vexes&lt;/a&gt;, creating different colored &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s for the different attacks.\nIf the player is within a 10 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; radius and the evoker is not in the middle of summoning an attack, the evoker flees from the player to avoid being attacked.\nEvokers are passive in Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. They will still attack any adult villagers, iron golems, wandering traders, or snow golems in the Peaceful difficulty.\nIf an evoker is attacked, all nearby evokers become alerted and start attacking the player, even if they are behind walls. , the alerted evokers can attack the player from an infinite distance away, even if the player switches to &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode; this can be fixed by relogging the world, or by setting the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; \"universalAnger\" to True.\n, an evoker is passive to other &lt;a href=\"Illager\"&gt;illagers&lt;/a&gt; even if it is harmed. Any evoker can search for and join a &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt; if sufficiently near a &lt;a href=\"patrol%20captain\"&gt;patrol captain&lt;/a&gt;.\n, evokers and &lt;a href=\"illusioner\"&gt;illusioner&lt;/a&gt;s are faster without any &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;s during raids.\n, evokers are given 3 seconds of the &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;Glowing&lt;/a&gt; effect if a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; is rung within 32 blocks of them. This applies to both evokers spawned in raids and evokers spawned in woodland mansions.\nFang attack.\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing purple &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s () and a low-pitched &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;. \nA number of fangs rise out of the ground around the player, then snap shut and vanish. \n&lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; caught in the attack are dealt &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of difficulty. This harm is not mitigated by &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; but is mitigated by &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt;. Any evoker-summoned fangs do not deal damage to any illagers, although fangs summoned or spawned by the player do.\nFangs appear no lower than the feet of the lowest combatant and no higher than one &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; above the feet of the highest combatant. Fangs attempt to appear on the highest &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block between those two extremes, but fail to spawn if they are obstructed by a &lt;a href=\"solid\"&gt;solid&lt;/a&gt; block. In practice, this means that fangs cannot spawn inside deep pits or on top of high walls, but may, for example, go up a staircase if the target is at the top and the evoker at the bottom, or vice versa. Likewise, an evoker floating in a boat on &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; cannot summon fangs against a player &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; or floating in a boat because there are no opaque blocks from which the fangs can appear.\nThe evoker typically summons 16 fangs in a straight line toward the target. However, if the target is within 3 blocks of the evoker, the evoker summons the fangs in two circles around itself: the smaller circle has 5 fangs and the larger has 8. The fangs do not seek the player, thus the player is able to dodge them. Summoning fangs resets the evoker's spell cooldown to two seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning fangs to five seconds.\nIf a neutral or hostile mob is caught in an evoker's fang attack, the mob attacks the evoker.\nSummoning vexes.\nThe evoker signals this attack by producing white &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s () for two seconds and a higher-pitched &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;. Three &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es appear nearby. The evoker can summon vexes as long as there are fewer than eight vexes within 16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s centered on the evoker. \nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to five seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning vexes to 17 seconds.\nCombo attack.\n, evokers may summon two circle fangs while summoning vexes, without any cooldown. It usually happens when a player melee attacks an evoker while it is summoning vexes. The &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons'&lt;/a&gt; evoker also feature this combo attack behavior.\nSheep color conversion spell.\nWhile the evoker is not engaged in combat and is set to codice_1, it changes the &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; color of any blue &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; within 16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s from blue to red. \nThe evoker signals this spell by producing orange &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s () and making a \"wololo\" sound. \nThis spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to three seconds and resets the cooldown for the sheep color conversion spell to seven seconds. Evokers look at the sheep they are using the spell on while they are doing the spell until they finish the spell. \n, evokers can still change a sheep's color when is set to codice_2. \nEvoker fangs.\nEvoker fangs are the entities that evokers use to attack the player with their fang attack. Evoker fangs are not affected by the peaceful difficulty.\nThe individual fangs in an evoker's fang attacks each have a delay. Before the delay is over, the fangs cannot be seen, although unlike truly &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt; entities, fangs in warmup still have a visible &lt;a href=\"Debug%20screen%23More%20debug-keys\"&gt;debug hitbox&lt;/a&gt;. After the delay, the fangs expand into existence, snap shut, make critical hit particles and shrink out of sight again, dealing magic damage to all mobs standing on the spot. Killing an evoker fang does not contribute to the &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/a&gt; advancement or achievement.\nSounds.\nEvokers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nEvokers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nEvoker fangs have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

The y-level of the portal is determined by the height of the terrain, placing the portal blocks at the y-level of the highest block found at codice_1. If the exit portal spawns at the top of the world, the portal blocks are the highest blocks generated, with the top 3 blocks of the bedrock pillar failing to generate due to the maximum build height having been reached. If there are no blocks at codice_1, then the portal generates out of bounds, and only the top 3 blocks of the bedrock pillar generate.\nConstruction.\nThe exit portal looks similar to the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; but differs in its design. Instead of a frame of end portal frame blocks, it has a 7-block wide bowl-shaped frame of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, and a central pillar of bedrock with a torch on each side. A &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; generates atop the pillar upon defeating the ender dragon for the first time.\nThere are 16 &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; blocks, one under each outer bedrock block, as well as four &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;. If any of the blocks are removed, they regenerate when the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; is defeated or respawned. (Note: the torches are attached to the central second-to-the-top block of bedrock)\nBehavior.\nThe portal returns the player to their &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Individual%20spawn\"&gt;spawn point&lt;/a&gt;. Upon respawning, all &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;s are removed from the player. The &lt;a href=\"End%20Poem\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; roll when a player enters the exit portal for the first time. \nIf an entity other than a player goes through, like a &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;thrown item&lt;/a&gt;, it is sent to the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23World%20spawn\"&gt;world spawn&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf a player dies above the portal (for example by flying into the bedrock column with enough momentum) the player goes through. If this happens, the player's items return to the world spawn point."}

Experience orbs gained during a player's life affects the player's score on the &lt;a href=\"death%20screen\"&gt;death screen&lt;/a&gt;. While having no direct effect on the player character, it can be used to enhance their equipment through &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, or by using an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; to repair, rename, or combine enchantments on equipment. Experience orbs also recovers durability on items with &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; that are being worn or are in-hand.\nSources.\nExperience orbs can be gained from several different sources:\nGathering experience points from experience orbs increases the player's experience level by gradually filling a bar on the bottom of the screen until a new level is achieved when the bar is full. When the player dies, they drop experience orbs worth \"7 * current level\" experience points, up to a maximum of 100 points (enough to reach level 7), and all of the other experience vanishes. If the gamerule codice_1 is set to true, the experience is kept even if the player dies.\nExperience orbs.\nExperience orbs fade between green and yellow colors and float or glide toward the player up to a distance of 7.25 blocks (calculated from the center of player's feet and the center of the experience orb), speeding up as they get nearer to the player. Experience orbs pulled toward a player are slowed by cobwebs. Experience orbs can also be pulled around or away from the player by running water currents.\nWhen collected, experience orbs make a bell-like sound for a split second. Unlike resources, experience points are picked up gradually: no matter how many orbs are in the range of the player, they are added to the player's experience one at a time (10 orbs/second). In extreme cases, this can result in the player being followed by a swarm of orbs for many seconds. If an experience orb isn't collected within 5 minutes of its appearance, it disappears.\nExperience orbs vary in value. The general worth of an orb is reflected by its size, with eleven possible sizes corresponding to specific values. The three smallest sizes are the most commonly encountered, as the majority of experience dropped by mobs and blocks is less than ten. Dense experience orbs, from values 17 and up, have orange \"eyes\" or \"cores\", and are less frequently encountered, most commonly from defeating the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, disenchanting objects on a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, breaking &lt;a href=\"spawners\"&gt;spawners&lt;/a&gt;, and collecting items from high- traffic &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s. For performance improvement, experience orbs of the same value can merge into a single entity, but they do not create a higher value orb.\nNaturally spawned orbs always have an integer value of 1\u201311, 17, 37, 73, 149, 307, 617, 1237, or 2477. Fishing, breeding, and trading drop a single orb with a random value in the appropriate range. Breaking blocks, killing mobs and players, smelting items, and bottles o' enchanting calculate their total experience amount and then split it into values of 1, 3, 7, 17, 37, 73, 149, 307, 617, 1237, and 2477. Higher values are chosen first, so, for example, a total value of 1000 would be dropped as orbs with values 617, 307, 73, and 3. Note that while the first Ender Dragon in a world drops 12,000 experience, it is dropped in 10 waves of 1000 and one of 2000, so no orbs of value 2477 are dropped. Such orbs can only exist in the world via furnaces that have had a lot of traffic.\nExperience orbs with negative values can be created using the command, either using values below 0 or above 32767 due to 16-bit . They have the smallest texture of experience orb. While collecting them does not affect the player's experience bar in any way, they can deduct durability from a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;, provided the tool is already damaged prior to collection of the orbs.\nLike &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, experience orbs float when on water. Experience orbs can be destroyed by fire, lava, explosions, and cacti, and can trigger pressure plates and tripwires. Experience orbs can also stop minecarts. \n, although mob &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; spawn the instant the final blow is dealt to the mob, experience orbs do not appear until the mob entity disappears and the smoke appears.\n, experience orbs appear in the same spatial and temporal location as loot when an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; is killed.\nLeveling up.\nThe formulas for figuring out how many experience orbs needed to get to the next level are as follows:\nOne can determine how much experience has been collected to reach a level using the equations:\nLikewise, to get the number of levels from the total experience value, one can utilize the following inverse equations:\nScore.\nThe score is the number of experience the player has collected since their last death. This number is the total experience the player has collected, rather than the amount of experience they had upon death. When the player dies, the score is displayed on the death screen.\nSounds.\nExperience orbs do not use entity-dependent sound events.\n \nData values.\nEntity data.\nExperience orbs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nHistory.\nThe experience level costs were heavily revised in snapshot &lt;a href=\"12w22a\"&gt;12w22a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"12w23a\"&gt;12w23a&lt;/a&gt;, and again in version 1.8. Before these, reaching level 50 (the maximum usable on a single enchantment) required 4625 experience, corresponding to defeating 925 hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (assuming the \"common\" ones.) Afterward, considerably less experience is needed to get into higher levels. Higher levels cost more experience than lower ones, but the levels are still easier to get than in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.2.5\"&gt;1.2.5&lt;/a&gt;. Now, level 30 is the maximum for &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, and that cost is equivalent of 279 \"common\" enemies, less than 1/3 the old price."}

This has important implications for leveling above 30\u2014the levels gained will have a high XP cost, but this will not be preserved. For example, if you are enchanting anything at level 30: if you earn enough experience to get to level 31, then enchant, you will be left at level 1. If you had enchanted first, and collected the same amount of experience afterwards, you would have almost reached level 4. Because of this, there is no useful purpose to earning experience past level 39, as this is the maximum level an anvil will require before an item is \"too expensive\" to enchant or repair.\nFormulas &amp; tables.\nThe experience cost for gaining a level is equivalent to:\n int expCost(int currentLevel) {\n if (currentLevel &gt;= 30) {\n return 62 + (currentLevel - 30) * 7;\n } else if (currentLevel &gt;= 15) {\n return 17 + (currentLevel - 15) * 3;\n } else {\n return 17;\nThis works out as follows:\nThe total XP required for a given level (\"x\") can be calculated as follows:\nUseful numbers.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;"}
