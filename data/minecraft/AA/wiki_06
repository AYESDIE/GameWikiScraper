{"id": "176089", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=176089", "title": "Tutorials/Amethyst farming", "text": "' farming is the renewable way of obtaining amethyst shards, as well as small, medium, large amethyst buds and amethyst clusters. Amethyst shards are used to craft amethyst blocks for decoration, &lt;a href=\"Tinted%20Glass\"&gt;Tinted Glass&lt;/a&gt; (useful for mob farms), and ', and to breed &lt;a href=\"Allay\"&gt;Allay&lt;/a&gt;s.\nManual farming.\nManual farming amethyst is much more efficient than automatic, unlike with most farmable items. However, just going to each bud and mining it is fairly tedious, so here are a few methods that will help you in your Minecraft world. Please note that for all these methods you will need to dig out all the blocks within a certain radius of the geode that is not a budding amethyst block, including calcite, smooth basalt and stone, as well as blocking off all caves. You can use a nether portal system to enter and exit the area.\nScaffolding method.\nWhat you will need:\nThis method is the most simple of all. You need to make a few floors using the blocks, and make each one accessible by using ladders. Then you will need to be able to access all the budding amethyst using scaffolding, but make sure that the scaffolding is not obstructing any sides of the budding amethyst. Also make sure to light up each floor.\nFloat method.\nThis method works best in an amethyst geode which is under an ocean, because you will do much less mining, clearing out and placing all the water, but this is an extremely easy and efficient method that can also work in an underground geode if you are willing to do all the tedious work required.\nThis will not disrupt the growth of amethyst, since amethyst buds and clusters can be waterlogged and grow in water source blocks and are not affected by it.\nWhat you will need:\nWhat you need to do is dig out a large area if you are underground, and mine all of the blocks around the geode that are not budding amethyst. If you are over the ocean then you will need to mine out all of the blocks around the geode that are not budding amethyst as well, and wall off the area from the rest of the ocean using blocks or glass (in an underground environment you will need to block off all the caves). This is recommended if you don't want drowned to enter and the items to scatter when they float. Then you will need to flood the entire area with water (all blocks have to be water sources otherwise this method won't work, so do it layer by layer), and spread out the conduits so that you are able to get the conduit effect in every single water block in the whole area. If you are in an ocean biome then you will also need to light up the water. In one corner you can also place a soul sand block next to a magma block to make a bubble elevator and an even easier way to get to the surface and floor.\nTo harvest all you need to do is swim down to the geode and harvest all the mature amethyst clusters. The drops will float to the surface of the water, so collecting the items is simple. The only downside to this farm other than the resources it needs is that the items can despawn if you don't pick them up after 5 minutes.\nHole method.\nThis method is extremely efficient, and you won't need to worry about items despawning.\nWhat you will need:\nFirst you will need to build 1 floor, but make sure that it is at least 5 blocks over the highest block of amethyst. Then you will need to make a hole in the floor where a block of budding amethyst is directly below it and repeat that until directly above every block of budding amethyst there is a hole. You can now place a water bucket in each hole. This will allow you to access the budding amethyst without blocking any over it, so that the collection system can pick it up.\nNow you will need to build the collection system itself on the bottom floor which is under the blocks of amethyst (you will have needed to dug out the area first). You can do the system however you want, with water flowing for example, which pushes the amethyst shards over a hopper minecart system which collects it and funnels it into a chest. The last step is to light up the area.\nTo use the farm you need to wait for the amethyst to grow, and to harvest you need to swim down each hole and harvest all the amethyst there. If you drop any amethyst it will be collected, so despawning is not a problem.\nAutomatic farming.\nThere are a few approaches to making an automatic amethyst farm. All approaches require a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuits/Clock\"&gt;timer&lt;/a&gt; of 167 minutes, the statistically optimal period based on the random tick rate. (As &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Comparator\"&gt;Redstone Comparator&lt;/a&gt; does not read the growth stage, the only way to know the stage is an &lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt; linked to a counting circuit. There's no chance for such a circuit to fit in a limited space, so probabilistic pushing is the best option.)\nVideos.\nManual:"}

It is found in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; most commonly at Y=15, although mining at lower levels is safer due to lower risk of mining into a lava ocean. While strip mining is still a potential and straightforward way of mining for ancient debris, using explosives is a lucrative possibility due to its high blast resistance. Furthermore, beds are commonly used, as they explode when used in Nether and are cheaper than other explosives. It is also possible to use &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s or the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; to mine, however the player should be careful to not die by their explosions and not to break &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt; with blue wither skulls.\nMethod comparison.\nThis video compares the methods to find ancient debris, between strip-mining, the bed method and TNT method.\nThis video shows 5 different methods, with success rate for each method.\nBranch mining.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20pickaxe\"&gt;diamond pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; with at least &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; II, the player can instantly mine the &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. With the proper angle, this makes it possible to mine while maintaining sprint. The player can then go in one direction until they hit &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and proceed to mine in another direction. However, it is highly recommended to have multiple &lt;a href=\"potions%20of%20fire%20resistance\"&gt;potions of fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;, as it is possible for the player to accidentally run directly into lava. Compared to using &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, traditional mining is resource-efficient, as only &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; are strictly needed. This method allows you to go about 12 blocks per second.\nIt is recommended to have &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; III on the pickaxe. This way, the player can mend their pickaxe by mining the &lt;a href=\"quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Gold%20Ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt; found along the way. This allows for the player to mine for &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they have food. Also, the player should mark the coordinates of where they started mining so they can easily find their way back.\nCombining &lt;a href=\"beds\"&gt;beds&lt;/a&gt; with branch &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; is also a useful method.\nThe bed method.\nThis method utilizes the fact that &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, when used in alternate dimensions, explode with a larger blast radius than &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. It is easy to do, as you don't need to mine a lot. You will, though, use up many beds, requiring reliable wool and wood resources. Furthermore, given the extremely large amount of damage bed explosions deal and the presence of underground lava pools, it may be advisable to bring &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Undying\"&gt;totems of undying&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potions of Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; to protect yourself. However, these are not required.\nMine all the way to Y = 15, as there is the highest concentration of &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt; in the exposed blocks.\nPlace a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and craft a good number of beds. If your inventory is full, put unused wool and planks in a barrel or other storage. If there are any &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s nearby, don't use &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barrel\"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt;, or any other similar container blocks, as they can become angered and come attack you!\nStart mining a tunnel. At every 16th block, mine 1\u00d71\u00d75 tunnels (1 block wide, 1 block high and 5 blocks long) perpendicular to your main tunnel at eye level. Additionally, you may break the block below you and place a slab to negate most of the damage before blowing up the bed.\nPlace a bed at the end of the side tunnel. Then, after carefully positioning yourself, right-click on the bed to trigger the explosion.\nAfter the explosion, you may find up to 3 ancient debris in exposed blocks. Nearby &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt; might also break, dropping &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s you can collect, and many more unbroken blocks are most likely revealed by the blast. You can mine these out if you like, but note that any nearby &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s will become angered if the blocks you mined are &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Gold%20Ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\nThis video explains the process of exploding beds for ancient debris. It also suggests a second explosion which is not necessary, but can increase the chance of getting ancient debris.\nRepeat these steps on the other side until you have no beds (or food).\nChunk border mining.\nThere is a common misconception that ancient debris generates more often at chunk borders, or that mining at chunk borders is a more efficient way to find debris. This is \"not\" true.\nWhile there is the possibility for a debris vein in one chunk to \"cross the border\" and so result in a chunk having both its own debris and the crossed-over vein, this is balanced out by the fact that the chunk's own vein cannot generate outside of the border to cross back in.\nAnother thing to consider is that while mining at a chunk border does allow you to see parts of twice as many chunks, you see fewer blocks in each chunk, so the chance of finding ancient debris balances out.\nAt best, being aware of chunks might allow you to skip using TNT on the rest of the chunk if you find the large vein early on."}
{"id": "53001", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=53001", "title": "Tutorials/Animal farming", "text": "Cooked meat is one of the best food options in the game, with &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s being its only competitor. Most forms of cooked meat can easily be obtained by killing &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s and then cooking their raw variants in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;. Killing all available animals in a large area may temporarily provide the player with a decent supply of cooked meat. However, due to how passive mob spawning works in Minecraft, it takes a while before more passive mobs spawn in its place, forcing the player to load in new chunks to spawn more animals.\nTo prevent this issue, one can instead gather a small supply of livestock, &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; them to create new livestock, and then kill a portion of the adults whenever the player needs more food. Farming animals can also provide the player with several other useful &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rabbit%20hide\"&gt;rabbit hide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"rabbit%27s%20foot\"&gt;rabbit's foot&lt;/a&gt;. A manual slaughter farm can also provide a modest amount of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, but this should not be the main focus of an animal farm as most hostile mob farms can produce experience points at a faster rate than animals can.\nBasic farming.\nTo lead animals around, you need to wield the same food that you can breed them with or a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; if you have &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s. You can also obtain a lead from the &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with them or killing them. You may also take their &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s! Wandering trader llamas can be bred in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Wheat\"&gt;Wheat&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es for &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s of any type for &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s; and &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s. Once you've got them in the pen, start feeding them, after which they pair off and have babies. They also produce experience orbs. You can breed the same two only once in five minutes. You get one young for each two adult animals that you feed in your herd. The babies take about 20 minutes to grow up and do not drop any items or experience on death, so don't kill too many adults too fast. You can breed adult animals only if you feed two of them at about the same time. They approach each other and begin to look like they are kissing.\nChickens are a special case, because not only do they breed with any seeds, but they also lay eggs, and throwing eggs has a chance to produce chicks. This makes them easy to multiply in general, as not only can chickens produce eggs without being fed seeds, but the process can also be fully automated with the use of &lt;a href=\"dispensers\"&gt;dispensers&lt;/a&gt;. Collecting and throwing eggs increases the number of chickens you can slay.\nFor sheep, you don\u2019t have to kill them to get wool, just dye them and shear them. Shearing a sheep yields 1-3 blocks of wool instead of the usual 1 block you obtain from killing. This process can also be automated with dispensers. However, sheep must eat grass from &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; in order to regrow their wool coat, meaning you need a fairly large pen with plenty grass blocks to recover their wool after shearing. If your farm has an enormous amount of sheep, they turn all of the grass inside of the farm into &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, so a few neighboring grass blocks should be placed outside of reach of your sheep so that the dirt inside of your pen can turn back into grass without running the risk of getting completely consumed by sheep.\nBreeding has a cooldown of five minutes, so you cannot breed the parents right after you already bred them. Additionally, baby animals cannot breed \u2014 feeding a baby animal instead reduces the time it takes to grow up into an adult (with diminishing returns as more food is given).\nA building to house the animals (like a barn) is useful, especially to prevent nasty surprises in the form of &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and other hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s from finding their way into your animal pen and creating a mess. Make sure your barn is well-lit to prevent these mobs from spawning in hidden areas.\nCow crusher.\nThere are limits to how many animals you can keep in a given pen. In modern versions of Minecraft, if animals are packed too tightly (24 in a single block space), they begin dying from overcrowding. If there is a mix of adult and baby animals, the adults die first, which allows for construction of a \"cow crusher\" (popularized by the YouTuber Wattles). This does work for pigs and sheep, but for various reasons (usually &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;) cows are the usual inmates. \nNote: In older versions of Minecraft, overcrowded animals could be pushed into the walls of the pen. If those were solid blocks, the animal would suffocate; if they were fences or transparent blocks, the animal could be pushed right through them. In some versions, animals were prone to \"phasing through walls\" between a game save and restore.\nBreeding tips.\nFeeding at twice the rate as you slay your mobs is enough to keep mobs at roughly their current population. If you are hatching chickens from eggs, a batch of newly-hatched chickens take just about an hour to grow up and then replace the eggs used to hatch them.\nWhen breeding animals in a fenced-in pen and you have a large amount of them, it can be difficult to leave the pen without animals escaping. Some ways to deal with this:\nAutomated animal farming.\nMost of these farms include a killing mechanism, a cooking mechanism for the meat and an item collector, usually a hopper. The cooking mechanism and killing mechanism are often combined, in the form of lava or fire.\nLava blade for cows, pigs, and sheep.\nThis design uses a sticky piston water gate to control the amount of animals to be cooked. They drop through a \"lava blade\", which enables their meat to be cooked efficiently. That this does not work on chickens and rabbits.\nSimple and easy cooked meat farm.\nThis is an easy farm to set up that requires only for the user to breed animals and press a button. It is reusable and has high efficiency. All cooked meats and other drops are collected automatically, and can be easily piled into a chest for collection by the player later. This farm works for cows, sheep and pigs.\nThen, you want to go in and kill off some of them, not all. If you kill off all of them, it is harder to breed them again.\nFully automatic chicken cooker.\nThis machine is not resource expensive and can give you infinite amounts of cooked chicken without you having to do anything. Just build the machine and you won't be hungry for a long time.\nThe chickens in the room with the hopper floor start laying eggs when they grow up and the eggs get transported through the hoppers and into the dispenser, which shoots them onto the slab, causing some of the eggs to hatch. The baby chickens are not tall enough, even while standing on the slab, to get burnt by the lava that is directly above their heads. However, when they grow up, they are too tall and their heads go straight into the lava. The chickens die and drop cooked meat. All of the feathers and chicken that they dropped gets sucked up by the hopper under the slab and deposited into the chest below the hopper.\nPoor man's beef farm.\nAn easy and simple way to farm raw beef. This farm utilises water currents and fall damage to kill cows for beef. Cows can be bred within the farm itself, making the farm a renewable source for beef. \nSteakatron 2000.\nIf you ever need to lead some cattle away to elsewhere, leave the trapdoors open, hit the water button until a sufficient number have escaped.\nCruddly's Porkatron 3000.\nIt greatly speeds up the production of &lt;a href=\"raw%20porkchop\"&gt;raw porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cooked%20porkchop\"&gt;cooked porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s by utilizing a gap made by a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt; with a block above to separate the pigs and piglets.\nLead your pigs via the operator stairs and gate into the slaughterhouse using carrots, potatoes, or beetroots.\nIt is advisable to briefly note these instructions on signs next to the machine.\nAdult pigs cannot fall through a single trapdoor. A single water source dispenser does not drown pigs in any block more than 1 square away. It is possible to use redstone dust to relocate all controls to the front of the machine or the operator gate area if so desired. It is also possible to use an inverter circuit to ensure the top gate and side gate are always in opposite states.\nSimple one minute sheep farm.\nThis machine is able to produce stacks of wool while being built in an effortless minute.\nCollection system:\nThese steps are illustrated below.\nShearing system:\nThese steps are illustrated below.\nMake sure the dispensers are well filled with shears and the machine automatically collects wool for you. Flick the lever to turn off\nYou can easily expand this design to add more dispensers by lengthening it on the side. You can also breed sheep inside this farm to give more opportunities to shear wool.\nFalling auto-spawn trap.\nYou need:\nChoose any place and put fences here, the fenced area can be bigger, but it's recommended to be big.\nIn this tutorial, the fenced area is small.\nMake a 2\u00d72 hole. It's recommended to be deep, but if it's smaller, read the optional part later.\nPlace a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; and open it.\nPlace four &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlace four more hoppers and make a hole in the wall.\nPlace two &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s at the front of the hopper, then place water and a double &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nMake a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; loop.\nClose the hole in the wall, where the redstone loop is. \nClose another hole in the wall. If you have a little hole or you want cooked steak, read the optional steps.\nPlace two &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThen place lava.\nHoglin farming.\nHoglins are a great source of food, but are typically hostile to players and can knock-off players to lava. Hoglins do have one weakness though, and that is warped fungus. Warped fungus repels hoglins and by making a platform for the hoglins to spawn, put the fungus near the edges with a fence on top to prevent the hoglins from getting stucked, a simple killing chamber filled with campfires or lava, a storage system and finally some trapdoors, a hoglin farm is finished.\nFor starters, you can build Shulkercraft's design. It's a fairly simple build and even with its small size it can still produce 1700 porkchops per hour. If you want a better and faster farm though, build Somecallmetimm. This farm is easily expandable by adding more layers. Link is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_txoXltWzs.\nSemi-automated farming.\nSheep farm.\nThis design can shear 100+ &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; in a minute.\nFirst, you need to make a , but with higher sides and about 12 blocks wide.\nWarning: If the gathering switch is turned on, ensure the harvesting/other water is off. If they are both on together, the sheep bounce over each other and escape.\nRemember, if one water is on, the other must be off. The procedure is as follows:\nAs you can now use shears in dispensers, fully automated wool farms designs are now available."}

{"id": "142682", "revid": "49340518", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=142682", "title": "Tutorials/Armor farming", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be farmed via random drops from &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, or by &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt;. While generally, large amounts of armor aren't required and can be crafted, a farm can be useful for creating decorative &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Stand\"&gt;armor stands&lt;/a&gt; or for visitors in a &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; world. \nVillager Trading Method.\nAn efficient way of farming &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=\"Trading\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt;. Armorer villagers and leatherworker villagers both will trade the player armor in return for &lt;a href=\"emeralds\"&gt;emeralds&lt;/a&gt;. The leatherworker is not recommended because it only trades for leather armor, which is one of the lowest-tiered armor in the game.\nGetting emeralds.\nIn order to get enough &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;emeralds&lt;/a&gt; to trade for armor, you are going to need to have an efficient way of getting emeralds. There are two different ways of doing this. One is making a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Redstone%20tips\"&gt;redstone farm&lt;/a&gt;, and trading the items you receive to the villagers. Another one is to construct a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Raid%20farming\"&gt;raid farm&lt;/a&gt;, which gets automatic emeralds through ongoing, simulated &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;raids&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedstone farm &amp; trade method.\nThe first way of getting large quantities of emeralds is to build a redstone farm which a villager will buy for cheap, and continuously trade that same item to multiple villagers of that profession. To do this you will need to trap multiple villagers inside of an area with a profession block in front of them (whichever villager trades the item you are making a redstone farm for) so that their profession changes to the villager of your choosing. Once you have an ample amount of them (4-6) you will also want to gather 4-6 armorer villagers so that you can farm the armor more easily. The armorer's profession block is a &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have done this, start working on contructing a redstone farm. Some farms that are very profitable in emeralds are:\nRaid farm method.\nThe raid farm method is where you construct a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Raid%20farming\"&gt;raid farm&lt;/a&gt; to farm emeralds, as well as various other items, including totems of undying. This can be a wonderful method because you only have to set up a raid farm, instead of set up a redstone farm, and trade to the villagers, going back and forth. Here are some links to tutorials to get started:\nTrading.\nOnce you have got enough emeralds, and once you have got all of your armorer villagers in place you must start to trade. The reason you want multiple of the armorer villagers is because a singular villager can only have a maximum of 10 trades, so to get every single option of armor, you will want multiple villagers with different trades. You will see that immediately there are some &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt; trades and you can trade for as many of those as you want. Once you upgrade the villagers to apprentice you may start to see trades for &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;chainmail armor&lt;/a&gt;. Then finally, at expert and master you will see &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;diamond armor&lt;/a&gt; trades. To upgrade a villager simply trade with them enough for the bar at the top to fill all the way up. Once it fills completely the villager will upgrade with new trades. You must be strategic with what you trade, because villagers can only trade 4 times for a certain trade at a time until they restock. Villagers can restock up to two times per game day.\nEnchanting.\nThe most efficient way to get the best set of armor is to put &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Book\"&gt;enchanted books&lt;/a&gt; on armor in the &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. You can stack up to six enchanted books on an item in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;survival mode&lt;/a&gt;, or up to 12 if you combine two books together and then put them on the armor piece. To get the best enchantments on your armor you will need to gather the enchanted books, gather the armor, and get levels and an anvil to combine them.\nGathering enchanted books.\nTo gather the perfect enchanted books for your armor there are many ways you can do it. You can trade with librarian villagers, put books in an enchanting table, or find them throughout the minecraft world. Enchanted books are crucial for this process.\nTrade with Villagers.\nOne way to get the enchanted books you need is to trade with librarian villagers. To do this you will need to gather a very large amount of villagers by constructing a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Villager%20farming\"&gt;villager breeder&lt;/a&gt;, and you will have to craft 12-16 &lt;a href=\"lectern\"&gt;lectern&lt;/a&gt; blocks (Those are the profession blocks for librarian villagers). Move the villages into an 1x1x2 space and place a lectern in front of them to convert them to librarians. If they do not have the enchanted book trade you like, you can break and re-place the lectern block over and over again to get the enchanted books you want. Next you will have to gather emeralds to trade with the villagers. Refer to the 'Getting Emeralds' section above for ways to get lots of emeralds.\nBooks in enchanting table.\nOne more strong way of getting enchanted books in &lt;a href=\"minecraft\"&gt;minecraft&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=\"Crafting\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Book\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and place them in an enchanting table along with &lt;a href=\"Enchanting/Levels\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;lapus lazuli&lt;/a&gt; to create some enchanted books. For better enchantments place &lt;a href=\"Bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; around the enchantment table. This is a relatively easy way to get enchanted books, but does require lapus lazuli, an enchanting table, lots of levels, and bookshelves, whereas the other method just requires villagers and emeralds.\nFinding in loot.\nThe final way to find enchanted books throughout your world is to explore the world for the various different naturally &lt;a href=\"Generated%20structures\"&gt;generating structures&lt;/a&gt; in minecraft, and searching for &lt;a href=\"Chest%20loot\"&gt;loot chests&lt;/a&gt; that can sometimes spawn enchanted books in. These structures include:\nGathering Armor, Anvils, and Levels.\nTo complete this method of combining books and your armor in an anvil you are going to need the following: Armor, Anvil, Levels. These items are pretty simple to gather and do not require much work.\nArmor.\nFirst you must choose what type of armor you want to enchant. You can choose &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;chainmail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended to use diamond armor, as you can get it easily, and upgrade those same pieces of armor to netherite later down the line.\nAnvil.\nAn anvil is crafted using three iron blocks and 4 iron totaling up to exactly 31 iron. In order to get this amount of iron you can &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; for iron using a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe\"&gt;stone pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; or above, or you can make an iron farm. It is recommended to mine 31 &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;smelt&lt;/a&gt; it in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have done this, in a crafting table place one iron in each slot of the table to make an iron block. Repeat this two more times. Then in the crafting table place the three iron blocks on the top three slots, on iron in the middle slot, and the three remaining iron in the bottom three slots. Then you can craft the Anvil. You may have to do this multiple times, just in case the anvil breaks from a lot of combining enchanted books and armor.\nObtaining Levels.\nThe final step is to obtain the correct amount of levels required to put the armor and the enchanted books together. There are many methods to do this effectively. Mining &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; underground is a great method of levels, and so is mining for &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt;. You can also wait for &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;nightfall&lt;/a&gt;, and kill some &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;hostile mobs&lt;/a&gt; for levels too. You can even make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20farm\"&gt;mob farm&lt;/a&gt;, or similar farms for &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombining Books.\nOnce you have all of the materials is is time to put them all together in an anvil. First place the piece of armor in the first slot of the anvil. Next, place the enchanted book in the second slot of the anvil, and in the third slot there will appear the piece of armor you will get after enchanting. The anvil will also show you how many levels it will cost you to put them together. Do not enchant yet. You are going to want to have all of the enchantments lined up and ready to enchant. Also, to get the most enchantments on a piece of armor, or any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, you must put the enchantments with the higher number first. For example, if you were putting a &lt;a href=\"unbreaking\"&gt;unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; III enchantment on the armor, but you also wanted to put &lt;a href=\"protection\"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt; IV on the armor, you should put the protection IV first so you can fit more enchantments on tools and armor.\nZombie Armor Farm (Bedrock version).\nThe only things required are a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. In order to farm the armor, you will have to first make a zombie farm, with the use of a zombie spawner dungeon. Once you have found it, surround the &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; (with the zombie spawner) completely with walls. Then, place water on one side so it creates a stream that runs to the other side. Where the water stops flowing, dig a 4 block deep hole in the ground. Place water so it fills the bottom two blocks of the hole. Dig two more blocks down and place a chest at the bottom and then a hopper above it. Finally, dig out a room with that chest in it so you can access the chest much easier.\nWhen a zombie spawns with armor or something in its hand, it will walk towards you while you are in that room. If you placed the water stream in the right place, it will fall into the stream and be pushed down into the hole. It will stay at the bottom and after a few moments, it will turn into a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;. It then instantly drops all of the items that it is attached to and the armor will have full &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. It should drop into the hopper and be moved into the chest, where you can grab it. You may also want to make a way that you can collect the armor in person because the armor sometimes floats up to the top of the water and avoids getting sucked up by the hopper. Occasionally, another drowned will pick up the armor, but will drop it when it dies, however it will not have full durability. Alternatively, you can use &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; to farm armor and tools. Master level tool smiths and armorers trade diamond tools and armor with enchantments. "}

Additionally, furnaces can be replaced with &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;s for faster cooking of &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; for faster smelting of &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"nugget\"&gt;nugget&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSemi-automatic furnace.\nThis semi-automatic design uses hoppers, and is not too difficult to build and is inexpensive.\nYou will need 3 &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, 3 &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s, and 1 &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;. The raw ingredients for this would be 8 &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, 15 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, and 12 logs of wood (48 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;).\nBuild instructions.\nSee below for a step-by-step guide on how to make this semi-automatic furnace design. Sneak (hold down ) to attach blocks to each block that has an inventory, such as attaching a hopper to a chest. Otherwise you will open the block instead of placing the block. \n\"Variations:\" You may choose to add &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;switches&lt;/a&gt; to control the hoppers. Switching off the bottom hopper stops it from taking items out, allowing you to collect the experience from smelting them. Switching off the top hopper allows you to fill the top chest with various items, then eventually smelt them all in one go, reducing the fuel waste normally incurred by smelting partial stacks. The fuel hopper on the side never needs to be switched off.\n\"Multiplayer:\" On servers that have chest and furnace protections, you may have to unlock these before the hoppers are able to interact with them.\nMaking two furnaces increases the rate of production much faster. Have a chest on top for the item to be smelted, and at the back, put a fuel chest.\nTiny fuel generator.\nCharcoal.\nThis design lets a furnace producing &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; feed its product back into the furnace to fuel itself. It needs to be started off with one piece of charcoal (or for that matter, any fuel) in the chest. If more than 5-6 stacks of wood are available, another chest for input can be placed atop the upper hopper. Note that this design uses a &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt;, which requires access to &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe chest will not start receiving charcoal until both the furnace and the hopper feeding it fuel (level 2) are full. However, the hopper can be \"stuffed\" with four non-fuel items in its last four slots, as long as you leave the first slot open for fuel. Then the chest will start getting charcoal after two stacks of charcoal are produced, which will require 2- stacks of wood. \nSee the following video for an example of how to make this:\nLarge smelters.\nThese smelters are designed to be extendable and handle large amounts of items.\nMumbo Jumbo's design.\nThis design can go up to 6 smelters and can produce, at most, 6 times faster. \nilmango's design.\nThis design is more recent and more efficient due to the new blocks."}

Two basic methods of farming axolotl are available: &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; and natural spawning.\nLocating lush caves.\nAxolotls only spawn in the &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; biome. These biomes can be hard to find, but some knowledge about biome generation in \"Minecraft\" can make it a lot easier.\nThe easiest way to find a lush caves is of course to dig down under an &lt;a href=\"azalea%20tree\"&gt;azalea tree&lt;/a&gt;. However, azalea trees do not always generate above lush caves, making some lush caves harder to locate. Luckily, azalea trees are not the only above-ground indicators for lush caves; the type of surface biome can also give out valuable information.\nLush caves only generate under biomes with high &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; values. These include temperate biomes such as &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt;s, warm biomes such as &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s, and cold biomes such as &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;. A few biomes, in particular, are almost \"guaranteed\" to have lush caves below them:\nThese biomes have the highest humidity values in the game, high enough so that lush caves always try to generate below them. The only case where there might \"not\" be lush caves below, is that &lt;a href=\"dripstone%20caves\"&gt;dripstone caves&lt;/a&gt; generate instead. This can be easily predicted, because dripstone caves only generate far away from the ocean. This means that if you find a dark forest, bamboo jungle or old growth taiga close to the ocean, it is absolutely guaranteed that there's a lush caves biome below you!\nBreeding.\nBreeding adult axolotls requires &lt;a href=\"buckets%20of%20tropical%20fish\"&gt;buckets of tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;. This a time-consuming manual effort. Feed two axolotls to put them into love mode, after which a baby axolotl spawns. The parents have a \"cooldown\" period of 5 minutes or 1 minute before they can be bred again. The baby axolotl has a chance to be blue, otherwise it inherits the color of one parent. A baby becomes an adult in 20 minutes (or sooner if you feed it), after which it can breed.\nOnce you have a blue axolotl, you can breed it to gain more blue ones, because each new baby has a 50% chance of inheriting the color of one parent.\nConsiderations.\nThe problems with breeding are time and resources. Because you need to breed axolotls many times before getting a blue one, you need many tropical fish. Consequently you need many &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, which in turn require many &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s to craft, or many &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s to buy buckets from &lt;a href=\"fisherman\"&gt;fisherman&lt;/a&gt; villagers. Some advanced items to make things easier are:\nLocation and breeding pen.\nBecause buckets of tropical fish are not stackable and difficult to carry, the best place to breed axolotls is a biome where tropical fish naturally spawn. Tropical fish spawn in , , , , and . The following example is in a warm ocean.\nOnce you have the materials you need, find a &lt;a href=\"warm%20ocean\"&gt;warm ocean&lt;/a&gt; and create a large holding pen for your axolotls. You can do this on land next to the warm ocean, or simply cordon off a section of the ocean, or carve an inlet into a beach. Build the pen so that the walls are at least one block higher than the water level, to prevent the axolotls from escaping. You can put a ladder in the pen to allow you to get in and out.\nThe breeding pen doesn't have to be deep. One layer of water is sufficient for axolotls to breed. A shallow breeding pen allows you to feed the axolotls without having to swim.\nIt is very important to build an additional layer of blocks on the sides of the breeding pen. Axolotls sometimes climb on land, in search of deeper water nearby, so if your breeding pen doesn't have a barrier, they are bound to escape to the ocean outside where the water is deeper. This also makes it hard for the player to get out of water, so you may put a &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; on the side of the breeding pen (like a real-life swimming pool), or use a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; on the side that's normally in the \"open\" (vertical) position, and flip it to \"close\" (horizontal) when you need to get out.\nBecause axolotls are agile swimmers, it often happens that when you try to feed buckets of tropical fish to them, you miss and hit the bottom of the pool instead, releasing the fish which get instantly killed by axolotls. A solution to this problem is to build the entire floor of the breeding pen out of s: when you accidentally hit on them, you tune the noteblock instead, and the fish don't get released from their buckets.\nIn \"Java Edition\", &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; don't spawn in shallow water, although they can in Bedrock Edition. Either way, light up the border around the pen to prevent hostile mobs from spawning in it.\nBreeding stock.\nYou need to find two axolotls to start breeding. Axolotls spawn underwater &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt;, where there is &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom. When you see an axolotl, use a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; on it to capture it. The bucket must not be empty when you do this; it must contain water.\nIf you hold a &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20tropical%20fish\"&gt;bucket of tropical fish&lt;/a&gt; in your hand while hunting, an axolotl that you didn't see may start following you.\nFood supply and breeding.\nHunt for &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;, using as many water buckets as you can carry.\nIn \"Java Edition\", when you feed your axolotls to breed them, it is a good idea to hold one bucket of tropical fish in your &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; to maintain the axolotls' attention. If not, as soon as you feed one, you are holding an empty bucket, causing the axolotls to lose interest and swim away until you switch to another bucket of fish. You cannot hold a bucket in your off-hand in Bedrock Edition.\nWith luck, you might get a blue axolotl before you have bred 1,200 non-blue ones.\nNatural generation farm.\nFor axolotls to spawn, they require a water space in a &lt;a href=\"lush%20cave\"&gt;lush cave&lt;/a&gt; in total darkness, with &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; blocks within five blocks below the spawning space. These conditions can also be achieved in an player-built underground lush cave room filled with four or five layers of water. Additionally, Bedrock Edition requires the ceiling of the room to consist of opaque blocks.\nIf the spawning room is below level Y=30, the conditions that cause axolotls to spawn also cause &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt; to spawn. Because axolotls kill squid, you can arrange the farm so that the &lt;a href=\"glow%20ink%20sac\"&gt;glow ink sac&lt;/a&gt;s dropped by the squid are swept into a collection chest. Or if you don't care about glow ink sacs, you can make the farm even simpler by ignoring them; the ink sacs disappear after 5 minutes.\nThe example farm described below is easy and quick to build in survival mode with common materials and stone tools. In fact, if you are interested in breeding a blue axolotl, it may be easier (and safer!) to build a simple farm to get your breeding stock, rather than hunting for axolotl in the wild.\nLocation.\nPick a location on in a &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; biome. It doesn't have to be in an actual lush cave, just in the biome. You can repurpose a lush cave to a spawning room also.\nThe ceiling of your farm must be below layer 63 (sea level), as deep as you want, although prior to &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.18\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.18&lt;/a&gt; the floor of the farm should not be below layer 0. The distance between the floor and ceiling should be at least 5 blocks (6 blocks is best, to give you breathing room).\nExample farm.\nThe diagram below illustrates the concept. The spawning room area is 8\u00d78, and 6 blocks high. The 8\u00d78 dimensions were chosen because it requires only one hopper, but different room sizes and shapes are possible with a carefully planned arrangement of flowing water and hoppers. The hopper is needed only to collect glow ink sacs. If you don't care, then don't bother with the hopper.\nThe floor of the room should be &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; because axolotls spawn only when clay is underneath the spawning space.\nWater source blocks occupy the bottom four layers of the room. The fifth layer has a row of water source blocks on one side, and one more opposite the hopper, to create a water flow that pushes items toward the hopper. It can be tedious to get this top layer of water flowing properly, because water on top of water does not spread like water on a solid surface. Place easily-breakable blocks like &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; under the end of the flow to force it to spread, then break the block and repeat until the water is fully spread out. It helps to have a &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; effect active while doing this.\nThe hopper should be two blocks below the flowing water (one block below the top-most water source block). Placing the hopper just below the flowing water layer (which would be normal for water flowing on top of a solid surface instead of on top of more water) risks items getting trapped under the hopper. Place a button or sign on one wall above the hopper to prevent water from flowing in. Then, when an item is pushed into the corner by the flowing water, it falls one block down into the hopper.\nIf you don't care about collecting ink sacs, you don't need the hopper or flowing water, and the farm becomes trivially quick to build. Just make the room six blocks high and fill it with five layers of water, leaving the top layer as air for you to breathe and place temporary torches for lighting during construction.\nWater flow management and item collection.\nThe flow in the top layer is managed by first placing the row of water blocks along the wall, which makes a short waterfall into the next row but does not extend all the way across the room, as water would normally do on a solid surface. You must place a row of easy-to-break blocks just underneath the waterfall row to force the water flow to extend one more row. For this purpose, &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; can be mined instantly without tools, and &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; can be broken quickly with a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;. Break the temporary underwater blocks and repeat for the next waterfall row, working your way all the way to the opposite wall to get the top layer of water flowing from one wall to the other. Finally, place a water block opposite the hopper to cause the combined flows to sweep all floating items into the hopper.\nAn upside-down &lt;a href=\"cobblestone%20stairs\"&gt;cobblestone stairs&lt;/a&gt; block is placed above the chest to prevent axolotls from leaving the room but still allow the chest to open. A block of sand is placed in front of the chest to provide a final seal to prevent any light from reaching the interior of the room. You just need to break this block to open the chest.\nBack door access.\nThere is ladder in the entrance area near the chest to get in and out of the farm. A path runs from the entrance around the back of the spawning room, leading to a door at the corner opposite the hopper. Due to the circuitous path and distance from the torch in the entrance area, no light reaches this door. This door is useful for entering the room to catch axolotls that spawn.\nThe path that runs around the back of the room is dark by design. This means that hostile mobs can spawn there. It is a good idea to line the path with bottom slabs to prevent any mobs from spawning in that path.\nYou should be able to see the door sufficiently in the dark to open it, or you can place a temporary torch in the hallway. Just be sure to remove this torch when you leave.\nOperation.\nOnce you have removed your temporary torches and blocked all the light from your chest collection room, the farm is active, but you need to move yourself more than 24 blocks away from the farm for anything to start spawning in it.\nGlow squid spawn more easily than axolotl, but when axolotl spawn, they start killing the glow squid, causing them to drop their ink sacs, which float upward and are swept into the collection chest, which you access by removing the temporary block of sand that's in front of the chest to prevent light from entering the room.\nTo gather axolotls, go through the back door with buckets of water. Even though the hallway is pitch dark, once you pass through the door into the water, your underwater vision is sufficient to see axolotl in the room and catch them in your water buckets. An axolotl may wander out the door into the hallway. That's OK, you can still catch it. If you want to keep axolotls around, you need to interact with them (feed them, breed them), otherwise they may despawn again."}

Aside from being used as a decoration piece, &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to craft &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s, make &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20planks\"&gt;bamboo planks&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;/... and even use it as an alternative fuel source to &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nYou can get &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; by breaking it with any tool. A &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is the most efficient tool for the job. By not cutting bamboo at the bottom it will regrow just like &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike many crops, bamboo does not need water. Also, it can grow far higher than others.\nAutomatic bamboo farming design.\nBamboo can be planted on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss\"&gt;moss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;. At default random tick speed (3), each plant grows approximately every . When &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; is on it, it grows by 1\u20132 &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;. Bamboo can grow up to 12\u201316 blocks tall. The top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow.\nHow to build an automatic bamboo farm.\nPlant a double row of 8 bamboo on mud blocks to make a 16 block farm. \nPlace a hopper/hopper cart collection system underneath the 16 mud blocks. Use a double row of 8 pistons to break the two rows of bamboo toward each other, and into the collection system. Use an observer placed 5 blocks above the seed bamboo to activate the harvest system. \nUse a secondary timer to clear the bamboo that fell after the first break. Limit the height of the bamboo to 12 blocks above the seed bamboo. Ensure that your bamboo has adequate light to grow.\nAn Infinite Fuel Source.\nConnect the bamboo farm to a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; to fuel it indefinitely. Bamboo burns quickly (0.25 items) so it needs a sizable bamboo farm to keep it burning."}

From &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; books, many items can be obtained from bartering.\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglins\"&gt;Piglins&lt;/a&gt; are neutral mobs that spawn in &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s. Piglins are also armed with &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gold%20sword\"&gt;gold sword&lt;/a&gt;s. An easy way to make them friendly with you is to wear any piece of gold armor. It is recommended to use the boots section, which is the cheapest and leaves the other armor slots for more powerful armor. It is also a good idea to build a piglin farm away from &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"soul%20fire\"&gt;soul fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul%20torch\"&gt;soul torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"soul%20campfire\"&gt;soul campfire&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"soul%20lantern\"&gt;soul lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, because they will run away from them. An exception is if they are caged up with blocks. These objects can also be used to lead piglins to a certain place. Also, piglin farms must be built in the nether, or else piglins will &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglins\"&gt;zombify&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most hostile mobs, they do not despawn in peaceful mode, but still follow normal hostile mob despawning rules. If you are caging up piglins for easier bartering, you will need to use &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;s on them or give them a piece of gold &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, which will prevent them from despawning.\nGold farming.\nYou need to have a source of gold to run the farm, either from a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Zombified%20piglin%20farming\"&gt;zombified piglin farm&lt;/a&gt; or from another source, such as mining.\nAFK farming.\nAn AFK farm is linked to a zombified piglin farm, then it can travel through a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; system (&lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; currents cannot be used as the nether instantly evaporates it upon placing the water bucket) and drop out of a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;, and collects through a hopper system. To make the farm more effective, make a hopper organizer, as seen in this YouTube video."}

{"id": "25716", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25716", "title": "Tutorials/Beating a challenge map", "text": "This tutorial contains many tips on how to complete a challenge map. Most of this tutorial is based on \"complete the monument\" styled maps, but will apply to any type of challenge map.\nTerms.\nThere are many terms used to describe features in Minecraft challenge maps. Here is a list of some of them:\nUseful things to know.\nChallenge maps can include a variety of difficult obstacles. Here are some tips that can be handy when completing a challenge map:\nDamage.\nMobs become easier to kill when you know how many hits they take with your weapons. It's also good to know how much damage a weapon does if you need to know which one of your weapons is the strongest.\nA weapon made with a not-so-good material that has a high enchantment is better than an unenchanted weapon made with a good quality material. For example, a wooden sword enchanted with Sharpness IV does more damage than an unenchanted iron sword.\nFighting mobs.\nMany challenge maps will have mobs that the player is required to fight. Different tactics should be used for different circumstances.\nLarge groups of mobs.\nIf there are several mobs in a group, it is best to walk backwards, away from the group. If there is a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; within the group, let it explode, and it will kill most of the mobs within the group. However, make sure not to be too close when it explodes, as it will damage you.\nMobs with less health.\nMobs with less health generally mean any type of mob with 10 or fewer hearts, such as &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"magma%20cubes\"&gt;magma cubes&lt;/a&gt;. If you can, build a barricade around yourself, which will prevent them from getting inside. Take them out by bow, even in close range.\nSkeletons.\nTry and use your &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; if you don't have at least a 3-hit kill weapon. &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s will attempt to knock back players in close range by firing arrows quickly. Skeletons will not notice the player if at least 16 blocks away, so it's recommended to shoot at skeletons from this range.\nBlazes.\nA &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;potion of Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; is extremely useful to drink when fighting against &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, as their fireballs are their only long-range weapon. If you get too close during melee combat, however, they are still able to deal damage without shooting fireballs.\nGhasts.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt;s can be extremely annoying in maps, because they are not only able to break blocks and set things on fire, but they will also often fly away from the player, making them hard to kill.\nWhen on a challenge map, it's best to kill ghasts as soon as possible. To kill a ghast, \"aim for the body\", or hit the fireballs it sends at you back to it.\nGhasts cannot break &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; or anything with higher damage resistance, so you can use that to your advantage. Always build with cobblestone, if you have some.\nSilverfish.\nOften, a mapmaker will create a passageway with walls of &lt;a href=\"monster%20egg\"&gt;monster egg&lt;/a&gt;s. If you break one of these blocks, it will spawn a &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, which, when attacked, will spawn even more silverfish from adjacent blocks. A silverfish will not call for help if it is killed in one shot by a player, or if it died by \"natural\" causes.\nA Silverfish has 4 hearts of health. Here are some ways of killing a silverfish without it spawning more silverfish:\nEndermen.\nAn easy way to defeat &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; is to stand in 1-block deep water 2 blocks from shore, and attack them repeatedly. This makes you safe against their attacks, and the water will damage the endermen.\nConquering dungeons.\nFunboxes.\nFunboxes are a term commonly used in the Minecraft community, describing 27 &lt;a href=\"spawners\"&gt;spawners&lt;/a&gt; arranged in a 3x3x3 manner. It can be very hard to defeat one of these without dying, because of the massive number of mobs that funboxes can spawn at once. Here are some strategies for disabling them:\nLava.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest and most effective way of disabling a funbox. It lights up the area around the funbox, disabling the spawners, and kills any monsters already spawned by the funbox.\nTo use lava, get within block-placing range of the funbox, and pour lava on it.\nIf the funbox is out of reach, you can alternatively bridge over to the funbox and pour lava from above.\nCannons.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/TNT%20cannons\"&gt;TNT cannon&lt;/a&gt; can be a fun and fairly effective way to dispatch funboxes. However, TNT can do great damage to players and blocks, so be careful with this method so that you don't blow up a chest or die.\nTunneling.\nTunneling is another method of disabling a funbox. The easiest way of tunneling toward a funbox is to go from below, as most funboxes are placed out in the open. Make sure to light up your tunnel very well while you tunnel towards it, as if your tunnel is too dark, monsters may spawn.\nAfter disabling.\nIf the funbox is inside of a dungeon, it's best to break it, as creepers can destroy lighting around a funbox (and thereby reactivating it). You can additionally get experience if you mine the spawners. \nIf the funbox is near your base, you can turn it into a fast mob grinder for drops or experience.\nBig rooms.\nBig rooms are dungeons that are located in a very large room. The monster spawners are often spread out in big rooms to challenge the player extra, making it difficult to light the area up enough to prevent mob spawns.\nRunthrough.\nDrink a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Swiftness\"&gt;potion of Swiftness&lt;/a&gt; and charge into the area, placing torches where you can. This is very dangerous, but very effective as well, as you will be covering large areas, and therefore disabling lots of spawners.\nCharge and retreat.\nGo into the room, quickly light up as much as possible, and retreat back to a safe spot, before repeating. This method is effective, but it is slow and rather dangerous.\nTunneling.\nDig tunnels under the floor so that there is one block between the tunnel and the room. Every once in a while, mine a block above you and place a light-emitting block in the room above, before quickly sealing the opening again. This will disable most of the spawners and will make the Charge and Retreat method much easier. Using lava as the light-emitting block is very effective, but also dangerous.\nTunneling to the top of the dungeon and pouring lava from above is a much safer way of doing this.\nLandscapes.\nA landscape is an area on a map that is bigger than even a big room, containing several little dungeons for you to conquer. There are also usually areas on the other side of these landscapes, making these areas much more annoying.\nTransportation.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s is a very effective way of moving around the landscape. You could also make a tunnel under the landscape for safe travel at night, but this takes a lot of time, and is not as efficient.\nVoid rooms.\nVoid rooms are rooms that have areas which open up to the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. If you fall off of the main platforms, you will lose your inventory most of the time.\nGo slow and steady in these areas. Don't take unnecessary risks. Block off any holes to the Void that you can reach, and be very careful of sand or gravel.\nBridging.\nIf there is a gap between two platforms, make a very secure bridge. Place blocks to the left and right of you, in addition to below you. However, note that if auto-jump is enabled, the barriers on the left and right of you would have to be 2 blocks tall in order for them to be effective.\nIf there are too many mobs on the platform where you are heading, it is best to make a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; bridge, if possible. Place a piston facing the platform, and repeatedly have it push blocks. Do this three times: one for the floor, and two for the rails on both sides.\nMazes.\nMazes are found occasionally in maps. If the Adventure map is in Survival mode rather than Adventure, mazes are often made of bedrock, so that they can't be mined through.\nHug a wall.\nBefore starting, choose one direction to go and stick with it, as this will make getting out easier later on. When you're at a split in the road, mark the way you entered, and then follow the path in the direction chosen above. If you hit a dead end, go back to the last split road, and mark that section correspondingly. Another way to find your way out of a maze is to walk alongside one side of the wall. It's a time-consuming method, but as long as there are no loops in the maze, you're bound to find your way out eventually.\nFighting in mazes.\nA common trick that map creators may do sometimes is to put spawners within the mazes, making it harder to move around. It's important to use corners to your advantage in combat. It's not recommended to use lava, as this will make it harder to penetrate further into the maze. Shields can be good in a 1-block wide situation. \nWhat to watch out for.\nSand and gravel.\nIn general, a &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; trap is a trap involving floating sand or gravel. When you place a block or a torch on it, it will fall, which will likely reveal lava, a pit of monsters, the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, or fall onto a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; connected to TNT.\nSand traps that expose areas are unavoidable; however, you can avoid the redstone-style sand trap by being wary. If you see a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, or something of that sort, make sure you have a way of getting away before breaking it.\nTNT.\nMap creators will often create something in a map that looks like a reward, but in reality is a deadly trap. Always be on the lookout for something suspicious, as this could very well be &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Also, some maps take advantage of external tools or data values in commands, and make it so that TNT will detonate when hit like it did in earlier Minecraft versions. This makes it impossible to destroy without detonating. In that case, you can pour &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on it\nPits.\nAlthough pits are easy to dodge within corridors, if you are distracted by something, such as combat, you may unconsciously fall into a pit. Always block off pits that may lead to deadly traps, if possible. Also, if you're fighting and you know that there are deadly pits nearby, make sure to move away from them.\nRedstone-related items.\nIt's important to be aware of &lt;a href=\"buttons\"&gt;buttons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"levers\"&gt;levers&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plates\"&gt;pressure plates&lt;/a&gt;. Redstone circuits can be made to do virtually anything, so if you see an \"innocent\" pressure plate lying about, block it off, or avoid stepping on it.\nMovement-affecting blocks.\nThese include &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;. Soul sand makes you walk slower through an area, ice makes the ground slippery, and vines can be distracting when fighting against walls. Although these will not directly kill you, they can be a pain if you're trying to do something risky, such as fighting mobs. Therefore, try to stay away from soul sand or ice, and avoid being cornered by mobs in a vine-filled area.\nPreparations.\nYour inventory.\nIt's best to pack lightly when going into a dungeon, as you don't want to lose too many things if you die.\nHere are some good things to have in your inventory:\nIf rescuing another player from mobs in a dungeon, you should have:\nHere are some good potions to bring along:\nThe base.\nGenerally, most people build their bases around the Victory Monument, but some mapmakers have been annoyed with the monuments (e.g. dying zombies, growing vines), so it is best to build it relatively close, but not too close.\nA base should be monster-safe, and contain basic necessities, such as &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. The following things are also good to have in your base:\nFood farm.\nIn most maps, the best renewable types of food are &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es. They are very easy to farm, and they feed a decent amount (Carrots heal and baked potatoes heal .) The following video is of an effective semi-automatic farm design, that is designed for wheat, but can easily work for carrots and potatoes.\nIf there are &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s in the map, then it is best to get a &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; farm started in addition to the carrots/potatoes. &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20porkchops\"&gt;Cooked porkchops&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"steak\"&gt;steak&lt;/a&gt; heal , making it the best easily accessible food in the game.\nA melon farm, unless very big, is not recommended, as &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s only feed , and melons grow rather slowly.\nIf there are &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s in the map and you spend a lot of time at the base, then a good idea would be an automatic chicken cooker, as that will provide &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Chicken\"&gt;Cooked Chicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feather\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt;s automatically. &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Chicken\"&gt;Cooked Chicken&lt;/a&gt; heals , making automatic chicken a good food source.\nMonster XP farm.\nYou will usually only need a monster trap in extreme cases, where it's impossible to continue the map without enchanting your gear.\nThe easiest way to make an XP farm is to set up a spawner trap around a funbox, preferably very high up, so that the mobs are around 1/2 hearts when they fall, so that they can be killed in 1 hit.\nTree farm.\n&lt;a href=\"Wood\"&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt; is undeniably the most important resource in Minecraft. In challenge maps, you will often need plenty of it, making a farm very useful.\nCobblestone farm.\nA &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; farm is usually only necessary when you need lots of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; or cobblestone. The following layout is an easy way to make a cobblestone farm:\n12 Pyramids.\nRecently, I have introduced a new map type known as \"&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creating_a_challenge_map\"&gt;12 Pyramids&lt;/a&gt;\". In case someone decides to make one, here is how to play.\nHow to play.\n First, complete the first pyramid. They look messy and randomly thrown together because they use things derived from a randomizer. That is what makes it eXcItInG! Once you completed the first pyramid, you get teleported back to the world spawn, and have your invetory cleared. Other times people will skip this, and let you keep them. I would let you keep the items for the first three pyramids, and then it will start reseting. Once at spawn, the next pyramid will be unlocked.\nItems.\nWithin the randomizer, there is only a chance that light-emmiting sources will be created in the randomizer, meaning there will be mobs. Lots of mobs. Sometimes, there will be weapons, tools, armour and consumables to aid you on your adventure. Due to the randomizer, nothing will be enchanted, unless the map-makers manually enchant them. Banner pattern will be player-selected, mine would always be the &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt; banner pattern (a.k.a Snout banner pattern, known as piglin_banner_pattern internally).\nDifficulty.\nI told them for the extra challenge they could set the difficulty to hard, but not hardcore. Some people could make the map like \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;\", and turn mob spawning off, name the mobs, and maybe even add spawners to the mix, with tools that can break spawners, and maybe quicker if they want breaking possible. At the end, you may get a prize or not, it depends on the person making the map."}

It mainly teaches you what to do on your first day, so you can safely survive the first night.\nBefore reading this page, it's expected that you have already bought and downloaded the game. You must create a new world before starting the tutorial.\nYour character can die in this game, but if you aren't in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;, that \"doesn't\" end the game. Instead, it's mostly an inconvenience. If you take enough damage to die, your things drop where you died, and your character respawns elsewhere. Initially this is near where you started (the \"world spawn\"), but using a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; lets you pick the spot. \nControls and interface.\nMinecraft is a sandbox game in which your character wanders around in a world, collecting resources and utilizing them to craft various items. To gain an advantage, you need to understand all the different techniques and abilities of the control system. If you are having trouble, you may want to start with a Peaceful Mode world to practice and, if necessary, change the keyboard bindings. The world in Minecraft is composed of blocks, mostly cubical and of various shapes, giving everything a blocky and pixelated appearance. These blocks not only represent objects in the game but also serve as a standard measure of distance, with each block being officially defined as a one-meter cube. Your character can occupy a single block's space and stands a little less than two blocks tall.\nTime passes within this world, and a game day lasts for 20 real-world minutes. Nighttime is much more dangerous than daytime: the game starts at dawn, and you have 10 minutes of game time before nightfall. The primary purpose of this guide is to help you \"find your feet,\" acquire basic equipment, and build shelter before nightfall. Hostile or neutral mobs spawn when night falls, and most of these mobs are dangerous, trying to attack you. It's essential to craft a bed so that you can sleep through the night and quickly transition from nighttime to daytime.\nThis article mostly assumes you are playing on \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" or desktop versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", where you use your keyboard and mouse to interact with the game. The &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;Controls&lt;/a&gt; page gives you a complete overview of all the controls and every control that does a action, or shows up a certain GUI.\nThis and other articles generally refer to controls by their default bindings. Most of the controls can be changed in the game's options menu, by clicking on the one you want to change, and then pressing the key you want to use for that control. If you are already using that key for something else, then it turns red.\n, when you start the game for the first time, a short in-game tutorial appears to explain the basics of how to move and look around in the corner of the screen.\nWhen moving around the world and dealing with blocks and creatures in the world, there are four basic operations, each discussed below:\nControl related.\nAgain, most of this article assumes you are using keyboard and mouse, but here is a brief summary for other control methods such as game controllers or touchscreens: \nMining, attacking, and \"using\" items all require targeting a spot on the screen. Many versions of the game have a cursor in the center of the screen used for targeting, but touchscreens allow the player to tap on the screen to act as the targeting spot. Only blocks near you can be targeted, and you can tell a block is targeted by it having an outline around it (or, in the case of touchscreens, being brighter). This selected area or block affects the way you use these actions. For example, using is based on what you are looking at and what is in your hand. Less obviously, the player's actions of attacking and mining also use this cursor or selector method. The buttons for both attacking and mining are always the same, but attacking is only a tap of the control while mining requires holding down the control. These actions may use up blocks and change tools that you are holding and also change depending on your held item. Any time this tutorial uses verbs describing in-game actions, you may want to test out that action using the controls page as a reference.\nMovement.\nMoving the mouse (or trackball, for simplicity we refer to the mouse) forward and back causes your character to look upward and downward. Moving the mouse left and right causes your character to \"turn\" in that direction, changing which direction is \"forward\". The keys moves your character left, forward, backward and right, respectively; note that none of these make your character turn around or even look in the direction you're moving. Be careful about moving to the sides or backward without knowing what's there, as you can fall off cliffs or otherwise run into danger! Looking around also lets you pick out individual blocks or creatures to interact with, see below. Walking off of the edge of a horizontal surface results in you falling. If you fall more than three blocks (and not into water) you take damage depending on the distance fallen. If you fall into the water below your head, you end up drowning unless you swim back to the surface. And if you fall into lava, you quickly burn to death! So, moving around in the Minecraft world, you need to exercise basic caution at all times.\nDouble-tapping and holding the \"forward\" key (again, by default), or pressing while moving forward, causes you to &lt;a href=\"Sprinting\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;, running faster (but this consumes food more quickly). If you fall into water, the same keys let you &lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; around.\nThe lets you &lt;a href=\"Jumping\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt;; you can jump one-and-a-quarter blocks high, and can also jump across a two block gap in the ground (four blocks if sprinting). By default, walking into a one-block-higher edge automatically makes you jump up to the new level, but there are still many situations where you need to jump upward. If you turn off Auto-Jump you need to explicitly jump up to higher terrain. If you fall into water (or lava!), this same key is how you move upward toward the surface, and jump out onto the shore.\nThe key makes you \"&lt;a href=\"Sneaking\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt;\". While sneaking, your viewpoint gets a little lower, and you move slower than the casual walking speed. The benefit of sneaking is that you cannot fall off the edge of a block; in fact, you can sneak slightly over the edge of a block, to look at and interact with the side of the block you're standing on.\nIt is also a possibility for your character to &lt;a href=\"Crawling\"&gt;crawl&lt;/a&gt;, but this is more of a complex control. See the article \"&lt;a href=\"Crawling\"&gt;Crawling&lt;/a&gt;\" for full details and how to use the crawling control.\nBreaking blocks and using items.\nTo interact with blocks, you need to move relatively close (within four or five blocks distance), and \"focus\" on the block by moving your cursor (the crosshairs) over the block you want to interact with.\nPressing the left button hits whatever you are focused on. Suppose you want to dig a piece of wood, focus on that piece of &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; and keep holding the left button until it shatters and drops a &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;. This is also how you attack animals or monsters later. Holding down the button on a block continues hitting it, eventually breaking it, making a block pop up in your inventory. This is generally how you collect materials from the world. Some blocks require particular tools to collect them, like &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt;, but the first two sorts of blocks you collect are likely &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; (grass blocks count as dirt), and both of those can be gathered with your bare hands, and no tools. Holding something that is not a tool (such as wood blocks or dirt) or using the wrong tool to dig blocks is still the same speed as unarmed, does not improve mining efficiency, and if you use the wrong tool to mine, the tool will be deducted of durability! Generally when you start a world, the first thing you should do is to find some trees and break a few blocks of wood out of their trunks (\"punching wood\"). Once broken, the blocks drop as loose items, leaving a floating block on the ground, representing the block you broke, which you can move toward to collect. Holding something that \"isn't\" a tool (say, the block of wood or dirt you just picked up) still counts as \"bare hands\". Other things seen around you, such as &lt;a href=\"Tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"flowers\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt;, still count as blocks despite not being square, but they don't necessarily \"drop themselves\" when hit. For example, tall grass usually drops nothing, but sometimes drops &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, which you can later plant to grow wheat for making bread to eat.\nThe right button is more complex: This is the \"Use\" command, with effects that depend not only on what you're pointing at, but on what you're holding. There are special blocks (such as the \"crafting table\" discussed below) that open a interactable GUI when used, but if you are not pointing at one of these, you just use whatever you currently hold. There are various tools that are used for their respective purposes, but at first you're probably holding a block of wood or dirt, and the \"use\" of a block is to place the block you're holding down into the world. When you place this block, it leaves your hand, using up 1 block leaving \u22121 of the number of blocks you had in the beginning. Simple blocks like these can be placed on any surface of a block that's already in the world having a block on top, but more complicated blocks such as flowers can be put only in particular places (e.g. the top of a grass or dirt block) and can not be stacked with another block. If you are pointing at a block that does have its own use, but you want to place a block on it (instead of, say, opening the GUI for a crafting table), you can \"sneak\" while placing the block, and you have the block on top of the block with the GUI, without opening and interacting with the GUI on the block. To place a block underneath you, press and click right click before you hit the ground, and you end up on a block you placed.\nWhen you eventually encounter a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;, you can also right-click on them to buy and sell items, trading for emeralds to buy the item.\nCombat.\nSurviving in \"Minecraft\" often requires a knowledge of the game's &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; mechanics. There are two combat systems that exist in \"Minecraft\" \u2013 the system in the \"Java Edition\" and the system in all other versions. In \"Java Edition\", without a tool in the player's hand, any attack deals 1 health point () of damage. In Bedrock Edition, a bare-handed attack deals 2 health points () of damage. Tools in general do a great deal more damage, and do more damage the higher their tier. In general, swords do make the best weapons, followed closely by &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s. Pickaxes do less damage, and shovels do the least. Hitting a creature with a sword uses up 1 point of its durability, while using any other tool uses up 2 points of the tool's durability. When a creature is hit, it turns red for a half second, marking its \"invulnerability period\". A second attack in this time does no damage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; mechanics for non-Java platforms are simple: While three blocks away or closer to a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, the player can attack that entity by clicking the attack &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; while their cursor is over the entity. Clicking speed does not affect the combat, instead, a player's skill in combat is based more on their hit accuracy. The basic tools from above each deal multiple hearts of damage when the player attacks an entity while holding that tool.\nIn the Java Edition, a slightly different combat system is used. To attack any &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt;, the player still must have the cursor hovering over the entity and be within three blocks of the entity when they press the attack button. However, after attacking, the weapon enters a brief \"cooldown\" period, indicated by the position of the weapon in the player's hand, and also by an icon in the hotbar. This happens even if you missed, or if the target was still invulnerable for a previous attack! Different basic tools have different cooldowns between hits. If the player attacks while still in a cooldown period, the attack deals much less damage, making it more important to aim your attacks. In Java Edition, axes do far more damage per hit than swords, but their cooldown period is much longer, giving them lower overall damage than swords over time. They also still wear out twice as fast as a sword.\nIn addition to attacking, the player can also block attacks with the &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. (Crafting a shield requires first obtaining an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;, so it's unlikely to get one for your first day.) A shield completely negates any damage when it is raised with the right mouse button or sneaking. , a shield can be temporarily disabled if attacked with an axe.\nIf the player jumps right before he hits an enemy,the hit will be critical and deal much more damage.\nItems and inventory.\nPicking a loose item up is as simple as walking over or near the item. To drop the item in your hand (see below), use the \"throw\" key, which defaults to . The item gets tossed two or three blocks in the direction you are looking. Pick it back up by walking over to it. In multiplayer, you can use this to give an item to another player \u2014 just throw the item toward them and they pick it up. You can also drop items or stacks of items using the Inventory GUI, discussed below.\nPro tip: On standard keyboards, the key is right next to the movement keys. This makes it \"very\" easy to accidentally throw away the item you're currently using, which may be a valuable tool. Many players prefer to change the \"throw/drop\" function to another key, such as or . (OK) All of these controls and more can be viewed by pressing Esc -&gt; Options -&gt; Controls. \nFrom the start of the game, you can see nine special inventory slots, called your \"hotbar\", but you also have more slots that are normally hidden. As you pick up items, the first few appear in your hotbar slots, but once those are full, they go into the 27 slots of your main inventory. At any given time, one of your hotbar slots is \"selected\", and the item in that slot is considered to be \"in hand\". (You can see your item in hand in front of you.) You can press keys through (or use a mouse-wheel if you have one) to choose which hotbar slot is active, thus you can quickly switch among up to 9 handy tools or other items.\nMultiple items of the same type usually \"stack\", showing a number indicating how many of them there are. Most items stack up to 64; other items (like chicken eggs) stack only to 16. Weapons, tools and armor are more individual, and do not stack at all. When you use, place, or throw items from a stack, you generally use one item at a time, counting down the stack.\nTo get at the rest of your slots (and the beginnings of crafting), press to open your personal inventory. (This also announces your first &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;; you can safely ignore all such announcements.) This is your first GUI (\"Graphical User Interface\") and shares many features with the other GUIs encountered in the game:\nLooking to the right, you can see an image of your inventory screen. There is a little image of your character, showing their current appearance. Left of that image are four slots for any armor you are wearing -- these can each contain only an appropriate armor piece, for helmet, chest, legs, or feet. (This guide does not discuss &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.) Just to the right is a slot marked with a shield, which is your \"offhand slot\". This one can actually contain almost any item, but most common is indeed a shield (which isn't available on your first day). If you \"are\" wearing a shield, you can use it with the same \"use\" key as for other items -- in general, you can \"use\" any item in your offhand, as long as neither the item in your main hand nor the block you are looking at has a \"use\" feature.\nBelow these are the 27 slots of your main inventory. You can drag items around from these slots to your hotbar and back, armor pieces can be moved to and from their armor slots, and items can be dragged to the personal crafting grid. Dragging items completely out of the GUI's rectangle and releasing them there drops the items into the world, much like the key (or whatever you rebound that to), but it is easier to drop a whole stack this way.\nThe hotbar and main inventory add up to 36 slots for general storage, which is the limit for how much a player can carry around and transport on their person. There is no sense of \"weight\" or encumbrance for items; a player moves at normal speed regardless of how full their inventory is, or what particular items they are carrying. (It is a running joke that a player can bounce around while carrying what \"should be\" hundreds of tons of stone and/or metal.) If your inventory becomes completely full, you cannot pick up new items, although you may still be able to pick up \"more\" of any stackable items that you already have.\nCrafting.\nAlso on your inventory screen is a 2\u00d72 arrangement of squares. This is your inventory crafting grid. Here you can take some of the items you've collected and turn them into new items. Below the crafting grid is the icon, which provides assistance with remembering and using crafting recipes (see its page for full details). You do not actually \"need\" to use the Recipe Book, but for a beginning player, it can be helpful in finding out what your options are, and even for advanced players, it adds a bit of convenience. In general, you learn new recipes automatically when you pick up (or craft) a key item for the recipes in question. Actually crafting an item certainly gets you its recipe, if you somehow didn't learn it by picking up the ingredients.\nExample of Crafting: Say you want to craft wood planks. Mine a wood block and place it in your 2\u00d72 crafting grid in your inventory, and you have acquired wood planks. To make a crafting table; spread the 4 wood planks you crafted with the right click button and spread all of the planks all over the 2\u00d72 grid. You now have a crafting table. You now have a 3\u00d73 crafting grid.\nWhen starting a game, your first craft typically involves two steps: First, take a single &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; of wood and put it in the 2\u00d72 crafting grid. The output slot then shows a stack of four matching wooden &lt;a href=\"plank\"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt;s, which you can then take. Then take those planks and put one in each of the crafting grid's four slots by holding the right mouse button. The 2\u00d72 crafting grid is now spread with wood planks. The output slot then shows a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, which you should take, put on your hotbar, and place down in the world to begin more advanced crafting. Without the crafting table it is impossible to beat the game, so this is the most useful tool. Having placed the table, you can right-click on it (\"use\", as above) to open a UI similar to your inventory, but with a 3\u00d73 crafting grid. This lets you do many more recipes, as you can craft any block craftable. you can also use it for any recipe you could craft in your inventory, but the larger crafting grid allows many more possibilities, like weapons, armor and tools. Notice that the crafting table also has a Recipe Book icon, as do several other utility blocks you encounter later in the game. Any of these recipe books show only the recipes that apply to its block. So your inventory's recipe book shows only 2\u00d72 recipes, but the crafting table's recipe book shows all of its crafting recipes. Similarly, the &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;'s recipe book shows smelting recipes, and so on.\nHaving set up a crafting table, your next step should be to make some &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s; you can actually do that in the 2\u00d72 crafting grid in your inventory, the recipe is two planks arranged one over the other. (Remember: as long as a recipe can fit in a 2\u00d72 space, you can craft it in your own inventory.) Having a stick unlocks the recipes for your first tools, discussed below. (Note: A stick is not a club! Using it to hit something is no better than using your bare hands.) When you are done with your crafting table for the moment, you can break it like any other wooden block: Your bare hands can do, but it is much quicker to break it with an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, which you might have just crafted.\nTools and swords.\nThe basic tools the player can acquire come in multiple &lt;a href=\"tiers\"&gt;tiers&lt;/a&gt; based on your materials, and they include the &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, for mining, respectively, stone-type, wood-type, and dirt &amp; sand-type blocks. Each tool has a certain damage on certain blocks. The pickaxe is slow at mining dirt, and the shovel can break lots of dirt at a time. The fourth tool is the &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;, which is a little different than mining \u2014 it is mostly used later, as part of &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be used to break some lightweight blocks such as &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; faster. &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt;s are similar to tools, and come in the same tiers, but these are used for attacking animals or monsters rather than breaking blocks. Swords cannot mine anything as it does absolutely nothing when you try to mine with a sword. The six tiers are &lt;a href=\"Wood%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20%28disambiguation%29%23Tools%20and%20Weapons\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt;, but for the first day you are limited to wood, stone, and \"possibly\" iron. Higher tier tools break blocks faster and &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;last longer&lt;/a&gt;, and swords do more damage. For pickaxes in particular, many blocks require a minimum tier for you to collect them: pickaxes can collect stone and &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; requires at least a stone pickaxe, and more advanced ores (again, unlikely on your first day) require at least an iron pickaxe. Gold is a special case; it probably isn't relevant for your first day, but don't make gold tools, swords, or armor \u2014 they are usually high-speed but they are weak and fragile. If you happen to find golden items in chests, you can use them as long as they last.\nOnce you have sticks, the Recipe Book for the crafting table includes recipes for the wooden tools and weapons. The wooden pickaxe lets you harvest cobblestone, and once you have that, you get the recipes for stone tools. Later, iron or gold ingots, and diamonds, likewise appear in the recipes for those tiers. That said, all the recipes for each tool follow similar patterns, making a little picture of the tool in the crafting grid, and different tiers vary only in the material used. For wooden tools, any combination of planks can be used. If you can't immediately find stone, you might want to make other tools out of wood; once you upgrade to stone or iron, you can always use the wooden tools for furnace fuel.\nTip: If your tool or weapon breaks, you can get the materials to make the tool or weapon again.\nBe thrifty with your first few iron ingots. The \"Second Day\" tutorial has more information, but briefly, the most important things to make first are a shield, an iron pickaxe, and a bucket. After that you can move on to an iron sword, other tools, and eventually iron armor.\nNew players should always have a balanced first world and day. It isn't much fun when things are unbalanced, such as when your armor or weapons are over-powered.\nHere are the recipes for the first three tiers of pickaxe, followed by the stone and iron versions of the other tools and swords:\nMine stone/iron and craft:\nThese tools make your game easier, and more natural.\nOverview.\nGame Progression.\nThis guide deals only with the beginning of the game, but here are a few words on the shape of the game as a whole. \"Progression\" in \"Minecraft\" is simpler and less linear than most other games, mostly a matter of finding various materials and resources, each of which allows new capabilities and options. For example, making a wooden pickaxe lets you mine stone to make a stone pickaxe and a furnace; this in turn lets you mine and smelt iron ore; the iron pickaxe lets you mine diamonds, and then a diamond pickaxe lets you mine any block that \"can\" be mined. Similarly, various crops let you breed different animals, each of which provides different resources over and above \"better food\". Various enemy drops likewise each have their uses (some more useful than others), and combining various resources from mining, farming and breeding, let you &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt; your equipment. Collecting and crafting various materials also lets you build with them; even beyond the practical factors of secure bases and farms, building your own structures is a big part of the game experience.\nProgression beyond the Overworld is fairly limited: Eventually you can build a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt; to reach the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get materials for more complex crafting, the resources to brew potions, and the top tier of tools and armor. The Nether materials also let you reach &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; dimension, where you must defeat the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt; to unlocks the outer End Islands, where you can get an &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; that lets you fly, and &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20Box\"&gt;shulker boxes&lt;/a&gt; for more storage. There are also two optional bosses: the &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s in the Overworld oceans, and the &lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;, which is summoned with Nether materials. \nFirst day.\nFor the first day, you have just a few basic objectives:\nAs the first day begins, you need to collect &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s. First, you should look around for &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, and go toward any you find, and break their trunks by \"punching wood\" as discussed above. Always collect all the wood on the tree so you make more things to craft weapons and tools. You need to collect at least 5-8 logs for your first round of tools and items you need immediately. You should make more a little later, but a few tools now make collecting more wood go \"much\" more quickly. As discussed above, the first thing to make is a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a few &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s. The first tool you should craft is a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20pickaxe\"&gt;wooden pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; (3 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; in the top 3 slots, and 2 &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s down from the middle plank). Crafting other wooden tools is not recommended, as you can quickly get cobblestone and make stone tools.\nIf any stone blocks are exposed close by, you can mine them with your new pickaxe to collect about 20 blocks of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. This is the amount you need to create every basic tool needed for this tutorial: a &lt;a href=\"stone%20sword\"&gt;stone sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone%20pickaxe\"&gt;stone pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone%20axe\"&gt;stone axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;. If you are efficiency minded, just mine 3 blocks of stone with your wooden pickaxe, immediately make a stone pickaxe and mine the rest of the stone with it, as it is about twice as fast. While you're doing this, keep an eye out for &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;, and mine any you find. Depending on the position of the stone blocks, mining them might well make you a mini-cave to spend the night in, otherwise keep an eye out for possible places to lair up.\nFood is required to keep you alive and to not take damage. Make a sword and kill animals for them to drop food. It is not recommended to eat the food when raw, so craft a furnace (8 cobblestone blocks with a empty the middle slot) and place down the furnace you crafted. Mine coal ore for fuel and put the food you have into the furnace. Wait for it to cook and when the cooking is done, you can eat it.\nOnce you have a stone axe, you should try to get more logs as time allows; extra logs are useful in many ways, such as building, crafting, securing your base and much more. If you have difficulty finding coal, you definitely want an extra dozen or more logs to make &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;! With coal or charcoal, you can make &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es (coal or charcoal above a stick on the crafting grid) for the night. \nOptional goals: While you're doing this, break any &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt; you pass and collect any &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; that drop (but don't waste time on this), and once you've got a sword or an axe, kill whatever food animals you pass, especially sheep (up to 3 of them), collecting whatever they drop. Not all animals are food animals: Only &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s drop meat. Other animals are all best left alone for now. Don't spend too much time chasing down animals though: a few pieces of meat are plenty, and for wool, you need 3 pieces of the same color. If you happen to spot some &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;, wait until you've got your stone pickaxe, and then mine that too.\nIf you are next to a &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to get some fish for food. &lt;a href=\"Cod\"&gt;Cod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; are some of the best food sources in the game, and new fish reappear soon after you killed some (or even all) of them, so you don't need to worry about preserving them for future breeding (they can't be bred anyway). Before entering water, you should first make sure it is not too deep, and the bottom of the river/ocean is well illuminated, because not only are you more likely to drown in deeper water, but it is more likely to spawn &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, a variant of zombie that may be dangerous to fight. While in water, you can still use to move around, but your movements are much slower than on land. press to move upward in water (also for getting back onto the shore), and to descend. pressing and together allows you to swim faster, and you can change directions flexibly by moving the camera. Remember to always watch the oxygen bar above your hunger bar, as when all bubbles are gone, you start taking drowning damage. Cod and salmon can be easily killed with a swipe of a sword. After this tiny fishing trip, remember to cook your fish in your &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"cooked%20cod\"&gt;cooked cod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cooked%20salmon\"&gt;cooked salmon&lt;/a&gt;, which work longer to prevent &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy the time you've done this, sunset is likely imminent or in the past. If you're really ahead of the game, you might take a moment to &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; some &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; next to a river or pond, and plant seeds to get a head start on &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;. Place a torch near these so they can grow overnight. But at that point, it's time to finish for the day: Head for cover, and either prepare a cave as your first night's lair, or make a mini-house. If you were able to make a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, you don't strictly need a shelter, it's better to have it someplace safe where you can leave it be, but you can also just find an open space to place it. Either way, use the bed as soon as you can.\nNight time.\nFor most players, the first night is time to set up your crafting table and furnace, cook your meat and perhaps some logs for charcoal, and maybe craft a few things for the next day. If you managed to pick up some iron ore, smelt that too, and consult the \"second day\" tutorial for what to make with it. If you've settled into a cave, you might want to mine overnight to look for coal or iron ore, but don't go too deep because you want to get an early start for the next day. If you managed to get wool for a bed, you also have the option of just skipping the night; if you managed to make yourself too hungry or hurt, or didn't get much in the way of other resources, that might be a good idea. If you're neither in a or near a cave, you can build a small \"house\" with a crafting table, furnace and torch if you have one. Close this house up like a lockdown so no mobs can get in.\nAt night time, the primary danger is hostile mobs (monsters) that spawn only in the dark. These include &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and more. All of these are good reasons to stay put in a well-lit shelter. But if you are really seeking adventure, you could always arm yourself with a sword or an axe and fight some monsters. While you might be able to get some materials for further crafting, it is dangerous, and if you die, all of your items and &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; levels drop where you died, and you respawn at your bed (or at your world spawn if you don't have one). So a good idea before adventuring out is to sleep on the bed and leave it, or right click on the bed during the day. When you see \"Respawn point set\" in the chat message, you can be sure that you respawn in your base next to the bed after dying, instead of in the wild where you first spawned next to a bunch of monsters. However, most of the monsters you can fight at this point either burn (zombies and skeletons) or become less dangerous (spiders) when morning comes, and it is easier to fight them later when you have better equipment. If you must fight monsters this early, be especially wary of skeletons; in the open their arrows can easily get your health quite low or even kill you at a distance, and if they're in the water or on higher ground, it's unlikely you can reach them before being killed at this stage. If you happen to see any of the more powerful monsters, keep well away from them: At this point, an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; can kill you easily.\nIf you are repeatedly being killed (too ambitious, a monster got into your shelter, or you didn't manage to make a shelter), you can always dig a three-block deep hole, cover it up and hide there. However, consider that because this is the first day, you don't actually lose much when you die (except for what has already been gathered that day), so if you do end up being killed you can just tough it out until dawn and start again. Keep on practicing killing mobs until you get the hang of it. If you're completely desperate, you can consider switching to \"peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;\", which causes all the monsters to disappear until you switch back.\nShelter.\nShelter is one of the most important features in the game, as this is useful for you to build shelter. As noted above, you should really want to find or make some kind of shelter before your first night, to avoid being killed. The \"Shelters\" article linked above gives a lot of suggestions for emergency shelters and more advanced ideas, but it takes some thinking ahead to manage a decent shelter for the first night. As you move around collecting logs and so on, look at the landscape for potential homes. Easiest (if you can find it) is a small cave with a single entrance that you can &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; off. If it's not quite ideal, consider if you can fix it quickly \u2013 say, fencing off a back door to deeper caves. If you don't have a cave, you may be able to make one, by digging into a mountainside or even roofing over a small valley. If instead, you have wide, flat space, then go ahead and build a small house. In all cases:\nLight.\nMonsters can't spawn within 24 blocks of you, but huddling in the dark is no fun \u2013 and when you do leave your home, you don't want to come back to find a monster has spawned or moved in. The usual way to fend of monster spawning is by light -- daylight or artificial. So, before night falls, you need to &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; up your space, and at this point, the only light sources you have are &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nThe power of torches has been sharply increased in recent versions of the game; as of version 1.18, they completely prevent monsters from spawning (&lt;a href=\"Monster%20Spawner\"&gt;naturally&lt;/a&gt;) anywhere within reach of their light. This light stretches for 13 spaces of &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;; each square east, west, north, south, up, and down, counts independently. This if you have a torch at head height at one corner of a large room, the safe area stretches 6 spaces diagonally on the floor (one space downward from the torch). On a hill, the light can stretch 4 blocks diagonally \"and\" up- or down-hill. Most solid blocks also block light \u2013 light can often travel \"around\" blocks, but any detour counts against its range.\nBefore version 1.18.\nBefore 1.18, more light is needed prevent monster spawning: A single torch prevents monster spawns \"completely\" within a 7 block range (barring obstructions), and reduces them for about the same distance past that. That range is in &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;, with each square east, west, north south, up and down counting independently. Accordingly, the safe zone runs only 3 spaces or so diagonally, and steps up or down can shorten it further. Even outside the safe zone, having some light sharply reduces the chance of monsters spawning (depending on how much light), but it's better to use enough torches to keep your whole home well-lit. If you have extra torches after that, try to light some space outside your home (or at least the entrance) too, to push back the area where monsters are likely to spawn.\nFood and hunger.\nOnce you have tools and shelter, your next priority is &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; takes a while to hit, so it \"shouldn't\" be a problem on your first day, but you should try to pick up \"some\" food for when it does, just so you don't get into an emergency situation. Just killing a few animals and cooking their meat can tide you over for long enough to make more permanent arrangements. The occasional &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berries\"&gt;sweet berries&lt;/a&gt; can help a bit, but mind those damage-dealing bushes! You can go up and read the food section for more information. Don't starve to death!\nMaking a crude &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Crop%20farming\"&gt;wheat farm&lt;/a&gt; early on (break tall grass for seeds, hoe grass blocks next to existing water, plant seeds in your new farmland) is listed as an optional objective, but if you can pull it off your first day, it gives you a definite head start on the game. Having &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; gives you more options: Harvested wheat can be used to make &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, or to capture and breed sheep and cows, and extra seeds can be used to capture and breed chickens.\nMaking food really quick is possible if you make a &lt;a href=\"Food\"&gt;food farm&lt;/a&gt;, but this is more of the more advanced things in Minecraft as it is no ordinary farm. You should instead make a normal crop area with your hoe instead of food farms for beginners, as food farms requires redstone, water, and many other things that are not for beginners.\nThe primary drain on &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; is from healing damage, and for quite some time, eating is your \"only\" way to heal damage! Fighting (even before healing damage), sprinting, and jumping are also energy-intensive. (Be careful about going uphill with auto-jump!) You have a little grace period (see \"&lt;a href=\"saturation\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;\") when starting the game and after eating, but when that's exhausted, your food bar starts rippling. At this point, healing damage, or getting too athletic, starts to drain your hunger bar.\nIf you get too hungry, you start suffering: Below 90% you can't heal damage, below 30% you can't sprint, and if the hunger bar goes empty, you'll lose health to starvation. You can't actually starve to death unless you're in Hard difficulty, but you are still quite vulnerable. You do not lose hunger at all in Peaceful mode. See the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/The%20second%20day\"&gt;Second Day&lt;/a&gt; guide for slightly more detail, or the &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; page for the whole story.\nNote that if you are staying at full health, and not fighting, &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"jumping\"&gt;jumping&lt;/a&gt; a lot, swimming long distances or mining many blocks, then you use almost no food. Walking at normal speed does \"not\" use up food (neither does &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;). Neither does crafting, and even mining and placing blocks use only a tiny amount per block. Thus, if your character has a secure place to stay, even if you've started to get hungry, you can just stay put to conserve food while waiting out the night, a storm, or crop/animal growth.\nThere are also a few items you technically \"can\" eat, but \"shouldn't\". &lt;a href=\"Raw%20chicken\"&gt;Raw chicken&lt;/a&gt; (the only one of these you might see the first day) has a 30% chance of giving &lt;a href=\"food%20poisoning\"&gt;food poisoning&lt;/a&gt; that can leave you even hungrier, and if you eat &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;, that has an 80% of giving you food poisoning. Eating a &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt; outright &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;s you, and eating a &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; poisons you \"badly\". \nIf you can manage to kill a couple (or more) &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, you may get a couple of pieces of string, which lets you craft a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;. This is a perpetual source of food if you have water nearby. Cod and salmon are both good food items (especially when cooked), replenishing both the hunger and saturation levels. Now, if you are next to a body of water, you can just jump into the water and kill some of the fish, but proper fishing can also catch a few useful items along with the fish. You do not need bait of any kind, but the fishing rod eventually wears out.\nPlay-by-play.\nGetting started.\nA player begins the game standing in a landscape somewhere. This is the general area in which a player reappears (&lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;s) upon death. If you have slept in a bed (and the bed's still there) you respawn next to that. This is the start of a new \"Minecraft\" world. This tutorial is intended to teach you the skills needed to survive in this world and eventually be able to do just about anything you desire. You can do the different sections below in any order you desire, but many sections require you to first complete other tasks first. The tasks listed on this page (except those noted as optional) should all be completed before moving on to the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/The%20second%20day\"&gt;second day tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, even if it takes you multiple days to complete all of the tutorials. No matter what, your goal for the first day should be creating a bed or shelter so you can survive the night. The other tasks are also important and can all be completed along with the main objectives while leaving you with extra time.\nSee the first section of this guide for information about controls and getting around in the world. You need to master those skills in order to complete the following tasks. Again, the game starts at noon, and you have 10 minutes of game time before nightfall. Your overarching goal here is to acquire basic equipment and a simple shelter in that time. You do have some time to practice your basic skills and learn about your inventory, but don't take too much time at that. If night falls and you still don't have any shelter or basic equipment, it is fair (for your first game) to switch the game to &lt;a href=\"Peaceful%20mode\"&gt;Peaceful mode&lt;/a&gt; for the night. \nWhile following the steps below, break any tall grass you see and collect any seeds that drop. They become useful later. In fact, collect any loose items you come across; almost everything can be potentially useful. Also keep an eye out for orange &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; blocks and (if you happen to be in a jungle) green &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt; blocks. If you find any, break some of them and take the results with you for later farming. Also watch out for &lt;a href=\"Berry%20bushes\"&gt;sweet berry bushes&lt;/a&gt;. \"Using\" them can provide berries for a bit of food, but actually stepping into them hurts!\nBiomes.\nThe \"Minecraft\" world is divided into different areas called \"&lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s\". Different biomes contain different blocks and plants and change how the land is shaped. There is an advancement that includes finding all the biomes; this is better explained on the &lt;a href=\"advancements\"&gt;advancements&lt;/a&gt; page. Biomes affect you, especially at the beginning of the game, but you need not worry about specific biomes until you have learned how to play the game. If you are curious, you may want to read more about biomes on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s page. That said, there are a few cases you \"should\" worry about:\nVillages.\nIf you see houses and other buildings nearby, this is not exactly a biome, but it means that you are near a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, which is a good thing. In fact, a village lets you skip past much of the first and second-day activities (due to ready-made shelter and beds) but it requires a bit of care. It's worth exploring the village and looting any chests you find; if you happen to find any emeralds, you might even be able to buy some useful items from the &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s. Besides providing equipment, food and other resources, a village also lets you collect the seeds for all four of the basic crops up front, from their farms, and you can also take one of their beds with you when you leave. You can even grab a few blocks of wood or stone from their houses, but try not to damage the village too much -- your best bet may be to disassemble one of the smaller houses and move its bed to one of the intact houses. (Don't bother doing this in a desert village, the sandstone is pretty but fragile, and you can't make tools out of it.)\nIf you see an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; trundling around, be careful \u2014 If you attack it or the villagers, it becomes hostile to you!\nRight-click (use) on the villagers to open the &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; interface. Do not left-click (attack) on them as they become upset, raising their prices... and if an iron golem notices, you're in trouble.\nAs you originally encounter them, villagers can sell useful early-game items like &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; tools, armor and weapons, but remember that eventually you can mine for your own iron and such. Don't bother buying stone tools unless you're in a desert, and maybe not even then. You can also harvest wheat and vegetables from village farms, but be sure to replant them afterward, they don't look like much newly planted, but they grow back over time. You can even sell the crops you harvested back to the farmers. You can also harvest any &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s from the vicinity and craft them back into wheat, and sell the wheat to any farmer you find (or make &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; out of it for yourself). \nAny time you are near a village, you can sleep in one of their beds overnight, as soon as night falls. Trying to stay up overnight can expose the village to attacks by monsters, which can easily wipe out the villagers. It's okay if a villager has already claimed the bed \u2014 trying to use the bed the first time simply kicks the villager out, and then you can use the bed again for yourself. If you have a village, you should probably travel some distance from it (say, fifty or a hundred or so blocks from the edge) to make your own lair, to avoid having monsters appear overnight due to your presence. If monsters (such as &lt;a href=\"illagers\"&gt;illagers&lt;/a&gt;) do appear during the day, your best bet at this point is to ring one of the bells in the village, and hope that the village's iron golem can deal with the invasion. It is difficult to repopulate a village that has been wiped out.\nCertainly remember where the village was, because as you accumulate more resources, the &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; becomes more exploitable. For the first day, the most obvious tricks are:\nGetting Logs.\nWood is the most basic resource in \"Minecraft\", and you need to collect some up front. The usual and most plentiful wood source are logs from &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, which are available in most biomes. Logs are one of many items that can be collected without the use of a tool. All you have to do is mine any log of the tree with your hand or any item. Each block drops as an item that you can pick up and put in your inventory by approaching it. You should start by collecting 6-8 logs for your first tools. There are many different types of trees in Minecraft, each having its own individual name and look. Each kind of log can easily be crafted into a matching type of &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;. All logs and planks work for any recipe requiring logs or planks respectively, but a few recipes require that all the wood you use be the same type (for example, when making a boat, you can't mix oak and spruce planks). If you mine all the wood from a tree, the leaf blocks atop it start decaying (you can also break them yourself), dropping sticks, saplings, and perhaps apples. For your first day, don't wait around for leaves to decay, but as usual, pick up any items they do drop and save them for later. Once you get to making axes, harvesting wood becomes much faster!\nA rarer source of wood is &lt;a href=\"sunken%20ship\"&gt;sunken ship&lt;/a&gt;s, which are made of logs and planks and are found in ocean biomes, but dealing with these is probably best saved for later. &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20mineshaft\"&gt;Abandoned mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s (found on the surface in a few biomes) also contain planks, but these are \"definitely\" better saved for later. Your Recipe Book provides an assortment of useful recipes for wood, including each type of wood as you encounter it.\nIn order to obtain better materials at faster speeds, the player needs tools. Tools are items that allow the player to complete tasks other than placing blocks at faster speeds than normal. Most tools can be made out of different materials each better than the last. Using a tool to mine the blocks for it is intended mines the blocks more quickly than normal. Tools lose durability upon each use, even if the use was to hit an entity. In fact, using tools as weapons generally wears them out more quickly. Enough damage to a tool eventually causes the tool to break. Different tools have different properties and abilities. If you are using a tool on a block and it seems to be taking an unexpectedly long time, you may be using the wrong tool for that block. Stop to look at the block and reconsider your approach. \nHaving acquired wood and made a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, the first tool to craft is a wooden pickaxe. This starts by crafting a couple of logs into planks, and then at two of those planks into sticks. The planks required for a wooden tool can be any combination of planks, as shown below.\nYou probably don't need to craft any other tools out of wood, because you can soon start upgrading to stone, but if you're starting in a forest, making a crafting table and wooden axe from your first three logs can help you get more wood quickly.\nThe basic tools are:\nSee the overview above for tool crafting recipes, but the reader may have noticed that in order to craft a basic tool, they more or less draw it with its components in the &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; grid. Other items are crafted in a similar fashion.\nEntering the Stone Age.\nOnce the player has crafted a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, they can successfully acquire &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; to make better tools. Cobblestone is collected by finding &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, then mining it with any pickaxe. Stone mined with any pickaxe drops as a cobblestone item. Besides the \"original\" gray stone, there are three other kinds of &lt;a href=\"rock\"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; you can find, which are good for building, but you cannot use them to craft tools. White &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt; and reddish &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; are fairly obvious, but &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt; is also gray, and can easily be mistaken for proper stone; when you start mining, check the block that you get in your inventory to make sure it's actually cobblestone instead of an &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt; block.\nIf no stone appears above ground near the player, stone can also be found by digging into the ground. The stone layer usually appears within 5 blocks under dirt and grass, or within 8 blocks under &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to never mine out the block you are standing on, unless you know that what's \"below\" that block isn't a long fall, lava, or other dangers! Another warning here: Unlike most blocks, sand and gravel can \"fall\", and if they fall on you they can suffocate you. If that happens, don't panic, just dig yourself out as quickly as you can.\nMost players should gather at least 19 pieces of cobblestone in total, which is enough to make a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; and all the basic stone tools including the sword and hoe. Taking extra cobblestone is good in case you use up some of your tools and need to replace them. At your crafting table, you should have all the recipes you need for a full set of stone tools.\nAt this point, you have a set of basic tools and both of the basic crafting blocks. And while you're not really \"prepared\" for a fight, you at least have a basic weapon to defend yourself or hunt animals for food.\nYour options for \"what to do next\" have opened up: The top priority is to arrange for a shelter for the night, a bed to sleep in, or both... but you should \"also\" have at least some time left to gather more resources (especially light and food) as you explore and/or build. These extra resources can give you a solid head start for the next day and the remainder of the game. Read the following sections, and attend to them according to what you find in the world around you.\nA good start is to take your axe, and cut down some more trees for &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s, trying to accumulate at least 10 or even 20 logs. Although some trees may look different than others, all logs work the same. However, different kinds of logs don't stack together, and likewise for their planks. While you cut down trees, try to gather the &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stick\"&gt;sticks&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s that drop from the leaves.\nWhile doing this, explore the immediate area (making sure you don't get lost), to try and find some &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Coal\"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt; is a key resource for making torches and smelting materials, but if you can't get it, you can fill in with &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, which is smelted from logs. If you get some, craft a few torches up front, but don't use up all your coal -- save some for later smelting. If you happen across a similar ore with tan specks in place of the black ones, you have found &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is extremely useful for most of your \"Minecraft\" career, and if it's within easy reach, go ahead and gather it (a stone pickaxe is required). However, if it's in a difficult-to-reach place, just note its location and save it for later.\nAlong the way, keep an eye out for useful plants. Keep breaking grass for seeds as you pass it, and grab a few of other plant types that you encounter, except perhaps for flowers. Flowers are not useful yet (though dandelions might be helpful for catching rabbits), but more useful finds (depending on where you are) include &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt;es. If you find any of these, break some of them and take the results with you for later farming. Be careful with cactus and berry bushes, as they harm you if you touch them! \"Using\" a berry bush can drop the berries without breaking the bush, but the bushes are common (not to mention hazardous), and if you do want more bushes, you can just plant the berries.\nBasic necessities.\nProviding light.\nPlayers are greatly affected by light in \"Minecraft\". Any underground space is dark, and half of the time the game is at night. It is possible to see a little better by altering the same settings to raise the brightness level of the display, but it's not just about visibility; monsters spawn in the darkness. Specifically, any space further than 24 blocks from a player without any light is a potential spawning ground for monsters. Accordingly, a player \"claims\" territory by lighting it up so that monsters cannot spawn. From the first day, a player can create &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, a basic light source that remains useful throughout the game. Torches (and any other light source) need to be placed in the world to give off light. They can be placed on the side or top of any solid block, and some that aren't entirely solid (for example, you can put a torch on top of a fence). Unlike in real life, a torch remains lit forever, allowing the player to use torches as a cheap and permanent light source. One stick plus one coal or charcoal crafts into 4 torches. At the beginning of the game, you should make torches 4 at a time as you need them, once you have a reasonable supply of coal and/or charcoal you can keep a stack of torches handy.\nThe most important places to light up are a player's home or base, caves explored, the outside around the player's home, and anywhere the player is often at or near that is dark.\nTorches are also useful to prevent getting lost in caves as well as to prevent monsters from spawning in them. On the way into a cave, for example, a player can place torches on the left side wall (especially near where tunnels branch, and then the player knows that to find the way out, the torches should be on the right.\nGetting food.\nEven though you probably aren't hungry \"yet\", collecting some food up front, and arranging for more, is a good thing. Just now, there are three things you can do about that:\nAs with your health bar, you start with a full hunger bar, with 10 icons (\"shanks\") representing 20 hunger points. After you have been moving around (and perhaps fighting) for a while, the &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar begins rippling and start decreasing. If the hunger bar drops below 90% (), you cannot regenerate health, and if it gets to 30% (), you can't sprint. If the hunger bar goes down to empty, you begin \"losing\" health. Unless you are in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Hard mode&lt;/a&gt; (and a beginning player \"shouldn't\" be), you can't actually starve to death, but your health declines 1 health point () in Normal mode, or half the health bar ( in Easy mode), which leaves you quite vulnerable. If you are playing in Peaceful mode, you do not have to deal with hunger at all.\nThe primary drain on &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; is from healing damage, and for quite some time eating is your \"only\" way to heal damage! Fighting (even before healing damage), sprinting, and jumping are all food-intensive as well. (That includes going uphill with auto-jump.) You have a little grace period (see \"&lt;a href=\"saturation\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;\") when starting the game and after eating, but when that's exhausted, your food bar starts to ripple, after which healing damage or getting too athletic starts to drain your hunger bar. See the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/The%20second%20day\"&gt;Second Day&lt;/a&gt; guide for slightly more detail, or the &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; page for the whole story.\nIf you are staying at full health, and not fighting, sprinting, jumping, swimming long distances, or mining many blocks, then you use almost no food. Walking at normal speed does \"not\" use up food. Neither does rowing a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, if your character has a secure place to stay, you can just stay put to conserve food while waiting out the night, a storm, or crop/animal growth.\nFirst farming.\nPreviously, you learned to break tall grass and collect the seeds. Now you have a chance to use those. Look for any water (pond, river, ocean) with dirt or grass nearby at the water level. Use your hoe on the dirt or grass, within 4 blocks of the water itself (diagonals count). Wait a moment to make sure the new farmland darkens instead of reverting back to dirt, then plant your seeds, one per block (save one or two seeds for possible chicken-wrangling, below). Later you can make a more organized farm, but for now, you have just gotten a head start on a permanent food supply. When you come back here tomorrow or the next day, the seeds may have grown into wheat, which you can use to make bread or to lure and breed cows (see \"animals\", below). You also get extra seeds from harvesting the wheat, which you can use to plant more wheat, or to lure and breed chickens. Pro tip: If you have any torches, place one to light the field overnight.\nIf you have found a village, it should have farms that may include any of the four food crops: &lt;a href=\"Wheat\"&gt;Wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrots\"&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;. See their respective pages to see how to recognize the mature plants, and how to prepare each of these for eating. Having done so, you can harvest any mature plants you find and replant the crop afterward, with a seed (wheat or beetroot) or one of the several carrots or potatoes you just harvested. Be sure to save some seeds, and extra carrots and potatoes, for your own later farms. If you're doing this in a village and don't want to plant the seeds yourself, you can give them to a farmer to plant for you.\nAnimals.\nThose creatures in \"Minecraft\" that are not immediately &lt;a href=\"Hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; to the player, are known as &lt;a href=\"Passive%20mob\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"neutral%20mob\"&gt;neutral mob&lt;/a&gt;s (\"mobs\" for \"mobile\", this is a common term on this wiki). Many passive mobs can be killed for meat. Raw meat is not as nourishing as cooked meat. See \"Smelting\" below for details on how to cook food.\n&lt;a href=\"Passive%20mob\"&gt;Passive mob&lt;/a&gt;s never attempt to harm the player. The majority of passive mobs are traditional domesticated farm animals that usually ignore the player. If harmed, they flee for a short time. Some animals (such as rabbits or foxes) run straight away from players who get too near. If a passive mob is killed, it may drop resources such as &lt;a href=\"raw%20meat\"&gt;raw meat&lt;/a&gt;. Most passive mobs at least drop a few &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s if killed by the player, but baby animals never drop anything. These passive mobs include the several meat animals... and now you've got a new stone sword! Look for sheep, cows, chickens, and pigs, use your sword to kill a few and collect the meat and other drops. In particular look for sheep, and try to kill at least 3 of them for their wool. That said, don't slaughter everything you see. Try to leave at least two of each kind alive for later breeding. If you have sufficient wood and are doing well on time, you might even set up a small corral of wooden fences and fence gates, and use seeds to lure some chickens in there for later. Unless you found a village, you don't yet have the wheat you'd need to lure cows and sheep, nor the root vegetables that pigs prefer, but you might perhaps be able to use dandelions to lure rabbits into a secure pen.\n&lt;a href=\"Neutral%20mob\"&gt;Neutral mob&lt;/a&gt;s act similarly to passive mobs except that they harm the player if provoked. {&lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s attack the player if the player harms them. These creatures also attack other creatures that hurt them. A polar bear is hostile to the player if a bear cub is nearby, and bees attack if you molest their hive. Bees and wolves both attack as a group: if one of them attacks, all the others in the vicinity join in! For all of these, plus the passive horses, donkeys, and cats, just leave them be for now. They don't drop meat, and you don't have the means to tame or breed them yet. &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; are a special case, because they are angered not only by being attacked, but simply by looking at them.\nFor more information on breeding, see the page &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;Breeding&lt;/a&gt;. Taming mobs is more complex, but you might look at the pages for &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s.\nYou may also see &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; in nearby rivers, and you \"can\" go into the water to kill them with your sword. Cod and salmon are edible, but you should cook them like other meat. Be careful about playing in the water. Aside from the risk of drowning in deep water, there may be monsters in there like &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; can hurt you badly if you approach them. Then too, moving in water is slow, and you don't want to spend too much time there.\nSmelting.\nTo progress in the game, the player needs to know how to use a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;. A furnace is used to cook &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, turn raw iron and raw gold into metal, and create other specific items such as &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are collectively called \"smelting\". To use a furnace, the player must first have one. This is the crafting recipe:\nJust like the &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, the player uses the furnace by first placing it down in the world then clicking on it with the use &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;. The furnace itself counts as a stone-type block, so to pick it back up you need to break it with a pickaxe. \nThe furnace GUI has only three slots and includes two icons to indicate time. The top left slot (\"input\") is where items to smelt are placed. The items are moved from this slot one by one as they are cooked and the products are placed in the right slot (\"output\"). To smelt items, the furnace requires fuel, which is placed in the fuel slot at the bottom left. (The example below shows how to smelt 3 logs into charcoal.) The \"fire\" icon burns down to show how much of the current fuel item is left, while the arrow shows how far along the smelting of the current item is. An item cannot be partly-smelted: If smelting is interrupted (you pulled the item out of the input, the fuel ran out, or you broke the furnace), the input item remains unchanged.\nSmelting takes some time, but you don't need to stay in the GUI, as the process continues while you go do something else. A furnace automatically uses fuel (one item at a time) from the fuel slot as needed, until either all of the items in the input are smelted or all of the fuel runs out. If the input items run out before the fuel, the furnace stays lit until the current fuel item is used up. You can put in more items to use up the rest of the burn time. While the furnace is lit, the furnace block becomes a temporary light source, displaying fire particles and making popping sounds.\nIt takes 10 seconds for each item to be smelted. Different fuel items burn for different amounts of time; most items made from wood can be used as fuel, but coal or charcoal are more efficient, and other fuels may become available later in the game. Some common fuels: Any wooden tool (or sword) can smelt one item; a wooden plank can smelt 1.5 items (that is, 2 planks smelt 3 items, as shown above), and a piece of coal or charcoal smelts 8 items. Don't use logs directly as fuel; the log burns no longer than \"each\" of the four planks you could make from it.\n, an efficient fuel is charcoal produced by smelting &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s using &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; as fuel. , slabs smelt twice as many items as the planks they were made from -- this means that smelting items from slabs is actually more efficient than making charcoal from the wood. (You may still need charcoal to make torches.)\nFor the first day (or the night afterward), you should start by cooking any raw meat you have, and smelt some logs into &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; if needed. If you have a bit of extra coal or charcoal, you may want to make a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;, which burns indefinitely and can cook food without using fuel. Be careful around a campfire, it also burns \"you\" if you walk on it! Unlike most things you make, if you break a campfire it does not drop itself, but you at least get a piece of charcoal back.\nIf you got any raw iron, smelt that too, and craft items according to how many ingots you have: In order, start with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, then an iron pickaxe, iron sword, and a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;. (More details can be found in the \"second day\" guide.)\nFor fuel, start with any wood tools the player has replaced with stone tools, and planks (2 at a time, in Bedrock use slabs instead) to smelt a little meat and/or your first charcoal, then move on to coal and/or charcoal for larger jobs. Note that charcoal is a more efficient fuel source than planks, as it keeps the furnace lit longer than the wood that went into it would have.\nSmelting items in a furnace also produces &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, which is automatically awarded to the player upon removing any smelted item out of the furnace.\nSafety (sleep and shelter).\nSleeping on beds.\nTo make it through the first night, the player can do either (or both) of two options: build a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Shelters\"&gt;shelter&lt;/a&gt;, or get hold of a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. If you have to choose, the bed is likely easier and safer... \"if\" you can find those precious three blocks of wool. If you were lucky enough to run into a village, you can sleep in one of \"their\" beds, and probably swipe it afterward.\nA bed is a special block with an unusual shape: It takes up two blocks of floor space, but is only about half a block tall. When crafting a bed, the three wool must be the same color, which becomes the color of the bed. However, the planks need not match. Wool is obtained from sheep}}; for now you need to kill them for it, but later in the game you can &lt;a href=\"shear\"&gt;shear&lt;/a&gt; sheep to get a steady supply of wool without harming them. Sometimes you may find wool lying on the ground, especially in a forest; this wool comes from sheep that were killed by wolves or by other players. If there are no sheep to be found at all, you can eventually collect string from killed spiders, and craft wool from the string.\nWith a bed, the night is easy to survive. All you need to do to do is place the bed somewhere suitable (see below, but almost any open ground works) and use it (sleep in it) whenever night falls. If you try using it as sundown approaches but are told \"you can only sleep at night or during a thunderstorm...\", just wait a few seconds and try again, it works once sundown has properly begun. You also cannot use a bed when hostile monsters are within 10 blocks, or you get the message \"you can't sleep now, there are monsters nearby\". On successfully using a bed, you change to lying position on the bed without the ability to move \u2013 not even looking around. It takes a few seconds after getting into bed before the game skips the night, giving you a chance to change your mind.\nA bed allows you to do three important things:\nA few warnings about using beds for a spawn point:\nThese limitations are why the \"best\" option is to have a secure shelter of your own, with a bed permanently installed inside it. That way, after death you come back safe at home. If it's still night or storming, you can go back to bed and sleep through to daylight, before you go back in search of your fallen possessions.\nBuilding your shelter.\nThe best way to avoid the dangers of nighttime is to craft and sleep in a bed, but this may not be possible if you couldn't find any sheep during the day. \n\"For more detailed instructions on how to build shelters, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Shelters\"&gt;Tutorials/Shelters&lt;/a&gt;.\" \nTo build a safe shelter, follow these guidelines: \nMake sure there are no gaps in the walls. Baby zombies and spiders can climb in through one-block gaps, and creepers will blow up if they see you though any gaps. \nMake sure your shelter is well lit. Mobs won't be able to spawn inside if your shelter is well lit, and you'll be able to see better. \nUse strong materials. Creepers will be able to blow up a weak shelter. \nEmergency shelters.\nIf night starts to fall before you can create/go back to your shelter, you do have a few options:\nMake sure to light up any shelter with a torch, so you can see what you are doing and mobs can't spawn in your shelter (if it's big enough)\nYou'll also need a way in and out of a shelter. You can seal the shelter with dirt or wood, or you can make a door using six wooden planks in a crafting table. In hard difficulty, zombies will be able to break doors, so you might want to also seal the outside of your door off with the beforementioned dirt or wood.\nYou may also reinforce a door with a fence gate, placed outside your door. Monsters cannot open or break fence gates, even in hard difficulty.\nUseful crafts.\nThere are a few things the player can craft that are particularly useful when making a shelter. In all cases, see their respective pages for more details. For all but the chest, the planks you use must all be of the same type (the ladder uses no planks).\nRead more: &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Shelters%23Shelters%20for%20the%20first%20night\"&gt;Guide to shelters&lt;/a&gt;\nDawn.\nWhen dawn comes, you should wait for undead creatures (zombie, skeleton) to start burning before you exit your shelter.\nOnce all zombies and skeletons have died, take out your sword and exit the shelter with caution.\nWatch out for creepers. They don't burn in daylight. If you see a creeper, stay away from it, and let it despawn or wander off. You could also try killing it or making it explode in a safe way, but be careful not to get blown up; a creeper can kill you nearly instantly, as you have no armour.\nWatch out for zombies and skeletons with helmets on (Normal+ difficulty) or in water, as they will attack you. Burning zombies can set you on fire (Normal+ difficulty). If this happens, go into water to put yourself out.\nYou can safely ignore spiders, as they are neutral during the day and won't attack you unless you attack it.\nAfter the first day.\nA tutorial for the next day is available here: &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/The%20Second%20Day\"&gt;Tutorials/The Second Day&lt;/a&gt;. In general, your options increase over time, and you have more choice about what tasks to focus on next.\nFollowing are some general tips:\nHome safety.\nBy the end of the first day, your shelter is likely to be primitive and small. In the days afterward, you can build a better home, in any of various forms. Some natural extensions include a back door, windows, a surrounding fence, and even &lt;a href=\"trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;s for monsters. Others are beautiful houses. If you build one and you don't like it, just build a different one. Remember that any time you pick up your bed, your spawn point reverts to the default (that is, random within 20 blocks of the world spawn point), until you not only place but \"sleep in\" (or at least \"use\") a bed again. For this reason, if your home is not near the world spawn point, you should eventually use a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt; to locate the exact point, and build a shelter there, or keep enough wool and planks to build new beds in new locations to keep your respawn point nearby as you explore the world.\nMining.\nEventually, you must venture below ground to gather iron and other resources. While there are much more advanced &lt;a href=\"mining%20techniques\"&gt;mining techniques&lt;/a&gt;, the most basic way to find ores is by entering a cave and exploring. Remember, if you are mining, \"never dig straight down\" is a great rule to follow as you might fall in lava or in a group of monsters. You can, however, dig down in a 2\u00d71 pattern, standing in the middle of the 2 blocks. This allows you to have a \"safe block\" in case there is lava beneath you. Or you can dig your shaft a few blocks at a time and put in ladders as you go, or just dig a staircase down instead of a straight shaft.\nFinding a cave.\nYou have no problems if you have just spent your night in a cave. If you haven't, the easiest way to do so is to roam the Overworld a little and look out for exposed cave entrances. Mountains biomes have caves inside mountains, but these are generally not what you want, because only coal ore appears above &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;. For iron and better ores, you want to find a cave opening into the ground (these are quite common) and head downward. Sometimes such caves end immediately, but often they continue into big cave systems. If they seem to end right away, sometimes there is a continuation about 2-8 blocks farther back and below the cave's end; mining in these directions (8 blocks back and down, exploring somewhat to the sides) can reveal this if it is the case. Digging away gravel or dirt can also expose cave extensions, but you may go through a few shovels that way. If you can't find any all day, just sleep away the night, replenishing your resources like wood and food as you use them. If you hear suspicious, hostile noises, just try to listen and follow them.\nCave exploration.\nCave exploration is pretty straight forward: you light up your way with torches, mine up ores as you see them (check ores and minerals), and kill enemies as you encounter them (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Combat\"&gt;Tutorials/Combat&lt;/a&gt; for details). Some important techniques might not be obvious to a new player, such as using &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;falls to descend into shafts, and/or swim back up from them. Always make sure to bring a waterbucket with you to water yourself in case you fall into lava. There are also many options for &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Navigation\"&gt;marking your trail and not getting lost, one very efficient option is to place wood or dirt blocks as waypoints&lt;/a&gt;. Also, note that sneaking (on PCs, the key by default) prevents you from falling over the edge of a block, and as such it is useful if you are caving near a long drop, especially a drop into lava. There are also open ravines, which can be explored by daylight, a bit more safely than underground caves. If you have spent a long time in a cave, be wary of coming back to the surface at night \u2014 at night there can be more monsters on the surface than there were in the caves, and if you spent long enough down there, there might even be &lt;a href=\"phantoms\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt;! If there are, then try to avoid them or bring a spare bed with you while mining so you can sleep and get rid of them."}

{"id": "49727", "revid": "51082192", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=49727", "title": "Tutorials/Best biomes for homes", "text": "Introduction.\nOne of the most important things to consider when building a shelter is where to put it. Depending on how much of a challenge you want day-to-day survival to be, you might prefer one biome over another. In this tutorial, you'll learn about the pros and cons of each biome so that you can make a more knowledgeable decision about where you would want to situate your new home. The biomes are listed from easiest to hardest to settle in for a typical, new player, based on the desirable/undesirable characteristics mentioned below. \nThis guide will judge each biome based on its own merits, i.e., its ability to provide necessary resources, preferably without needing to travel elsewhere. For biomes from the Nether or End dimensions, this includes assuming the player will not be traveling to the Overworld for supplies, if possible. \nPlease note that this page is currently under construction.\nDesirability.\nAll biomes have certain characteristics about themselves, which can either enhance or dampen the building experience. Keep in mind that this isn't ideal for some types of builds and that ratings might be slightly subjective. However, it is up to you at the end to decide what biome you would want to dwell in, and we hope that this guide will help you choose what biome is best for your base. \nOverworld.\nThe Overworld is the main dimension in \"Minecraft\" and the one the player will spawn into on world creation. It is by far the easiest of the dimensions to live, being the one designed best for living in. It is also the only place you can use a bed, without it exploding. There are many different foods here, and the hostile mobs that spawn are often easier to defeat than those in other dimensions. The player will have an abundance of biomes to choose from, each offering a different pro/con dichotomy for the player to consider.\nSurface Biomes.\nPlains.\nThe plains is a good biome for a player's first house. The lack of obstruction makes it fairly quick to walk or sprint around. The flat ground makes it easy to create a large house, and &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s are common. &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s spawn here, allowing for even faster transportation. There is a lot of tall grass, making it easy to collect seeds and start a wheat farm. This biome has many gullies and short hills. Wood is scarce, but forests are likely nearby.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Sunflower\"&gt;Sunflower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s (from villages), &lt;a href=\"cornflower\"&gt;cornflower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in plains biomes.\nMultiplayer.\nOn multiplayer, the Plains biome has both some heavy pros and some heavy cons. It is very easy to build defenses due to the flat terrain, and it is hard to be ambushed when at your base. However, the base (if at surface level) is easy to see. This means that enemy players/scouts could find a way in. If you settle in a plains biome, it is recommended that you make some tall walls to keep enemies away. Alternatively, you could build above or below a pillager outpost, and the pillagers would act as a natural defense. Before settling in a plains biome for a long time, you will want to have gathered a substantial amount of wood from the nearest trees so that you don't have to go back and forth between your base and a forest.\nDesert.\nMany players prefer to not live in deserts, as they lack grass, wood, and many other vital resources - however, once a player has basic materials, living in a desert can be beneficial. &lt;a href=\"Sand\"&gt;Sand&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained in large quantities, and &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; is rare in other biomes. Almost no above-ground water generates here, which poses a problem if spawned deep within these &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, no passive mobs spawn here other than rabbits. No trees spawn here either. Though not the best biome for the beginner, it is still a nice biome to live in after you've got your initial house set up somewhere else (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Survival%20in%20an%20infinite%20desert\"&gt;Tutorials/Survival in an infinite desert&lt;/a&gt; for tips on how to survive in a desert).\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Sand\"&gt;Sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, loot from &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMeadows.\nMeadows are similar to plains biomes, though they usually generate at the bases of mountains, at higher elevations. They are unique from plains biomes in that they spawn &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s more frequently, as well as having unique flowers.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Donkey\"&gt;Donkey&lt;/a&gt;s, various flowers, &lt;a href=\"Emeralds\"&gt;Emeralds&lt;/a&gt;, plains village loot, pillager outpost loot.\nWindswept Hills.\nThe Windswept Hills biome is perhaps one of the more spectacular biomes, with peaks and stone cliffs, but also one of the more difficult to navigate. Large surface caves, floating islands, and overhangs are often found. Snow falls above y-level 95, allowing for snow farms and ice farms in this biome. \nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Cobblestone\"&gt;Cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald%20ore\"&gt;emerald ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;spruce wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nForest.\nThe forest has a lot of &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, making it great for getting &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, but it also means that building a house here involves cutting down a couple of trees. Also, this can be a dangerous biome at night for beginners. There are many trees, allowing for mobs to hide from the player, and minimizing combat space, which is especially dangerous for creepers. Also, the forest provides shade, allowing skeletons and zombies to survive in the daytime.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Log\"&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lily%20of%20the%20valley\"&gt;lily of the valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rose%20bush\"&gt;rose bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lilac\"&gt;lilac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"peony\"&gt;peony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; are useful resources found in forest biomes.\nMultiplayer.\nOn Multiplayer, the forest is a very good place to build a base. There is an abundance of wood and animals, as well as cover so that your base stays semi-hidden. However, building defenses is very difficult in a forest, because the nearby trees will need to be cleared out. If you wanted to, you could burn some of the trees down, but make sure it doesn't get out of hand or you won't have a forest left! Never leave trees close to the perimeter of your base. It will be very easy for enemies to climb the trees and get over the wall. If is on the server, building a base out of wood might be a good idea, because of its abundance. However, it does not have as much blast resistance as stone or cobblestone.\nTaiga.\nThe &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; is the colder version of the forest. In taiga biomes, only the spruce tree can be found, which is good for spruce-related buildings.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lantern\"&gt;lanterns&lt;/a&gt; (from villages), &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in taiga biomes.\nMultiplayer.\nThe taiga is a wonderful all-round biome. The trees provide cover but are not as dense as forests or dark forests, and berries provide a source of food. Villages here generate a lot of pumpkins, and wolves spawn in this biome too. Pillager outposts provide a challenge or can be used as a natural defense for a skybase or underground base. Foxes can also be tamed, which only adds to the benefits of the biome. This biome is not particularly special or \"cool\", but is a good all-rounder, and is one of the best choices for a beginner to multiplayer.\nSwamp.\nThe swamp biome offers flat space (although much of it is flooded), plenty of trees, water, and clay. &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20hut\"&gt;Swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;s only generate here, and &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn aboveground. &lt;a href=\"Frog\"&gt;Frog&lt;/a&gt;s can be found hopping around eating these slimes, and make for cute pets. &lt;a href=\"Mushroom\"&gt;Mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s are fairly common, making &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt; a good early-game food. &lt;a href=\"Lily%20pad\"&gt;Lily pad&lt;/a&gt;s are common on the water. Fossils spawn 15-24 blocks underground. Blue orchids are exclusive to swamps. \nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Clay\"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;oak wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"blue%20orchid\"&gt;blue orchid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es and their drops, &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in swamp biomes.\nMultiplayer.\nSwamps are good enough by themselves in a multiplayer setting, but are outclassed by taigas and savannas. They provide trees and food (mushrooms), but also boast many dangers on top of enemy players (slimes, drowned and witches). However, bases in swamps are hard to attack without boats and/or lily pads. Aside from this, farming is easy in swamps due to fossils being a good source of bone meal, and water being plentiful. Clay (and bricks) are not good materials to make a base out of - they are very conspicuous. However, the swamp is both a blessing and a curse for redstone-oriented players: Water can ruin redstone contraptions, but slimeballs are in high supply here.\nOcean / Deep Ocean.\nOceans are appealing for players to live in. Oceans spawn in temperature variants, such as warm, lukewarm, normal (basic ocean biome), cold, and frozen. Each one of these (except warm oceans) also have a \"deep\" variant, allowing for larger underwater structures. All ocean types can contain underwater ruins and shipwrecks, and all deep variants can contain ocean monuments.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20grass\"&gt;sea grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure%20explorer%20map\"&gt;treasure map&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20shard\"&gt;prismarine shard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20crystal\"&gt;prismarine crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wet%20sponge\"&gt;wet sponge&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ink%20sac\"&gt;ink sac&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in oceans and deep oceans.\nFrozen Ocean/Deep Frozen Ocean.\nFrozen ocean is an ocean with a surface completely frozen, including deep variants. Some resources are different enough than in other ocean biomes.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure%20explorer%20map\"&gt;treasure map&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20shard\"&gt;prismarine shard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20crystal\"&gt;prismarine crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wet%20sponge\"&gt;wet sponge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ink%20sac\"&gt;ink sac&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt; are useful resources found in deep frozen oceans.\nSnowy Plains.\nThis &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; is made up of large expanses of flat, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;-covered grass. These contain scattered &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s in about the same density as plains biomes, although spruce trees generate instead of oak. There is also a sub-biome consisting of mountains which, while tall, are not as tall as the ones in the mountain biome. This biome can be beautiful, but the cold can make finding a reliable food source difficult.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s (and any rare loot they generate with), snowy &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;arrows of Slowness&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stray\"&gt;strays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;spruce wood&lt;/a&gt; from trees are useful resources found in snowy plains biomes.\nMountains.\nMountains are often sights to behold, usually reaching high above the clouds. They often begin from a meadow biome near the ground, and as the altitude increases you may find snowy slopes or sparse forests. Depending on the type of peak, there may be a jagged stone peak, a snow-capped peak, or a more flat icy peak. &lt;a href=\"Goat\"&gt;Goat&lt;/a&gt;s can often be found jumping around the higher areas of mountains, but be careful that you don't get rammed off the mountain by their horns. Watch your step, as you may find yourself sinking into &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;, which will slowly freeze you to death if you do not escape. \nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Goat\"&gt;Goat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Goat%20Horn\"&gt;Goat Horn&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Packed%20Ice\"&gt;Packed Ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emeralds\"&gt;Emeralds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stone\"&gt;Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spruce\"&gt;Spruce&lt;/a&gt; wood.\nIce Spikes.\nIce spikes is a very interesting biome with its random giant spires of packed ice, which have a very pleasant appearance, but also, like the badlands, lacks resources. This biome is also good for building homes that are more for show than for function. The taller ice spikes can be made into a tower with some work, although, inside, it will be little more than a spiral staircase with a room on top. The smaller ones can also be hollowed out and used to make an igloo. If you decide to live in an ice spikes biome, try to find one that is near a snowy taiga biome, so that you can harvest wood more easily.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Packed%20ice\"&gt;Packed ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in ice spikes biomes.\nMushroom Fields.\nDespite this biome being far down on the list, it is actually one of the easiest biomes to live in. However, Mushroom fields are very rare and are rarely connected to the \"mainland\" in any way. The most common reason for players to look for a mushroom fields biome, is the fact that no monsters (except the &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;) naturally spawn here, although &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s will still spawn mobs. It is completely safe for new players, and still great for experienced players. The one mob that does spawn there, &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s, can be \"milked\" with a &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; to get mushroom stew or with a bucket to get &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for an infinite food source as long as the player has a bowl. The &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; is useful for growing mushrooms, and with the exception of the swamp and dark forest biomes, this is the only biome containing giant mushrooms. Normal monster spawning cannot happen at all, meaning that &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; is unobtainable but the drops of &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s are available from &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, additionally mineshafts still generate and can spawn cave spiders. Trees also don't spawn here, meaning that wood is unavailable unless you find a shipwreck on the mushroom field shore or you bring wood from a nearby island. Make sure to bring &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s with you if you decide to build your house on a mushroom island, if you don't have saplings, wandering traders can still spawn in this biome and may sell saplings, make sure to have emeralds, which you can get from &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck\"&gt;shipwrecks&lt;/a&gt; and mineshaft chests, to buy it.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Mycelium\"&gt;Mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;, planks from &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s, loot from dungeon, mineshaft chest and &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; in mushroom field shore are useful resources found in mushroom fields biomes.\nBeach.\nWhen it comes to how to live on a beach, it really comes down to how to survive in their adjacent biomes. Beaches themselves are biomes of barren sand/gravel except for sugar cane, turtle nests, and buried treasure, if you manage to stumble on some when terraforming. Beaches are mainly appealing for players who want to be able to see the ocean or have an above water base for ocean operations.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Turtle%20egg\"&gt;Turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scute\"&gt;scute&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"heart%20of%20the%20sea\"&gt;heart of the sea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found here.\nJungle.\nAlthough the jungle may not be the best place to start for new players, it can provide lots of &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, as giant &lt;a href=\"jungle%20tree\"&gt;jungle tree&lt;/a&gt;s are the biggest &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s in the game. Also, if the traps are avoided, the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt; has some loot worth taking. One of the problems with the jungle is that thick bundles of leaves generate on the ground, making it hard to navigate. The trees in a jungle can also have horizontal branches on which mobs can spawn.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;Jungle wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s, loot from &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cocoa%20beans\"&gt;cocoa beans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in jungles.\nMultiplayer.\nJungles are a very interesting biome to live in. First off, the chances of enemies finding a base is minuscule, particularly if it is concealed. Second, a lot of wood can be harvested, and melons provide a source of food (albeit an inefficient one) as well as being tradable with farmer villagers. Jungle pyramids can be used as ready-made bases. However, there are several downsides. It is very difficult to construct defenses, and you may have to clear out a large area if building on the ground - which will take a lot of time. As well as this, jungles are often large and hard to navigate, so you might need to write down the coordinates of your base. Treebases can be accessed by vines, and can be hidden easily.\nBamboo Jungle.\nBamboo jungles share many similarities with regular jungles, though instead of jungle trees, massive amounts of dense bamboo shoots and only giant jungle trees can be found.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Log\"&gt;Jungle wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, loot from &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in bamboo jungles.\nMultiplayer.\nBamboo jungles are not recommended for many reasons. One, they have far less wood than normal jungles. Two, they can be very laggy even if you have a very good device. And three, they are quite difficult to navigate and to build defenses in. Even the bamboo itself has little practical use other than making scaffoldings, sticks, and as a poor fuel source.\nStony Shore.\nThe stony shore biome occurs where a biome meets the ocean. Stony shore, is a beach biome variant, and, true to its name, is completely made of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes with &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nUseful resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt; are useful resources found in stone shores.\nDark Forest.\nThis is the only place that &lt;a href=\"dark%20oak%20tree\"&gt;dark oak tree&lt;/a&gt;s can naturally spawn. These thick trees allow players to chop a single tree down for more than half a stack of wood, plus saplings and rarely apples. Also, dark forests will occasionally spawn &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s when sufficiently far away from the world spawn point. However, in addition to all of the problems with living in a regular forest, the area underneath the trees is often dark enough for monsters to spawn even in daytime, making this &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; rather dangerous, especially for beginners.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Log\"&gt;Dark oak wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totems of undying&lt;/a&gt; (found when you kill a &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; found in a &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; and raids) are useful resources found in dark forests.\nSnowy Taiga.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt; is a snowy, cold biome, which can be considered the snowy variant of the spruce forest. &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and foxes will spawn here, which can aid the player when tamed. Snow falls instead of rain, and water will eventually turn to ice if exposed to the sun, which disallows sugar cane or infinite water sources outdoors unless near a light source. Snow on top of your shelter can be annoying, and the few leaves on spruce trees can mean fewer saplings.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berries\"&gt;sweet berries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and their loot, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s and their loot, and &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es are useful resources found in snowy taiga biomes.\nMultiplayer.\nThis is a good place to live in multiplayer. Both wood and food can be found here. Igloos make decent bases, and the villagers in their basement offer trades. Consider curing the zombie villager to get discounts on its trades, or alternatively take the &lt;a href=\"Brewing%20Stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;. Wolves are good companions found here, and pillager outposts can generate too.\nOld Growth Pine Taiga.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Growth%20Pine%20Taiga\"&gt;Old Growth Pine Taiga&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. the giant tree taiga) is a variant of the regular taiga which spawns with huge 2x2 trees. These trees have few leaves, but yield lots of wood. The ground here is made up of &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt; and dead bushes can be found, giving it a more \"decaying\" feel. There are many ferns and double ferns that may otherwise be rare, as well as &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, which is a good alternative to &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; (since mushrooms can be placed on it in the daytime). Mossy cobblestone spawns naturally here, making it unnecessary to use up &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; to cut &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, if using mossy cobblestone for building. Like other taiga biomes, wolves can spawn in this biome. Foxes can also spawn.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Podzol\"&gt;Podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es are useful resources found in giant tree taiga biomes.\nMultiplayer.\nIn multiplayer, this biome is not as good as a regular taiga due to the lack of horizontal cover. However, it provides almost as much wood as a jungle biome and offers a good opportunity for tree bases. There are also mushrooms, which can be used in mushroom soup.\nSavanna.\nThe &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biome has a similar appearance to the grassland, but it doesn't rain here (except in the windswept variant), and it contains plateaus for a greater vertical range of building. Trees are not as abundant as in other forested biomes, with a more open feel. There can be many high mountains, which can be beneficial and problematic. The diversity of views possible offer flat, semi terraced, and sheer vistas.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Acacia\"&gt;Acacia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oak\"&gt;oak trees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s for storage, &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt; for seeds, an abundance of animals and &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in the savanna biome.\nMultiplayer.\nSavannas are one of the best places to build bases. They have less trees than a forest, but more than plains. Plateaus are great as vantage points where you can see the surrounding land, and animals and coal spawn here. The only downside to savannas is that once you have gathered the resources, it's just a hotter variant of the plains biome. For this reason, it's very important to make a tree farm if the savanna is quite small, so that you can keep producing wood sustainably. Shattered savannas are great for both camouflage and height, but building defenses can be very challenging due to the height variation.\nBadlands.\nThe canyons hold a lot of &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;. While only a select few variants have some useful trees to start out with, you'll want to come back here to enjoy the scenery. Apart from the scenery, you can also mine out the plentiful terracotta for other projects. Like the desert or mushroom fields, it's best to start out somewhere else and return here when you have gathered some basic materials. You can also find above ground &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s in this biome.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Terracotta\"&gt;Terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20sandstone\"&gt;red sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;oak wood&lt;/a&gt; from trees in wooded badlands are useful resources found in \ncanyon biomes.\nUnderground Biomes.\nWhile living on the surface allows for more open building options and easier movement, living under the surface allows the player to remain right next to the vast resources of Minecraft's underground. Across all cave biomes, there are ores and structures that will help greatly in progressing and gaining stronger equipment.\nNote that the underground can be split into two similar sections; The upper half of the underground is comprised of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; blocks, and contains mainly coal, copper, iron, and in some biomes, emeralds; The lower half is made up of &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt;, a darker and tougher rock, and contains iron, gold, redstone, and diamonds. Structures like mineshafts, geodes, and strongholds can typically generate at any height, but some structures, such as an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;, only generate in the deepslate layer.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Stone\"&gt;Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tuff\"&gt;tuff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"amethyst%20geode\"&gt;amethyst geode&lt;/a&gt;s loot and mob farming opportunities are useful resources found here.\nLush Caves.\nThe Lush Caves are a rather peaceful underground biome, being covered in greenery comprised of &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;Moss Block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Azalea\"&gt;Azalea&lt;/a&gt; bushes, and &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Berries\"&gt;Glow Berries&lt;/a&gt;. The glow berries provide a significant amount of light to the caves, meaning hostile mobs are frequently prevented from spawning in areas where the light can reach the ground. Additionally, pools of water containing clay and &lt;a href=\"Dripleaf\"&gt;Dripleaf&lt;/a&gt; plants, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Axolotl\"&gt;Axolotl&lt;/a&gt;, a cute, friendly creature that can be caught with a water bucket. \nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;Moss Block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Azalea\"&gt;Azalea&lt;/a&gt; bushes &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Berries\"&gt;Glow Berries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dripleaf\"&gt;Dripleaf&lt;/a&gt; plants, &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Axolotl\"&gt;Axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Fish\"&gt;Tropical Fish&lt;/a&gt;, general underground resources.\nDripstone Caves.\nDripstone Caves are mainly just regular caves with &lt;a href=\"Dripstone\"&gt;Dripstone&lt;/a&gt; formations all across the floor and ceilings of caves, and small water pockets under Dripstone stalactites. While they are a spectacle, the biome does not offer much in way of unique resources. &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt; zombies do spawn occasionally in this biome, and those wielding &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s can pose a threat, as they can knock loose stalactites that will deal damage should they fall on the player. \nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Dripstone%20Block\"&gt;Dripstone Block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pointed%20Dripstone\"&gt;Pointed Dripstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt;s (from Drowned), general underground resources.\nDeep Dark.\nThe Deep Dark stands out as one of the most dangerous biomes in the game; Only generating in the deepstone layer, this biome consists of a unique growth known as the &lt;a href=\"Sculk\"&gt;Sculk&lt;/a&gt;, a family of blocks that include &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Block\"&gt;Sculk Block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Catalyst\"&gt;Sculk Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor\"&gt;Sculk Sensor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Vein\"&gt;Sculk Vein&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Shrieker\"&gt;Sculk Shrieker&lt;/a&gt;s. These blocks generate in small patches around the biome and should be approached cautiously, as if a Sculk Sensor or Shrieker detects a vibration, they will alert a very dangerous mob, the &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;. This formidable creature cannot see, but instead uses vibrations to detect the player, like the Sculk it emerges from. The player will need to remain sneaking to avoid detection, though beware that the Warden also has a keen sense of smell, so remaining motionless is not enough to avoid danger. Carrying projectiles like snowballs is useful for distracting the Warden, but be careful not to anger it by spamming projectiles.\nA structure unique to the Deep Dark, the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;, contains lots of powerful and unique loot for the player to grab, but more likely than not the city will be covered in Sculk. As opening chests causes vibrations, the player will have to be very careful not to set off any Shriekers while doing so.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Swift%20Sneak\"&gt;Swift Sneak&lt;/a&gt; enchanted books, Diamond Leggings(Possibly enchanted), Diamond Hoe (Possibly enchanted), &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Shard\"&gt;Echo Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Disc%20Fragment\"&gt;Disc Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s, Soul Fire Torches, Experience (From destroying Sculk blocks), Sculk blocks (With silk touch), Deepslate blocks, wool blocks, wood, and candles from dismantling Cities, general underground resources.\nNether.\nThe Nether contains plenty of valuable resources and is a hospitable place to permanently live, but it is still a dangerous and difficult place to live in. Food is absent in some biomes and hard to come by in others. \nIn order to set the player's spawn in this dimension, a &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt; can be crafted with &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt; (obtained from piglin bartering and bastion remnant chests) and &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; blocks. More glowstone blocks are required to charge the anchor, with each death taking away one charge, and one glowstone block. \nBlackstone, a stone equivalent that generates in patched within netherrack or basalt, can be used to make stone tools and furnaces. It also has its own set of decorative blocks, such as stairs, slabs, etc.\nA rare ore, &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;, generates hidden within the terrain (not exposed to air). This ore, when smelted into &lt;a href=\"netherite%20scrap\"&gt;netherite scrap&lt;/a&gt; and combined with gold ingots, can be turned into &lt;a href=\"netherite%20ingot\"&gt;netherite ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. With a &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Table\"&gt;Smithing Table&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"smithing%20template\"&gt;netherite upgrade smithing template&lt;/a&gt; (also found in bastion remnant chests), they can use these ingots to upgrade any diamond gear to the most powerful toolset tier available.\nThree notable structures generate in the Nether, those being &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s. Nether fortresses offer useful loot such as nether warts and blaze rods for brewing, saddles for striders, iron/gold ingots, obsidian, and diamonds. Wither skeletons can drop their skulls, which can be used in conjunction with soul sand/soil to summon the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. Bastion remnants offer an abundance of blackstone, chains, and gold blocks, as well as a variety of gold and (rarely) netherite related items. The pigstep &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt; can also be obtained here. Ruined portals are incomplete nether portals often accompanied by crying obsidian, a gold block or two, and likely a chest containing some gold and a flint and steel to ignite the portal, if the player has enough obsidian to restore it. \nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Netherrack\"&gt;Netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz%20ore\"&gt;nether quartz ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; (for smelting and decoration), &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; loot, &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt; loot, &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt; loot, &lt;a href=\"ghast%20tear\"&gt;ghast tear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s are items, blocks, and entities can that be found throughout the Nether in all or most biomes.\nGeneral Hazards.\nThe most immediate problem is the monsters which spawn, generally regardless of light level. Bases can be floored with transparent or partial blocks to prevent spawns inside the base. Depending on the nearby biomes, various other measures will also be needed: For Endermen, avoid building with blocks they can pick up, and make sure that low ceilings are available for shelter. For Ghasts, enclose the base completely to prevent them from getting line-of-sight on a player. Avoiding fragile blocks on the exterior can forestall problems when working near the base. Piglins can be deterred by placing &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;soul fire&lt;/a&gt; (including the torches, lanterns, or campfires) as a perimeter, and pacified by wearing a piece of gold armor. (Note that they can open doors!) Hoglins can be deterred with &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;warped fungus&lt;/a&gt;, and cannot pass through one-block-wide gaps. Zombified Piglins are a particular nuisance, because of the hazard of accidentally aggravating them; they can also knock on doors (and in Hard difficulty, break them) even while still neutral. However, most of the general base-defense techniques (not lava or fire) will work against them. Magma cubes are especially dangerous -- in areas where they can spawn, spawnproofing and a solid perimeter are a must, and low ceilings can at least keep the largest cubes out.\nThe longer-term problem is the difficulty of farming: All dirt must be imported, and crops must be farmed \"dry\". However, trees and large mushrooms can be farmed normally (given dirt), and large fungi can provide \"wood\". Hoglins or imported animals can provide meat.\nNether Wastes.\nThe nether wastes is a biome that is a barren netherrack cavern with little to offer in terms of survival.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;Bartering&lt;/a&gt; loot are useful resources found in nether wastes.\nWarped Forest.\nThe easiest of the new biomes introduced to settle down in is the warped forest. This is a fairly crowded forest of blue warped fungi trees, which provide a blue-tinted wood that can be used in place of Overworld wood types to make a crafting station, sticks, tools, etc. Endermen are the only hostile mob to spawn in this biome, and combat can be avoided if players are careful to not look near their eyes. Bringing a carved pumpkin to protect yourself from endermen is also recommended.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Warped%20stem\"&gt;Warped stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungi\"&gt;warped fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"twisting%20vines\"&gt;twisting vines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in the warped forest.\nCrimson Forest.\nThe crimson forest is a red counterpart to the warped forest, with more dangerous mobs inhabiting it. While this makes surviving mobs harder than in the warped forest, the crimson forest offers food options that the warped forest cannot. It is up to the player to decide which of the two biomes is more desirable. &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s inhabit this biome, meaning the player will need to equip at least one piece of gold armor to prevent them from attacking on sight. Piglins also become angered whenever opening a chest or mining &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt; within their line of sight, so the player may want to enclose their chests in a windowless room to prevent piglin attacks.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20stem\"&gt;Crimson stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crimson%20fungi\"&gt;crimson fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weeping%20vines\"&gt;weeping vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; loot are useful resources found in the crimson forest.\nSoul Sand Valley.\nSoul sand valleys are by far the most trying biome to live in amongst the Nether biomes. The biome is coated in a floor of &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, making traversing slow. &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s spawn frequently here, which when combined with the slowing nature of soul sand, can be very dangerous to the player. Soul fire is present in this biome, and occurs whenever soul sand or soil is set on fire. It deals double the damage of normal fire, but using soul sand/soil in certain crafting recipes can allow the player to craft soul fire variants of useful blocks, such as &lt;a href=\"soul%20torch\"&gt;soul torch&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"soul%20campfire\"&gt;soul campfire&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Bone%20block\"&gt;Bone block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast%20tear\"&gt;ghast tear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; are useful resources found in soul sand valleys. \nBasalt Deltas.\nBasalt deltas are a unique biome in the Nether, as netherrack rarely generates within it (aside from structures). Instead, &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt; make up most of the terrain. Small lava pools are dotted around the biome, and &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s spawn much more commonly here than elsewhere, with the rare &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; being the only other naturally spawning mob.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Basalt\"&gt;Basalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found in basalt deltas.\nThe End.\nThis dimension would not be advisable for beginner players, but for players who want an advanced challenge, the End could serve as a home after the final boss is defeated. The End dimension is made up of two different areas: the center island where the final boss is fought; and the outer islands that begin generating 1000 blocks from the center. The center island is a somewhat small landmass that is made up of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. The outer islands feature many end stone islands, chorus plants, and valuable end cities. Should the player chose to live solely in this biome without important items from the Overworld (as if they had spawned into the world for the first time), the center island is uninhabitable on its own merits; it offers no food or resources to collect. The outer islands must be reached in order to obtain the necessary resources. Note that the player will need to kill the final boss before the challenge begins, as it will likely kill an item-less or starting player in a few seconds.\nCentral Island.\nThis is the location the player will first encounter when entering the End, and is the location of the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; boss. For long-term survival, the Ender Dragon will have to be defeated, as the boss will destroy any blocks other than end stone, obsidian or indestructible blocks like bedrock.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"End%20stone\"&gt;End stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt; portals, the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found on the central island.\nOuter Islands.\nThe outer islands of the End are more sustainable than the central island, but they are still a harrowing challenge. The biome consists of large end stone islands that are usually separated by gaps dozens of blocks wide. Ender pearls or bridges can be used to cross these gaps, but be wary of angering &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, as they can teleport onto the bridge and easily knock the player off. \nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"End%20stone\"&gt;End stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"purpur\"&gt;purpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt; loot, &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chorus%20flower\"&gt;chorus flower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s are useful resources found on the outer islands.\nOther.\nWhile not technically biomes, these areas offer different base building experiences than any biome and may be desirable to some players.\nSky.\nBuilding high above the surface can be challenging, as there is a constant danger of falling, and the player will need to set up farms to sustain themselves without taking trips to the surface. However, building a skybase can allow the player lots of creative freedom without any land to get in their way.\nUnderground.\nAs an opposite to the sky, the underground may require the player to spend lots of time mining out space for structures. Any room or cave near the player's base will need to be lit up sufficiently to prevent mob spawning, however, a wandering trader along with two &lt;a href=\"trader%20llama\"&gt;trader llama&lt;/a&gt;s can also spawn underground. However, the player would be living right next to a vast amount of resources such as iron, diamond, and more. While likely less desirable than living on the surface, living in the underground can provide a unique survival experience.\nUseful Resources.\n&lt;a href=\"Stone\"&gt;Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; loot and mob farming opportunities are useful resources found here."}

{"id": "165799", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=165799", "title": "Tutorials/Best biomes to play", "text": "There are many &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in \"Minecraft\". Some are easier and harder to live in depending on the availability of food, wood, and other resources. Some biomes may have variants that can be easier or harder to live in.\nThe Overworld.\nThe &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; first spawns in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; where resources such as &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; are plentiful in most biomes. However, certain biomes have other negative things in them, making them harder to survive in.\nForest.\n&lt;a href=\"Forest\"&gt;Forests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Birch%20Forest\"&gt;Birch Forests&lt;/a&gt; are very common biomes, likely to be where you spawn in. As a rather basic biome, living in or near one is recommended for new players. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Forest\"&gt;Dark Forests&lt;/a&gt; should be considered as a more extreme version of the normal Forest that happens to contain the coveted &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;Woodland Mansions&lt;/a&gt;.\nPros:\nCons:\nPlains.\n&lt;a href=\"Plains\"&gt;Plains&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Meadow\"&gt;Meadows&lt;/a&gt; are common biomes characterized by grassy, flat terrain and plentiful &lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;Bees&lt;/a&gt;. It's highly recommended to live here for many reasons. The &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt; can be seen as a variant of the plains biome that has llamas and more trees at the cost of being hotter. \nPros: \nCons:\nTaiga.\n&lt;a href=\"Taiga\"&gt;Taigas&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Old%20Growth%20Taiga\"&gt;Old Growth Taiga&lt;/a&gt; Variants provide a similar yet distinct experience from normal Forests. This is the way to go if you're looking for a different kind of play.\nPros:\nCons:\nJungle.\n&lt;a href=\"Jungle\"&gt;Jungles&lt;/a&gt; and their variants from a glance might seem to be one of the best places to live. However, many factors add up for it to be an unpleasant experience to those who try, mostly pertaining to the foliage.\nPros:\nCons:\nSnowy Biomes.\nOn cold extreme, the &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Plains\"&gt;Snowy Plains&lt;/a&gt; and other associated biomes like the Ice Spikes might surprise some with their difficulties. Since temperature &lt;a href=\"Powder%20Snow\"&gt;for the most part&lt;/a&gt; isn't a problem, this biome plays out very similar to the plains and taiga. Due to this many of the downsides will not be listed as it's the same as the aforementioned biomes.\nPros:\nCons:\nDeserts.\n&lt;a href=\"Desert\"&gt;Deserts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; are the other temperature extreme, often being barren, flat and seemingly inhospitable. With proper skill and adequate preparation, it can lead to a thriving base for those who can tough out some of the downsides.\nPros:\nCons:\nOceans.\nWhile these biomes aren't considered often, &lt;a href=\"Ocean\"&gt;Oceans&lt;/a&gt; aren't bad places to live, just requiring some extra precautions before settling down.\nPros:\nCons:\nMountains.\nEven if they are painful to traverse, &lt;a href=\"Mountains\"&gt;Mountains&lt;/a&gt; have many reasons to live in them. The view is often second to none and various treasures can be found within.\nPros:\nCons:\nSwamps.\n&lt;a href=\"Swamp\"&gt;Swamps&lt;/a&gt; and its variant, the Mangrove Swamp are incredibly different biomes for survival, but both may be interesting to live in.\nPros:\nCons:\nThe Nether.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; is a different dimension that is altogether more hostile and dangerous for survival, with powerful mobs, difficult terrain, and an ever-present danger of lava falls and lava oceans. However, it offers many valuable items not found in the Overworld, as well as a unique and challenging survival experience.\nPros as a whole:\nCons as a whole:\nWarped Forest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Forest\"&gt;Warped Forest&lt;/a&gt; is the safest biome in the Nether, as only &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; and passive &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s spawn here naturally. It is still possible to find a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;, both of which contain dangerous enemies.\nPros:\nCons:\nNether Wastes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wastes\"&gt;Nether Wastes&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more barren biomes in the Nether, but is still considered relatively safe due to the open terrain and the fact that overwhelming numbers of hostile mobs do not spawn here. A wide variety of mobs spawn in this biome, including the &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;, and strider.\nPros:\nCons: \nCrimson Forest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt; is seen as the red counterpart to the warped forest. Piglins and hoglins spawn here in abundance along with the occasional zombified piglin, so this biome is generally regarded as one of the more dangerous biomes in the Nether.\nPros:\nCons:\nSoul Sand Valley.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand%20Valley\"&gt;Soul Sand Valley&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively open biome, but is regarded as dangerous. Due to the high amounts of ghasts and skeletons combined with soul sand slowing down anything that walks into it, this biome can be extremely difficult to survive in.\nPros:\nCons:\nBasalt Deltas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Basalt%20Deltas\"&gt;Basalt Deltas&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most challenging biomes in the Nether due to its uneven terrain, frequent lava pools, and high numbers of magma cubes. Survival in one of these biomes is considered quite difficult and dangerous.\nPros:\nCons:"}

Otherwise, you may end up having a house that can be burned down or blown up easily, or you may spend unnecessary time looking for supplies to build a house out of rare materials and lastly, if no consideration is taken to building materials, the end result can end up looking strange at best and unappealing/haphazard at worst. This tutorial page contrasts different building materials, and additionally gives an overall view of the quality of the material.\nWhat to look for.\nWhen picking a material to build with, there are three main considerations: Obtainability, durability, and decoration.\nObtainability.\nSome materials are easier to get, while others are extremely difficult and many are somewhere in between. For example, in &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;, making a house of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; is certainly easier than making one of &lt;a href=\"diamond%20block\"&gt;diamond block&lt;/a&gt;s. Also to consider is the &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resources\"&gt;renewability&lt;/a&gt; of the material you would like to use. Some materials can be replicated through various means and thus gained infinitely, while others must be sought after over increasing distances from spawn.\nDurability.\nThe durability of a material is important, especially in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Multiplayer%20PvP%20bases\"&gt;PVP&lt;/a&gt;. The main considerations to make are &lt;a href=\"hardness\"&gt;hardness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blast%20resistance\"&gt;blast resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;flammability&lt;/a&gt;. Maximum durability is not always necessary. If you don't expect to be attacked by players, then hardness shouldn't be a problem. If you can stop &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s from getting close, blast resistance isn't as important. If there is no nearby &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"trees\"&gt;trees&lt;/a&gt; to spread fire and you aren't concerned about lightning, flammability isn't a problem either. Just remember that it is usually better to have too much durability than too little.\nDecoration.\nUnless you are building strictly for function, then decoration blocks are a big part of enhancing your builds when you've done all that you feel you can with normal building blocks. Ultimately what looks the best is a matter of opinion, and there is no right or wrong way to decorate."}

{"id": "120369", "revid": "255294", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=120369", "title": "Tutorials/Best enchantments guide", "text": "This guide will give you an explanation and walk-through of the best &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; you can apply to everything that can be enchanted in the game.\nThis page assumes that the world is created and played in the latest game version. However, it is possible to obtain different and more extreme enchantment combinations on prior versions; early 1.14 releases notably allow more than one protection enchantment to be applied to a single piece at a given time. \nThe enchantments are sorted from highest to least priority.\nOn this page, an sign means that the enchantment cannot be obtained via enchanting table, and must be added through an anvil.\nArmor.\n\"Have at least one piece with protection, preferably the pants, or just enchant your entire armor set with protection (save for one situational enchantment on the chestplate).\"\n&lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; is not as necessary on armor as on tools and weapons. Unbreaking III on a piece of armor only makes it last about 43% longer, but for a tool or a weapon, its durability is effectively quadrupled. \nThere are multiple enchantment orders with the same &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics%23Costs%20for%20combining%20enchantments\"&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Experience%23Leveling%20up\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;. At the same total costs in levels the cost in &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; can still be different. For example two steps costing 2 and 4 levels require more &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; than two steps costing 3 levels each. The optimal enchantment orders is codice_1 with a cost of 6 + 2 + 2 + 8 + 9 = 27 levels.\nThe optimal enchantment orders is codice_2 with a cost of 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 levels.\nThe optimal enchantment orders is codice_3 with a cost of 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 levels.\nThere are multiple enchantment orders with the same &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics%23Costs%20for%20combining%20enchantments\"&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Experience%23Leveling%20up\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;. At the same total costs in levels the cost in &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; can still be different. For example two steps costing 2 and 4 levels require more &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; than two steps costing 3 levels each. The optimal enchantment orders is codice_4 with a cost of 6 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 10 = 30 levels.\nFeather Falling.\nWhen obtaining Feather Falling from an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;, the player should not enchant at level 30, but reduce to levels 22, 24 or 26. At level 30, there is only about a 3% chance to obtain Feather Falling on a pair of diamond boots; but using level 24 and 26, the chance is a much-higher 30%; at level 22, the chance is as high as 44%. The enchantment level can be reduced by placing &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or any other block between the enchanting table and the bookshelves, which prevents the enchanting table from detecting the bookshelves.\nWeapons.\nKnockback is a fairly controversial enchantment. Some players absolutely hate it, especially in SMPs and PVP fights, while other players add it to knock away mobs like creepers and piglin brutes. In Netherite PVP, Knockback I allows you to knock away enemies while still being able to reach them but Knockback II knocks the enemy away too far, making it hard for you to launch a counterattack. &lt;br&gt;\n1) Sword + Looting III (6 levels, 72 experience) &lt;br&gt;\n2) Sweeping Edge III + Unbreaking III (3 levels, 27 experience) &lt;br&gt;\n3) [1] + [2] (11 levels, 187 experience) &lt;br&gt;\n4) Sharpness V + Knockback II (2 levels, 16 experience) &lt;br&gt;\n5) [3] + [4] (11 levels, 187 experience) &lt;br&gt;\n6) Fire Aspect II + Mending (2 levels, 16 experience) &lt;br&gt;\n7) [5] + [6] (14 levels, 280 experience) &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; means without &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; you need 383 fewer &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. With Unbreaking I / II / III you need on average 767/1151/1535 less arrows (1536=24 stacks). &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; means your &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; will never break if you continually gain enough &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, which will likely happen. If you have an enchanting setup and a lot of iron for anvils, Infinity is better, unless you can obtain large quantities of arrows with ease. Another exception would be if you got a powerful bow early game, for example from &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;: Mending would be better because you won't have a lot of iron or an enchanting table early on. It's worth noting as well that Infinity doesn't work with tipped arrows, so Mending is preferable when the player uses tipped arrows as ammunition (for example, Arrows of Slowness from a &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt; farm). Punch II is optional, as knockback can sometimes be a nuisance. Some pros of Punch include being able to knock away high-damaging mob such as creepers, piglin brutes and vindicators. It's also useful when being repeatedly hacked by an enemy player and for bow-boosting. \nThere are multiple enchantment orders with the same &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics%23Costs%20for%20combining%20enchantments\"&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Experience%23Leveling%20up\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;. At the same total costs in levels the cost in &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; can still be different. For example two steps costing 2 and 4 levels require more &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; than two steps costing 3 levels each. The optimal enchantment orders is codice_5 with a cost of 5 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 10 = 29 levels.\nCrossbows can only receive up to Quick Charge II through an enchanting table. Quick Charge III must be obtained via other means: either by combining two crossbows in an anvil, using enchanted books, or via mob drops.\n&lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; allows the user to shoot three projectiles for the cost of one. &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt; allows the retrieval of arrows which hit a mob, similar to &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;. They are mutually exclusive. \n&lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; can be useful for fighting &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in any weather conditions. &lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; will make your trident come to you automatically, unless you throw it into the void. \n&lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; is useful for fast &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; in certain &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; conditions or underwater, it can also be used as a reliable substitute of &lt;a href=\"Firework%20Rocket\"&gt;firework rockets&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; as long as there is a water source nearby, or it is &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;ing. \n&lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; makes a lightning strike on any mobs you attack with your trident (only works under &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s). This can be used to turn &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, red &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s into brown mooshrooms, and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s into charged creepers. A charged creeper's explosion will cause a nearby mob to drop its head (such as zombies, skeletons, and other creepers) so this enchantment is useful for farming &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;mob heads&lt;/a&gt;. But beware of that as charged creepers' explosions can one shot you even with full Protection IV netherite armor so a totem is recommended. \nImpaling is almost useless in Java Edition, as they only work against underwater mobs such as guardians. However, in Bedrock Edition, Impaling affects everyone as long as they're exposed to water or rain, making it useful in PVP. \nTools.\n&lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; III has the highest priority when you mine for ores, especially &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; V, when combined with the &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; II effect obtained from &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;s, allows the instant mining of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, making mining much faster.\n&lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; is useful for a variety of blocks. A notable one is the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;, a block used frequently in late-game, which can only be retrieved with a Silk Touch pickaxe. Others include stone (for stone bricks or selling to villagers), bee nests, and glass.\nIt is usually not recommended to enchant shears at all, as they can only be enchanted through an anvil, and they are crafted with &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s which are very easy to come by in late-game. So only enchant them if you have an abundance of &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Book\"&gt;enchanted books&lt;/a&gt; of the above categories. \nSimilar to shears, flint and steel is not recommended to be enchanted. However, it can be useful in situations when you want a long lasting flint and steel. \nShields are a great substitute in place of totems and are especially useful when utilised correctly in SMP PVP. However, shields are almost useless in high ping and against explosives (1.19.2 and below). Also, putting a banner on a shield makes it look cooler.\nBeing one of the least used tools in the game, it is not recommended to obtain the tool in the first place, not to mention enchanting it. \nThis tool is not recommended to be enchanted, for reasons similar to carrot on a stick stated above. In addition, even if its durability is depleted, it will simply turn into a &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20Rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;, which means the player can simply craft the rod with another warped fungus in their inventory to make a new one.\nIt is almost necessary to apply these two enchantments to elytra, as they are one of the most useful modes of &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; in late-game. Unbreaking is needed to quadruple the elytra's airborne time, since elytra breaking in mid-air can be deadly; Mending is the most effective way to repair elytra, as otherwise they can only be repaired with &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Membrane\"&gt;phantom membranes&lt;/a&gt; or other elytras in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, and the cost increases over time.\nSimilar to shears &amp; flint and steel, brushes are not recommended to be enchanted. However, it can be useful in situations when you want a long lasting brush. \nConflicting Enchantments.\nConflicting enchantments are enchantments that cannot be combined on the same armor, weapon or tool without &lt;a href=\"Commands/give\"&gt;/give&lt;/a&gt; or changing the playerdata.nbt using a NBT editor. The following enchantments cannot be combined:\nFurther guide.\nThe following &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; cannot be combined: &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Projectile%20Protection\"&gt;Projectile Protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt;. Protection prevents half the damage that would be blocked by the other three. Protection is better, but there are sometimes other factors you should take into account. If you fall often in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, it would be better to put &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; on your &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. If you die often from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; explosions, put Blast Protection armor on.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%23Enchantments\"&gt;Note&lt;/a&gt;: More than 20 &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchantment&lt;/a&gt; Protection Factor (EPF) is useless. 1 Level of &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; = 1 EPF, 1 Level of specific type of Protection = 2 EPF. For example, two pieces of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with Protection IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe following &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; cannot be combined: &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on what you want to do with the sword or axe, you can choose the most suitable. Sharpness is useful for general use, Smite is useful against &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs (&lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.), Bane of Arthropods is useful against &lt;a href=\"Arthropod\"&gt;Arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s). Each level of Smite and Bane of Arthropods deals 2.5 extra &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to the specific group of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Sharpness deals 1.25 extra damage [&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;] and codice_6 extra damage . If you are going to battle a lot of undead mobs (with the same sword or axe) more than every third[&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;] / fourth[&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, level I to II] / fifth[&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, level III to V] time, Smite deals the most damage. The same rule is not fully valid for choosing Bane of Arthropods, as &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Arthropods&lt;/a&gt; have low health, meaning Sharpness should be enough. Sharpness is the best choice, so have another sword with Smite for zombie farming (optional), or carry both a sharpness sword and a smite sword (optional, only if you have good inventory management).\nAside from curses, there aren't any enchantments that should be avoided with other tools."}
{"id": "89565", "revid": "5290187", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=89565", "title": "Tutorials/Blast chamber", "text": "A blast chamber is a chamber used to greatly decrease both the chance of &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; loss and the &lt;a href=\"blast%20resistance\"&gt;blast resistance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; while trying to break blocks with &lt;a href=\"explosions\"&gt;explosions&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is important to note that this method only works with blocks that can be moved by &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt;, and more importantly, most explosions can cause blocks and their items to be destroyed entirely, making it impossible to get them back. The exception to this are TNT blasts, where they drop all blocks broken as items as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2019w11a\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrinciple.\nBlocks cannot just exist outside the block grid. However pistons appear to do this all the time. Actually, the blocks to be pushed are deleted, then &lt;a href=\"Piston%23moving%20piston\"&gt;moving piston&lt;/a&gt; is placed at the destination, then play the animation of blocks moving to give a sense of blocks moving.\nThis \"phantom\" block has some interesting properties. It has a blast resistance of 0, and can't be broken by tools, but it can be broken by an explosion, after that it will drop the same things the block it replaces would drop if broken by explosions. Thus, blowing up a moving block greatly increases efficiency.\nTo get enough explosions for a blast chamber, either use &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Block%20and%20item%20duplication%23TNT%20Duplication\"&gt;TNT duplication&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"creepers\"&gt;creepers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghast%23Ghast%20fireball\"&gt;ghast fireballs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wither%23Wither%20skull\"&gt;wither skulls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ender%20crystals\"&gt;ender crystals&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nSince &lt;a href=\"19w11a\"&gt;19w11a&lt;/a&gt;, the usefulness of blast chambers has increased greatly - as blocks destroyed by TNT now have a 100% drop rate. Motion still reduces blast resistance of blocks though, so the classic blast chamber design yields more blocks broken per TNT. It may also be still beneficial with other explosion sources - Withers, Ghasts, etc."}
{"id": "46125", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=46125", "title": "Tutorials/Blaze farming", "text": "This tutorial seeks to teach you, the player, how to farm &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, a mob found in &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt;es.\nUsage.\nThere are many uses for a blaze farm. Blazes drop twice as much &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; as normal mobs while only having 20 health points, the same amount as a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. This makes blazes ideal for XP farming. On top of that, &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s are the only source of &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; which is needed for &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt; and to get to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. Blaze rods are also the fourth most efficient &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; sources; the top three being &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20coal\"&gt;blocks of coal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dried%20kelp%20block\"&gt;dried kelp block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBasic Parts.\nBefore starting your blaze farm, you will need to find a fortress. Once you've found one, you need to decide where and how you want your blaze farm to be built. You can either make a blaze farm from blaze spawners or from the open fortress. Each place needs its own system to deal with them.\nSpawner.\nBuilding a blaze farm around a spawner is possibly the easiest farm to build. This is because the area around a blaze spawner will only spawn blazes. These farms have the following components:\nWhen building a blaze farm using a spawner, it is recommended to light up the area around the spawner temporarily, so that blazes don't spawn while you're building the farm itself. Blazes will spawn around a spawner if there is a light level of 11 or lower (lower half of their body).\nWhen you remove the light sources within the cage, you may need a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;potion of Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; to survive a swarm of blazes.\nOpen Fortress.\nThese are possibly the most difficult to build because the open fortress will also spawn &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, normal &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s. Building an open-fortress design meant solely for blazes is impractical if you have an alternative, but if your nether fortress does not have a blaze spawner, or you accidentally destroyed them, an open fortress farm is your only option. Here are the basic parts:\nDesigns.\nThere are many different designs for blaze farms. Here are some examples:\nEthosLab's Design.\nIn this design, the blazes are pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s when they touch the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s, which condenses the blazes into the grinder. The grinder, like many other farms, is triggered by a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, which suffocates the blazes until they are down to a half of a heart, allowing for players to kill them in one hit. This design also includes an option to trigger &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow on and off, allowing to stop blazes from spawning if desired.\nMumbo Jumbo's Design.\nThis design is very similar to the previous one. Like EthosLab's design, it uses pistons to push the blazes down into a grinder, which suffocates the blazes until they have only a half of a heart left. However, the &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; for this design is different, partially because of the addition of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparators\"&gt;redstone comparators&lt;/a&gt; in Minecraft &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.5\"&gt;Java Edition 1.5&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenerikb's Design.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//i.redd.it/vfid1xh8dfq11.jpg\"&gt;Schematic&lt;/a&gt;\nThis design is different from previous designs. There is no redstone for this design, making it a lot simpler to build. Also, unlike the first 2 designs, the player must move around to kill the blazes, as well as completely kill the blazes, rather than just hit them once. Basically, this design allows the blazes to fall into rows, where the player can safely attack their feet, without taking any damage from the blazes.\nGnembon's Design.\nThis 1.12 design is very resource friendly since it uses the AI wandering process instead of pistons to collect blazes. A follow-up video in the channel further eliminates the redstone-powered grinder by circumventing entity cramming with ladders and killing multiple blazes with a Sweeping Edge sword. (It's still working in 1.14.2).\nHere's a very quick tutorial that shows how to build the same farm.\nImpulseSV's Design.\nThis design was one of the few fully automatic designs for a blaze farm. Because of the fact that it is fully automatic, it requires a lot more redstone than semi-automatic farms, and is therefore more complicated. What happens in this blaze farm is, a player must be in a certain spot, so that the blazes can attack that player. Once the player is attacked, tamed &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; positioned in a certain spot will kill the blaze.\nDue to the update in 1.8, this design no longer works as blaze do not swim upward in lava.\n1.16+ Design.\n1.16 adds the feature that lava pushes fire-resistant mobs. This allows for easy spawner farms similar to using water to push mobs in the overworld. This design by Cheesedud6 uses no redstone for the basic collection unit, with the option of having a redstone mob softener.\nBedrock edition.\nFlowing Lava.\nFlowing lava pushes the blazes to the flowing point. (tested in Bedrock 1.19) This property makes blaze farming extremely cheap and easy.\nMumbo Jumbo's Design.\nBased on Mumbo Jumbo's design (above), this design omits the suffocation block but keeps the player within activation distance of the spawner. The Redstone Repeater needs to be placed facing South with a signal delay of 2. The button on the right toggles the lava lighting to pause spawning, and the lever on the left toggles the centering pistons."}
{"id": "87162", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=87162", "title": "Tutorials/Block and item duplication", "text": "This page seeks to teach you how to clone &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s without building a separate farm for them, in vanilla Survival mode. It can be treated as an \"everything farm,\" since it can \"farm\" things that can't normally be farmed, like &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20diamond\"&gt;block of diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"non-renewable%20resource\"&gt;non-renewable&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nIf any of these do get patched, you must either go back versions or use third-party applications in order to replicate them again. For Java Edition, this can happen in the Minecraft Launcher, but on Bedrock Edition, you must use third party applications in order to replicate these again. These third-party applications are NOT owned or endorsed by Mojang, so use at your own risk.\nNote that these techniques are considered \"cheating\" by many people and Mojang tries to remove the ability to duplicate in Survival during almost every update, except for primed TNT duplication, which has been left in on purpose until a suitable replacement exists. On most servers, duping inventory items is a bannable offense.\nThe best way to duplicate a block is to turn it into an item first, then duplicate the item. However, there are other ways to duplicate the blocks themselves, though they only work for certain blocks. &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20box\"&gt;Shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es make item duplication much easier because they allow for up to 1,729 items to be cloned at once (including the shulker box).\nBackground.\nWhy duplicate.\nIf you happen to be a speedrunner, duplication if allowed can cut down a lot in your game time. One extreme example is the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7Wv_jJQ3XCE\"&gt;TAS Any% speedrun&lt;/a&gt; done in 29.19, complete with the dragon dead. Alt+F4 is usually used for this purpose.\nHow to use this guide.\nThis guide is in the process of restructuring. When it's done, all methods will have something like this in front:\nThese tables are there to save you some time with testing no longer useful methods.\nWhy do we care about mods? Although we, being the official wiki, do not endorse the use of mods, mods are a fact of life we must accept. Servers commonly use them to fix the very glitches we are talking about here and, by some tweaking of the game, do whatever the server owner want the game to do.\nWhy single out Realms? Realms works a bit differently from your normal multiplayer server, Java or Bedrock. As a result, different glitches may occur.\nLegitimate Duplication.\nThese are not actually duplicating items, but instead are legitimate (or mostly legitimate) methods of obtaining certain items.\nDirt Duplication.\nStart by obtaining at least 2 &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;. Next, craft coarse dirt using 2 dirt and 2 gravel for 4 coarse dirt, then till the dirt and mine it to obtain 2 extra dirt. With a bartering farm, a good hoe, and a good shovel, you can mass produce dirt in a matter of minutes. However, this is not perfect duplication, as you will need a constant supply of gravel.\nBone Meal Duplication.\nBy using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"composting\"&gt;composting&lt;/a&gt; the yield, the player gets bone meal back. Usually, this method yields significantly less bone meal than is used, and is therefore not profitable, but the following methods do duplicate bone meal:\nVoid Trading.\n\"Void trading\" is a way to trade with villagers and wandering traders without restocking. To do that, a player unloads the villager before closing the trading interface, so that the villager never \"remembers\" having been used for trading. Infinite trading is good for turning farmed items such as &lt;a href=\"Stick\"&gt;Stick&lt;/a&gt;s from a Bamboo farm into emeralds, or for buying things.\nA few ways are possible:\nJava Edition.\nUnpatched/Working.\nCurrently, work as of the latest release of \"vanilla\" Minecraft. They may be patched in modified servers (such as Spigot, or Paper), which many servers use, but have been tested and they still work in unmodified conditions. In singleplayer, these will work but in multiplayer, these will \"usually\" not work. \nSingleplayer.\nBasic Save File manipulation.\nThis method is safe and reliable. Needs only the desired items for duplication as well as a chest. You need to have access to save files so this is impractical on servers, where admins aren't giving FTP out like candy.\nExtra info: these files also contain your current location and your exp. Theoretically, you can enchant some gear, deposit it in a chest, then load the level.dat file to preserve your level and keep the enchanted gear. Another potential use is to use up your inventory while building then load a backup to keep your progress and refill your inventory with the building material. You could even use this to try multiple times to kill the Ender Dragon / Wither without risking your gear and inventory.\nDisclaimer: the environment and mobs are not saved with this method, do not attempt to summon the Wither near places of importance or important mobs. Instead, backup the entire target world folder and load it in event of failure. Perform test runs to ensure that this method works.\nAlt+F4 v2.0 - Task Manager.\nAlt+F4 is patched, but using Task Manager to end the task, on the other hand, is NOT patched, and still works. This is very similar to the Alt+F4 method.\nSteps:\nFrom testing, it doesn't always work. Try playing with different timings.\nVideo here:\nSP and MP.\nExplosive fireworks + elytra duplication (MP only).\nThis duplication glitch works on 1.16.5 multiplayer. It requires an elytra and firework rockets that deal damage to the player. If the rockets do not damage the player, the duplication will not work. Video below: (duplication glitch starts at 0:33)\nThis is known to work in vanilla servers and realms, however Spigot has patched the bug and Paper has patched it long before its discovery.\nDirt Duplication.\nThe mechanism for growing giant &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; trees is known to be glitched in JE 1.16 snapshot. Instead of growing a giant tree on the saplings, the game grows the tree on the first position where space is sufficient and a dirt block is present in the north-west position. When the tree is grown, all the dirt blocks are filled in. With bone meal and piston automation, a semi-auto dirt duplicator can be produced (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWaiFAjcZUaw\"&gt;YouTube by ilmango&lt;/a&gt;).\nLead Duplication (note: does not work in 1.16.4).\nBring an animal to the end, put a lead on it, and then lead it into the end portal. When you get back, it should have dropped two leads. Sometimes one of the leads ends up in the end, so make sure to check there. It may not always be in the end, though. This also works when bringing animals into the nether.\nBook player-profile rollback glitch.\nThis duplication glitch works on Singleplayer and Multiplayer. All you have to do is place a chest in front of you and then leave the server as it saves your player data, then relog and put the items you want to dupe from your inventory in the chest, get a book and quill, overload the book with excessive characters and it will cause you to get kicked from the server and rolling back your player data to last save while server files stay the same. As a result, the items will be in both your inventory and the chest.\nThe book mod (requires fabric download and custom download to work) automates the process.\nVideo here: https://youtu.be/ml3HkqNfUH4\nPiston-based duplication of rails and carpets (Patched on paper).\nCarpets can be duplicated using a contraption made of two &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Block\"&gt;Slime Block&lt;/a&gt;s, a Sticky &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt;. This glitch gives infinite fuel and is very easy to automate give thousands of carpets per hour tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezM2Hs_-hbE \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-9ihB7EmKI\nand\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGQLDJ8dNGs&amp;t=3s\nare in-depth tutorials that show how to do so\nDragon's Breath Duplication.\nWhenever the dragon lands on the end portal and releases the purple fog, be above or below the purple fog, look at the fog at a steep angle, and proceed to harvest the &lt;a href=\"dragon%27s%20breath\"&gt;dragon's breath&lt;/a&gt;. The fog will first shrink as intended, but after it reaches the smallest size, it will expand with each bottle used, and keep expanding until the fog disappears as too much time passed. (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DE8ylwONrlfk\"&gt;YouTube by Underscored Frisk&lt;/a&gt;)\nShulker Box breaking glitch.\n&lt;a href=\"Shulker%20Box\"&gt;Shulker Box&lt;/a&gt; dupe allows you to duplicate any item in Minecraft singleplayer or Realms. This glitch works with 2 players or with an auto mine mod. So you quickly spam your item in and out while it being broken. The key is to take the item out just before the shulker box breaks. This may take a few tries but eventually you will dupe your items.\nYou can also use autoclicker with these settings: time between clicks- 1sec 487milisecs. Then you bind the autoclicker to key n, and automine to key m and press n,m,right click at the same time. This opens shulker. Hover over item you want to duplicate - shulkerbox should break and item in it, and item on the ground.\nVideo here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hLxebiG3EA\nPiston-based TNT Duplication.\n&lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; duplication works in a similar way as rail duplication. A TNT block is BUD-powered, such that when the contraption is pushed by a piston, the TNT is updated and ignites into a primed TNT entity. Then, the piston moves the TNT from the list of TNT block left. This doesn't so much duplicate the TNT block as it creates free primed TNT entities from it without deleting it. Many TNT duplicators still work, but unless properly constructed will blow themselves up.\nOne common TNT duplication design uses a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Detector%20Rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt; to power the slime block it is placed on, and moves a TNT block next to a &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Fan\"&gt;coral fan&lt;/a&gt; underneath, the combination of the TNT and the coral duplicates the TNT whenever the whole contraption is moved forward with a piston. For an indepth tutorial of this one checkout Cheesysponges video https://youtu.be/3Izrj2m6Li4\nThe second slice may be placed on either side, and the coral fan has been marked with vines. To prime the mechanism, the upper slime blocks must first be moved forward, pushing the TNT under the rail. After this, moving the whole assemblage forward with a piston will duplicate the TNT, spawning a lit TNT entity directly below the TNT block.\nFor a list of variations, see e.g. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//random-j-farmer.github.io/random-minecraft/2021/01/03/tnt-dupers.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. TNT duping as a glitch is notable in that it has been patched by several times in the past but was ultimately allowed in the vanilla game due to its immense value to the technical community. In the words of &lt;a href=\"Mikael%20Hedberg\"&gt;Mikael Hedberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fkt9jf/anchor_yourself_to_the_nether_snapshot_20w12a_is/fkv2yyv/\"&gt;\"TNT dupers fill a slot in the game that the intended game mechanics still cannot.\"&lt;/a&gt;\nGravity Block Duplication.\nThere are many ways to do this, but the basic idea is the same.\nA gravity-affected block is pushed toward an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;. It becomes an entity as it falls into the portal, and it travels into the other dimension's \"spawn point.\", but before it's removed from the original dimension, it bounces off an entity in the portal (in a vehicle so it won't go through), and is caught by some &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. It then turns into a block and is returned to its original location. This process can be looped using &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;. It works for any block that is affected by gravity, except for primed TNT because it would blow up the contraption and cannot become a block again in any case.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20egg\"&gt;Dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;s fall differently from each other and other gravity-affected blocks such as sand, gravel, and concrete powder. Neither dragon eggs nor anvils work in a sand/gravel/concrete powder duplicator because of this. However, it is possible to create a machine that can duplicate dragon eggs and anvils but not sand/gravel/concrete powder. They both can be duplicated and sent into &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; as either falling entities or items.\nTripwire Hook Duplication.\n&lt;a href=\"Tripwire%20Hook\"&gt;Tripwire Hook&lt;/a&gt;s are duplicatable, but only in certain directions. It may work in some directions, but not others.\nPatched/Non-Working.\nThese no longer work as of the latest release of vanilla minecraft, but worked on older versions.\nSingleplayer.\nThese are dupes that work(ed) only on singleplayer, either because you need access to manage the server, Paper/Spigot patches it, or a plugin is installed that patches it.\nAlt + F4 Method (Patched 1.15).\nThis method is a simple method and has been around since &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;. This method involves dropping the items you want to duplicate, and then saving and quitting. You would then reload the world, pick up the items and press the keyboard shortcut to close a window. Then relaunch the game and reload the world. The items should be duplicated.\nMultiplayer.\nThese are dupes that only work on multiplayer, commonly because they exploit an anti-dupe plugin (like the thousands of donkey dupes)\nDeadly Method (Patched 1.15).\nThis method is extremely deadly, but not necessarily to the player. This method involves taking a mob that can carry items (e.g. a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;) down to very low health (i.e. half a heart or less). Using extremely precise timing, kill that mob as it travels through an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;. The items equipped and the mob should appear in the other dimension. It works by tricking the game into thinking the mob is alive on one end of the portal and dead on the other side. The live &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; will travel through the portal still carrying the items, and the dead mob's items are also sent into the portal, allowing the player at the other end to collect the cloned items and the mob carrying them.\nThe deadly method used to automatically farm diamonds (currently the fastest theoretical means of automatically obtaining items in vanilla survival):\nSame Player Twice (Patched in virtually every server).\nThere is a way to trick the game into logging in the same player twice on one server. To do this, start two instances of \"Minecraft\". This requires starting a new instance of the Launcher so that they don\u2019t interfere with each other. Log them both on the same server at the same time. By doing this, the game will render two of the same player. You can then kill the copied player and double your inventory. Rarely servers may also duplicate players on accident or leave \"ghosts\" of logged out players which can be killed for the same effect. \nDonkey Inventory Oversight (Patched in 20w16a and in Paper/Spigot 1.15.2).\nWorking in 1.15.2 and in 1.16 snapshots up to 20w12a (Patched in 20w16a and in paper). You need a tamed donkey or llama equipped with a chest. If a player shift-clicks the donkey / llama, that player may view the donkey's inventory and place items. If a second player rides the donkey, the first player will continue to view the donkey's /llama's inventory, even though it is not normally possible to view a donkey's inventory when it is already being ridden by a player. If the second player disconnects, the donkey will disappear along with them, and the donkey's inventory will be considered by the game as part of that player's data. However, the game will keep a copy of the donkey's inventory and GUI temporarily loaded for the first player, who can then reclaim the items. When the second player reconnects, the donkey's inventory will contain what was originally in it before the second player disconnected. The items can once again be taken from the donkey's inventory, resulting in x2 duplication.\nBoth.\nThese dupes work(ed) everywhere! Servers that don't use anti-dupe plugins, singleplayer, etc. \nBundle Duplication (20w45a to 20w48a).\nFor any crafting recipe that uses more than 1 of the same item, you can use this dupe. To use it, you put the items in the crafting grid, then use the bundles on the crafting slot. The resulting item will not disappear but you will save the item you just took from a bundle. For example, if you used 9 stacks of netherite ingots to make 1 stack of netherite blocks, you could use 9 bundles to take all the netherite away and get 1 stack of netherite blocks for no cost.\nBaby Piglin Item Dupe (Patched in 1.16.3).\nThis dupe involves baby &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. It is incredibly simple and it works in multiplayer. To perform this glitch find a baby piglin and drop his health down to a 1-hit kill (2 hits with a normal diamond sword should work). Then drop the item you want to duplicate to the piglin(e.g. a shulker box) then wait for the baby piglin to pick it up. After the piglin has picked up the item drop the piglin 1 gold ingot. While the piglin is admiring the gold, kill the piglin.\nZombie/Drowned Method (Patched).\nThis method exploits the fact that zombies can transform into drowned while they are dying. If you coax a zombie to pick up an item by throwing one at it and then kill it right at the moment that it converts to a drowned, the zombie will die and drop what it was holding but the newly spawned drowned will be holding a duplicate of the item. This can also work with husks transforming into zombies.\nIlmango shows a simple implementation for survival:\nChunk memory overflow (Patched 1.15).\nWhen you overflow chunk memory, you will be able to freeze the chunk. What this means is that changes on this chunk will not be saved and after loading it again it will return to the previous state.\nThe best way to do this is to create books filled with about fifty pages of random Unicode characters and put it in a chest. There are mods for doing this automatically, but you can also do it manually by copying and pasting. You will need two different types of books for this to work.\nIn 1.14+:\nDiscovered by Earthcomputer: \nTutorial on YouTube by BarrenDome: \nDropped Items (patched 1.13).\nRelogging at the same time as you drop items can dupe items. Needs very precise timing; exit the second you see the items but before you hear the sound of collecting items.\nPiston Duplication (patched 1.16).\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt; is removed (broken by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;) from the rear of a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; as the piston is retracting, the correct timing will yield two items of the item that was within the frame. This will work with any blocks or items inside of the frame, with &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es being able to duplicate multiple items at once. This method works in both singleplayer and multiplayer game modes.\nCrafting Dupe (Patched 1.12.1).\nThis method can also be used to stack unstackable items, such as diamond swords.\n1. Put 2-3 stacks of planks in your inventory.\n2. Drop the item that you want to dupe on the ground. (Make sure that there is no item that it can stack within your inventory!)\n3. Open your inventory and spam the crafting table recipe until you pick up the item you dropped. It should result in a stack of that item.\nUsing Dolphins(Patched 1.17-pre2).\nPut a &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; as it absorbs an item. The original item will still be there, while the dolphin will carry a copy.\nAll Item Duplication Glitch (patched 1.17.1).\nFill your inventory with items. Repeatedly rename the item you want to duplicate on an anvil until the anvil breaks. When it does, you will drop double the renamed item. If it is not working look at how it's being done in this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=oSdwwxBgWco (Original Finder)\nBedrock Edition.\nUnpatched.\nDirt Chest (works 1.16.1+).\nWhen using this method there might be a chance the items will get deleted, so creating a backup is recommended.\nThis method will not work on Realms. \n1. Gather all the items you want to duplicate as well as a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\n2. Place your &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure there is 4 &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; in front of the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\n3. Save &amp; Quit, and then rejoin the World. \n4. Place the items you want to duplicate in the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and quickly break 4 dirt in front of the chest 1 y-level below it in a 2x2 square shape then count to 4.\n5. Quickly forcibly close the application. \n6. Rejoin the game. One of three things will have happened; \nA) The items will have duplicated (both in inventory and chest), \nB) The items will have been removed (neither in inventory nor chest), \nC) Nothing will have happened (in chest or inventory).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptGpINSxhaA\nChunk save stating.\nThis method works by causing the game to crash in a way that only the chunk you are standing in will not save correctly, this will cause the chunk you are standing in to revert to the last save, allowing you to dupe in that chunk. \nExplanation of how it works: https://youtu.be/XTkivXhbcMA\nFortune on Flowers.\nThis can be used to duplicate any 2 block tall flower and can be considered by some as legitimate duplication, since the bug tracker says it works as intended.\nSteps:\n1: Get an item with Fortune (level 3 works best) and a 2 block tall flower.\n2: Place the 2 block tall flower.\n3: Break said flower.\nThe flowers should have at least duplicated. I think you can get up to 6!\nPatched.\nTo use the following methods, you will have to either not update past that point or revert to a previous update (if possible for your system, not all can, such as on or ).\nGravity Block Duplication (Patched on 1.16.200).\nDuplicates all gravity-affected block except &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s\nThis video will explain how to duplicate any gravity-affected block. It works similarly to gravity block duplicators : by having a falling block enter an end portal and become a block on the same tick. \nThe reason this design does not work for dragon eggs is that it relies on &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s being able to push blocks into their original position. This allows for the block to be duplicated repeatedly, every 6 redstone ticks. However, one can manually duplicate dragon eggs with a similar process:\nIn the above diagram, the G, D, and P denotes the &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The repeater is necessary for the timing to work correctly, due to . Like the automatic gravity block duplicator, one must use &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s to replace the &lt;a href=\"End%20portal%20frame\"&gt;End portal frame&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTo use, deactivate the &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, and a second dragon egg will appear in The End. You can then re-activate the lever to break the dragon egg and place another one. This design can be used for other gravity blocks, but the automatic version is generally more efficient.\nAnother alternative to end portal based duping is end gateway based duping, however, it is not as fast as end portal based duping.\nAnvil Duplication (Patched in 1.16).\nYou will need two book &amp; quill and an anvil. Write any text in one book &amp; quill, and sign it. From then, copy the first book &amp; quill by placing them next to each other in the crafting grid. Take the item you wish to duplicate and rename it to the name of the copied book. From here, you can shift-click the anvil result and duplicate your item.\nAnvil Naming (Versions &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.5.1\"&gt;1.5.1&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"1.16\"&gt;1.16.0&lt;/a&gt;) (Patched).\nWhen naming a stack of items in an anvil, you can use the \"Take Half\" option to receive the output items without depleting the original stack. As long as you do not take the final renamed item, you can go to the original stack and pick it up to start more or just leave the anvil interface if you are done.\nItems duplicated this way won't work for quick use in a recipe, though certainly can be used for Classic crafting and any other use. However, if you wish to revert an item to the default name, you can do so by crafting it into another item then crafting it back to the original (such as &lt;a href=\"redstone%20block\"&gt;redstone block&lt;/a&gt; -&gt; &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; x9 -&gt; &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Redstone\"&gt;redstone block&lt;/a&gt;), or by placing it as a block then breaking it back into an item.\nDonkey + Looting sword (patched 1.16).\n1.

If you are in the chest interface and quick-move an item to your inventory in that moment then you will receive the item and the chest will be moved with the item still in it as well.\nThe recommended build is not automatic.

{"id": "16349", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16349", "title": "Tutorials/Block update detector", "text": "The Block Update Detector, or BUD switch, is a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; mechanism that uses quirks in the game in order to detect changes in nearby blocks. There are many different designs that are all based on the same general idea: a redstone circuit is put in a state where it should be following a mechanic, but the game has not updated the block to follow this rule. This unupdated block then functions as the \"sensor\". When an adjacent block changes state in some way, the game updates all adjacent blocks - including the sensor block - and powers them up. The circuit then performs some other action and, with most designs, goes back into standby.\nNote: Most of the BUD switches listed below do not work on Bedrock Edition, since redstone is largely separate from block updates.\nWhat it detects.\nThe BUD switch detects the following events when they happen next to the sensor block:\nBlock and block state changes that some BUDs may not be able to detect, include:\nTypes of BUD Switches.\nBelow is a comprehensive video from SethBling (outdated), which showcases a variety of compact block update detectors, mostly making use of the redstone block.\nIn-Game.\nThe BUD switch now has a compact block form in-game and it was added in 1.11 snapshot 16w39a called the '&lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt;'. The observer does not detect block updates, instead it detects block state changes.\nPiston Based.\nMany BUD switch designs exploit a property of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s called &lt;a href=\"quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity&lt;/a&gt;. A piston can receive power through a space one block above itself. In this case, the power source is either above and to the side of the piston, or two blocks above it. However, when powered in this way, the piston does not immediately notice changes in the state of the power source. When some other block update happens next to the piston, it will \"wake up\" and react to the change. By forming a feedback loop, where the state of the piston controls the state of its power source, it becomes the sensor of a simple BUD switch:\nIn this design, the piston will only extend in response to an adjacent block update, but after extending it will immediately retract because the arm of the piston notices the repeater next to it turning off. This is how a piston BUD resets itself: by having the power run next to the extended piston arm, with a delay.\nNote: If the block diagonally adjacent to the sticky piston becomes horizontally adjacent, the circuit will constantly pulse instead. \nThis design can be extended with multiple sensor blocks. All of the pistons in this design are sensors.\nA 1-wide tileable design using &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Redstone\"&gt;redstone blocks&lt;/a&gt;:\nAlternative method: if players take a sticky piston facing parallel to the ground, then place a Block of Redstone on its face, and connect the block of redstone out to the side of the piston through a repeater that goes into a block diagonally adjacent to the piston, it works a fully functional BUD. Then, if you set a delay of any number of ticks \"other\" than the default 1-tick delay on the repeater, it turns into a T-BUD. This process can also be reversed by setting the repeater back to its default 1-tick setting. (It only works since release of Redstone Blocks, though players could theoretically use a normal block and a redstone torch to mimic its effects.)\nAn extremely compact one-time design that is easily hidden and therefore ideal for traps is as follows: Place a piston, a sticky piston is most useful, parallel to the ground. Place a block one block to any side except the piston head and one block above the\npiston. On the side of the block facing the piston, place a redstone torch. Then place a lever on any other side of the block and switch it on. The redstone torch will go out but the piston will remain extended. You can then break everything except for the piston, but make sure to break the lever after you break the torch. A block update will then cause the piston to retract, possibly pulling the floor out from under the victim. Remember, though, that after the detector is tripped, it has to be rebuilt to be used again.\nThe design looks something like this:\nOr, for it being smaller:\nThe player can make a 2\u00d71 (3\u00d71 when extended) BUD by having a 2 sticky pistons (stacked) both facing any direction except up and down, then on both of those sticky pistons add Redstone Blocks. Whenever a block is updated, (destroyed, placed etc.) it will switch the bottom piston outwards. Good for traps, as the BUD may need to be compact. The only con to this is that it has to be reset.\nAnother extremely compact design involves using 1 sticky piston facing up with a &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt; and redstone block stacked on top of it. This design is 1\u00d73 (1\u00d74 when extended) and allows the piston to be updated from 5 of its sides. It does not need to be reset after triggering, but players do need to make sure that the slime block isn't grabbing a wall in order to activate in the first place.\nStuck-Piston Based.\nThe following designs works because pistons can't be pushed by other pistons while extended. Also, when a piston retracts, it doesn't notify any other pistons that were trying to push it. The piston with the block attached to it is sticky and acts as the sensor. This design has the advantage of a low profile, and also that the quirk it exploits is less \"buggy\" and less likely to be fixed in the future.\nThe latter design above can also be extended to an array in a variety of ways, including a one-wide design.\nThe stuck-piston principle can also be used to hide a BUD completely underground, as shown by this video:\nDropper Based.\nHere is a video about this.\nRedstone Torch Based.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"14w25a\"&gt;14w25a&lt;/a&gt; (with the fix of ), a burned-out &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; can be used as a reliable BUD. Once burned-out, a redstone torch will reset upon an update from any adjacent block. This is the smallest and simplest BUD, only requiring a single torch and redstone dust (plus two repeaters for a solid output signal.) \nA redstone torch on the side of a block and put redstone dust make the redstone signal loops with itself is also a BUD. The place around the redstone torch (include upside and downside) is the detecting place, but not the redstone dust. The redstone torch will blink for 16 ticks, and finally burn down. It has a 56 ticks cool down. It can't detect sleeping in a bed.\nThis works in the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, as shown in the video below.\nRedirection based.\nWhen redstone dust redirects, it does not send out block updates, so a piston can have its power removed by redirecting redstone dust away from it to remove power. When the piston receives a block update, it will update its state accordingly and the redirection bud will reset.\nVariations.\nOther devices can be built using the same underlying principle as the BUD switch.\nBUD in Bedrock Edition.\nBy using a waterlogged block that is not allowed to flow (through the use of trapdoors or other techniques) and an observer clock, if the player updates the waterlogged block rapidly and the observer clock is in the same chunk the clock will break and give a constant output out of both sides. Then whenever the block is next updated, one side of the clock will pulse off for one tick. You can create a BUD switch using this by linking up using both sides as the output of the BUD.\nVideo describing this phenomenon: \nT-BUD.\nBy eliminating the reset mechanism of a BUD switch, it becomes a T-BUD or Toggle-BUD. This device has \"two\" stable states, which it switches between when it detects a block update next to the piston. This is equivalent to a normal BUD connected to a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuits%23T%20Flip-Flop\"&gt;T Flip-Flop&lt;/a&gt;, but much simpler to build. It is useful for tracking the state of blocks like &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s. However, it has useful capabilities for placing some blocks two blocks away. When placing a piece of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; two blocks away, the T-BUD activates when it is destroyed only. When placing a &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt; two blocks away, the T-BUD activates only on the placement.\nNote: As of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.4\"&gt;Java Edition 1.7.4&lt;/a&gt;, the repeater in the picture must be set to a two tick delay. If the repeater is left at one tick, it will work as a BUD.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known BUD switch is on the Minecraft Forums.\nThe term \"BUD switch\" was later coined by YouTuber EthosLab."}

The most efficient farm types to connect the bone meal farm with are &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pumpkin%20and%20melon%20farming\"&gt;melon slice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cactus%20farming\"&gt;cactus farm&lt;/a&gt;s, as either can generate a lot of bone meal per hour if the farm is big enough. Additionally if you have other farms you can make leftovers, such as seeds go into the composter.\nUsing a composter.\nRight-clicking a composter is inefficient. Luckily, the game allows us to connect a composter to a hopper: add a hopper on top of the composter to make a queue of items, and add one at the bottom to keep it running after it gets full by collecting the bone meal.\nComposting spreader.\nThis is a design that uses parallel composters. When you have an efficient upstream farm, this is what you need.\nItems can be inserted into the composter by placing a hopper on top of a composter. The farm starts by adding unwanted compostable items into the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; on the top left (see picture). The items in the chest occasionally drop into a &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;minecart with a hopper&lt;/a&gt; that travels along a track over the hoppers above the composters. The items are taken out of the hopper minecart and into the composter, and composted automatically. When the composter is fully fertilized, the bone meal is taken into the bottom chests.\nAlternatively, you can do without a rail by using a large chest with two hoppers below, connected to two different composters. The hoppers divide the input evenly. You can even scale this up to connect to another level of chest-spreader, so you can have 4, 8, 16... composters running in parallel.\nVillager.\nMake a crop farm and lock farmers in it. Place minecart hoppers under each block of farmland. The hopper minecarts should funnel the crops into hoppers, which point downward to composters. Under the composters should be more hoppers that point to a chest.\nThis farm requires much iron and wood, so you should make an iron golem farm and have a large supply of wood. See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Iron golem farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nA farm by Chapman\nBone meal shearing.\nBone meal shearing is an unusual way of farming bone meal, and it relies on iron input, as they use up durability on shears.\nThe process works by composting the flowers which came from placing bone meal on grass.\nNotes:\nSkeleton farm.\nA skeleton farm can produce bones, which can be crafted into bone meal, as well as other stuff that skeletons drop, such as bows, arrows, and armor.You can also gain XP from them. For more information, read &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Spawner%20traps\"&gt;Tutorials/Spawner traps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20farm\"&gt;Tutorials/Mob farm&lt;/a&gt;. A spawner trap is the most efficient, because only skeletons spawn:\nYou may put a hopper below the block where the mobs die, so you can collect their drops and put them into a container, or an item sorter.\nMoss-based automatic bone meal farm.\nIn both Java and Bedrock Editions it is possible to apply bone meal to a &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt; and convert nearby &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; into more moss blocks. These can then be composted to make a bone meal profit of between 2.5:1 and 3:1.\nThe moss can convert stone in a 7x7 area (minus the 4 corners) up to 5 blocks below the source moss block. It can also convert blocks up to 5 blocks above the source, but only where there is a connection of non-air and non-liquid blocks between the moss block and the stone platform above. In any case, only the highest block within the range can be converted. It is also necessary for the source moss block to have air above it for the bone meal to have any effect.\nAny moss blocks that are formed, or indeed the source moss block, also have a chance to grow one of the following on top: azalea, flowering azalea or moss carpet. If a plant grows on top of the source moss block it must be cleared before the moss block can be bone mealed again.\nTo create an automatic farm, stone generators are used to replace the platform that is converted to moss. A mechanism is required to break any moss carpet that grow on top of the moss, usually flowing water or pistons, as this would otherwise prevent any further stone from being converted beneath the carpet. The moss block and other plant items can then be collected and composted. A recycling system is also required to ensure that the farm is self-sustaining in bone meal. \nNylium-based automatic bone meal farm.\nIn Bedrock Edition it was possible to make a profit from applying &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nylium\"&gt;crimson nylium&lt;/a&gt;. This was changed in the 1.18 update, where using bonemeal on crimson nylium was changed to create less plants. The nylium block produces &lt;a href=\"Roots\"&gt;crimson roots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;nether fungi&lt;/a&gt; in a 7x7 square area around the block that was bone mealed. Collecting these nether plants and placing them in a composter on average yields a bone meal profit. This process can be automated by moving the nylium platform with pistons to break the nether plants. The plant items can then be collected, typically using a water pickup system. from the top of the Nylium platform and fed into a series of hoppers above composters. "}

Despite this, it is still possible to break the unbreakable blocks in Survival mode without &lt;a href=\"Commands\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt;. Bug exploits are used to achieve this, so these methods could be rendered useless in any update. &lt;a href=\"Breaking\"&gt;Breaking&lt;/a&gt; bedrock is also more difficult than phasing through it, both of which are covered in this article.\nNote that these methods can also be used to break other unbreakable blocks (though bedrock is the most useful) and regular breakable blocks (the player will not be able to collect any of the blocks broken, and they are much easier to break using tools).\nWhy bother?\nIt may seem pointless to go through the effort of going through or breaking &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, but it is actually quite useful. Many &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s use this mechanism to travel large distances across &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The most common use of these techniques is to make an easy access point to the top half of the Nether by phasing through the top layer of bedrock and then breaking the bedrock to put up a &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Elevators\"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt; to the top. Breaking bedrock is also useful if the player wants to fall into the void in &lt;a href=\"the%20Overworld\"&gt;the Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or Nether. It is also useful for breaking some of the blocks on the &lt;a href=\"End%20gateway%20portal\"&gt;end gateways&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. These same techniques can also be used to break the &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%20Frame\"&gt;frames&lt;/a&gt; around the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhasing through bedrock.\nThis section is about going through the &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. The only logical reason to do this instead of breaking the bedrock is going up through the bedrock in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; ceiling. It is recommended to bring the materials to build and light a Nether Portal with you to get back safely, as most of these methods cannot be reversed. \n, the Nether build limit is 128 and above bedrock, so it is not recommended to phase through the bedrock. However, if you have already broken bedrock somewhere else, you can phase through the bedrock to return to a destination more easily.\nMethod 1.\nThis method works by placing a boat just below the nether ceiling and jumping out. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtoUElqlErAQ\"&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; shows how to do it and more information is in the description.\nMethod 2.\nTo use this method, you will need the following materials:\nThe optimal strategy involves only one ender pearl if done correctly, though more may be brought just in case. Find a two block tall space to stand in just under the topmost block of the Nether, and make sure there is a two block wide (or one block wide, though it will be more difficult), one block tall space in front of your eyes. Throw your pearl horizontally into this space and jump. Prior to jumping, you should be suffocating in the bedrock. It is very easy if you look at the left/right edge of the surface you are facing and hold forward when jumping(only requires a one block spaced crawl).\nPros:\nCons:\nYou will need an axe too.\nMethod 2b.\n[Bug Used: ]\nThis method requires &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s. It was much easier to do in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;update 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, but is still possible in later versions.\nDig up to where the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; would be \"bumping\" its head on the top layer of bedrock (on &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;y&lt;/a&gt; = 127). Then, look straight up and throw the &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s as quickly as you can. This is more difficult to do in versions 1.9 and above due to the item cool-down. It works by having one of the ender pearls glitch and teleport the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; into the block such that when the next ender pearl is thrown, it goes above the block and &lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;teleports&lt;/a&gt; the player to the top of the block.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 3.\nThis method is by far the easiest among all of them.\nThis variation uses the same resources and:\nDig up to &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; with Y at least 126. Place the stair towards the side just under the bedrock, then throw the &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; above it and you will be &lt;a href=\"Teleportation\"&gt;teleported&lt;/a&gt; to the top of the stair. Just jump and you can go out.\nPros:\nOutdated.\nMethod 4.\nAn easy and cheap method that doesn't make the player take damage.\nYou'll need:\nCreates a nether portal in the y axis=130 or higher. It'll create a nether portal above the bedrock layer.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 5.\n[Bug Used: ] (fixed)\nThis method requires that the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; has already journeyed to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; and reached the outer End islands. This is very important.\nTo use this method, you need the following materials:\nFirst, fill in an area that is 17 * 17 blocks by 9 blocks high against the bedrock ceiling. The &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; and bedrock that generates naturally can be used to fill in this region: only remaining air blocks need to be filled. Once this happens, stand in the middle of the top of this filled-in area (against the bedrock ceiling), and record your &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt;. Then, eat the chorus fruit. If the player is not teleported on top of the bedrock, eat another &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt; until you are successful. It works using a chorus fruit's teleportation ability and removing all other valid places for the player to teleport to. \nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 6.\n[Bug Used: ] (fixed)\nThis method is cheap, but also has the highest chance of &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. It has two variations, depending on how quick you are with placing blocks.\nTo use this method, you need the following materials:\nDig up to the highest level of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;y = 127&lt;/a&gt;). Place a block (if needed) two blocks below it, and then place the &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; on top of this block. There should be no gap between the rail and the upper layer of bedrock. Next, place a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; on the rail. This is where it gets dangerous, and where the &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; comes into play. Get inside the minecart and quickly dismount it. The player should be &lt;a href=\"Suffocation\"&gt;suffocating&lt;/a&gt; in the bedrock layer. Next, hold down the \"&lt;a href=\"Jumping\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt;\" key and throw an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; directly up. In case of this failing, throw another ender pearl directly upward. It works by having the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; dismount the player in a position where the player will be able to jump and see the top of the bedrock. The ender pearls move the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to the top.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 6b.\n[Bug Used: ] (fixed)\nThis variation use the same resources and:\nBegin in the same way as in Method 4: Place the first minecart just under the bedrock ceiling as in Method 4, enter the minecart, and then exit the minecart. You will begin suffocating in the bedrock ceiling. From there, jump up and down so that you can see the top of the bedrock. Place a rail on top of the bedrock, preferably close to where you will be coming out. Next, place a minecart on top of the rail and quickly ride it. You will be teleported to the top of the bedrock ceiling into the minecart and can exit without further risk of suffocation.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 6c.\n[Bug Used: ] (fixed)\nThis variation requires an extra minecart, one piston, one slab, and one lever.\nBegin in the same way as in Method 4: place a minecart under the bedrock ceiling, then break the rail under the minecart. Place the piston to face the minecart with one air block between them. On the space between the piston and the minecart, place a lower slab. Activate the piston to push the slab right on the minecart. Then break the piston and the lever. Enter the minecart, and dismount it quickly. You now should be glitched through the bedrock block without taking any further damage. Now finish like in method 2: place a rail and a minecart (or alternately, place a boat) and jump in.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 7.\nPlace a piston down just below topmost Bedrock layer so that it is pointing upwards. Place a rail on top of it, place a minecart on the rail and destroy the rail. Extend the piston so that it crushes the minecart slightly into the Bedrock. Jump in the minecart and dismount. You should be suffocating inside the Bedrock. Jump twice and you should end up above the Bedrock. After that, use the glitched minecart to go down. This glitch is for 18w11a only.\nBreaking bedrock.\nDepending on the method, breaking bedrock can either be a simple build, or a complex process. \n1.10-1.16+ Method.\nVideo by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dfu8hFZLn3wU\"&gt;Lewis&lt;/a&gt;\nVideo by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/channel/UCoWLeM6h756fOFbgH0zyzNA\"&gt;CheesySponge&lt;/a&gt;\nhttps://youtu.be/R0jCKJOkAog\nVideo by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/channel/UCOzX6x_9dyosDBdjcBMdN0A\"&gt;Fallen_Breath&lt;/a&gt;\nhttps://youtu.be/UcxmUl65nYM (different orientations)\nVideo by unknown (good quality, same variant):\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1GZTxwWIsXvUHbwT1HaItZxU5zRuQykzN/view?usp=sharing\nMethod 1.\n[Bug Used: ]\nThis method uses update priority and headless pistons to break bedrock. While it can seem needlessly complex to do this for one block of bedrock, it is the preferred method to destroy large quantities of bedrock.\nA video by EDDxample that shows how to break one block of bedrock in all directions:\nThis other video by EDDxample showcases a semi-automatic bedrock breaking flying machine:\nThis other video by EDDxample showcases a high-end automatic bedrock breaker:\nMethod 2.\nThis method requires a one block deep 1\u00d74 block trench in the bedrock directly above the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt; that brought you to the Nether. It only works with the ceiling of the Nether and requires that there are no other portals within 16 blocks in the Nether or 128 blocks in the Overworld. These are the materials you will need:\nNote: This amount can change drastically depending on the situation.\nThis method works by removing all of the valid places for a Nether portal. It forces the portal to generate in the bedrock, replacing some of it with the obsidian frame.\nPros:\nCons:\nRevised method using portals:\nRedstone Lag method.\nThis method requires a number of pistons (for example, to break one bedrock, you need 2 pistons), a trapdoor, a lot of redstone, a lever, a full beacon powered with Haste II, a maxed out pickaxe and some temporary blocks. It also needs a mod called Tweakeroo.\nFirst, place a lever and surround all sides of it with redstone. More redstone placed means the lag will last longer, but sometimes, the bedrock won't break if the lag is too long, so you would need to be precise. Set up a Haste II beacon, go to Tweakeroo settings, in the Generic tab, find \"Fast Right Click Count\" and set it to a number (in the tutorial it's 32), then in the Tweaks tab, find \"Tweak Fast Right Click\" and set it to true and optionally set a hotkey if you want. Then place a forward facing piston, a block on top, a redstone block on top of the block, a block beside the piston which would activate it, break the redstone block, place a trapdoor on the back of the piston, and right click on it, turn on the fast right click tweak and hold your right click, but make sure not to hold it too long. Then go to your piston, break the block beside the piston, enter crawl mode, break the piston (but make sure not to break the detached piston arm), and place down another piston, wait for a while and the piston should face forward again, break the piston and you would see it broke a piece of bedrock.\nMore information here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUfFWr9WCAs\nPros:\nCons:\n21w05a / 21w05b Method.\nVideo by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4zC1Hfj-uc90FUXzRamNw\"&gt;PhoenixSC&lt;/a&gt;\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvJGmuxOvvY\nThis method requires &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2021w05a\"&gt;snapshot 21w05a&lt;/a&gt; due to the use of dripleaves.\nIt has been patched in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2021w06a\"&gt;snapshot 21w06a&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutdated.\nMethod 3.\nIntroduced in 1.17.0 and patched in 1.17.30 and above.\nThis easy method uses powder snow. \nYou will only need:\nMethod 4.\n[Bug Used: ], patched in 1.13 and above.\nThis method is much simpler, but it requires more resources. These are the minimum materials you will need to break one block:\nThis method is incredibly easy to do, but time-consuming. This is all you need to do:\nThis works because the dragon egg is dropped in the lazy &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s. Lazy chunks are a region two chunks wide at the edge of the player's render distance that are partly loaded and have not yet been unloaded. Redstone still works, but falling block entities fall instantly. Dragon eggs have the strange property where they replace the block they fall on with itself, if they fall in the lazy chunks.\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 5.\nThis can be done in a variety of different ways because it uses certain plants with block-breaking properties.\nBamboo.\n, growing bamboo with bone meal removes the block above. See [ this video] for how to quickly remove strips of bedrock.\nThis method no longer works in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.10.0\"&gt;1.10.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nJungle Trees.\nThe branches of huge jungle trees replace blocks that they generate in.\nHuge Mushrooms.\nHuge mushrooms break the blocks that their caps spawn in.\nThis method no longer works in 1.13.2\nPros:\nCons:\nMethod 6.\nAs of Minecraft 1.13, this method no longer works as described.\nThis method requires an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Indestructible%20end%20crystals\"&gt;indestructible end crystal&lt;/a&gt; and a piston.\nTo do this, push the end crystal with the piston into the block that you want to break. The block will break.\nIt works because indestructible end crystals constantly generate fire underneath them. This fire breaks all blocks, including bedrock.\nPros:\nCons:\nFun fact: In the 1.8 update, no bedrock generated on the obsidian pillars because the crystals generated one block lower than they were supposed to. The fire generated broke the bedrock that was supposed to be there.\nVideo.\n\"Note: This trick has been patched in 1.13.\"\nVideo made by &lt;a href=\"slicedlime\"&gt;slicedlime&lt;/a&gt;:"}

It is recommended to build these in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, as a very large number of resources, some of which may be hard to acquire in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt;, are usually needed to create a large cruise ship.\nVideos.\nVideo of the cruise ship built in the game.\n\"See for more videos.\"\nMedium-large cruise ships.\nMedium-large cruise ships are slightly smaller than cruise ships, making them useful if you want to build a ship that is large but not as tedious and resource-demanding as a large cruise ship.\nVideos.\nA video of the construction of the , which could be considered a medium-large cruise ship.\nPassenger ferries.\nPassenger ferries can be built in water bodies between two land masses, where the distance between the masses is not small but not significantly large either (e.g., a large lake, but not a river or an ocean). The size of a passenger ferry varies, such as a steamboat. The boat advised to create depends upon the number of passengers expected and/or the distance between the two lands.\nRiver cruises.\nIf a huge cruise ship is not what you're looking for, you can build a boat, which is a smaller ship designed for traveling through rivers. These boats are usually two decks or lower and not very long either. You could build this on top of a naturally generated river, or you could dig your own river and build your boat on that.\nTerminals.\nStrongly recommended while building a cruise ship, it can include a check in desk, toilets, playing area, caf\u00e9, walkway to the ship, and optionally staircases and/or lifts with more than two levels.\nTerminal tutorials.\nDock (for small boats and nether hubs)..\nCreate a platform of planks, add fences from floor of water body to platform corners.\nStation (for small boats and nether hubs)..\nCreate 2 docks separated the exact width of the boat, create a staircase, extending terminal or sliding terminal up to ship entrance.

{"id": "29453", "revid": "46853501", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=29453", "title": "Tutorials/Building a metropolis", "text": "A metropolis or a city is a complete urban area with buildings and a dense population. As a project, players may find building a metropolis of their own to be an outstanding project, though it should be remembered that building a metropolis requires using a large number of resources and a lot of time.\nThis tutorial should only be a reference, not a step-by-step lecture. You should make up your own ideas along the way. When editing, keep the buildings list in alphabetical order. This tutorial is aimed for fantasy, medieval and modern buildings, feel free to find the tone that fits better for your world or multiplayer modded &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparation.\nBefore starting a metropolis, the player should decide on their project's theme, limitations, goals and tools. If the player needs help with finding a theme, suggestions are given later. For some players, building a metropolis in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode may be the most rewarding. Others may want to work on the project in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode so they do not have to spend time gathering resources. To make building quicker and easier, the player may also want help in their project in the form of friends, &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt;s or even third-party programs. Plans also have to account for what the project's future use is, who will view it and what will those viewers' needs be.\nFor most themes, the easiest location to build would be somewhere that is generally flat as it removes the need to clear-out large areas. Such an area can be found through a variety of ways including finding a generally-flat &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s) or loading a different world type such as &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"buffet\"&gt;buffet&lt;/a&gt;. The player could also use a third-party program such as WorldEdit, MCEdit, VoxelSniper, and WorldPainter to clear an area. The theme may work best in specific &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; and the terrain generations, and as such, the player will need to consider those things while finding/preparing an area.\nIf the player plans on building their project in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, they should ensure they have the basic materials they need to keep the project going, such as good tools and armor, food, and perhaps even a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;. The player also needs methods to collect all the blocks they will need for building their project. As such, they may want to try using more common blocks.\nGetting started.\nThe player should start planning out where a couple of large features of the city will go before they begin building. Then they can ensure they and any other players can begin building the structures. Note that your first buildings will most likely end up near the center of the metropolis.\nBefore building, it's best for you to know what blocks to use in your theme. A project will usually look better if built with blocks that work well together. The best blocks to use together will vary throughout the build, but generally the block types used will gradually shift from area to area. Lighting should be remembered throughout the build. Building interiors are something the player may want to work as well. If the metropolis will be used for a multiplayer world or custom map, the player probably should be careful to not use blocks in their builds which players can easily break or grief. Also, you should plan for the residents of their town. The needs of &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s are different than those of a couple of friends.\nThe player may also want to avoid overusing rare and hard to acquire blocks such as &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; since they work best as attention draws to areas such as spires, corners, or doors and not for main building materials. Making large areas of these blocks make a build too shiny and overwhelming, and lacking in variety.\nCity Plan.\nBefore you create your city, you should make a city plan. One way to make a city plan is to follow these steps:\nTo start your plan, you can make the outlines with &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;, wool, &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, or any other easy-to-collect blocks you have in large quantities. You can match colors with different things.\nNote: To make it easier, try to visualize the city plan in your head, and try make it fit into Minecraft.\nPopulation is another important thing to keep in mind when building a great city. Keep in mind that the size of your population is the key to how large your city can expand. The following Key* below will help you understand how large your city is and the components that it needs based on its ranking and population. Population can be calculated by estimating or counting the amount of beds in your city. Every family home will have between 3-5 people. So a viable option to calculate population is count up family homes and multiply that number by either 3,4, or 5. Apartment buildings and hotels will also house more people so make sure to keep that in mind as well. \n-Village; 50 to 150 population \n-Suburb; 150 to 600 population\n-Town; 600 to 2,000 population \n-City; 2,000 to 10,000 population \n-Metropolis; 10,000 to infinity population\nMaterials.\nMinecraft has a variety of &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Best%20building%20materials\"&gt;and ornaments you may use&lt;/a&gt;. Try to find a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Color%20palette\"&gt;color that matches the theme&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilding Up.\nConsistency and planning are possibly the two most important things in a build. Planning can be anything from a simple bullet list of materials needed to a full-scale blueprint of all the aspects of the metropolis. It is best if a town can keep its theming, block choices, sizes, and areas somewhat similar between buildings. Make sure that the first buildings and roads are close in size and appearance to how you want the rest of the city to be. Part of a natural city flow are zones--different areas which better fulfill certain needs for town members than other areas. If the player allows the city to develop into zones as it is built, the city will appear more natural. Building outward and in zones allows different portions of the metropolis to have a different feel to the builds as different building heights, materials, and the amount of space changes. Planning of where to place and how large to make certain zones should ensure that the build fulfills the needs of any actual or imagined residents of the metropolis. \nRoads and Paths.\nAn important piece of planning and building a metropolis is the roads. Roads and pathways connect all the buildings and zones together and usually act to keep a sense of order to the space. Generally, larger areas should include more orderly roads while smaller spaces should have rougher, more mixed pathways. The sizes of roads should also differ by area to fit the spacing of buildings. For this reason, roads should generally be created as needed and not used to force buildings to follow their path. Materials such as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20coal\"&gt;coal blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt; are all popular blocks for roads and paths. Roads can also be decorated with plants, road lines, and lights. Generally, paths should be fairly flat so they can be easily used for quick travel. Adding options for travel along different roads such as &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; lanes, or even just &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s to tie &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s to can increase the efficiency of roads. If you make a tunnel, it should be at least three blocks tall so players riding horses can use it. You should also be able to navigate the roads easily.\nScale.\nYou should also consider what scale your city is. A smaller-scale city will be faster to build and consume less resources, but a larger-scale city can be more detailed. In a larger-scale city, it is also possible to construct interiors to the buildings, which is not possible in smaller scale.\nLighting.\nOne light source for a metropolis is lampposts. A lamppost can be built with a redstone lamp hooked up to an inverted daylight detector so that the lamp will turn on when it gets dark. You can also use a torch, as you can put them in houses. Another indoor lighting trick is to put the light source under carpets. The source of light will be hidden from sight, but the light will still shine through the carpets.\nResidential Zone.\nPrimarily a metropolis needs to have places for its citizens to live. Generally, these areas should be large, yet organized. Smaller roads, shorter buildings, more greenery, and small blocks keep the area more friendly while the opposite create a larger, busier feel. Most residential areas will keep houses spaced close together. Some areas may work best with tall apartments. A residential zone usually feels more lively if the player includes a couple of small shops in the area. Some shops can be added as part of a living space. When working with multiple players, it may work best to allow players to build their own housing.\nThe deeper within the city, the more urbanized the housing generally should be with larger buildings. If the metropolis works well with it, smaller, single housing can make up surrounding suburbs and even further out rural zones can allow large swaths of land to be lived in by a very spread out population.\nCommercial Zone.\nThese zones are for trade such as through markets, shops, malls, restaurants, or grocery stores. Trade allows for citizens of a city to get all types of items and services without having to specifically work for each type of item or service. Some shops work better mixed in with residential zones. A commercial zone can allow for lots of shops to be clustered together and for large stores to be neatly separated from the housing. If the citizens are players, commercial zones can create extra opportunities for player interactions.\nPublic Transportation and Transit Stations.\nSince a metropolis should be quite large, efficient transportation is important to keep the city together. Public transportation hubs can create efficient travel. Some cities might work best with &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; roads, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; bolts. Some might work best using the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; to decrease the travel time and distance. &lt;a href=\"Command%20block\"&gt;Command block&lt;/a&gt;s can be programmed to teleport players when triggered. Infrastructure fitting to the theme of the metropolis should also be used to give more life to the city.\nIndustrial Zone.\nMass production greatly decreases the space needed for many people to live, but it isn't the prettiest sight. Nobody likes to have a house with cluttered views of smog-belching factories, so make sure your industrial zone is not next to any nicer houses, and preferably none that are owned by those who don't work in the industrial zone. Plan a green area in the 100 blocks, or maybe a river. Industrial zones keep giant farms or mass production plants away from where residents live. If the farms produce items, this also may reduce lag by keeping these large, item-creating structures unloaded when unneeded. These areas are generally best kept further from any type of residential or commercial zone since their function is often practicality over appearance.\nCapital.\nA city really can appear to have more pride just by adding a capital area. Adding larger, flashier buildings to stick out in the city skyline gives the city a sense of power. The area can be decorated with statues and monuments. Such areas are usually more expensive to live in, so rarer materials fit into the block palette well. You can build a large building for the government(You may not need it).\nSuggestions.\nHere are some ideas to help the player get started on their city. You can mix and match multiple types.\nTransportation.\nYou need a method of transportation for your city to get around. Here are some ideas:\nBuildings and Structures.\nA - D.\nMore complex version: Have people have a simple account by giving access to an ATM (&lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;). People can also send a request to have a personal vault underground by writing a book with their name and requested combination and putting it into a minecart with a chest along with their items, and sending the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; into the main facility. Then, the owner (with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; knowledge), can build a working vault with combo lock and message the player when they have finished, so the player can access their vault. NOTE: This method will take up a lot of space, build it preferably underground (Think Gringotts from \"Harry Potter\"!)\nN - R.\nSome might have a way to practice magic or perform sacrifices, Gather players to be priests or use cleric villagers. \nBuild tables outside or inside so that customers can enjoy their meals on the premise. There can be chests behind the counter, you can hire people to work at the restaurant behind the counter, or the villagers could be placed here to sell food. Just in case the food runs out, there should be a room behind the counter for the kitchen with even more food storage and crafting capabilities. If you are good with redstone, you could automate the process. For cities inhabited by zombies, put a bunch of redstone cages that can drop villagers so zombies can eat them.\nGovernment.\nNote: If you don't want to have a jail, you can fine citizens who break rules through money or their belongings. Alternatively, you can use a server ban.\nGovernment Systems.\nIf you can think other systems of government, feel free to put them here! (Tip: Put the suggestions above this line, not beneath it.)\nMore Ideas.\nHere are more ideas for a metropolis that do not fit any of the previously mentioned categories.\nAn alliance is composed of several cities that agree to protect each other and allow each other to put military forces into each other\u2019s territory. They also agree to not attack each other. When a treaty is signed an alliance forms. Other cities can join or leave an alliance.\nAward loyal soldiers with positions like general or lieutenant.\nSame as war, but much more intense, with most/all cities at war, plus air forces added. Be careful as lag machines might be made by the losing side/sides in an attempt to force the winning side/sides to agree on their terms but they also threaten to drop the frames per second and maybe even the ticks per second to near 0 or at 0. This may mean that the server could crash due to the ticks per second being pushed to 0. So be careful and only allow it if you are willing to risk the server crashing due to lag machines.\nCurrency.\nTry having a currency so people can buy and sell things in your city. Good currency is usually something with practical value that follows a non-finite standard to prevent inflation. If you want a finite standard, you should be careful in order to avoid inflation. Therefore, great currencies to use are emeralds and emerald blocks (which are worth 9 emeralds each). This has the added benefit of allowing you to make villager shops with no difficulty. Another good currency would be \n&lt;a href=\"Brick\"&gt;Brick&lt;/a&gt; = $1, &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; = $10, &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; = $25, &lt;a href=\"Copper\"&gt;Copper&lt;/a&gt; = $40, &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; = $50, &lt;a href=\"Netherite\"&gt;Netherite&lt;/a&gt; = $75, and &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;Emerald&lt;/a&gt; = $100. Here's a list of common currencies with notes about their usage: \nNote that you do not necessarily need a currency as you can do trades and such, but it is a more fun alternative.\nGeneral Tips.\nRoads.\nRoads are present in virtually every city, but making them look nice is actually more complicated than one might expect. \nTo start, roads tend to be direct, fast, smoothly curved routes. Certainly, any road that isn't at least about 7 meters wide shouldn't have 90-degree bends that are intended to run without stopping.\nRoads also tend not to be steep, in real life, anything over 1/2 block up or down for every 6 blocks horizontally would be considered moderately steep. Anything more than about 1/2 block up for every 3 blocks horizontally for long sections would be considered very steep, and other than in mountainous terrain, be limited to residential streets.\nIn Minecraft, terrain tends to vary on a smaller scale than in real life, and be much steeper as well.\nUsually, long, wide \"highway\" type roads are as straight as possible, as cheap as possible, and require the least amount of terraforming possible. If there is a 30-meter-wide circular crater, sweeping around it smoothly is usually better than bridging it.\nIf there is a tall mountain in the way, going straight up it is not likely to be cheap to make or easy to travel. Go slightly up and around, if there needs to be a route to the top, make it connect to the main road and spiral up the mountain.\nThere are also multiple scales and types of roads with different qualities.\nGeneral Block Palette.\nIt is often advised that, for a specific type of construction, you stick to a specific palette of block-types, to make your city more organized. Example block palettes include:\nThis helps other builders, and yourself, to make creations that \"fit\" together, instead of a random mix. It also helps the build stay consistent. However, following the palette isn't always necessary, as different-looking buildings can make your city look more varied and interesting.\nJobs.\nJob Search Center: A place that helps those new to the server to find work. \nAfter you have built your city, you may want citizens to work. Here are some examples of jobs the citizens of your city can work.\nHouses.\nHouses are possibly some of the most important buildings in a city. They house most of its population and are usually used for social gatherings as well. In war-zones, houses may act as or be mixed with defensive fortifications as well.\nHouses are rarely just dwellings with a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, table and &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;. They have multiple rooms, possibly multiple stories, and are often designed to accommodate between two and five times the number of people who are intended to live there for short periods (For example, as long as they brought their own beds/sleeping bags, there are enough chairs at the tables, etc., to support them).\nIf you plan on including villagers in your city, you'll also need at least some houses that are suitable for them.\nHouse types.\nNote: Buildings you can build are not limited to the ones in the list below, and designing your own buildings instead of using the ones in the list can make your city look more original.\nHome-Shop: A shop on the other floors above inhabits the owner. These are usually in a brownstone-like design, which the store on the bottom, and 1 or 2 floors on top of three shop. \nHomeless Shelter: A place in which many people take refuge, in which people who are unable to afford or construct their own home. This building is the ideal start to your life on the server. \nHotel: A building with rooms players can rent for the night to stay in.\nShack or hut: a small structure meant to accommodate the most basic needs.\n&lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt; huts and &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;s both fit in this category. Lots of land nearby, but rarely does the resident officially \"own\" it. They're typically made from &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and are usually single-story structures that aren't very large.\nBungalow: A one-floor house, but very broad and square, consists of very few rooms such as a bathroom, bedrooms, a hall, A basement, a dining room and kitchen. It has a roof terrace on the roof.\nApartment Building: A tall building containing multiple apartments, almost always located in a city. Shorter than a skyscraper but usually taller than a normal house. The apartments might be owned by their occupants, or the occupants might have to pay rent.\nFarm house: A small to medium house intended for to house a farmer and their family, probably 1 to 2 stories, plus a basement, and a room with about 5 or 6 pens, for animal keeping.\nRural house: Often big, but rarely have much structure above the second story. Typically has one or two stories, with a fairly large (up to 20 x 15) exterior, as well as various features such as bedrooms, a kitchen, a dining room, bathrooms, etc. Can have yards or farms surrounding the house, usually very big.\nHoliday Home: Build a comfy house away from your primary residence. Use this home as a getaway from your regular home. This type of construction is best built when you have completed the majority of the more advanced necessities of Minecraft. Spend your vacation in your library writing the memoirs of your adventures.\nModular house: Build your house out of approximately 5x5 block cubical \"modules\" connected to each other. Each module can be either a single room or a hallway connecting the modules. You can even have multiple floors in a modular house, but having only a single floor is the most common.\nSkyscraper: A tall building with more than 40 floors. A skyscraper may host offices, retail spaces, and residential spaces. Due to their tallness, it might be a good idea to build an &lt;a href=\"elevator\"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt; inside the skyscraper to make the higher floors easier to access.\n Modern home:\nModern houses are mainly found in the richer parts of cities, make them out of lighter materials, and add dashes of color if necessary, materials like terracotta, bricks and concrete are ideal. and be sure to add mini floors! (Mini floors are stories of a modern home that are up near the ceiling and have glass panes for fences.) Add smaller rooms off of the bigger ones.\nDuplex: A two-story house, where both stories are separate apartments. Suggested size is around 14x14, with a kitchen, a living room, some bedrooms (at least one or two per floor), and a balcony. They can be made with things like bricks, wood, etc.\nSuburban house: At least moderate-sized, usually gets a little bit of all mid-quality materials. Rarely very unique and often very squashed outside, but comfortable interior with at least 2 bedrooms. Should generally have 2 or more stories, being usually up to 15x15 in size, and having a small yard. These should also have at least two bathrooms. \nTown-house: Usually 3 stories of roughly equal size with essentially no yard. Rarely over 8x10 wide, and placed in rows within 5 feet of each other. Like the suburban house, but more like 120\u2013240 square meters area.\nTent: Very small, Usually made of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;. Contains basic furniture such as a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, and tools. \nMansion: Any house which is unique and singular within a large area, much larger than necessary to support the people inside, extremely nice, has more area than any conventional home, and has more than 1000 square meters. Typically used by either very important or very rich people.\nOther type of houses that don't fit in these categories: There are many, in fact, countless types that don't fit very well into any category mentioned above. Examples include: towers, tree-houses, mass-living areas, sleep-tubes, house-boats, converted asteroids, cave-homes, continuous mazes of rooms of all types, bridge-homes, general store-homes, gas station-homes, motor-homes, space-module houses, worker barracks, wall-houses, hive-apartments, bunker-houses, manor houses and even some more unusual builds.\nLast Note.\nWhatever you decide, this is your city. These are just suggestions. Be creative and do whatever you want with it. You can use all the suggestions on this page or you can ignore everything and build the best city Minecraft has ever seen! It's your call, so get building!\nAfter Building a Metropolis.\nAfter you've spent a long time building a city, you may think that is the biggest thing you can do in the Minecraft world, but this is not true. Minecraft has an infinite number of possibilities that you can do, that never run out. First of all, you can defeat all of the boss mobs in the Minecraft world, or complete all the advancements.\nCities, Structures, and More.\nIf you have completed all the advancements, defeated all the boss &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s multiple times, have gathered several stacks of &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, and have made a city, consider modernizing your world. Here are some suggestions:\nMinecraft is a versatile world and you will never run out of the ideas of things to build, fight, and find. What you do in it is all up to you.\nGood City Mods to Use.\nIf you are using Forge 1.12.2, you will have access to literal thousands of mods. Other versions also support mods, but must use Forge or Fabric. Cities can look even better with mods, such as realistic signs, new products, new blocks, and even pilotable vehicles. "}
{"id": "93911", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93911", "title": "Tutorials/Building a rollercoaster", "text": "Roller coasters are a popular type of build involving minecarts and rail.\nComponents.\nRail Type.\nTo maintain top speed throughout your ride, all straight sections of a roller coaster should consist of &lt;a href=\"powered%20rails\"&gt;powered rails&lt;/a&gt; activated by means of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s. These redstone power sources can be placed on a block adjacent to or hidden underneath the block that the powered rail is placed on. A single redstone torch or lever will activate 8 connected powered rails in each direction in addition to the rail immediately adjacent to or above it, thus powering up to 17 rails on a track when positioned in the center of a given section. &lt;a href=\"Detector%20rails\"&gt;Detector rails&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to power 1-3 powered rails when a player is riding the coaster, with the added bonus of sending a redstone signal under or next to the block it's placed on. This creates opportunities for the player to utilize other redstone-powered blocks in their build. Powered &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;s will dismount the player upon passing over one. Only normal &lt;a href=\"rails\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; can guarantee the success of a turn.\nRealistic railing.\nMost real-life roller coasters only use powered rails to climb the first hill, using the energy from the descent of that hill to move the car along the rest of the track. This can be achieved in \"Minecraft\" as well: simply place powered rails up the first hill (along with your choice of redstone power source) and make the rest of the track from plain rails. The minecart should be able to make it around the whole track, as long as each hill is not as big as the previous one. Note that, if you choose to follow this model, your riders will not maintain top speed throughout the entirety of the ride.\nStation.\nA roller coaster typically starts with a station, which requires a way to a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;. One simple example involves placing a block on the ground where you would like your station to begin and putting a piece of plain rail on top of it. Next to that block, go down one block (to ground level) and place an inactivated piece of powered rail, so that it appears to slope down from the plain rail. Then, place either another piece of powered rail or another plain rail next to it. Put a minecart on the slope of the inactivated powered rail. While inactivated, the powered rail will hold the minecart in place against the pull of gravity.\nOnce this is done, build a 2-block-high pillar next to the sloping rail. Place a button on the uppermost block, facing the powered rail. When you right-click the button, the powered rail will turn on, allowing the minecart to move forward.\nStations can include a variety of complex features. For example, many builds include a switcher, allowing the minecart to go on a different railway into a station separate from the roller coaster.\nTrack.\nA common way to design a track for a roller coaster involves placing blocks where you want the track to go and then placing the rails and powered rails on top of those blocks. For a more realistic-looking roller coaster, place support beams along the length of the ride and conceal redstone power sources under the track.\nRails can be placed on any fully-solid opaque block, as well as on top of hoppers, upside-down blocks of stairs, and upside-down slabs. However, if you are planning to conceal redstone power sources underneath your track, avoid using blocks that follow the laws of gravity, such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. (Note that these blocks can be used otherwise, as long as they are supported underneath by any block that does \"not\" fall when unsupported.) In Survival mode, consider using common or renewable materials.\nTunnels.\nTunnels allow you to move a rider safely through an obstacle, including natural features of the terrain, such as a mountain, water, or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, or anywhere else that an obstacle would otherwise block the way. If the roller coaster moves through &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;, there is no way to protect the rider from the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; without killing or teleporting it away when it draws near (which requires complex commands), except for a tunnel constructed fully of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, which is impossible to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Breaking%20bedrock\"&gt;obtain in Survival mode without the use of glitches&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; will break any rail they come into contact with. (Water problem fixed in 1.17, but will slow down the minecart.) For maximum visual impact, you can construct a tunnel out of transparent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"barriers\"&gt;barriers&lt;/a&gt; for moving through either of these fluids.\nIntersections.\nIntersections usually combine clever placing of rails with redstone. Intersections are based on the normal rail. If a normal rail is placed at a t-intersection between three rails, it will default to one particular side. Powering that rail, however, will switch to curve the other way.\nDrops.\nIn Survival and Adventure mode, drops can be any height. No fall damage will come to the player. Alternatively, the rider can be driven in a boat, since boats negate fall damage as well. However, boats are more water based and are fun to ride with magma blocks and soul sand.\nJumps.\nJumps are used to add excitement while bridging gaps between rails or increasing the rider's elevation. Detector rails need to be connected to specifically-timed &lt;a href=\"slime%20blocks\"&gt;slime blocks&lt;/a&gt; attached to &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the timing, the player can be \"thrown\" anywhere with slime blocks.\nVertical Loops.\nAn expansion on that idea involves making the jump up circular and bringing the player down to the starting point. This is the closest that the player can get to a vertical loop, since minecarts cannot go upside-down.\nCorkscrews.\nAn expansion on the vertical loop idea turns it into a corkscrew. These are even more complicated to build as there is forward motion brought into the equation.\nThe only known corkscrews that currently work were built by The Duke MC.\nHowever, Javamonk expanded the idea to the height limits of the world.\nPortals.\nMinecarts and other transport vehicles in &lt;a href=\"portals\"&gt;portals&lt;/a&gt; will not react to the portal blocks. The only way to make use of the portals is to force the player to dismount the vehicle. This can be done with a powered activator rail or a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; set to &lt;a href=\"kill\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; minecart entities upon activation. (Too many activator rails will kill the minecart.)\nWater Skiing.\n\"Water Skiing\" is a part of the roller coaster which uses uplift bubble columns (by putting soul sand at the seabed) to cause the minecart to quickly traverse a body of water like a boat (but bouncier!). You should have a slime block on a sticky piston to launch the minecart for more speed. There should also be a sloped waterlogged powered rail to prevent the minecart from hitting the side of the landing block. (Build a small platform below if you have to.) There should also be a \"landway\" of nine rails with above blocks cleared to a great height to prevent the minecart from inadvertently landing on a trackless block.\nSkating.\nSkating is a part in a coaster where you are on ice and sliding around. Advanced users can utilize redstone alongside a slime block and sticky piston to change the other player's direction.\nWater Flows.\nWater flows can be used as a much slower alternative to rails. The water should not flow backwards. To make a flow faster, add soul sand below (see Water Skiing, above).\nTeleportation.\nUse a &lt;a href=\"Command%20Block\"&gt;Command Block&lt;/a&gt; to target the minecart and &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; it to the destination with codice_1 , or codice_2 .\nRider Protection.\nIt is critical that your rider doesn't die during the journey! Use these additions to make the rider safer.\nPartial Protection.\nFences.\nFlank the rails with fences and remove blocks right next to or above the fences.\nPros: Easy to build; looks nice; easy to integrate with other protection methods\nCons: Does not fully protect the player against evokers (and their vexes), skeletons, phantoms, spiders, and boss mobs\nGlass.\nSurround the rails with glass.\nPros: Easy to integrate with other protection methods; provides total protection against non-boss mobs unless broken\nCons: Obstructs the player's vision; fragile against explosions; a single gap can let a baby zombie in\nArmor.\nEquip enchanted diamond or netherite armor to the rider.\nPros: Good protection\nCons: Strong attacks can still kill the player; the armor will eventually break; the Curse of Binding will be needed; the player's armor does not look nice\nBeacons and Conduits.\nSet up fully powered beacons and conduits along the track. The beacons should provide Resistance, Regeneration, and Strength (the latter may be omitted in some instances). The conduits will let the player breathe underwater.\nPros: Long range, just one is needed for a short ride\nCons: Regeneration may not be fast enough in some instances; you will need to build multiple for longer rides\nResistance 5.\nResistance 5 makes the player completely immune to all &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. It is available through an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; of the Turtle Master or &lt;a href=\"Commands\"&gt;Commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nPros: Player cannot take any damage; easily accessible with commands\nCons: Minecart can still be destroyed; resistance 5 may only be applied with the potion in non-Java/Bedrock editions, leading to additional cons below\nPotion Cons: Must be reapplied frequently; drastically decreases FOV\nKill, teleport, or freeze nearby entities.\nSet a Repeating Command Block to automatically kill, teleport, or immobilize entities that get too close with one of the below commands:\nThe targetor will depend on the edition of Minecraft you play on.\nThe ignore list is also dependent and is what entities you want to spare.\nExample: To freeze entities that get within 5 blocks of players, with the exception of mobs named Jeff: codice_12\nPros: Works every tick; variable range; deflects boss mobs\nCons: ; laggy; fills operators' chat menus if the gamerule codice_13 is true; does not protect rider against non-entity hazards (lava, fire, cacti...); the simple mistake of forgetting the ! in codice_14 will make worlds unplayable and uneditable\nPeaceful Mode.\nPeaceful Mode completely stops the spawning of most hostile mobs.\nPros: Almost completely safe; does not obstruct the view at all\nCons: Does not stop some hostile or neutral spawns; does not work if the coaster has a mob as a part of the ride\nComplete Protection with Barriers.\nArguably the best method of shielding the rider, &lt;a href=\"barriers\"&gt;barriers&lt;/a&gt; are indestructible and transparent. Surround the track with barriers.\nPros: A bulletproof method of keeping mobs away; barriers are invisible, players will not know they are being protected until something hits the barriers\nCons: Can suffocate the rider; hard to keep track of; do not block the Ender Dragon\nSample.\nRoller coasters in Minecraft range from simple designs to highly complex ones. Players may choose to add complicated assets, such as command blocks, custom sounds and textures, and particle effects.\nHere is an example of what a modern Minecraft coaster may look like. The creator decided to add thematic elements to the ride, such as an immersive queue, custom music, and command block elements (particle effects, sounds, etc.). The massive size of the coaster, as well as the theming, compensates for the lack of traditional roller coaster elements such as inversions and hills.\nShop.\nYou could build a shop for benefits if you're on server by selling/using vending machines by connecting a hopper (point downward) to a dropper (point forward) and observer (point backward). Place a solid block on it facing the same direction and lastly, under the solid block, place 2 redstone dust connecting it to the dropper."}

It has a square look to fit the theme of &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not require any materials that are hard to acquire. You need a type of building block to start off with, as well as a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; and a nearby water source.\nTo build this fountain, start off by constructing a 5X5 frame of any material you wish, but only place &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; on the edges, so that the water has a place to flow into. Then, build a 3 block high column in the middle of the frame. Just pour a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; bucket on the top of the central column to finish it off, and the water should flow down all sides. You are done!\nDesign 2.\nTo build a fountain just like Design 1 but for a little more complex, polished, and round look, try placing a row of three blocks 2 blocks from the center of the fountain, on every side, and then connect them with one diagonal block. See the following picture for a demonstration. This picture uses &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; as the building block.\nFountain expansions.\nThere are many things to make a fountain even better and bigger.\nYou can make the central column higher. No matter how high it is, the water will always flow into the trench at the bottom and will not spill out, if you have done it correctly. If you want a very tall fountain, consider making a 10 block tall column, or more. You can also expand the width as well as the height. Instead of making the frame 5 x 5, make it as big as you'd like. However, make sure that it is not any smaller than 5 x 5, or the water will flow onto the frame, and spill out. \nAnother option to make your fountain bigger is to make the column in the middle bigger than one block. Consider using the center 3 x 3 area for the column. However, the frame must always be at least 4 blocks bigger in both length and width than the column. For example, if you had a 3 x 3 column, you must have at least a 7 x 7 frame. If you want a really giant fountain, make it with a 25 x 25 frame and a 3 x 3 column 25 blocks high. \nFor a more complex and round feel, make the shape of your fountain frame in a circle. This is rather difficult in the blocky world of Minecraft, but it is still possible (see \"&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creating%20shapes\"&gt;Tutorials/Creating shapes&lt;/a&gt;\"). This will make your fountain look even better. The fountain design 2 is an example of a fountain with a very small circle frame.\nConsider decorating your fountain. Make the fountain floor where the water flows stone brick, instead of dirt. Surround the bottom layer of the fountain with leaves, to give it a great-looking blend with nature. You can also grow &lt;a href=\"Tree\"&gt;trees&lt;/a&gt; around the fountain, but don't make them so tall or so close that they cover up the fountain.\nWaterfall.\nBuild a 1 deep, at least 3 wide all, however high you would like, to start. Then, build a barrier 1 block above the top of the wall, to prevent the water from flowing out the wrong way. Finally, add &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on the top of the wall. Also, if you would like, you can build a 1 block deep trench at the bottom of the waterfall, so that the water goes straight down instead of all over the place.\nWater or Lava Wall.\nBuild a frame for your wall. Build two more frames, all touching. The middle one should be 1 block bigger on the top and bottom. Then, add water in the top gaps. The water should flow straight down into the trench at the bottom. \n\"Tip: To build an incinerator, make a wall, but use &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. You can use this as a trash can, to throw in any items you don't want.\"\nSwimming Pool.\nSwimming pools come in all shapes and sizes, so a lot of what a swimming pool looks like is up to you. One trick that is necessary when building 2, 3, and 4 block deep swimming pools, is in order to put water sources in every empty space, start by digging only 1 down for every block, and put the water layer there. Then, for the deeper parts, dig however many blocks down you want that part of the pool to be, and the water should flow down.\nHere is an example of how to build a swimming pool. This one has an L shape to it.\nDecorating and Accessories.\nA pool can have many accessories added to it to make it more decorated and more fun. Here are some tips:"}

Efficient, productive, and interesting farm configurations can be achieved with the creative placement of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source blocks and &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;.\nManual designs.\nManual &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; farms can be a great start to farming cactus. Manual designs are generally cheaper, easier to build, and more lag efficient than automatic designs. However, manual farms are also less efficient and much slower than automatic designs. If you do not need a large amount of cacti, manual farms should be enough.\nCactus rows.\nThis design is probably the simplest next to looting a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert biome&lt;/a&gt;. To build it, simply place &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; in rows 1 space apart from each other. It may be desirable to space rows 2 blocks apart to make harvesting easier without getting pricked. If you are not careful, there may be some loss from the cactus being destroyed.\nDiagonal rows.\nThis method of &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; farming allows for the player to harvest cacti without taking damage. It uses a platform and a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; canal to collect the cacti. Wait for the cactus to grow and break the upper block while standing on the pedestal. It is not the most efficient nor compact design, but it could do for smaller farms. It has about a 15% loss rate.\nPiston harvester.\nGenerally speaking, the use of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s in a cactus farm is a very laggy and noncompact way of harvesting. However, in a manual design, the use of pistons can be beneficial as they allow the cactus to be more tightly packed and make it easier to harvest without being damaged. Additionally, since all the cactus are broken at once, there is less for broken cactus to be destroyed.\nThe schematic shows an efficient way of building a farm like this. The &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s should be built 1 block beneath the &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;. Cacti should be placed on every &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; block. A block will need to be placed on the pistons or they will not push up high enough to break the &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;. If you are lacking in &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; or another falling block can be used instead of sticky pistons.\nNotice how each cactus is only next to 1 piston and each piston except on the edges is next to 4 cacti. When building, make sure it is same if you want to use the least pistons. The first time you build this, it may be helpful to place the sand and pistons first. You could do this on a level surface, digging an extra block lower for each piston. When you are satisfied that the placement of the pistons is correct, remove the sand and ground where the redstone goes.\nAutomatic designs.\nAutomatic &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; farms work on the principle that if there is space available above a cactus, but there is a block next to where the new cactus block will be, then the cactus will grow and immediately break off. This principle can be used to create massive yet lag efficient designs. Note that any adjacent block will break a cactus, not just a full block.\nEfficient design.\nThe design of a cactus farm is critical to its efficiency. These points can help you to design farms with greater yields than you could otherwise obtain.\nAdvanced designs.\nAdditional complexity permits more compact (higher yield per space) designs.\nStandard automatic.\nA standard cacti farm usually looks something like this. Designs like these are not very efficient, however, when built on a large scale, they can produce thousands of cacti per hour. Usually &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; streams are placed at the bottom to wash the cacti into hoppers.\nXisumavoid design.\nThis design uses efficient design principles to get higher output per block. Note that the iron bar in the schematic could be replaced with a &lt;a href=\"fence%20post\"&gt;fence post&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo construct this design, first create a large square out of slabs. Next, place sand blocks every other block. Finally, place in water streams so that all the cacti flow into &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s. Repeat this process above the bottom to stack the farm. As there are no pictures, it will probably be helpful to see the design in the video."}

This is why this calculator has many different decoders.\nCurrent parts.\nThe following are the components of a calculator. They are in a somewhat logical order.\nControl panel (room).\nThe control panel is the room from which you set the inputs and decide of the operation.\nNumbers input panel.\nHere, the users will decide what numbers they want to use. In the picture, a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;-based binary input system is used, so the users must decompose the numbers they want to use into powers of two.\nOperation panel.\nFrom this panel, the user chooses between the operations he is going to use: add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide (/). Like for the Number's Input Panel, this picture of the Operation Panel uses the lever system.\nInput wires (white and orange).\nThese wires link the input panel and the operation panel to the different logic units. Try to rearrange them in a manner where the same values go together. So, your wires should look like, from left to right: A1; B1; A2; B2; A4; B4; ...\nLogic units.\nThe logic units in a calculator are the machines that perform the operations.\nAdder/Subtractor (yellow and red).\nThe picture to the left shows a version of an adder/subtractor. Its construction is simple because it is modulated (made of many same parts). That means that if you use more bits, you can just add more parts on the side. However, this means that you'll have to change some links.\nIn this machine, your inputs (in binary code) go into the bottom (yellow) &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Advanced%20redstone%20circuits%23Alternate%20Full%20Adder\"&gt;full adders&lt;/a&gt;. Each adder needs the two inputs (A and B) with the same values. Also, the least significant bit has to be on the left, so they should all be connected by their carries. Basically, your inputs look like the wires in the &lt;a href=\"%23Input%20Wires%20%28white%20and%20orange%29\"&gt;#Input Wires (white and orange)&lt;/a&gt; section. Use basic bridges to pass wires over the others without connecting them.\n&lt;br&gt; Your A inputs (left) are the minuend (X in X-Y=Z), and go straight in the adders. The B inputs, your subtrahend (Y in X-Y=Z), have to pass through a multiplexer, made out of a modified version of a &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Logic%20circuit%23XOR%20gate\"&gt;XOR gate&lt;/a&gt; which gives to the adder an inverted signal in case of a subtraction. The multiplexer is controlled by a switch (on the picture, that switch is on the left). The sums go into another multiplexer, which, again, gives an inverted input in case of a subtraction. This is controlled by an &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Logic%20circuit%23IMPLIES%20gate\"&gt;IMPLIES gate&lt;/a&gt; (in the top right) which gives a true output if the switch is on \"Subtraction\" AND if the last carry is true. This is required because on a subtraction, that last carry actually means the \"-\" (minus) sign. \nThe white machines are &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Advanced%20redstone%20circuits%23Half%20Adder\"&gt;half-adders&lt;/a&gt;, that use, as inputs, the carry of the last adder and the sum of their respective full adder. We need this because, if the answer is negative, it uses the equation \" -A = !A (inverted A)+ 1 \", as explained .\nThe final outputs are all of the top-most wires you can observe, plus the wire on the right (the carry from the last full adder) and the carry that goes in the first (left) half-adder, as the negation sign.\nMultiplier (light blue).\nThe multiplier is probably the most complicated part of the calculator. For our purposes, multiplication is a repeated addition. That means that, once again, adders will be used here.\nBefore you add the adders, you actually have to set up an AND gate (not including the control one). Its use is simple: in binary multiplication, because only 0's and 1's are used, the only way that we can have an output is by multiplying 1 by 1.\nHere is how to construct a multiplier, in order from the least to the most significant bits.\n&lt;br&gt;\nLeast significant bits :\n1*1 = 1. That means that the output of the second AND gate (the control one) goes straight to the output collective wires.\n&lt;br&gt;\nSecond to last:\n1*2 = 2 and 2*1 = 2.\nThose two outputs meet in a full adder. The sum goes to the output, and the carry goes to the next bit.\n&lt;br&gt;\nNext:\n1*4 = 4; 2*2 = 4; and 4*1 = 4\nThe carry from the last bit goes in the first adder as the carry input. The two normal inputs are 2 of the 3 AND gates. The sum of this goes in a second adder, where the second input is the third AND gate. Both carry outs go to the next stage, and the sum goes to the output.\nYou continue like this until you run out of AND gates, or equations.\nDivider (pink).\nDividers on a redstone calculator are less complicated than multipliers. Again, full adders should be used here. Basically, for each A input, set up n adders where n is the quantity of inputs by B. Also, this time, you have to \"reverse them\". Now the most significant bit should pass its carry downwards.\nOutput wires.\nOutput wires have to get every output from every machine and redirect them to the next part using redstone dust.\nBinary-to-decimal decoder.\nThis transforms your binary code into a decimal output. The size of it will be (Binary inputs*2)*(Decimal output)&lt;br&gt;"}

They do not chase &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s.

A picture is provided.\nCapture.\nIf all that is wanted is to capture a small quantity of cats for taming, then the only requirement is that they are unable to get out of the collection chamber while the player can. Use of fence gates or doors at the bottom of a pit that is at least 2 blocks deep is sufficient for this.\nFor more cat capture volume, a minecart trapping system is recommended so the captured cats are removed from the population cap.\nKill.\nWith a population cap of 5 cats per 128 block radius, to continue to have new cats spawn, then the currently spawned cats must be killed within 1200 game ticks in order to keep the population clear.

{"id": "65628", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65628", "title": "Tutorials/Cave spider farming", "text": "This tutorial teaches how to farm &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOverview.\n&lt;a href=\"Cave%20spider\"&gt;Cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s can be dangerous enemies - they are shorter than a &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;, one block wide, and apply the &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; effect to the player. This makes them hard to farm. However, with some skills and care, it is possible. Cave spiders drop the same things that &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s do (&lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s). Despite this, cave spider farms are useful because their &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s are easier to find. While a spider spawner may be tucked away in some &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, cave spider spawners can be found in many &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s.\nConstruction.\nPreparation.\nBefore starting the farm, you will need to find a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt; that contains a &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt; spawner. The spawner area can be recognized by a large quantity of &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s. The cave spider spawner will be in the center of the cobwebs.\nOnce a spawner is found, there are a few things that need to be done before starting the farm. First, get rid of all the &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; (sword yields &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; and shears yield the cobweb item itself), and quickly surround the &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; with torches, so that cave spiders won't be able to spawn. Be careful not to accidentally mine the cave spider spawner, because you will not be able to get it back.\nThe next thing to do is to make the layout for the spawning area. For the best results, make the spawner room a cuboid, with 4 blocks in between the monster spawner and each wall, and 1 block between the spawner and the ceiling, as well as between the spawner and the floor. You should now have a 9 x 3 x 9 area, with the spawner in the center.\nWhen working with the cave spider spawning area, it is strongly recommended to seal off the area you're working with, so that you are not in danger of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s other than cave spiders attacking.\nCollector.\nOnce the area around the cave spider &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; is all set up, you can start building your farm. Most farms have 2 basic components, the collector and the grinder. The collector is the area around the spawner, which collects the cave spiders, and moves them towards the grinder. The grinder is what kills the cave spiders. They are usually killed by either the player or an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;, because most sources of damage do not damage cave spiders.\nThe spawning area in a cave spider farm is generally the same as for other &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;-based traps. However, remember that cave spiders are smaller - they can fit through gaps 1 block wide and 1/2 block tall. Also, remember that they can climb walls.\nOne way to get the cave spiders to go into the grinder is by pouring &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on every block on one side of the spawning area. Then, dig down 1 for every block on the opposite side, place a water source block on each side of the ditch, and place signs over each block in the ditch. Now, all the water should eventually flow to one block. If you want to make sure that the cave spiders don't climb the walls, place water sources all along the top of each wall.\nThe block where all the water flows into should connect to the grinder room (make another channel if needed). Remember that you can stop the flow of water, but still allow mobs and players to get through with &lt;a href=\"signs\"&gt;signs&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrinder.\nThere are two types of grinders for any type of mob farm: a manual grinder and an automatic grinder. For a manual grinder, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; kills the mobs, and for an automatic, some other source of damage kills the mobs. For cave spiders, a manual grinder is cheaper and more efficient than an automatic, but requires the player to be there to kill the cave spiders.\nManual grinder.\nBecause of their size, ability to hold breath underwater, and ability to climb walls; &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and fall damage is difficult to make effective on caves spiders. &lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;Cactus&lt;/a&gt; isn't very effective either, as cave spiders are small enough to fit in between two cacti without taking damage. That said, a cave spider can fall a maximum of 16 blocks before dying. The only ways to kill them automatically are &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s. The easiest way to make a cave spider farm is to use a manual grinder.\nManual grinders require a hole that is too narrow for cave spiders, but large enough to allow players to attack them easily. One simple way of making one is by placing two &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; posts next to a closed &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;:\nAutomatic grinder.\nOne of the few ways to kill cave spiders without the player's aid is by placing &lt;a href=\"iron%20golems\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt; in the collection chamber of the cave spiders. Place &lt;a href=\"hoppers\"&gt;hoppers&lt;/a&gt; along the floor, all eventually connecting to a double &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. The iron golems will kill the cave spiders, and the loot will fall into the hoppers and go into the chest.\nThe disadvantage of using this method is that cave spiders will damage the iron golems as well, and eventually the iron golems will be killed. It is recommended to have an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt; before trying to attempt this farm (otherwise, you will go through a lot of iron!). This can be mitigated by having the cave spiders land on &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s. You can also repair the iron golem by using iron ingots.\nAnother way is to make a 9x9 plus 4 air blocks under the spawner and one on it. On the floor put magma, and in the upper corners, water. It will push the spiders in the middle. Under the magma block put minecart hopper, and under it a normal hopper which leads to a chest. The storage is expandable. The only thing you have to do is stay at the level of the spawner, right next to the farm.\nAnother way is to use flowing water to funnel the cave spiders onto a campfire with a block directly above it. The cave spiders can fit in the half-block gap between the campfire and the block and will take damage from occupying the same block as the campfire, and a hopper can be placed underneath. A soul campfire will deal twice as much damage as a regular one.\nFinal Touches.\nOnce your grinder, whether it's automatic or manual, is fully functional, go back to the &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; room and get rid of all of the lighting that you put up. This should allow the cave spiders to spawn. If desired, you can decorate any part of the farm that may be in view of a player. Also, if you want to enhance the mechanics of a farm, make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Item%20sorter\"&gt;sorter&lt;/a&gt; (this will only work if you have hoppers underneath your grinder). This way, the &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s dropped from the cave spiders will go into separate chests.\nNow you have finished your cave spider farm, which will supply you of endless string and spider eyes. However, note that in order for cave spiders to spawn, you must be close to the spawner.\nVideos.\nDesign by wattles.\nThis design is very simple, but requires player intervention. Once the cave spiders are collected in the grinder, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can hit them to their death. This design takes advantage of the fact that players can hit in between a closed trapdoor and a half-slab, but cave spiders can't climb through it.\nDesign by BasketMC.\nIn this design, there are two different modes. In one, the cave spiders take &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; until down to half of a heart, when &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; puts the lava out. This allows for players to kill them in one hit. In the other, the cave spiders are killed completely. This design is meant for 3 cave spider &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, but could easily be modified to 1 or 2."}

The plant grows from &lt;a href=\"chorus%20flower\"&gt;chorus flower&lt;/a&gt;s planted on &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt;. When growing, a chorus may grow additional flowers on any side, which can grow independently into separate stalks or branches, making the plant grow wide. A fully grown chorus measures up to twenty blocks in height, sometimes even higher. A &lt;a href=\"chorus%20plant\"&gt;chorus plant&lt;/a&gt; block has a chance to drop one &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;. If a block below the plant\u2019s main part is chopped down, blocks above it are chopped automatically; chorus plants drop fruit as usual, but chorus flowers do not drop, which means they must be harvested directly.\nChorus flowers can be planted in any dimension, as soon as there are blocks of end stone to plant them on. They do not require specific light levels for growth.\nChorus fruits can be eaten (to restore points of &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;), but the player has a chance of being teleported in a random direction. They can also be &lt;a href=\"popped%20chorus%20fruit\"&gt;popped&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; and then used for crafting &lt;a href=\"stone%20brick\"&gt;stone brick&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"end%20rod\"&gt;end rod&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nChorus plantations are mainly used to provide &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;s for construction. First, the gathered &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"popped%20chorus%20fruit\"&gt;popped&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, then the popped fruits are used to craft purpur blocks (at a ratio of 4 per 4). This setup works best with a group of furnaces and a renewable source of fuel, such as a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Tree%20farming\"&gt;tree farm&lt;/a&gt; which provides &lt;a href=\"logs\"&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt; for smelting into &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;. This combination is self-sufficient, which means it can be built anywhere regardless of the availability of local resources (or the lack thereof), such as space between &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;'s central and outer islands or space above &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;'s top &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; layer.\nHarvesting.\nIn order to harvest a chorus plant it is sufficient to chop down the plant\u2019s bottommost block, which will cause all blocks above it to be harvested, with a chance of dropping chorus fruits. While easy, this does not allow for &lt;a href=\"chorus%20flower\"&gt;chorus flower&lt;/a&gt;s to be harvested, because they do not drop this way, so they must be harvested separately.\nManual harvesting.\nManual harvesting of chorus plants involves manually planting the chorus flower (or multiple flowers), waiting for the plant(s) to grow, and manually harvesting the plant.\nBecause the chorus plants grow quite tall, it is preferable to create a separate platform at the height where it would be possible to harvest chorus flowers from. Once the plants are fully grown, the player would climb onto the platform and harvest the flowers. If some plants are not accessible from the platform, they can be reached by jumping onto other plants, but this method has a risk of falling onto the surface from a considerable height. The varied and unpredictable shape of chorus plants can also pose a problem. In order to simplify this process, it is possible to shoot chorus flowers with a bow (or with &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s), dropping the chorus flowers. Plants can also be confined within a \u201ctube\u201d of solid blocks in order to limit their width and to simplify harvesting.\nAutomated harvesting.\nAutomated harvesting involves automating specific processes of harvesting using &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s or flowing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Virtually all automated farms use confinement of plants\u2019 growth in order to simplify the process.\nSemi-automatic harvesting.\nSemi-automatic designs usually involve manual harvesting of &lt;a href=\"chorus%20flower\"&gt;chorus flower&lt;/a&gt;s in amounts enough to sustain the plantation and automated harvesting of the plants. Usually, some plants are limited in height to allow for simple harvesting of chorus flowers. After the harvesting is done, pistons or flowing water are used to chop the plants. The drops can be concentrated in a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; line.\nAFK harvesting.\nAway from keyboard (AFK) harvesting involves collecting flowers and fruits by chopping them with an array of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, similarly to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Tree%20farming%23Automatic%20Tree%20Farms\"&gt;automatic tree farms&lt;/a&gt;. But, unlike tree farms, chorus plants\u2019 growth can\u2019t be sped up by &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, which significantly slows down the production rate in comparison to tree farming. On top of that, the flowers must be broken manually in order for this kind of farm to be sustainable. A layer of downward-pointing dispensers above the farm, loaded with snowballs, can harvest a fair number of the chorus fruits. It can be automated by fixing the and buttons in a pressed position (such as by a heavy object). Unlike manual or semi-automatic chorus planting, AFK-able designs are more complicated to build and are quite rare.\nVideos.\nNcolyer's fast AFK design for 1.16 versions and above\nCubfan135\u2019s semi-automatic farm\nRay\u2019s Works\u2019 AFK design\nGTexperience\u2019s AFK design\nJavamonk\u2019s design"}

There are two methods of chunk banning; the first is the method of building high NBT structures, although this does not work in recent versions. The second (and more reliable) chunk banning method, now known as \"area banning\", is to fill a shulker box with high NBT books and drop it as an item entity. Unlike \"chunk\" banning, this will kick you from the game if you are within 96 blocks of the dropped item on a Vanilla server, or 32 blocks on a server with Spigot/PaperMC server software. In addition, if a &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; holds a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt; with high NBT &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt;s, the range on a Spigot/PaperMC server the ban range will be 48 blocks.\nChunk bans are mainly used in anarchy servers, prisons and safe houses to keep people out of certain places. The first reference of a \"chunk ban\" was the furnace chunk ban in 2b2t, and the first non-anarchy reference was in a prison called The Obelisk by Miningblob. Ever since then several prisons and safe houses have been made with dropped shulker box \"area bans\", most notably &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D20Gg3ph5PSo\"&gt;Gaia's Vault&lt;/a&gt; by TheDeafCreeper+SeenSven and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXgZcEO3JKHk%26amp%3Bt\"&gt;Wifies' safe house.&lt;/a&gt; \nThere is a lot of misinformation about the difference between \"Chunk bans\" and \"Area bans\"; so watch this &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbhqzV9hU09E%26amp%3Bt\"&gt;informative video&lt;/a&gt; by Jerrylum to fully understand Area Banning.\nDO \"not\" hold it in your inventory if playing on 1.18.1 or higher. it will PERMANENTLY ban you. The solutions are either to change the nbt data in the server/world file to remove the shulker box or to have a friend place a repeating command block with near you and then try to join."}

Each team had a unique advantage which the players can use to win the game and are a symbol of both tactical intellect, survival skills, fighting prowess, teamwork and deception.\nImportant skills to remember/master.\nPVP skill is incredibly important in PVP. Even if you have the best gear, a seasoned fighter can still overpower you even if they only have diamond equipment.\nThe second most important skill to learn is diplomacy. Diplomatic skills are essential in forging alliances with other people and make peace with enemies. \nThe third most important skill are survival skills. Survival skills not only involve foraging for food but also includes how to get the best gear as fast as possible, how to survive in the wild, etc. All of these skills are incredibly important to master. Thus it's more recommended if you sharpen these skills first before joining a Civilizations SMP.\nBasic concepts and mechanics.\nAssuming you are now good at PVP, skilled at diplomacy and have good survival skills, we must learn the basic concepts of Civilizations.\nTypically, Civilization SMP are divided into 3 or more teams, and the player can choose whatever their heart desires. In some competitions, the advantages lie on the team chosen, and the advantages/perks can either be resource advantage, terrain advantage or technological advantage while in other competitions, the advantages lie on which role the player chooses. The roles is dependent on the organizer of the competition so watch out and weigh the pros and cons of each advantage.\nAnother thing is how you will get stacked really fast. Depending on the civilization, there's no fixed way to get stacked, but one of the most reliable ways is through villager trading. However, some civilizations don't generate vanilla structures, only custom ones so look for other sources to stack up fast.\nAnother thing to know are who's gonna be your main enemies. In vanilla servers, opposing players are your main teams, but depending on the organizer, they can add NPCs that will ocassionally attack players. These hostile NPCs are usually deployed when the players' guard are low, providing them the oppurtunity to ambush unsuspecting players and kill them. At the end of the day though, opposing players are gonna be your worst enemy.\nA thing you should look out for are the world events. Events typically include a famine or a disease, incursions from NPCs, revealing the coordinates for a structure that have good loot, leader election, where fighting between members are enabled, allowing for betrayals, exploration, building contests, etc.\nSurviving in an actual competition.\nAssume you have joined the contest, what team are you gonna join? Determine which teams are available and make an in-depth analysis of each teams' strengths and weaknesses. For example, assuming the teams available are: Overworld, Nether and End, each team had its own advantages and weaknesses. The Overworld, has rich natural resources but are hidden in the depths and players had to mine for them which is potentially dangerous, the Nether had Bastions, thus gold and netherite, but the inhospitable environment can make it really hard for players to survive while the End, had the power of End cities and elytra, but the void and shulkers' levitation powers can make it a bit hard. Sure the End might be your best bet, as End cities contain the best loot in the game, but players join with literally no tools, so it's a bit risky. The Nether rivals the End with the Bastions, but the nether's hostile world is really challenging to conquer, so the best option here is the Overworld.\nAssuming you've finally made it in, what are you gonna do now? First things, get wooden tools, make stone stools, and get iron armour and tools ASAP. Also aim for some diamonds and an enchanting table. Then get a full set of diamond armour ASAP. Not only it will make you more powerful and increase your chances of surviving, but also it can be used as a tool to recruit followers, as players typically ally those with powerful gear for protection and gear acquisition. \nLook an eye for the world events. Set-up a basic food farm even if it's bread. Cows and pigs are a great foodsource and can help you survive in famines, unless you're underground"}

It requires you to soak a dirt block with a water bottle to turn it into mud, and then place it over a dripstone block which has a dripstone below it, which will \"dry out\" the mud block and turn it into clay.\nManual farming.\nThis method is how to farm it from scratch if you haven't found a swamp yet and don't have any mud. If you do have a lot of mud, you can replace the dirt with the mud and you don't need to worry about soaking it. Here is what you will need and how to do it:\nFirst, you will need to build up 4 blocks and start placing some dripstone blocks in that height. You can do it in any style you prefer, such as strips or squares. Then, place stalactite dripstones under the blocks, and place dirt above it. Then, place the water in a spot where you can access it when above the dirt blocks, and fill up all the glass bottles and soak all of the dirt with the bottles, until it turns into mud. When the chunk is loaded the mud will slowly dry out and eventually turn into clay, and then you can harvest it and repeat the process of placing and wetting the dirt.\nSemi-automatic farming.\nTo semi-automate the design, you will have needed to build it in strips. First place dispensers facing into the dirt blocks and place water bottles in each of them, and link them up to a button using redstone. You can also place observers facing into the other side of the dirt blocks and connecting them to a bell or note blocks to make a sound and to a redstone lamp to make a light so that you know when the clay is ready to harvest. To activate the farm, press the button and it will soak the dirt blocks, which will also activate the observers, but when the observers are activated again, the clay is fresh to harvest."}
{"id": "5583", "revid": "55867055", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5583", "title": "Tutorials/Cobblestone farming", "text": "Cobblestone farming is the technique of using a cobblestone generator to produce &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; without damaging the terrain. Cobblestone generators work on the principle that when a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; stream comes into contact with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, the lava is turned into cobblestone. This fresh cobblestone then prevents the two streams from touching. When this fresh cobblestone is removed, the two fluids produce another piece of cobblestone. Variants of the generator can also produce &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, but this is generally trickier, because for stone, the lava must enter the water from above.\nMany generator designs exist, but the simplest way is to make a five block long trench with a one block gap in the middle. Then, place water in it at the end closest to the hole and lava at the other end. This creates cobblestone where the fluids meet. \nWhen producing cobblestone, one must be careful not to let the flowing water touch the lava source block. Doing so destroys the lava source, converting it into &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. A basic understanding of fluids is helpful to prevent this. If you place a stair into the water source (flat side to the lava), this prevents the water from flowing over the lava source, but the cobblestone still forms where flowing lava touches the waterlogged block. Placing a non-flammable block over the lava helps prevent the cobblestone item from being destroyed by the lava when you mine it, as well as keep you from falling into it.\nAdding pistons can let a generator extrude a whole line of blocks, safely away from the lava and easily mined as a batch. Subtle variations of these designs can produce \"plain\" stone as described below. The pistons and other arrangements for these generators can also be repurposed for a &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; generator. Basalt generators don't need the water streams at all, just the lava, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;. Note: soul soil is needed, not soul sand. You can convert soul sand to soul soil by making and breaking &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;soul campfires&lt;/a&gt;.\nReasons to build.\nWhile the popularity of building any form of cobblestone generator varies, there are many reasons why a player should build a cobblestone generator. Here are a few.\nPistonless generators.\nPistonless generators have been around for quite a while. However, Their usefulness is limited because cobblestone is so readily available. These generators require the player to mine and collect the fresh cobblestone in close proximity with lava. This both presents risks to the player and reduces efficiency if the dropped cobblestone is destroyed by the lava. These drawbacks can be mitigated by design choices, for example by removing the block under the cobblestone, allowing the loot to fall in a safe place, or collecting drops using a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes about the schematics here: Gold blocks indicate any fireproof block. Water and lava source blocks may be marked with \"s\" when there is possible confusion. Cobblestone or normal stone appear only where they form. An \"x\" indicates a place to stand while mining the cobblestone.\nBasic generators.\nA lava stream touching a water stream is the simplest type of generator. In a 10-block long trench with sources at either end, the cobblestone forms next to the lava. With a little more digging, you can manage this more compactly, and even get a current to wash the mined cobblestone away from the lava. This and the next design are easily expandable for multiplayer use. \nFountain generator.\nA fountain-style generator offers more convenient mining, but takes more work to construct than the basic version. This one also uses two lava streams for faster production.\nFrom below generator.\nThe \"From Below\" generator is a small building with the generator on the roof. Putting the generator on the roof means very little cobblestone is lost to the lava, but it is a lot more work. This one also uses two lava streams. \nPiston generators.\n&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to automate cobblestone generation and reduce the amount of cobblestone lost. Piston cobblestone generators work on the same principle as standard generators, but rather than mining, a piston pushes the fresh stone out of the way, allowing the streams to touch once again. Piston cobblestone generators can be used both to create a large supply of cobblestone that the player can mine later, or to supply a self-repairing structure with blocks. The piston can be driven by a clock, or by a circuit to detect when a cobblestone block has appeared. The cobblestone extends in a long line or pillar; if you don't want it to extend out to the full 12 blocks, you can \"cap\" it with any unpushable block. Furnaces work well, and you have plenty of cobblestone handy to make them.\nComponents of a piston generator.\nThere are three basic components to consider in a piston cobblestone generator:\nBasic piston generators.\nThe first design uses a redstone clock drives a piston which pushes out the generated cobblestone from a basic core. The second uses a block-detection circuit, and pushes the cobblestone upward.\nQuad-piston generators.\nThese advanced generator designs consistently produce four cobblestone blocks on every fourth piston cycle. The blocks are pushed upward, negating any chance of the cobblestone burning from touching lava. \nCobblestone Quad-piston \"Factory\":\nThis build can easily be converted to a basalt generator: \nExamples of Secondary Piston Usage:\nStone generation.\nLava flowing into water from above creates stone. Stone can be mined slightly faster than &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, and it can also be collected as stone using a pickaxe with the Silk Touch &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. Using stone also gives self-repairing structures a different, more natural look.\nStone generators are rarely designed without &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, as lava needs to be directly above the stone generated. Lava must flow down into flowing water in front of the piston. As with cobblestone generators, a single-piston design can only make a row of stone up to 13 blocks long.\nStone generator examples:\nSmooth Stone Generator A can be built in a 4\u00d75\u00d72 hole, with two blocks dug out of the bottom (level 0), and the clock extending two blocks out from one corner.\nThe upward facing piston is on level 0. The hole east of it contains redstone and is covered by any transparent block (glass shown for visibility). The redstone torch in the main section is temporary; once you've built the clock, place a lever on either input block (green wool), and flip the lever, then replace the torch with redstone dust. (This lever is turning the clock, and generator, off, so turning the lever on stops the generator.) After building, flipping the lever again runs the generator, or do a bit of tidying-up: The rest of level 2 can be filled with any block, and you may want to cover the lava (and even the exposed repeater), with a slab.\n\"Variation\": Since the clock is already protruding, you might substitute a longer one to cut down on the piston noise. Experiment carefully with the delays, as some clock cycles can stop production entirely. (With this 5-clock, the generator is moving the pistons three times for every block.)\n\"Earliest Known Publication\": May 29, 2012, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUHlHmaHtFSU\"&gt;Minecraft Smooth Stone Generator Tutorial by DJ&amp;Riggaz&lt;/a&gt;. \nSmooth Stone Generator B is a clockless build driven by a BUD switch.\n\"Earliest Known Publication\": May 1, 2014, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dv-xOT50-f7k\"&gt;Simplest Automatic Stone Generator - KollinsPlays Minecraft Vanilla Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. \nMore video examples.\nFastest Largest Continuous Mining Stone Generator \nAFK stone farm.\nAFK design which allows you to put something heavy on your mouse and go away from your keyboard.

The jungle log does not need to be attached to a living tree, only any harvested jungle log, therefore it is easy to create large farms for cocoa beans by chopping down jungle trees and arranging the wood to optimize growing space. \nFarming.\nAn optimal arrangement for a non-automated cocoa bean farm is:\nThis can be repeated vertically and horizontally (overlap by 1 square horizontally or laterally when repeating this pattern) to create larger farms. Vertical farms are more space and yield efficient, however they are progressively more difficult to replant and harvest the taller they are. Bear in mind in your farm design that you cannot reach more than 6 blocks up and 4 blocks down from the block on which you are standing, so balancing simplicity of planting/harvesting and maximum yield involves a trench 4 blocks deep and jungle wood blocks protruding 6 blocks above ground.\nCocoa beans will break if the bean itself is hit by the player or a piston, if the jungle wood itself is pushed by a piston, if water occupies the same space as the growing bean, or if the jungle wood block is destroyed. All automated harvesting relies on these methods. Theoretically, &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; would also remove the beans but would be costly to implement and difficult to replant.\nAlternatively, a slightly less growing space efficient but overall easier and higher yield design is to build a wall of any arbitrary width, covering both sides with cocoa plants. This is simpler to plant and harvest, as you are only working in 2 dimensions.\nBear in mind that extremely large farms are impractical and unnecessary given the speed at which cocoa pods grow and the overall yield of beans from a relatively small planting. Pods grow quickly, achieving maturity in minutes, each yielding up to 3 beans, each bean making 8 cookies or dying 1 wool brown. At about 80% pod maturity you will almost always see at least a 200% return on your planting.\nMechanisms.\nNo designs for a fully automatic farm are available at this time, as you are required to manually place cocoa beans on the jungle log to plant pods, however semi-automatic farms that harvest automatically but still require manual planting are possible and relatively cheap to build.\nCurrently there is only one major variation of the semi-automatic farm: piston-harvested.\nFormerly, there was another major variation of the semi-automatic farm: water-harvested, it was broken as of the &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt; due to the &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogging&lt;/a&gt; mechanics, as water can now pass though &lt;a href=\"cocoa\"&gt;cocoa&lt;/a&gt; without breaking it.\nPiston harvested farms use a single line of jungle logs, planted on all 4 sides with cocoa plants. &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;s either push the trunk, causing the grown beans to be removed, or scrape the beans from the trunk. (Other designs raise and lower the trunk in rapid succession; but these utilize more complex &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt;s and are not significantly more useful, cheap or efficient than simpler designs.) Piston designs suffer from universally low yields, somewhat expensive and complex circuit design (compared to alternatives) and general space inefficiency.\nWater-harvested farms may also have a single block trunk of some height, but a much higher yield is possible by building walls and allowing the water to cascade over them to scrape off the pods.\nSimple Water Flush Design.\nFully-grown cocoa beans planted on a slate of jungle wood can be flushed using water for a clean and fast harvest. This design is polished, compact and clean yet simple and easy to build (this is only possible in versions before the 1.13, as the waterlogging mechanic lets water pass through cocoa beans without breaking them).\nWall design.\nPlanting cocoa beans on the 4 sides of a log makes it harder to replant, so a wall of jungle wood makes the fastest design possible. For a compact design, the wall must be also partially underground so as to make the most out of your planting reach.\nThis design uses dispensers, that are cheaper than other design's pistons, and the use of redstone is minimum. The design is modular, with units of one dispenser and 3 blocks wide wall.\nPiston column design.\nThis design by MonkeyFarm uses pistons to harvest the cocoa beans. A piston moves the wood column up while another moves it back down, removing the cocoa beans from the tree. It is a bit more resource expensive however equally compact.\nNote: The top repeater needs to be on the last tick for it to work.\nWall design with water.\nThis design is theoretically scalable to any size wall and utilizing only one piston and a number of redstone torches equivalent to half the wall. The example uses two 7x7 walls placed in a 3x17x1 ditch to catch water runoff. There are 210 possible growth locations, yielding nearly 10 stacks of beans at maximum growth.\nThis design exploits the fact that water will propagate infinitely so long as it flows downhill first, allowing a single water block and single piston to cover any width of wall. This is based on MinecraftMaximizer's design at the bottom of this page, but is considerably more space and material efficient, using a piston rather than a dispenser to release the water. This is because dispenser designs require 2 toggles: 1 to release the water and 1 to stop it; piston designs can work by a single button press. It does require more redstone than Maximizer's, which only uses 1 dust in the dispenser, with the advantage to this design being that it can be triggered from the ground.\nBulky efficient design.\nA large and rather bulky mechanism may be created in a 7x7x3 with an inner stem of three jungle logs all covered with planted cocoa plants. Four three-block tall towers of pistons on the corners of the logs facing the plants with NOT gates connected to the bottom torches may be used to create a peak efficient farm. The downside is that the harvest will fly away from the center, making it harder to collect.\nCompact design.\nA more compact 3x4x4 mechanism, but with 3/4 of the efficiency of the 7x7x3 model, may be made with a three-jungle-log stem. However, one side of the log stem is connected to sticky &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt; with a block on the side of the middle piston. A torch is placed under the block and &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; is placed on top, then a lever is added to the block under the torch. To complete, plant cocoa plants on the three remaining sides of the jungle log stem and wait for them to grow. A flip of the lever and the cocoa beans can be harvested.\nWater column design.\nFor efficiency of space, as jungle logs are very common in a jungle biome, there is no reason to make a farm solely based on wood surface efficiency. The efficiency should rather be of space, and amount of materials used.\nUsing water as a harvesting mechanism provides a far more compact solution, uses less materials, and can extend the farm beyond the single-column versions seen above. A great example of this type of farm can be seen in MinecraftMaximizer's and MikiMiner's designs.\nSimple water flush design.\nThis design has a low resource cost and does not take up much space, making it good for underground farming."}

The color palette consists of a certain selection of blocks that will often appear on a build.\nCreating a color palette.\nWhen you're creating a color palette, you have to decide what blocks you mainly want to use for the build. There are some things you need to think about, such as the contrast. Let's say two similar colors are next to each other, you might notice a difference when you're close to it, but when you move further away the difference may be harder to tell. This can also apply to the texture itself.\nYou also have to look at which blocks fit together in the color palette or when put next to each other and which do not. This means that some blocks could fit in the palette and some could appear \"out-of-place\" which you mostly want to avoid.\nA color palette consists of multiple blocks, that are usually categorized as:\nExamples.\nColor Palette differences.\nThis example, should show you the difference a \"color palette\", so basically different blocks, can make.\nHouse structure, with only one \"color\" used.

{"id": "19296", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19296", "title": "Tutorials/Combat", "text": "Combat is a very important aspect of Minecraft, whether it's defeating the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s for gunpowder, or trying to win a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Player%20versus%20Player\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; match. This page lists the best ways to kill each hostile or neutral &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; in the game, as well as many combat strategies.\nHostile mobs and bosses.\nThere are many hostile mobs and 2 bosses (the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;) in the game. This list is sorted primarily by chance of encounter, with a few exceptions when appropriate, such as the listing of the illusioner, which does not spawn naturally, with it's fellow illagers.\nIt should be noted, however, that if caught in a difficult place without a weapon, the player can usually run away with little difficulty if they are outdoors, or even tunnel downwards and wait for the mob to despawn before resurfacing to avoid combat. And, finally, should they so wish, the player can set the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; to Peaceful, which removes all hostile mobs, except for the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOverworld mobs.\nZombies.\nZombies are one of the easiest hostile mobs to kill, as they use only melee attacks and burn in sunlight (unless they are wearing &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;s, carved &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, or are in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or the shade), and it is easy to land a hit on them in melee combat without taking damage due to their slow speed and predictable movement. Zombies are not that fast (except for baby zombies, which &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;, are small, and, as a result, are hard to hit), and by themselves are merely a nuisance, although they can prove to be rather annoying in large numbers, or in dark, small spaces, like mines.\nAs zombies are helpless when unable to reach the player, simply getting out of reach can nullify their threat. \nThe player can also use a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; to shoot zombies, but may wish to save their arrows for more difficult targets (unless the &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; enchantment is applied).\nOne of the best ways to deal with a zombie horde or baby zombie is to pillar up 2 blocks, so they can't reach you but you can still reach them. This is not recommended if more dangerous mobs are around, as they may knock you off the pillar. \nIf possible, luring them out into sunlight will cause them to burn. \nUsing weapons with the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment is a very effective option, as it is against all undead, and a sword or axe enchanted with it will usually make quick work of them. \nOn hard difficulty, zombies can spawn other zombies when players hit them, and will transform into drowned when underwater for a long enough time, and can break down wooden doors. If playing on Hard mode, protecting ones house with something like an &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt; or fence gate is advisable, as zombies can't break through those, although another option is having the base of the door one block higher than the block directly in front of it. \nUnlike other hostile mobs, zombies have a detection of 40 blocks, which means they'll see, and take action, against a player at a further distance than other mobs. This can be exploited to lure them out and dispatch them before dealing with more dangerous threats.\nHusks.\nSpawning exclusively in deserts, husks have the same behavior as zombies but don't burn under sunlight and will inflict the player the &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; effect. While marginally more dangerous than normal zombies Husks still don't pose much of a threat and can usually be dealt with like any other zombie.\nDue to husks only spawning in deserts, players can also avoid them entirely by not living in a desert biome.\nSkeletons.\nSkeletons are difficult to slay in melee combat unless the player has the correct tactics. However, if the player has weak armor, just sprinting towards one and timing your hits correctly can work, but you will take a few shots in the process. \nSkeletons are very accurate and running out will almost always result in a hit, as does trying to wait around the corner and attack the edge of the skeleton. By blocking with a shield, players will negate damage taken, and the arrow bounces off the shield, which can be used to their advantage. \nOne of the best ways to approach a skeleton is by circling around them and while doing so, approach and hit/block them. Players can also jump-sprint so that there is a chance that the skeleton will shoot over or under them. It is then possible for the player to hit, &lt;a href=\"blocking\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, and repeat until the player kills them. \nAs with all undead mobs, using weapons enchanted with smite can be very useful against skeletons. \nNever use sprint hits on skeletons unless they are near a hazard, as knocking them back will give them a free shot at the player before they can approach. \nOne can make short work of a skeleton by shooting it while outside its search range. If detected, charge the bow shortly after dodging a skeleton's arrow to prevent being shot while under the slowing effects of a charging bow. \nAnother easy way to subdue skeletons is by pushing them into the water since they sink. When underwater , skeletons stop using ranged attacks and switch to melee attacks, which makes them much less threatening. They will still fire arrows in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", but the water will substantially reduce their range to the point where they're ineffective beyond a few blocks. \n&lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; will naturally chase away and attack skeletons, so &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s are slightly safer from skeletons since wolves will naturally spawn. \nIf the player is low on health and arrows, wait until day break so that the sunlight burns them. \nIn &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es, they spawn 20% of the time in place of a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Skeletons can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt; biome in the nether.\nStrays.\nStrays behave near identically to skeletons, but they are more dangerous than their normal counterpart. Strays shoot arrows of slowness which slow players down and prevents sprinting. Strays use a melee attack that also inflicts slowness underwater, so fighting them with a ranged weapon is recommended as the stray can be hard to reach and kill, especially when armored and equipped with an enchanted bow. \nStrays only spawn in snowy biomes, so living in a non-snowy biome can avoid an encounters with this mob. \nWolves naturally hunt strays so a &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt; biome is a safer place to live or explore on.\nSkeleton Horsemen.\nThe skeleton horsemen can rarely spawn during thunderstorms and they spawn in groups. The skeleton rider, always equipped with enchanted bow and enchanted iron helmet, move as fast as a horse but despawn after several minutes.\nIt is highly recommended that the player use a ranged weapon, since multiple skeletons riding horses with enchanted bows are hard to reach. The horse is actually passive, so players just need to kill the rider and players will get the skeleton horse as a result.\nCreepers.\nCreepers are very powerful and often catch players of all experience levels off guard, despite their small line of sight. On &lt;a href=\"Hard\"&gt;Hard&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, the player can't even survive a direct creeper explosion with unenchanted netherite armor. Creepers don\u2019t usually get that close though, and will usually begin to explode up to 3 blocks away because of their detection radius. Using an Axe for combat is recommended, as they deal more damage per hit and the player is highly advised against trying to hit one multiple times consecutively anyways.\nOne way to kill them is to hit with a sprint attack and immediately walk backwards after, having the &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; enchantment can help with this greatly. \nIf you have iron or diamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, charge and spam-click. You will need to be extremely fast as they explode relatively quickly. \nCreeper explosions can be blocked by &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s. Useful for surviving ambushes in cramped spaces such as caves.\nThe safest way to engage a creeper is from a distance by shooting three fully charged &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s at it with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; so it cannot explode near the player. The player can finish off the creeper with a melee weapon after shooting the creeper twice to save arrows.\nSwimming creepers can be easily dealt with using melee attacks while the player is on land. If fighting on land with no ranged options. Alternatively, the player can find sufficiently high ground to strike a creeper from above with a melee weapon without the detonation sequence being activated. By making a 3\u20134 block pillar of dirt/sand by pillar-jumping, and waiting until the creeper comes next to the pillar, the player can attack it without exploding.\nCreepers will also run away if close to a &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;, keeping the creepers at a distance.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s, if lightning strikes close enough to a creeper, it becomes charged. Charged creepers are one of the most dangerous mobs in the game, with it's close range explosion dealing so much damage that a player with full diamond armor enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV is left on just 2 hearts. However, the lightning also damages the creeper, making it a faster kill if the player decides to attack it. Just make sure it doesn't explode and they should be able to kill it just like normal creepers.\nExplosion mechanics.\nIf there is 3 blocks or less between the player and the creeper, and it has a line-of-sight to the player (i.e. the player and the creeper can see each other's faces), they will start its 1.5 second countdown before they explode. Hitting it and moving back or sprint-hitting it will move it far enough away that the countdown stops. Creepers running away from cats that have started their countdown can still explode if the player is close enough.\nBelow is an image showing the likelihood of a creeper exploding. The white square in the center with an 'X' is the creeper's location. This grid uses the block system for distance and it is used by 'placing' the player on the relative colored square. Please note that the player may think that they are two blocks away in the game, but actually, they may be closer, depending on the graphics or perspective (e.g. looking up vs. looking straight ahead).\nAdvanced techniques.\nOne of the scariest things about the creeper is its silence while approaching. However, if the player listens carefully, they might notice that the creeper has footstep sounds. Since the player also makes footstep sounds, it is hard to tell if a creeper is coming, or it is just the player's own footsteps. Luckily, player footstep sounds and creeper footstep sounds are not in the same category: the player's sounds are under the \"Players\" category, and the creeper's sounds are under the \"Hostile Creatures\" category. Therefore, by turning down the \"Players\" volume slider and increasing the \"Hostile Creatures\" volume, the footsteps of an approaching creeper can be much more recognizable. If the player is wearing headphones, they can even identify the direction of the footsteps; this is also possible with &lt;a href=\"subtitles\"&gt;subtitles&lt;/a&gt;. The player can also &lt;a href=\"sneak\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; to prevent their character from making footsteps at all, so that when they hear footsteps, they can be certain that a creeper is nearby.\nLike with other mobs, the player can place a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; in front of the creeper's path, so that it will enter the boat, and is unable to escape. The player can then place a 2-block-high pillar next to the boat with the creeper inside, stand behind it, come out and hit the creeper, and retreat back behind the pillar when the creeper hisses, and repeat, until the creeper dies.\nIf the creeper is encountered in a cave, the player can run back, and build a horizontal barrier with cheap blocks like dirt or cobblestone, at the second block space above the ground (i.e. at the player and creeper's eye height). When the creeper approaches, it won't explode because it does not have a direct line-of-sight with the player. the player can then strike at the creeper's feet without worries, until it dies.\nIf the player does not plan to harvest the gunpowder or experience from a creeper, one way to deal with one is to just let it blow up. The safest way to blow up a creeper is with a &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;. Just simply the flint and steel on the creeper, and run away before it explodes. Although the creeper drops nothing this way, it's still effectively dead, and can no longer harm the player. If the creeper is next to multiple other monsters, the player can kill all of them by simply lighting the creeper up. But if you do this strategy, you might have to patch up explosion holes if you don't like them.\nIf the player does not have a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, another way to block off a creeper's explosion is to place a block in front of the exploding creeper at its feet level. It can be any solid block, even ones with low blast resistance like dirt or sand. Since explosion damage is calculated from the feet of the creeper, by placing this block, the \"exposure\" of the player to the explosion is substantially reduced, and the player would typically only take damage. The terrain around would still be damaged though, so the player should make sure not to stand in dangerous places while doing this(like un-updated sand or gravel).\nAnother risky way to kill a creeper is to charge it, and perform two consecutive &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s with a diamond or netherite sword. If this is done correctly, the creeper will be killed before it has time to finish its explosion countdown. However, this requires quick reflexes and a bit of practice, so players should train themselves in a Creative test world before they ever try this in Survival.\nWitches.\nWitches are hostile mobs with an appearance similar to villagers that spawn in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s, swamp huts, rarely during the night in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. They throw negative &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt;s at the player and will drink &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt; potions to protect themselves, making them one of the more dangerous mobs in Minecraft. Witches often start their attacks by throwing splash potions of poison or slowness, following up with harming or weakness and have . \nIf the player finds one, shooting it with a bow is the safest bet. If the player is holding a strong weapon, another strategy would be charging towards it and hitting it multiple times before the witch is finished drinking their potion of Instant Health. \nDon't use splash potions on them as they are almost completely immune to them. Fire attacks and lava will also be negated through &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s of fire resistance, although the time that it takes for them to drink this potion can give the player a significant advantage. Prioritize killing witches before other mobs to prevent them being healed. \nSlimes.\nSlimes are found only below &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; level 40 in certain chunks and in swamp biomes at night, but usually occur in large numbers, especially at full moon, and are often a major pest in mines. \nOne solution is to mine a hole only one block wide so that only the harmless tiny slimes can fit in it, but in natural caves and larger mines, larger slimes can become a nuisance as they will spawn in any light level. \nSince the larger slimes are slightly over 1 block wide, the player can trap them behind walls and hit them easily. They are also easily killed by attacking from above. Attacking from above or backpedaling will prevent too many from attacking at once. Water is also effective at slowing them down. \nLava will kill large numbers of slimes, so it is good as a last resort or if the player doesn't care about drops. Note that a tiny slime can be killed with a punch, saving weapon durability. A \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" player could also use a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;'s sweep attack (which deals by default) in order to eliminate a number of tiny slimes at once.\nGuardians.\nThe guardian has two methods of attack: engaging a laser-like beam and a thorn-like attack. The beam takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage while doing so, and changes from purple initially to bright yellow when fully charged. Once charged, the beam abruptly disappears and deals damage. The guardian will swim around for a few seconds before firing again. If the target comes near the guardian while it is firing its beam, it will stop firing and swim away until it is at a comfortable range, at which point it will continue attacking. The guardian, unlike other hostile mobs, will not follow the player if they move out of sight. Instead, it will simply continue swimming until the player becomes visible again, and will then start to charge its attack. The beam cannot be dodged, as it follows the player, but can be obstructed by solid blocks, and has a range of approximately 15 blocks.\nGuardians also have spikes on their bodies. Although these spikes don't do any direct damage upon contact or as a melee attack, they act similar to the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. The guardians can extend and retract their spikes. If a player attacks the guardian when its spikes are extended, the player takes a small amount of &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; if attacking the guardian with a melee strike.\nGuardians are difficult to attack with melee attacks when underwater, as the player will not be able to quickly approach the guardian due to the slowing effect of the water and the fact guardians will swim away when approached by a player it is targeting. The guardian will deal around damage every time it is hit when its spikes are extended. If cornered, the guardian will usually extend its spikes and fire its laser at the player, even at point-blank range.\nIf brought to land, they may take fall damage from their swift and erratic movement.\nIf the player must melee a guardian, they should try to corner it and hope for the best; or else try to trick it into swimming within melee range repeatedly.\nThe guardian cannot shoot as fast as a player with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; can, so a skilled player will be able to shoot the guardian, and then hide to break the beam's lock, repeating until the guardian is dead. Arrows will slow down and eventually fall when in water, so the player may be forced to shoot at a very close range. If the player wants to use a ranged attack, a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; is a viable choice as it doesn't slow down underwater. The main difficulty with fighting guardians is the mining fatigue effect from the elder guardians, which will slow down weapon cool-downs. If the guardian is in shallow water the player(s) can use a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; to pull it out of the water where the player(s) can then kill it using melee attacks without being shot at or hurt by the spikes. The guardian can still shoot while out of the water and unless it's held still, it flops around too much to easily attack with melee.\nFighting guardians is incredibly dangerous without armor. Armor is essential to combating guardians, especially within an ocean monument. Entering their territory without armor will almost always lead to a swift death, even if armed with a sword or Trident.\nUsing the combined effects of &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Strider\"&gt;Depth Strider&lt;/a&gt; III, &lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; II and sprinting, the player can actually swim faster than the guardians, allowing them to sneak up on them or to escape their beams. Players can also use trident with &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; III and &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; V, and when the guardian uses its laser attack, quickly use the trident and aim into it, so guardian will take damage from the trident and stop using its laser due to the player being too close. \nElder guardians.\nThe elder guardian has a very large amount of health , making melee kills even harder. Elder guardians do more damage than regular guardians. Fighting elder guardians is incredibly dangerous without armor. Armor worn should include diamond or netherite equipment enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;s due to their longer breath) and boots with &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Strider\"&gt;Depth Strider&lt;/a&gt;. Tridents enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; are also recommended since elder guardians are an aquatic mob. They will also give players Mining Fatigue III, making it almost impossible to tunnel out in case of emergency and to mine the gold treasure inside the ocean monument. It also slows the player's attacks.\nPlayers can use tridents with Impaling V and Riptide enchantments and then ram into the elder guardian and if under the effect of Strength II, it can cause massive damage to the elder guardian.\nSilverfish.\n&lt;a href=\"Silverfish\"&gt;Silverfish&lt;/a&gt; are small mobs, which can be spawned from a silverfish spawner, which only naturally generates in strongholds or by breaking an &lt;a href=\"infested%20block\"&gt;infested block&lt;/a&gt;. Infested blocks can be disguised as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, or variants of stone bricks, and spawn in strongholds, igloo basement, woodland mansion's fake portal room, and at mountains biomes. The breaking speed of infested blocks is the same with any type of tool or bare hand, making it easy to find which blocks are infested blocks. When using the player's hand to break blocks, infested blocks break a lot faster than cobblestone, stone, or stone bricks, but when using a better quality &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, such as iron or diamond, infested blocks break a lot slower than cobblestone, stone, or stone bricks. Infested blocks spawn one silverfish when mined.\nOne silverfish only deals very little damage , or with better quality armor on. However, when the player attacks a silverfish, it can summon other silverfish hiding in other nearby infested blocks. This problem can be solved by killing a silverfish in one hit. , the player can do this with any type of axe except a wooden or golden &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. , the weapon of choice should be enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt; or be used only with critical hits instead.. With the sharpness enchantment, the player can also do this with a stone axe, iron axe, or diamond axe or diamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is going to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; and the silverfish spawner in the end portal room is bugging the player, they can go ahead and destroy the spawner. Silverfish don't drop anything upon death, so it won't be useful to make a silverfish farm unless the player wants an XP only farm.\nEndermites.\nIf the player uses &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s often, they are sure to come across an &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt; at some point. Endermites are not very difficult to fight because they have only , just like silverfish. When using lots of ender pearls, they become more of a nuisance than a hazard. When they have spawned an endermite, there are a few things the player can do. If they don't want to bother with killing an endermite, go to at least 16 blocks away from it so that it won't attack the player, and it will despawn after 2 minutes. If the player wants to kill an endermite for its experience, it's not too difficult. Just get a sword or axe of any type, and keep hitting it until it's dead. If the player uses a stone or better axe (this will not work in Bedrock Edition as unenchanted axes do less damage than swords), or a diamond sword enchanted with Sharpness, the player will be able to kill the endermite in one hit. &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; are also hostile towards endermites, which can spark some rather comedic battles.\nPhantoms.\nPhantoms are difficult to kill as they have a small hitbox and only briefly swoop down from the skies to attack before retreating. They only spawn at night if a player hasn't slept in a bed for at least 3 in-game days (insomnia). Players can check how much time has passed since their last rest in their &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;: if the \"Time since last rest\" statistic is greater than 1.0 h, phantoms can spawn. The longer the player has not slept in a bed, the more frequently phantoms will spawn. \nAfter spawning, they will fly around the player and swoop down to attack. Outrunning them is a rather futile method against them. Instead, the best way to avoid being attacked by them is by going inside a house, cave, making a small hole in the ground, or sleeping. Phantoms are undead mobs, so sleeping or waiting them out until daytime will cause them to burn in the sun. They are also affected by &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;. Phantoms are afraid of &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s so it's best to have one around the player to prevent phantoms from swooping down.\nAlternatively, if you want to kill them for drops or XP, stand under a tree or build a roof above you. When the phantom swoops down to attack, hit it when it is under the roof. The phantom will try to retreat, but will be blocked by the roof. \nIf stuck out in the open with no method of cover damage can be avoided by precisely hitting one as they swoop towards the player, preferably earlier in the dice and/or moving backwards to increase the window of time the Phantom can be hit without touching the player. \nPhantoms\u2019 slow turn speed can also allow the player to avoid damage by quickly running to the side around the phantom and even counterattack, but this is much less effective against large groups. \nThey drop &lt;a href=\"phantom%20membrane\"&gt;phantom membrane&lt;/a&gt;s upon killing them, which can be used to repair &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; when using an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be used as a &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt; item by using an awkward potion to turn it into a potion of &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt;.\nVindicators.\nAdded alongside the &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, these mobs deal the highest natural melee damage on a single player world ( on easy, on normal, ) on hard, and almost always spawn in groups with other vindicators, mostly as part of illager &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt;s. Since the woodland mansion has many areas where a mob can hide (as there are some generation problems with the torches, so the vindicators will not be alone), it is easy to be ambushed and swiftly killed, especially when entering bedrooms, their primary spawn location. As the mansion is already dimly lit, it is best to explore using night vision, have another player with the player, if possible, and keep their hostile mob noises up since vindicators make grunting noises while idle.\nHaving armor enchanted with Protection will reduce the damage taken, but beware of vindicators holding an enchanted axe, as it can deal even more damage than it normally does, sometimes killing unarmored players in a single hit. This is not a mob to be taken lightly, even late game. Even more so, when it is coupled with the other illager types, such as &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBlocking with a shield doesn't work, as vindicators have the ability to disable shields using the axe's stun function. \nDuring raids, prioritize to kill vindicators over pillagers, as these mobs become regular enemies at later waves.\nEvokers.\nThe shamanic counterpart to the vindicator. They summon vexes, small spirit-like creatures that eventually die off, assuming they do not kill the player. Most of the time the player will not find lone evokers. Evokers are typically accompanied by 2 or more vindicators. The vindicators will charge the player, giving the evoker time to use one of its summoning attacks: \nEvokers can also appear in raids (which only appear if the player has the bad omen effect in a village) at wave 5 on normal difficulty, and wave 5, 6 and 7 on hard difficulty. As they spawn, they run very fast and summon in Vexes before the player can kill it.\nEvokers will also attack when damaged by the player, even if the evoker has no line-of sight towards the player. Because of this, if you attack the evoker far away with a bow, it will summon vexes and they will attack you.\nVexes.\nVexes are very small creatures about the size of a baby zombie, can only be summoned by Evokers. They float around, passing through blocks and deal damage with iron swords. They do high damage ( on easy, on normal and on hard) and have . A player with good gear will be able to kill it in one or two hits. Prioritize killing them over vindicators when the player can see them in range of the sword, as they move fast and can get behind the player.\nAfter some time after they are summoned, they will slowly lose health and then die.\nIllusioners.\nThe third type of illager, they don't spawn naturally, and must be summoned by the player(s). They have the ability to blind the player for 20 seconds, and can even spawn duplicates to fool them. These duplicates move in the same way as the regular mob, but real illusioner is invisible. The illusioner attacks with a bow. Due to it dealing poor damage, illusioners are more of a nuisance than deadly. It drops the occasional bow on death. It's recommended to use a bow for this mob, search where real arrow comes and hit in that direction until the player finds the real illusioner as duplicates are the same distance from the invisible real illusioner. When the player is blinded, it's best to back away, waiting for the blindness to disperse, then attack again. You could also drink a bucket of milk to remove the blindness. Splash potions of harming are great. Since they deal area damage, it will kill the illusioner in a few hits without having to search the real illusioner.\nAnother very good strat to kill illusioners is to hook them with a fishing rod. When the illusioner first notices you, it will not actually clone and will just shoot you with a bow. Then hook it with a fishing rod in your offhand. Then keep hitting the fishing rod bobber until the illusioner is dead.\nPillagers.\nThe fourth type of illager, they spawn in 3 ways: &lt;a href=\"Illager%20patrol\"&gt;Illager patrol&lt;/a&gt;s as they spawn naturally with groups of pillagers and vindicators, at &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outposts\"&gt;pillager outposts&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s, which only occur when the player has the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; status effect in a village. They hold a crossbow which is sometimes enchanted. Pillagers shoot their crossbow at the player up to 6 blocks away every 2 seconds, and can sometimes be dangerous, especially in groups. The player needs to be careful when encountering a pillager armed with an enchanted crossbow with &lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; as it fires 3 arrows at once.\nTo avoid making contact with the pillager, it is best to stay away if the player does not have any armor to protect themselves. If forced to fight, strong weapons are recommended. A &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; can stop the pillager's arrows if successfully timed. Blocking an attack and counter-attacking while the pillager is reloading is an effective strategy. A bow or crossbow can help kill pillagers from a safe distance.\nUpon killing a pillager, they drop &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, Sometimes a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt; if the pillager is the &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt;.\nRavagers.\nAn illager bull-type mob, they only spawn on &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s (which only appear if the player(s) carries the bad omen effect into a village), where they begin spawning in the third wave. They are sometimes being ridden by vindicators, pillagers, or evokers. They have the same amount of health as an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; and are very dangerous to face in combat as they have a powerful attack if the player gets too close. Their attack on hard difficulty can almost instantly kill the player without any armor and can also destroy crops and leaves in their path as they chase the player or villager. Ravagers run slightly fast if running away from them, which means the player may have a hard time healing. &lt;a href=\"Beacon\"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt; effects such as Resistance, Strength and Regeneration may help defeat ravagers slightly easier.\nTo avoid getting killed, it's best to stay further away from ravagers while the wave of a raid is in effect, and it is recommended to have some strong protection on diamond armor and a strong diamond sword to face them. The player(s) can also use a bow or crossbow to kill ravagers from a safer distance. If a ravager is unaccompanied by other mobs, you can pillar up two blocks then hit it with a sword. You can also hide in a village house and open one door. Then when the ravager charges in front of the building, you can hit it then hide inside, since ravagers are about two blocks wide. These methods are better resource-wise, and if you don't want your shield or arrows to be consumed fighting a ravager. \nA shield can help if the player can time the blocking right; however, there is a 50% chance for them to stop for a moment to growl and roar. This will hurt the player and after that, they continue to chase again. If the ravager is stunned by blocking with a shield, try to hit it a few times as this is the time where the ravager is the most vulnerable. \nSince the player will likely be encountering a Ravager in a Village during a raid, they may want to employ the help of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Iron Golems have a similar attack strength and health pool to Ravagers, making for an evenly matched fight. With the player's help, a single Iron Golem can survive against a couple or so Ravagers. \nIts recommended killing the illager rider first before killing the ravager, as a combination of those two mobs can be dangerous.\nNote: Vindicators riding ravagers is unused and can only be summoned using commands, so the player will only encounter ravager being ridden by pillager or evoker in this edition.\nUpon killing a ravager, they drop a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarden.\nUnlike any other hostile mob in the game the warden is designed to be unkillable and not meant to be fought. there are no gain for players in fighting wardens, and warden encounter is systematically not a situation where combat is relevant. players should not try to attack a warden in any circumstances unless they have good gear with quick-thinking speed of healing themselves and damaging the Warden, is pillared up from a 20 or more block distance and has enough arrows to kill, or using a Warden farm and killing it with Bow and Arrows from a safe distance. \nThe warden despawns if unprovoked for 60 seconds. If the player happens to kill a Warden, they only drop a &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Catalyst\"&gt;Sculk Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;.\nNether mobs.\nThere are 9 mobs, that can spawn exclusively and naturally in the Nether. This list is sorted by chance of an encounter. As zombified piglins are neutral, combat strategies for them are listed under &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Combat%23Neutral%20mobs\"&gt;neutral mobs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurrently, all Nether mobs are hostile, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;, which are neutral, and the &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;. All can be very dangerous without sufficient weapons, but all can be outrun fairly easily while sprinting, and all despawn on peaceful. These nether mobs are immune from fire damage, making Fire Aspect and Flame enchantment useless. Piglins and Hoglins aren't immune to fire damage.\nGhasts.\nGhasts are often considered the most difficult mob to kill in the Nether because of their extreme attack range, explosive attack power, mobility, and flight. Players in any exposed area will have to deal with them sooner or later and possibly from the moment they step out of a portal. Ghast fireballs have a profound effect on nether architecture, making a compelling case to use only materials resistant to their explosions for outer walls and exterior fittings in places where their attacks may be drawn. As a result of their large size and the extreme unpleasantness of an indoor ghast spawn, the primary defense mechanism for buildings in the Nether becomes enclosure. A ghast's firepower is highly inaccurate at most ranges if one is moving. Players are most vulnerable when they are building in the Nether, when they may not be moving and possibly standing above a long fall. Ghasts can also break blocks from under the player, often dropping them into lava or causing death through fall damage. \nThe player can reflect fireballs by hitting them with anything before they impact, even bare hands. Because of their low speed, spamming mouse clicks is often enough to deflect any given attack. It is possible to kill ghasts by reflecting their attacks back at them, but it can be difficult since they are agile. If you do manage to kill a ghast by reflecting their fireball, you will get the Return to Sender challenge. Players can easily make a fireball reflect in the direction they want by shooting an arrow, fishing rod, or snowball at the fireball. In fact, snowballs or eggs are the easiest as they are easy to get and don't have a speed limit, so the player can just bombard snowballs and they will hit the fireball at some point. The fishing rod, when released, slightly affects the fireball's trajectory. This relationship goes both ways and a ghast's constant stream of fireballs may well interfere with the firing arc of the bow. \nMost ghast kills are made with a bow and arrows or a ghast fireball for obvious reasons, but a ghast can be killed with melee weapons if the player can get close enough before it flies away. Ghasts are highly vulnerable when caught on the ground since their attacks can be deflected and their health is quite low \u2014 2 blows from a diamond sword will kill one at only 10 health units. It is possible to use a fishing rod to draw ghasts near enough to hit them with a sword. A close ghast is also much easier to hit with a bow, though reaction time against its fireballs is likewise lessened. When aiming the bow, be sure to lead the shots as ghasts can quickly change trajectory and move quite quickly. Depending on the ghast's range and relative altitude, it is usually necessary to also aim at a high trajectory to gain extra range. Where possible, having the advantage in altitude (such as shooting from the topmost layer of the Nether) is of enormous help. Also, ghasts move much slower when caught in a lava fall or pool, so waiting for the perfect opportunity can help their accuracy. If ammunition is not a concern, it is advisable to shoot many arrows at differing trajectories in order to find the range to the ghast. Be wary when shooting at a ghast, because if you miss, there is a chance that your arrow will sail past the ghast and hit a zombie piglin, which would have disastrous consequences. The ghast's hitbox is mainly its body, and aiming too low may cause a shot to go through the ghast's tentacles, dealing no damage. However, it is perfectly practical to shoot the hitbox through the ephemeral body from above using plunging fire. \nMuch like using neutral or enemy mobs as shields against arrows fired by skeletons in the regular world, it is feasible to use zombie piglins as shields against ghasts in the Nether. It is possible to injure or kill zombie piglin in this fashion without ever making them hostile to the player. If a ghast hits a zombified piglin, other zombified piglins will try to kill the ghast and will if it is close to the ground. \nShields themselves are extremely useful in the open as they negate all damage and Knockback to the player as well as reduce blast damage in surrounding blocks making netherrack a relatively safe platform (though still not recommended if the platform is only a single block thick) to stand on while fighting the ghast. \nDepending on how far your FOV is, the ghast can fire at you from outside your vision. If you keep your FOV at normal, you will be able to see the ghast if it's firing at you, but you will only have a little bit of time where the ghast is in your view and is not firing at you. Anything less then normal and you might not see the ghast at its very long-distance firing range.\nAn effective method of fighting ghasts in the Nether is to make a shelter, preferably out of brick, cobblestone, obsidian, or other explosion-resistant materials. Nether brick is ideal because it is completely immune to their fireballs, and is commonly found in the fortresses and as smelted netherrack. Make a 1\u00d71 hole in the roof and add ladders leading up to it, in such a way that players can poke the upper half of their body through the roof. When a ghast is near, climb the ladder, shoot an arrow at the ghast and quickly descend again into their explosion-proof shelter. This should mean that the player can kill ghasts easily with minimal health loss. To improve this even further, add a small 3\u00d73 roof 1 block above the hole in the main roof. Most of the ghasts' fireballs will now hit this roof rather than the player, meaning that the player should be safe against most ghast attacks. \nGhasts do when a direct hit from a fireball is taken. If reflected back to the ghast that shot it, the fireball will deal , instantly killing it.\nOverall though, an enchanted bow and good skill are the most effective ways to deal with a ghast. Shooting arrows can be difficult at longer ranges, meaning a bow enchanted with infinity helpful, letting the player shoot many arrows without losing any.\nAnother great weapon is the &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; with the Multishot enchantment as it fires 3 arrows at once in a different direction, giving a high chance that one of them hits the ghast. Arrows fired from crossbows has faster and further range than bows.\nGhasts can spawn anywhere in the &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Basalt%20Deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;, however they spawn fairly more often in the &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt; biomes.\nMagma Cubes.\nMagma cubes are common in the Nether, especially near fortresses, so being able to fight them is a necessity for anyone who explores the Nether a lot. Additionally, they are a good source of experience and a useful potion ingredient, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller two kinds of cube are both easily killed with a stone sword or better even in large numbers, as they have low health and a slow attack rate, but big cubes can be deadly. Due to their jumping attack, they are very hard to hit and dodge, and while they have less health than the player at 8 hearts, they have natural armor that negates some of the damage dealt to them, making their practical health much higher than the player's base. Preferably trap them on a ledge above the player and use a hit and run tactic, but if they must fight them in the open, hit them immediately after their jump so the player has time to escape the next one. Once the big cube is defeated, fighting its smaller counterparts should be much easier.\nWhen fighting one magma cube in a flat area, a trapdoor-like technique is often a safe way to kill them while avoiding taking damage. Stand just out of reach of the magma cube, and start walking toward them just before they jump. As they jump over the player, look up and hit them, but keep on moving. If done properly, the magma cube should be knocked over the player and they should be safe. If they are knocked sideways or backwards when the player hits them, move to avoid them. A sword enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; will also help. Sprint-hitting a cube also gives increased Knockback; however, it is much more difficult to hit them when moving faster. This technique requires practice, but may be the most reliable way to kill them without a bow.\nMagma cubes are one of the only mobs to spawn in the basalt delta, and they spawn in all sorts of quantities, making them harder to battle. Plus the biome itself is hard to navigate, filled with lava pits and magma blocks, and it is quite easy to jump into or be hit into a hole with lava at the bottom, which is sure doom for the player. An easier way to deal with a group of magma cubes is to shoot an arrow at one of them from a safe place out of the magma cubes range, so they cant see you. Once you have shot the magma cube it will either come after you or just ignore you depending on how far away the player shot it from. Repeat this process until there is no more giant magma cubes, then you can rush in and kill the smaller ones, or, if you don't want the magma cream, you can shoot them from far away. On \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to clear a group of small and/or medium magma cubes from a safe range, as long as &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; is in plentiful supply.\nA magma cube spawner can be found generated in a &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt; structure.\nBlazes.\nBlazes are rare and spawn from spawners in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es. They are essential to get &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s, which have many uses, such as in making &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;. They can occasionally spawn elsewhere in a nether fortress, so it is best to be prepared, even if the player does not plan to go near a spawner.\nBlazes can be difficult due having both effective ranged and effective melee attacks that deliver two different types of damage, in addition to their ability to fly. They fly, slowly, up or down to gain a height advantage or hide behind cover between fireball volleys, but usually not fast enough to dodge a player's first or second attack. Their horizontal movement is extremely slow, and the are unable to pursue a player or maneuver effectively in close combat. In open areas they can rise out of reach of melee attacks if the player gives them enough time, but at melee range a blaze on the ground can often be hit two or three times with a sword before they are out of reach, and skilled use of Knockback can pin them down.\nBlazes fire a volley of three fireballs that lasts 0.9 seconds, followed by a very long recharge delay of 5 seconds, while it only takes 1 second to fully charge a bow, making a player's skill at timing their attacks and shield blocking/taking cover the key to blaze combat. Their range of 48 blocks is comparable to a bow's 52 blocks, but the fireball's flat trajectory can create an effective range advantage in the nether where overhanging terrain is common, and even more so in enclosed Nether Fortress corridors. Silent, surprise fireball attacks by distant blazes are a risk walking on open-air Fortress bridges, on lava below on striders, and the general vicinity of a Nether Fortress. If you can see a blaze, it can probably hit you with great accuracy.\nAs with any mob, a group of blazes can be especially challenging. They will each attack at the first opportunity, risking a devastating mass volley of fireballs. Fortunately, they do not use coordinated that could pin you down, but rather leave their entire group helpless for up to 5 seconds while they recharge after firing en masse, giving the player the opportunity to advance, retreat, place or mine blocks, or repeatedly attack, before having to take cover or shield block again.\nBlazes can only spawn in light level 11 or lower (at the lower half of their body). Much like ghasts, the blaze's ability to fly can make it difficult to recover their loot after killing them, though usually the greater concern is the many fires a group of blazes can ignite around themselves, potentially &lt;a href=\"Fire%23Burning%20entities\"&gt;destroying&lt;/a&gt; drops before the player can pick them up. \nOne viable tactic is to pull blazes into melee range using a fishing rod. \nBlaze spawners generate in fortresses and will start spawning blazes once the player gets within 16 blocks. The spawners have a chance of spawning 1\u20134 blazes at once. 'Camping' at a blaze spawner is an effective way to gather blaze rods, as they will almost always appear close enough to attack with a sword, and there is a delay in their attack after they spawn because they have to charge first. This is best done in combination with the Fire Resistance potion in effect, which makes the player immune to the blaze's ranged attacks and can be brewed by adding magma cream to awkward potions. Players can also build a doorway, 2 blocks tall and 1 block wide, where the player can camp and kill the blazes as they come down. This strategy is extremely effective if the player cover up the roof of the spawner room and camp in the doorway with a diamond sword. But be careful, as the blaze also has a melee attack that damages the player if they get too close. The player can also just dodge the fireballs (stand still for 1\u20132 seconds, the blaze will shoot at them, then they can run away), then run up to them while they're charging and attack them with melee combat since they charge on the floor. Then, run away the second they start flaming again.\nA blaze suffers damage from &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s, and would be damaged by water if there was any in the Nether. Alas, &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s do not survive in the Nether unless immediately provided with a potion of Fire Resistance or possibly a Regeneration potion. However, player-thrown snowballs are still a viable tactic. Due to their ease of acquisition and infinite supply, snowballs can be considered superior to archery for battling blazes. Though they can't be used to damage other kinds of mobs, carrying a few stacks of snowballs while exploring nether fortresses is an excellent way of repelling unexpected waves of spawned blazes. In addition, other mobs like wither skeletons and magma cubes can often be knocked off the high fortress bridges with snowballs, adding further usefulness.\nWither Skeletons.\nWither skeletons are the Nether equivalent of skeletons. They use stone swords and give players the &lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt; effect upon damaging them. They spawn in fortresses. If the player sees one, shoot it with a bow or trap it with blocks, or use a tactic similar to creepers \u2014 sprint hit them, then retreat a few blocks, and repeat. A shield is also very useful as it completely blocks their hits including the wither effect. Wither skeletons are exactly 2.4 blocks tall, but their pathfinding works as if they were over 2 blocks tall. This provides some safe tactics for combating them: the player just has to build a 2 blocks high space where it is safe to hide upon engaging a wither skeleton. If the player is too close and can't place a block in front of it fast enough, use an attack strategy similar to zombified piglins. They will rarely drop wither skeleton skulls used to make the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. A sword enchanted with looting will increase the chance to drop a skull up to 5.5%. The Smite enchantment can deal high damage to them, due to wither skeletons being an undead mob. They can spawn with pumpkins on Halloween, and can sometimes pick up armor and weapons, but they cannot pick up blocks or items. An efficient way of killing them will be making a wither skeleton farm by filling in large parts within the bounding box of the fortress with &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt;.\nPiglins.\nPiglins are hostile towards players if they are not wearing any &lt;a href=\"gold%20armor\"&gt;gold armor&lt;/a&gt;, break &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gilded%20blackstone\"&gt;gilded blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, or opening/breaking &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Chest\"&gt;Minecart with Chest&lt;/a&gt; nearby them. They use &lt;a href=\"golden%20sword\"&gt;golden sword&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, sometimes they spawn holding a crossbow similar to how &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s use, unlike zombified piglins, they sometimes spawn wearing Gold Armor, including enchants on both Swords and Armor. Most Piglins spawn in &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt; biomes and inside generated structures of &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;. Piglins do not drop anything except one of the items they hold or armor they wear. If the player gives a piglin a gold ingot, they will &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; with the player similar to trading with &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s. Players must be aware of piglins while either exploring crimson forest biome or a bastion remnant structure, but as long they wear at least one piece of gold armor on any armor slot, piglins will remain neutral. If a piglin is in the Overworld, they will turn into a zombified piglin. Piglins stay further away from &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and are always hostile to &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoglins.\nHoglins are hostile towards players when encountered, they can sometimes be hunted and killed by piglins. Hoglins only spawn at crimson forest biomes and they drop &lt;a href=\"raw%20porkchop\"&gt;raw porkchop&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Porkchop\"&gt;cooked variant&lt;/a&gt; if killed while on fire) and &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; upon killing them. They can attack and fling the player up in the air. Their weakness is &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus\"&gt;warped fungus&lt;/a&gt; as they run away from a distance, buying the player some time to run away if low on health or attempting to kill them. They can be bred with &lt;a href=\"crimson%20fungus\"&gt;crimson fungus&lt;/a&gt; to make a baby variant.\nZoglins.\nIf a hoglin enters the Overworld, it will become a zoglin, similar how a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin. Zoglins are hostile to every mob and players except creepers. Like hoglins, zoglins can attack and fling the player in the air. They drop Rotten Flesh upon death. Hoglins stay further away from zoglins if not engaged in combat. Zoglins are undead mobs, which can make the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment very useful.\nPiglin Brutes.\nPiglin brutes are much stronger variants of piglins that spawn with no armor but a &lt;a href=\"golden%20axe\"&gt;golden axe&lt;/a&gt;, they ignore gold armor on players and gold ingots dropped on the ground. They have HP and they only spawn in generated &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt; structures. Players will need to be more prepared if they are exploring inside the structure, enchanted diamond or netherite armor with Protection 4 enchantment is recommended along with a strong diamond or netherite sword with Sharpness 5. It may be best to bring a lava bucket or a flint and steel as they are not immune to fire or lava damage.\nThey have a small chance to drop their golden axe upon death.\nEnd mobs.\nShulkers.\nShulkers only appear in end cities. They shoot shulker bullets that follow players and make the player get the &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; effect for 10 seconds. This is an advantage for them to travel to the top rooms in the end city and end ship, but also a disadvantage if they are on top of the end city dungeon or higher, as the player levitates high into the air and can take fall damage and possibly die. However, this can be completely avoided by having Slow Falling status effect as the player will fall slowly and don't take any fall damage.\nShulkers often hide in their shells, which give them a large amount of resistance and make arrows shot at them bounce off. To kill shulkers effectively, the player can use a bow and time it with the shulker opening its shell, or take advantage of the levitation and hit them with a sword while floating up towards them. An effective way to kill shulkers in tight, tall spaces is using explosions from firework rockets.\nThe main strategy to defeating shulkers relies on protecting against the bullets they shoot. The player can &lt;a href=\"Punch\"&gt;Punch&lt;/a&gt; the bullet, which will break it. A &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; can block the bullet entirely. Since the bullet turns in right angles, the player can place blocks in the path of the bullet, which will break it. They have 30 health units. If a shulker shell is closed, bows will not work on them, but a sword with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; will work.\nEndermen.\nAlthough they are technically neutral, the player are sure to end up fighting an enderman sooner or later, either by unintentionally looking at one or trying to get &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite their somewhat unsettling appearance, enderman are damaged by fire, lava, water and rain. The player can safely look at an enderman if they have a pumpkin on the player's head (place it in the spot where the player would put a helmet). Alternatively, if the player sees it before it sees them, they can build a 2-block high ceiling, at least 3 by 3, or simply mine a 1x2x2 tunnel in a wall or hill (it is also a good idea to mine a block up or down to have space for jumping crits). Then, look at it until the player sees the anger animation, and quickly retreat under the shelter as it teleports to the player. Since enderman are three blocks tall, the player can then attack it without fear of reprisal. It should be highlighted that this ceiling must be made in materials that endermen cannot pick up, otherwise the enderman can disassemble the platform and reach the player.\nEmptying a bucket of water on the ground will hurt the enderman without it becoming hostile to the player, though it will teleport away. All types of swords are effective against one, though wood, stone, and gold swords may not deal enough damage to kill the enderman before it kills the player. Cacti will also damage endermen, so a wall of cacti also help them against endermen. \nHostile endermen will teleport away when the player closes in on them to strike. When this happens in a small underground space, the enderman may teleport into inaccessible caves or to the surface. They will not teleport back to the player unless they move to an area that has enough space for the enderman to teleport back. On the surface, an enderman's tendency to teleport away when the player is close enough to attack can be used to keep an attacking enderman at bay. The player can also change to third-person view by pressing ( + on Macs) to make sure the player can't be attacked from behind because of endermen having a tendency of teleporting behind them.\nAny block held by an enderman is dropped upon its death, making it possible to obtain grass blocks, mycelium and nylium without using &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne easy strategy to kill one is to hit one, then jump into a pond or lake. Stay in hitting range so the player can kill it. The enderman will not be able to jump into the water to attack the player. This is a good way for an unprepared player to kill one.\nAn even better way to deal with an enderman is to place a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; next to it. The enderman will enter the boat, and is unable to escape or teleport away. With the enderman trapped, the player can repeatedly jump and perfom &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s on the enderman, without worrying about retaliation. It is recommended to trap the enderman while it is still neutral, since its movements can become unpredictable when aggravated. \nYou can also safely kill an enderman from atop a 4 block tower. 3 blocks also work, but the enderman may randomly teleport away. This method is especially suited for the End.\nEndermen teleport to avoid being hit by arrows and splash potions and teleport to a new location upon being hit with a melee weapon. They will also teleport away from water, lava, rain, and sunlight, despite the fact that sunlight does not harm them. They will also teleport if on fire, so the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; enchantment is going to be more of an annoyance against them.\nA less exciting but effective way of killing an enderman is by staring below their torso, preferably attacking the 'feet' of its legs constantly with a sword or an axe. However, due to their tendency to teleport when the player closes in on them, the player should either stand still while attacking their legs or move backwards keeping their distance (should multiple endermen be in pursuit of the player). This can also be done by simply punching them (providing this strategy is done correctly) without taking a single point of damage, but could be considered tedious to some. \nThe player can wear a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; as the head armor piece in order to stop endermen from turning hostile when the player look at them. If they hit an enderman with any kind of sword while doing this, the enderman will not teleport away from them, allowing the player to kill it safely.\nEndermen can also spawn in the &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; biome in the Nether.\nBosses.\nEnder Dragons.\nEnder dragons spawn naturally (when the player enters the End the first time) or can be respawned with 4 end crystals on the exit portal and have extremely high health (100 hearts). They can only be found legitimately in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. Always craft at least some diamond &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and bring at least a diamond sword, as well as a Power V and Infinity bow. Instead of bringing a helmet, bring a pumpkin instead, as there are lots of &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; and the pumpkin will stop them from becoming hostile when looked at. Also, bring at least 5 golden apples, at least three extended invisibility potions, and a water bucket or a hay bale. A tactic to fight one is to stock up on ladders, as there are obsidian pillars with &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on top. However, when the end crystals are destroyed they blow up, and the diameter of the explosion is larger than the pillar, causing the player to fall off. It would be a better idea to mine lots and lots of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; so that the player can make their own pillars and shoot the end crystals from a distance. That way, the player won't fall off and die. Coming unprepared will most likely result in their death (if the player dies in the End, they would spawn like normal in their default spawn point).\nThe Ender Dragon will approach the player when they are at the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; frame, allowing successful melee attacks, as the Ender Dragon fires acid at the player. When the Ender Dragon is killed, it plays a unique death animation and drops an exit portal. When the player jumps in, the credits appear. The portal also has a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; on the top, which can be used to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Breaking%20bedrock\"&gt;break bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be collected if the player put a piston on one side of the egg and any block on the other. Then, activate the piston and the dragon egg drops. It's a great way to show off to your friends that you have killed the Ender Dragon.\nWithers.\nWithers are boss mobs that can be summoned by making a \"T\" shape with &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and placing 3 wither skeleton skulls on top. They have 150 hearts of health (300 in Bedrock Edition) and shoot black or blue skulls that give the Wither effect and do as much damage as a ghast fireball, the blue skulls are also able to destroy any block except bedrock, barriers and end portal frames. So when spawning the wither make sure the player is in a confined space (made with obsidian if being done in survival) with lots of effective potions drank to kill the wither quicker. Upon summoning one, drink a potion of &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, a potion of &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, a potion of &lt;a href=\"Swiftness\"&gt;Swiftness&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe put a &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; in your off-hand. When the wither has gotten up to max HP in a few seconds the Wither will gain health and cause a massive explosion. A good thing to do is to shoot it with arrows until down to 75 hearts of health and then kill it quickly with a sword to end the battle. , after the wither's health reaches 150 hearts (half health), it will explode again and spawn 4 wither skeletons, then the wither can use dash attacks, which can be dangerous. The wither drops 1 &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to make a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;. Enchanted diamond or netherite swords especially smite and diamond or netherite armor is recommended.\nNeutral mobs.\nOverworld mobs.\nWolves.\nWolves are neutral mobs that will become hostile should players attack them directly. If players accidentally hit a wolf, they and any other wolves nearby will become hostile. They will remain hostile until the player escapes, or they die, similar to zombified piglins. Try and escape them by tunneling away from them, sealing the entrance (and bring &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es so the player will be able to see) or combat them with a stone sword or higher while sprinting backward. An extremely effective method is building a two-block pillar, and slowly dispatching the wolves. Wolves can be tamed by feeding them bones until hearts float off of them, tamed wolves will display a red collar. Bones can be obtained by killing skeletons as a drop.\nSpiders.\nSpiders can be a nuisance if handled incorrectly. They are one of the monsters that are 1 block high, and as such, they will be able to sneak into the player's house if a hole is sufficiently large for them. However, spiders are also 2 blocks wide, so a 1\u00d71 hole will not let them pass. Spiders have a special feature in which they can climb blocks. If players hear spider noises but can't see one, usually they are on top of their house. In the daytime, spiders will become neutral \u2014 they will only attack players if they attack them (but if they were hostile towards players during the night, they will still stay hostile). Also, even in their neutral state, if players try to sleep in a bed the usual \"You can't sleep there are monsters nearby\" message appears.\nHowever, they can ambush players in the daytime if players exit their house when one is on their roof, attacking their back as they walk away from their house. Spiders have a jump attack, and so it is best to swing a sword while walking backwards to avoid most damage. During the day, they can be killed by lava or flint and steel without becoming hostile to the player. In Survival, a spider becomes neutral towards the player if the light level around them is around 12. One can also kill spiders by pillar jumping, creating a ledge around the pillar, bombing the spiders with snowballs, and watching them climb and fall.\nSpiders drop 0\u20132 &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, and have a chance to drop a &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;. String is useful stuff, and precious in the beginning game as it is needed for &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s. It can also be crafted into &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; (12 string makes enough for a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;), and it can be placed in the environment as &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt;.\nCave spiders.\nCave spiders only appear in &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s underground, but are a pain to deal with. Not only are they smaller than a regular &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they can fit through 1\u00d71 holes, but also their bite will &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; the player (except on Easy and Peaceful difficulty). On Normal difficulty, the Poison effect lasts for 6 seconds if not countered by drinking a bucket of &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;. On Hard, the Poison effects will last for a deadly 15 seconds. Keep in mind that the poison effect on Hard can deal 10 (5 hearts) of damage if not treated with said milk, and will eventually be the ultimate cause of player deaths in the mineshafts from the poison leaving only 1 health left on the player. Cave spider spawners are often difficult to take out, due to their location being surrounded by &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s. If the player runs across a cave spider spawner, make sure the player has &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; to cut the cobwebs quickly (a sword will be used up quickly by this). Another great option would be a bucket of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Players can also tunnel under the floor to reach them, then mine upwards and break the spawner. Neither type of spider is affected by the cobweb slowing effect, so be aware that they cannot get stuck as other mobs and entities can. These mobs are easier to defeated using bane of arthropods enchantment to inflict cave spider with &lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpider jockeys.\nThese are rare, they have chance to spawn in place of a regular spider and from a spider spawn egg in Creative mode. It is also highly fatal if confronted head-on, as the spider will pounce and climb to the player, while the skeleton shoots them with arrows. On Hard difficulty, a spider jockey deals a total of 5.5 hearts of damage if attacked head-on. If the spider climbs into an area that is only one block high, the skeleton will suffocate.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; is killed by the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, the skeleton will revert normal and continue to attack normally and vice versa.\nWolves are a messy way to combat them because the wolf will attack the mob who last attacked it, so it may alternate from attacking the spider to attacking the skeleton, etc.\nThe player can attack spider jockeys with a bow outside of the mobs' search range. Be sure that the player does not hit the spider until they have killed the skeleton.\nIf a spider jockey spots the player from a high place, the skeleton may hurt the spider trying to shoot at the player, causing the spider to attack the skeleton, provoking a fight between them. The player can wait until one of the mobs dies so they will have to deal with a single mob or use the confusion to climb up and fight the already damaged spider jockey to get both loots. Be careful, as they could still be pushed off.\nThe spider jockey also has other variants, such as one where the spider is being ridden by a &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;. These variants can only spawn in snowy biomes and are more dangerous than their normal counterparts, due to stray arrows giving players slowness, while the spider tries to approach the player.\nThe wither spider jockey also another spider jockey variants which the rider is wither skeletons, but these mobs are unused as a spider cannot spawn naturally in the Nether, it's safer to attack these mobs from distance, due to wither skeletons only using melee attacks.\n, the spider jockey also has another variant, the cave spider jockey. Cave spider jockeys are skeletons riding cave spiders, which means it can only be found in a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;. It is mostly the same as regular spider jockey except it can move through 1x1 gaps and it's &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;ous.\nStray cave spider jockey is the rarest spider jockey variants , due it can only spawn from mineshaft with spawner viewed by sky in snowy biomes; such as ravine in snowy biomes that expose mineshaft spawner (snowy biomes also rare biome), the condition is very rarely met and if players found one like this, cave spider jockey only has 1% chance to spawn and 20% chance the rider will be normal skeleton, so the player is unlikely to find this mob. If the player encounters one, make sure to have milk as a stray can give slowness that makes the player difficult to escape while cave spider moves toward the player and inflict poison.\nThe last variant of the spider jockey is the wither cave spider jockey, but this is also an unused mob. The combination of wither skeleton and cave spider makes combating this mob using melee attacks too risky as the player will get both the wither and the poison effect.\nDrowned.\nActing the same as zombies, Drowned instead spawn in oceans, rivers and &lt;a href=\"underwater%20ruins\"&gt;underwater ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Normal zombies can also drown in water and be converted into drowned after 30 seconds. They are easy to kill like normal zombies, except if a drowned mob spawns holding a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;, which can be dangerous if players are not protected with armor. It's recommended to wear armor with &lt;a href=\"Projectile%20Protection\"&gt;Projectile Protection&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo avoid getting killed by a drowned holding a trident, it's best to stay away from them if players do not have any armor, as they do when thrown and in melee. Attempting to kill a drowned with no armor results in a high chances of dying. However, they only attack players during the daytime if they are in water and avoid attacking the player while out of the water to prevent themselves from being burned.\n, drowned stop using ranged attacks when the player is 3 blocks or less away from the drowned, so the player can easily prevent drowned from throwing the trident by moving in as close as possible and defeating it.\nIron golems.\n, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s containing 10 or more &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s and at least 21 houses (counted as beds), while , iron golems spawn when villagers gossip about golems. They do massive damage and have high health ( health points), and they throw players into the air, doing even more damage when they land, so it is advised to use a diamond sword or a very highly enchanted iron sword to engage them. The player can also use cactus to kill it, if they can get the iron golem to walk into the cactus either by provoking it or placing the cactus in its path. If they can figure out which area of the village spawns iron golems, an iron/poppy farm can be created. Bows are effective, as iron golems are extremely deadly at hand-to-hand combat. However, they have a lot of health, so attacks will take pretty long. Alternatively, if the player has 5 or so tamed wolves, hit the golem and run away. The dogs will see it as hostile and finish the job. The player is unlikely to lose more than one or two.\nAnother way to easily kill iron golems is to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar up&lt;/a&gt; 3 or 4 blocks tall, away from any nearby blocks the golem could stand on to reach you, and attack while out of reach. Note: the golem might still knock you off a 3 block tower. If you see him moving towards you along the side of the pillar, move to the farthest edge away from him. A 4 block tower is completely safe, but the time window for a critical attack is very small, so it will take longer to kill the golem.\nAnother even easier way is to aggro a golem, then run into a nearby house, stand just beyond the door frame and jump crit him to death. Careful as he may still hit you if you move too close.\nPolar bears.\nWhen alone, polar bears are neutral in that they will attack the player if they are attacked, but they can also be immediately hostile when approached if a polar bear cub is nearby. If the cub is attacked, any adults in a 41 block cuboid area will come to its defense. Attacking the adult first when a cub is nearby will cause all adults in a 21 block cuboid to attack the player. Cubs are passive in any situation. \nPolar bears have 15 hearts, and do 4 damage on Easy, 6 on Normal, and 9 on Hard. They attack by rearing up on their back legs and smashing down with their front legs. This attack can sometimes miss or be dodged if the players is moving in circles or irregular movements. Iron gear or better makes dealing with them in low numbers trivial, but when in large groups (which is fairly uncommon) they can quickly overwhelm the player. The player can create a 3 block tall pillar to easily dispatch of any hostile adults.\nPolar bears have a much faster swimming speed than the player, so it is recommended to not engage polar bears in water if possible.\nLlamas.\nLlamas will attack the player if provoked by spitting at them for half a heart of damage one time, after which they become neutral again. They can have between 15 and 30 health points. Their extremely low damage and lack of pack mentality basically nullifies them as a threat to any player with weapons or armor of any level. However, if the player happens to find themselves completely unarmed and unprotected against a llama with half a heart of health left, its spit can be dodged by sprinting sideways to the llama.\nTrader Llamas.\nIf the player accidentally hits a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;, the trader's llama will become angry and spit at the player. The player can dodge attack or make 2 trader llama attack each other by hide behind one of the llamas. However, if the wandering trader isn't present, hitting trader llamas will cause them to act like a passive mob and run away. When killed it can drop a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, but only if the wandering trader is holding them.\nDolphins.\nIf the player accidentally hits a dolphin, they will be attacked by multiple dolphins, and they can avoid them by swimming to the surface and get out of water. When the player see a dolphin on land trying to hurt the player, they can kill them safely as their movement is much slower on land, and since dolphins are aquatic mobs, they are affected by &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nPandas.\nPandas behave like llamas in which if the player attacks them, they will panic and then attack the player back once. Lazy pandas are the slowest, weak pandas only have 10 health, worried pandas, despite normally avoiding players, will panic then try to attack the player without avoiding them. However, if the player hits an aggressive panda, it will attack them until death. Aggressive pandas also becomes angry if a nearby panda is attacked. It deals 6 HP and has 20 HP. Pandas drop &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;.\nBees.\nBees act similar to zombified piglins when provoked, their eyes turned red and chase the player slowly. They attack with their stinger; but only once, and after they have stung the player and do not have their stinger for about a minute, the bees die. Bees give the player the &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; effect if the difficulty is on either normal or hard. Bees can also turn aggressive if the player uses a &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt; on a honey level 5 to collect a &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;, uses &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; on a honey level 5 to collect &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;, or breaks their nest or &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; regardless if an axe has &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; enchantment or not during the day if multiple bees are nearby. However, bees will not attack the player if there is a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; underneath its beehive and acts as a safe way to collect honey bottles and honeycombs. It's much more effective to move their nest or beehive location at night since they are not active during the night.\nNether mobs.\nThere is currently only 1 neutral mob in the Nether: the &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;\nZombified piglins.\nZombified piglins are neutral mobs. This means that they are not naturally hostile, but will retaliate if attacked, just like wolves. These mobs will attack in medium-large groups and unprepared players should be cautious of their strength in numbers.\nTo an unprepared or careless player, a charging group of zombified piglins can mean a swift death, but the fight becomes easier after the player can recognize how they behave and attack. Zombified piglins attack with a mob mentality. If the player attack one of them they will all join in and attempt to kill them. As soon as one zombified piglin is attacked, all of the others within a 32 block radius become hostile and will charge the player if they are in sight range (16 blocks). Zombified piglins will notice attacks from behind walls and at different heights. Their hostile status lasts between 20\u201340 seconds since the last attack by the player, so taking cover and waiting can be used, but it is better to bunker down (in a narrow cave/choke point, for example) and dispatch them safely. The hostility radius is centered around each zombified piglin that is attacked, not the player. This means that the player can attack a far-away zombified piglin with a bow without nearby zombie piglins becoming hostile (although this is not suggested). Note also any zombified piglins between 17 and 32 blocks will continue to wander as normal unless the player comes within 16 blocks of them (or \"vice versa\"), upon which they will rush them (assuming they haven't calmed down by then), but when they defend themselves, any zombified piglin within a \"new\" 32-block radius will be angered.\nThey carry a golden sword, and so they do quite a bit more damage than a zombie. On Hard difficulty they will do HP of damage. Compared to the zombies that deals HP damage on Hard difficulty, there is a considerable difference. They do, however, share zombies' natural armor (8% damage negation). Zombified piglins always spawn with a golden sword. They will never spawn with armor pieces on them (chestplates, helmets, etc.), but their sword may be enchanted. If items are dropped near them, they will pick up the items. Armor and swords will be automatically equipped.\nThe easiest way to kill a zombified piglin is in one hit, as they will not be aggravated if another zombified piglin is killed in one hit. This can be achieved with Strength II and a Diamond sword, or a Diamond sword with Sharpness III and Strength I.\nAnother easy way to kill zombified piglins is to build a 2-block-high tower next to one by pillar jumping. Make sure the zombified piglins can't jump onto the tower. Then hit the zombified piglins. All other zombie piglins will be angered, and come rushing towards the player, however, they can't reach the player. Now dispose of them. When done, check to see if other zombified piglins are coming. Then, destroy the tower. Be careful of baby zombified piglins because they are small and hard to see in all those adult zombified piglins, and can really surprise players.\nUtility mobs.\nSnow golems.\nAllied:\nDespite dealing no damage, the snow golem's use in combat is not to be underestimated. Defensively, they can either knock enemies away from the player's base, or lure them into a trap. They are very cheap to make, and offensively, they can distract mobs, making them much easier for players to kill, as after being hit by a snowball, they will ignore the player to attack the golem. This allows players to make easy kills on most mobs. They also alert them if a mob approaches from behind, as well as slowing it. If players need to retreat, place a snow golem or two to occupy incoming mobs, buying them plenty of time to escape or let their health regenerate. Unfortunately, they do not attack creepers, so players may want to take a cat with them if possible.\nHostile:\nWhile snow golems can be useful for defending off other mobs, they are little threat to a player. They deal no damage, but they do deal Knockback and wear down armor, which can be dangerous in certain situations, such as fighting near a drop-off. Strafing away from their snowballs is fairly easy from a distance, but is difficult up close.\nIron golems.\nAllied:\nAfter boss mobs, the iron golem is the most powerful mob in the game (they have HP) and can kill most mobs in one or two hits. However, it is also extremely expensive to build, requiring 36 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, and apart from creating it, the player has no control over it. It also takes longer to build than a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;, making it less useful as a last resort. In general, it's a better idea to use wolves instead, as they are much easier to acquire. However, an iron golem has the advantage that it can attack where the player is far away or inattentive, making them useful in mob traps and base defending. It may also be useful when the player is in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and fighting a &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. They are especially useful because they do not take fall damage and cannot be knocked back.\nHostile:\nHostile iron golems are one of the most dangerous threats in the game. They have the highest base damage in the game, and, aside from boss mobs, is tied for the most health in the game with the Ravager at . Add on the fact that they take no Knockback, yet deal massive Knockback to the player, taking one down requires end-game gear if they are faced head on. The situation the player is most likely to anger an iron golem is in a village, where they attack a player who attacks a villager, or the golem itself. If this is the case, it is best to just run away, as depending on how much damage was done to the villagers, the golem may become passive again. If the player wants to fight the golem, then enchanted diamond/netherite gear is recommended, as well as a shield to block the golem's attacks. Golden apples and potions can also help. Alternatively, if the player uses a bow from afar, the golem can be killed without even seeing the player. However, note that killing a village's iron golem will lower the player's reputation there, causing future iron golems to become hostile automatically. \nOther players.\nThe hardest enemy to defeat, all other players have HP (10 hearts). If the player is engaged in a duel, be sure to be prepared with at least iron tier armor and weapons as their opponent will make quick work of them, especially if they are unprepared/have better weapons than you. It will be great if they could get some help, either from allied players, tamed wolves, iron golems, and/or snow golems. Engaging other players may possibly be the most challenging fights in Minecraft, depending on the player and the other's skill. Observe battle tactics and use them to their advantage. Use negative splash/lingering potions and flint-and-steel if allowed. When the opponent attempts to spam them with sword hits, block with a shield at first, then backpedal and fire several arrows from an enchanted bow. Then, sprint-hit or hit critically to them to finish them off. A fail-safe is to drop an anvil on them from 24 or more blocks high, which will kill them.\nOther Player's Tamed Wolves.\nWhen players are attacked by another player's wolves, just use same strategy to defeat wild wolves. A tamed wolf has 20 health and 4 attack damage, so they are a bit harder to kill because of their increased stats and that players can tame multiple wolves.\nIf you are surrounded, run away and try to get as many blocks in-between you and them as possible.\nThe equipment.\nSword.\nThe primary weapon is the most versatile to use. A sword's damage varies on material and a rule of thumb is the rarer the material, the stronger the sword (with the exception of gold). A sword deals far more damage than by hand, and will greatly increase a player's chance of survival upon being faced with hostile mobs. Even the wooden sword, the lowest tier of sword, deals four times as much damage as the fist (and each further increase in material increases the damage of the sword by half a heart). Swords may also deal sweeping attacks capable of splash damage when the attack bar is full, making short work of grouped mobs. A sword, like many of the weapons mentioned here, has a limited amount of uses, and disappears when its uses reach zero. Again, the higher tier the sword is, the more uses it has, and each tier approximately doubles the uses that a sword possesses, apart from the diamond, which has more than 5 times the number of uses as iron. Enchanting the sword can also greatly increase its power.\nAxe.\nThe axe\u2019s and usefulness varies between the two versions of \"Minecraft\".\nIn \"Java Edition\", axes deal much higher damage(a wooden axe deals the same damage as a diamond sword) compared to swords and have the ability to momentarily disable &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s. However, they also have a 2x slower attack speed cooldown. Also, axes are unable to deal sweeping attacks, making them less effective than swords against multiple mobs.\nIn Bedrock Edition, axes deal half a heart less damage than their sword counterpart and do not disable shields. \nIn both versions, axes cannot be enchanted with Fire Aspect and cost 1 more of the material to make than the sword.\nAxes use 2 durability every time it is used as a weapon, so they have much lower lifetime damage compared to swords.\nOverall, the usefulness of an axe depends on your version. In Java Edition, even though the damage is higher, the sword of the same material does more Damage Per Second (DPS). However, axes can be used to deal more damage in a single blow, and are useful in certain cases, like starting out in a survival world, or in player-versus-player (PvP) combat. In Bedrock Edition, axes are completely inferior to the sword, because they do 1 less damage than a sword of the same material and have no benefits.\nTrident.\nIt is a good weapon, but rare to obtain, which can be thrown or used in melee. The &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; can be thrown as a ranged attack but unless it has been enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt;, the player will have to retrieve it in order to use it again. When used as a melee weapon the damage depends on the version. In \"Java Edition\", it does about the same damage as an axe but has a lesser attack cooldown. In Bedrock Edition, it does the same damage as a netherite sword.\nTools.\nWhen a player is out performing tasks in the world, they might not have a sword/axe or set a sword/axe in their hotbar. &lt;a href=\"Shovel\"&gt;Shovel&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s can also be used to deal damage when a sword or axe cannot be drawn. Different tools and weapons have different attack strength and attack speed. However most tools apart from swords or axes are highly inefficient when combating mobs and should be used only as a last resort.\nBow.\nThe bow is the easiest to use, and most widely employed ranged weapon in the game. However, it requires &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s as ammunition. Enchanting a bow with &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; can sidestep the ammunition problem, as wielding one arrow is enough for infinite shots, limited only by the weapon's &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. Infinity can also prevent one's opponents from picking up the missed arrows to use as ammunition of their own. Other bow enchantments will greatly enhance the bow's attacking power, allowing it to deal more than ten hearts per shot.\nAlthough bows are very useful weapons in most land combat situations, they do not work well in water or lava. When shot through fluids, arrows will drop downwards after traveling 4 blocks from the player, making underwater archery useless and sometimes dangerous (players can be hit by their own arrows).\nThis makes bows useful for ranged fights, if you are fighting a mob thats not near you.\nCrossbow.\nThe crossbow is similar to the bow, but more powerful, and shoots arrows with more velocity, though it has a longer charge time. It requires arrows or firework rockets as ammunition. Enchanting a crossbow with &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Charge\"&gt;Quick Charge&lt;/a&gt; can sidestep the reload time problem, as charging crossbows with Quick Charge III is faster than fully charging a bow. Other enchantments which greatly enhance the crossbow are &lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt;, which are useful for attacking multiple enemies. Although crossbows can't be enchanted with Power, Multishot can help when the player shoots as close as possible, so the opponent will get hit by 3 arrows at once with each arrow dealing 6-11 damage. Even though the crossbow cannot be enchanted with Infinity, Multishot fires 3 arrows, but only one can be picked up, so as long as only two arrows hit enemies, the player can still retrieve the third arrow (it also works for tipped arrows as well). The same goes for the Piercing enchantment: as long as an arrow or tipped arrow passes through mobs, the player may retrieve it from where it lands.\nThe crossbow can also use &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s as ammunition. Firework stars with an explosion effect deal 5-6 damage with 1-2 additional damage per an extra &lt;a href=\"firework%20star\"&gt;firework star&lt;/a&gt;, and up to 7 firework stars can be used. The mean firework rocket damage ranges between 11-18, which deals splash area and can damage endermen and the wither during its projectile armor phase. Additionally, each firework star can be dyed (with a large ball effect), which may obscure another player's vision (due to the particles color). However, firework rockets are much harder to use in \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" as they don't explode immediately upon impact with mobs or blocks, severely reducing their effectiveness in combat. They can also be expensive, requiring from to pieces of &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; per rocket.\nDue to the crossbow's ability to keep an arrow loaded whether it's held in hand or kept in the inventory, the player can have 9 hotbar slots full of loaded crossbows and can do rapid shooting. With each crossbow having the Multishot enchantment, it will shoot even more arrows, which is very useful when shooting multiple crowded mobs, or a boss mob. This also works with firework rockets.\nAlthough crossbows are very useful weapons in most land combat situations, they do not work well in water or lava. When shot through fluids, arrows will drop downwards after traveling 4 blocks from the player, making underwater archery useless.\nBucket.\nThe bucket can be filled with either &lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Bucket\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Milk%20Bucket\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; to become a powerful weapon in the game. It does not have &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore can be used infinite times. A bucket is primarily used as a defensive weapon against approaching mobs, as the player must place the contents of it between the mob and themselves for it to be effective. A bucket can also be filled with milk which removes all &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWater bucket.\nA water bucket can be used to reduce the speed of approaching mobs, leaving them highly vulnerable to arrow fire and sword damage. Combining this with height, a player can hold off hordes of mobs with little effort. A water bucket provides advantages over the lava bucket in the fact that it is safe to use, is easily removable, and also doubles as a fire extinguisher should the player be set alight. However, it cannot be used in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Also, by using traps it is possible to drown an opponent. For drowning players it is best to encase the trap in obsidian. It also helps that blocks are harder to break underwater.\nA water bucket also has the added benefit of being guaranteed protection from &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, provided the player is standing in the water.\nLava bucket.\nA lava bucket is capable of causing an immense amount of damage to multiple mobs in addition to providing light and greatly hindering mob movement, even more so than water. Any mobs (without fire resistance) that come into contact with lava will suffer 2 whole hearts of constant burn damage every half-second for a total of 4 hearts of damage per second. In addition to that, they will also be set on fire, suffering additional burn damage over time even after leaving the lava. The lava bucket is especially dangerous in confined spaces where it can be used to block off a pathway, preventing most mobs from reaching the user. One should be very careful, however, about where they place lava as that extreme damage figure mentioned above also applies to players.\nLava buckets are almost completely worthless against all nether mobs \u2014 their only use is to slow down land-based mobs such as the zombified piglin or the magma cube in the same way that a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; is used. Also, the player should note that lava destroys any drops that the mobs would otherwise give, so lava should only be used for an outright kill.\nFurthermore, with the bow enchantment update which gives flaming arrows the ability to do burn damage, the lava bucket can be used to place a block of lava and fire arrows through it. The best method is to create a two-block high stack of cheap blocks (dirt or cobblestone is recommended, do not use flammable blocks), which player place the block of lava upon at the top, thereafter the player remove the two blocks under the lava source block creating a lava wall/pile of sorts. The player can now shoot arrows through the wall against enemies which will set them alight. This method is slow, and suited for long-range combat, but is useful for players who do not have access to an enchantment table. This method is also able to ignite enemy TNT at a distance when not equipped with a flame bow.\nTNT.\nAs an explosive, &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; is an incredibly powerful weapon, dealing enough damage to instantly kill most mobs caught in the blast radius and creating a sizable crater, making the area difficult to navigate for future mobs. Because TNT has a rather lengthy fuse and can be activated with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, either directly or through a &lt;a href=\"Dispenser\"&gt;dispensed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;, it is most effective as a trap, allowing players to dispatch an enemy indirectly. But because TNT does just as much damage to the player, it is rather dangerous to use in direct combat unless they can get away from the primed TNT faster than their foes can. In addition, TNT is expensive to make, so using an alternative explosive method in this situation, such as a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; while in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, is preferred.\nBed / respawn anchor.\nPut enemies to bed and lay them to rest. If the player happen to be fighting in the Nether or the End and are about to die, one of the most cruel and ironic ways to kill the enemies is to take them down with the player as they die by using a bed. Simply equip the bed, place it, click on it and it will instantly explode, killing just about anything within a 5 to 7 block radius. In terms of blast force, the bed is actually more powerful than TNT, which makes it that much deadlier and harder to survive. One major downside is that the player have to click on the bed to detonate it which means they will have to be very close to it in order to do it and since the detonation is instant, players are very likely going to kill the player when using a bed as a weapon in the Nether. As a result, aside from taking on the role of a crazy suicide bomber or tricking the opponents into accidentally detonating the bed for the player, they're better off using the bed as a last-ditch final attack to take an opponent with the player into death. However, if you place a block between you and the bed, then click on it, the bed will do little damage to you. \nThe bed can also deal a significant amount of damage to the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, especially if it explodes close to the dragon's head.\nEnd crystal.\nThis is an even more powerful weapon that can kill a player in Protection IV armor quickly. Simply place down a block of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, place the end crystal on top, and shoot it/hit it. Be aware that in order to deal the maxium damage from the end crystal, your opponent must be in the same y level as the crystal or higher. You can do this by hitting them and then place and destroy the crystal quickly or just wait for them to be on a higher y levels than you. Unfortunately end crystals are expensive to craft, and can only be placed on obsidian or &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlint and steel / fire charge.\nFlint and steel is a unique weapon, as players can set a block of fire, and while it burns, any mob that comes into contact with it will catch fire, suffering burn damage over time. This can be very useful when being chased by multiple mobs, as it will weaken all or most of them down to the point where a sword hit or two will be enough to kill them. However, there are several downsides to this method. First of all, mobs may elude the fire by pure luck, requiring another light. Second of all, if the player are in a confined space, circling to avoid mobs, they could potentially set the player on fire by accident. Third, burning mobs can also set themselves on fire when through melee attacks. Lastly, it can take a long time for the mob to die, enough time for more mobs to join the party. A fast player could make a short 1-block netherrack wall and light the top. Mobs would have to jump and they would take damage instantly or over time. Particularly effective with a sword with the Knockback enchantment.\nSolid blocks.\nBlocks - the central element of the game - can become powerful tools of defense when used in the hands of skilled players. They can be used to elevate the player quickly from the ground by pillar jumping, block pathways to stop approaching hostile mobs, cut line-of-sight to prevent hostile mobs from noticing or attacking, or shield the player from explosions. \nGood candidates include &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. All of which are cheap, available in large quantities, can be quickly broken with basic tools, and are not affected by fire or gravity. When in areas without fire hazards, &lt;a href=\"plank\"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; can also be considered.\nSand or gravel.\nSand or gravel aren't weapons in true sense, but they can be used to kill mobs. Best use is in caves \u2014 when the player are on a high place and the player have a mob directly below, they can place that block on a wall near where they are standing; the block will fall, and with right aim, it will fall on the mob, and thus suffocate it. However, killing with this weapon doesn't yield any experience, but that block will make the mob stuck, and the player can finish them with the sword.\nCactus.\nCacti can be used to make effective traps against mobs. When in contact with the block, any mob (including the player) will lose half a heart every half seconds, however, mobs may avoid them, but if the player wants to make a trap, the player can place three cacti plants, two blocks high, in a V format. The player might want to lure them nearby (around 10 blocks far from the trap) and hide in the opposite side, where they will try pursue players but will not be able to reach.\nCobwebs.\n&lt;a href=\"Cobweb\"&gt;Cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to greatly impair enemy movement and makes any mobs stuck in it easier to hit. Players can acquire cobwebs from &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; libraries, &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basements, &lt;a href=\"abandoned%20village\"&gt;abandoned village&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; spider rooms. If players are running away or an enemy is approaching, they can place cobwebs in their path. Even if they don't run into it, they will still have to waste precious time going around and there is also the chance of them accidentally stepping into it while fighting players. Furthermore, intentionally placing and jumping into cobwebs may be a viable strategy, as players can repeatedly perform &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s with melee weapons so long as all other criteria is met. \nAnd not only that, but you can trap enemies with cobwebs. When the enemy is standing still, quickly block them into a box, and put cobwebs in there. Then you may kill them. And if it is a player, they will also need to break out.\nSnowball.\nSnowballs may seem a useless weapon at first, as they deal no damage against mobs other than blazes. They have their use however because of their two important traits. First, they push a mob backwards just as any hit does even despite the lack of damage. Then, unlike arrows snowballs can be fired as quickly as the player can right-click. This allows them to be used to keep even large amounts of approaching mobs at bay with relative ease or to quickly interrupt a mob's attack when necessary. This speed combined with the fact that snow is abundant in certain biomes, renewable and easily gathered makes it a cheaply obtained and useful long or short-range option, even after a bow has been located.\nNot only that, but you can get a cool combo with snowballs. Shoot the snowball, and when the enemy is in the air, start comboing them.\nDispenser.\nDispensers can be loaded with a wide variety of ammunition, such as arrows, fire charges, snowballs, eggs and potions and will fire said items when activated by redstone. Dispensers are good for traps, for players and mobs. Loading a dispenser with arrows or fire charges and linking it to a (fast-cycling) redstone clock can turn it into a full-auto machine gun turret with enough firepower to level just about any mob that happens to be in front of it.\nArrows: Will be fired is a similar fashion to a skeleton's arrows with a slight inaccuracy, dealing 1.5 hearts of damage per shot. Simply right-click the dispenser, and load the arrows into the nine-grid squares. A dispenser can be loaded with up to 9 stacks of arrows. Dispensers can also be loaded with tipped arrows which will apply status effects to whatever mob they hit in addition to the contact damage.\nFire charge: A dispenser loaded with fire charges will shoot them out as fireballs like a Blaze would, dealing both contact damage as well as setting mobs on fire, dealing additional damage over time. One should be careful not to use fire charges near anything flammable as the fireballs will start random fires upon hitting surfaces and can cause any flammable blocks nearby to catch fire.\nFireworks: A dispenser loaded with Firework rockets will launch the rockets in the direction the dispenser is facing. This allows the player to launch firework rockets sideways and presents them with a high customization type of ammunition. A firework rocket will, upon exploding deal 5\u20136 hearts of damage for first firework star loaded into it and 1\u20132 for each extra fireworks stars. All firework stars go off simultaneously when the rocket detonates and up to 7 firework stars can be used per rocket, making a max-payload rocket deal a whopping 11-18 hearts of damage upon exploding. Alongside firework stars, the player can also add more gunpowder to the rocket to extend its range and fuse length, allowing the player to time it to detonate after traveling a certain distance. Up to three gunpowder can be used but be aware that adding more gunpowder will reduce the amount of fireworks stars that can be added and vice versa.\nSnowballs/eggs: Can be used to Knockback mobs, for defense or offense (where the mobs will be knocked towards is a hole). Snowballs will do nothing but throw them back (but will damage blazes), but eggs may spawn chickens. If the player are in a tundra biome, those surely will be the easier to make, as they can make snowballs.\nTrident: can be used for underwater dispenser, since tridents deal high damage, and travel fast regardless on land or underwater, a trident with the &lt;a href=\"riptide\"&gt;riptide&lt;/a&gt; enchantment loaded in dispenser still can be thrown, and one enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; won't come back to dispenser, also &lt;a href=\"channeling\"&gt;channeling&lt;/a&gt; still works with a dispenser.\nSplash potion/Lingering Potion: A dispenser loaded with potions can be used for a multitude of purposes. It can be loaded with harmful potions (Poison, Instant Damage, Slowness, Weakness, etc\u2026) and used as a weapon against enemies or it can be loaded with beneficial potions (Healing, Regeneration, Speed, Strength etc\u2026) and used to apply positive status effects on oneself in the middle of a fight. Just be careful of what the dispenser is loaded with when using it so as to not accidentally hit the player with bad status effects or accidentally give the enemies a good status effect.\nDispense water: Dispensing water on the target can be used to push them off ledges or into other hazards but is otherwise not very efficient: it is much simpler to get close and place the water by the player. Dispense water only when the target is far away from where the player is standing, yet players want to slow them down.\nDispense lava: A dispenser loaded with a lava bucket can act as a powerful area denial tool as it creates an extremely harmful hazard that will make short work of any mob that runs into it. Dispensing lava to attack the foes is slightly more efficient than placing it as the dispenser allows the player to maintain a safe distance between the player and the lava to avoid burning themselves and the dispenser can also suck up the lava without problems, making it a much safer alternative to placing lava by hand.\nSplash potion.\nSplash potions can be a lot of help to hinder their foe or dealing damage, but use them sparingly. Remember that there is a big difference between throwing a splash potion of damage at one mob than at a group of mobs. Another good strategy is to know some potions. Splash potions of Healing or Regeneration can let you get closer to zombies or zombie pigmen and receive the Healing or Regeneration boost while damaging your target. Splash potions that have increased time make for hit and run tactics, a good strategy if the player are low on health. If they are being chased by a group of hostile mobs and you have a splash potion of Instant damage, remember that you still take damage from splash potions. Use the Knockback from the potion to take shortcuts or get over walls two blocks high.\nLingering potion.\nLingering potions can be used to hinder enemies or deal damage, but use them sparingly. Lingering potions of Healing or Regeneration can let you get closer to zombies or zombie pigmen and receive the Healing or Regeneration boost while damaging your target. Lingering potions that have increased time make for hit and run tactics, a good strategy if you are low on health. If you are being chased by a group of hostile mobs and you have a Lingering potion of Instant damage, remember that you still can take damage from the area of effect cloud.\nFishing rod.\nFishing rods are not a weapon in the traditional sense, but useful nonetheless. Their ability to grab and draw in mobs is useful to keep passive mobs from running away when hit, or to draw hostile mobs into traps or hazards. Players even use them on other players, to bring the enemy closer to you, or freeze them and have a chance to get a combo. Additionally, reeling in a mob while standing high above it can launch it quite far into the air, causing it to take fall damage on the way back down. To maximize effectiveness for combat, keep a sword in the item slot next to the fishing rod, so that drawing in an enemy, then striking them with a sword becomes faster. The player can also fly with elytra using fireworks to boost fly higher while use fishing rod grab mobs or player then reeling it can cause high fall damage. \nAnvil.\n&lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;s deal as much damage when falling on an entity as that entity would take with no armor or potion effects falling from the same height. This means to kill a player or mob with 20 health, it has to fall 24 blocks. This will damage the anvil as well.\nFighting styles.\nHere are some fighting styles that players use to fight mobs and other players. Note that some of these styles are only helpful when fighting other players. Also, not all items that should be brought in combat are listed under \"Required items\", so make sure to bring all the required items, but also bring standard and basic defensive items, such as tools and armor.\nMelee Combat.\nRequired items: \nPre-combat.\nBe sure not to consume any of the following items before battle.\nThe reason for this is that these items have a very low effective quality and will make the hunger go down very quickly, especially while in combat. In combat, the player will be sprinting, jumping, attacking, and taking damage. These all affect the player's hunger saturation, or the amount of time each hunger point will last, so they are going to want as much saturation as possible. The following foods are the best choice for pre-combat preparation and are recommended to have while in combat.\nAll of these foods, except for cake, have an effective quality score above 20. Cake, with a score of 14.4, is useful because the player can place and eat it without being forced into the speed of crouching. If the player are on a server with plugins that keep players from placing blocks in certain areas, then cake might not be the best choice. Always be sure to keep the sword as set as their most easily accessible item in their hotbar, depending on how their controls are set up. If the player are using the default controls, it is recommended that the player set their sword as the leftmost item on their hotbar. Also, be sure to keep other important items such as food or potions to the left of their hotbar.\nEngaging in combat.\nWhen engaging opponents, sprint jump towards them with the sword equipped and start the swing as the player approaches the opponent. Try to be in mid-air when the player attack to get a critical hit (in 1.9 try to not be sprinting when landing the first hit at the last moment, since you can't do critical hits and Knockback hits at the same time), which will increase the amount of damage they deal. If successful, it will leave a star-like particle effect. If the player makes contact, their opponent will be knocked back. After a successful critical hit, try to combo your opponent (by sprint-resetting, strafing, and some others movement methods). The best way to combo someone is to keep enough range and give the opponent enough Knockback so they can't hit you right after you hit him. If you're opponent is in a combo which turns to your advantage, you can try to cast a critical hit, while your opponent is struggling to escape your combo.\nIf the player are the one that gets hit, and the damage is too much for the player to re-engage combat, the best option is to use a splash potion. Don't immediately use the potion, because the player might also heal the opponents. Instead, run out of the opponent's range, and, while running, look down briefly and throw the potion. If it is an instant health potion, turn around and surprise their opponent with a quick attack. If it is a regeneration potion, wait for their health to regenerate to full and turn around and lay as many hits on them as they can. The regeneration effect will be a huge advantage, allowing you to attack without fear of losing health too quickly.\nIf the player is at a distance from the opponents that are attacking with a bow, start to move towards them, sprint jumping and moving from side to side. If possible, block with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; to protect against incoming arrows. Using a shield to block will protect players against 100% of incoming damage; however, it will also damage the shield, and it will disable the shield if the weapon is an axe.\nIf you have a shield, try to use it at strategical moment to block 100% melee damage (only works in 1.11+). If the opponent has a shield too, it is better to fight with an axe, since they do more damage and can disable shields when hitting a blocking player. If the opponent rises their shields, try to sprint hit him with an axe, then continue with axe critical hits while his shield is disabled. The opponent is at his most vulnreable state when having a shield disabled.\nTips:\nThe player may want to use a splash potion or potion of Strength, as the player can kill other players wearing armor much more easily.\nBeing skilled in melee combat can make a big difference in winning or losing a pvp match. The player can practice on competitive multiplayer servers to get tips from highly skilled and experienced players online. Some competitive servers are minemen.club, or lunar.gg.\nNote: There are 2 different combat system, and even if melee combat is mostly the same about combos, there are still differences. In 1.8, vertical Knockback make so getting the most hits is important (and therefore ensure all of them are sprint-Knockback hits), whereas in 1.9 the attack cooldown and low Knockback make so getting better hits (critical hits/sprint-Knockback hits) is important. Combos are still possible in 1.9, but they are still a bit different than 1.8 combos.\nElytra Sniping.\nThis strategy allows players to take down heavily armored foes using ranged attacks. This style is recommended for players with good aim. It is very effective, but it requires an elytra, which is very rare.\nRequired items:\nOther items that help greatly for strategy:\nSteps:\nThis strategy is best used in environments that have high vantage points available such as mountains, jungles with high trees, amplified worlds, etc., with a lot of places where the player can safely use the bow.\nCons:\nPros:\nAlternatively, you can also go airforce-style and shoot from your elytra while flying. However, you will not be able to hide behind cover this way, and it will be harder to hit the target while you are moving.\nRiptide Hooking.\nThis strategy is useful in combat with both mobs and players but is very hard to pull off. This is a good way to deal a lot of damage very quickly.\nRequired items:\nSteps:\nTips:"}

They generally have a number of components which must be set in the right combination in order to activate something such as a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;. Combination locks can be very useful in creating &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creating%20a%20challenge%20map\"&gt;adventure maps&lt;/a&gt;. Note that if you are playing in survival multiplayer, other &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s will still be able to break into the mechanism and cause it to activate without knowing the password.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nOrder-insensitive combination locks.\nLever lock.\nA &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; lock is one of the easiest redstone locks to create. Each lever doubles the number of combinations the lock has. The possibilities can be found using 2\"n\", where \"n\" is the number of levers used.\nWhen constructing, you will probably first want to place the levers and put them into the desired positions. Next, you should place the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s. Torches go behind levers that are down and repeaters go behind levers that are up. When you are done, all of the torches and repeaters should be turned off. If not, double check any components that are turned on.\nItem frame lock.\n&lt;a href=\"Item%20frame\"&gt;Item frame&lt;/a&gt; combination locks are a step up in complexity from lever locks. &lt;a href=\"Item\"&gt;Item&lt;/a&gt;s in item frames can be rotated into 8 different positions. This rotation can be detected by a &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; which will output a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust%23Behavior\"&gt;signal strength&lt;/a&gt; from 1 to 8 depending on the position. Since each item frame has 8 possible states, the number of possible combinations can be found with 8\"n\", where \"n\" is the number of item frames.\nThe horizontal redstone paths on the floor decrease the signal emitted by the comparator down to a fixed strength of 1, and then feed it into an \"A OR NOT B\" gate that is true if the strength is either too small (B is not powered, i.e. false) or too large (A is powered, i.e. true). These gates are all ORed together so that the overall result is true if any item frame in the lock is misplaced; finally a torch (optional) inverts the result.\nIf you want to make it extra tricky, it is also possible to detect an empty item frame by when a comparator doesn't output anything. Simply leave a &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt; connected to the comparator and feeding into the vertical redstone wire on the right side; a filled item frame will give a signal strength of 15 out of the repeater and keep the door locked.\nRS NOR Combo Lock.\nConnect a series of buttons to the S-input of RS Latches. Feed the Q or Q (choose which one for each latch to set the combination) outputs of the RS Latches into a series of AND gates, and connect the final output to an iron door. Finally, connect a single button to all the R-inputs of the RS Latches. The combination is configured by using either Q or Q for each button (Q means that the button would need to be pressed, Q don't press).\nExample:\nWith the automated reset it causes the correct combo to cause a pulse instead of a \"always on\" until reset.\nOrder-sensitive combination locks.\nOrder-sensitive combination locks are sometimes known as permutation locks.\nOrder-sensitive changing code XNOR Combo Lock.\nOpens when a certain order of switches are pressed.\nYou can change the order.\nHave 4 blocks near each other with a switch and a sign saying 4,3,2 or 1 respectively.\n10 blocks to the right and 2 blocks down place a block then place 2 more with a 5 block space. 6 right and 3 up place the block. Label them 4-3-2-1 respectively.\nHave a 11 block wire or 13 for left to a repeater on the 9th block or 11th for left and on the right side. Place a repeater 2 blocks over with the same wire from it. Connect the left repeaters.\nto the code changing module. (You may use bridges of cobblestone for getting over other wire and repeaters for boosting the signal. Construct a XNOR Gate where).\n2 of the wires meet. Connect to adjacent outputs with AND gates. These Outputs are connected to final AND gate. Final AND gate if connected to iron door.\nOrder-sensitive RS NOR Combo Lock.\nA door that opens when buttons are pressed in certain order.\nMake a series of buttons, and connect only one to an RS NOR latch. Then connect both the RS NOR latch and a second button to an AND gate, which feeds to another RS NOR latch. Do this continually until you have either filled all of the buttons or are satisfied with the lock. Connect the final RS NOR latch to a separate AND gate with a signal from an enter button. Feed that to the output RS NOR latch. Then connect any of the left-over buttons to the enter button and send reset signals to all of the RS NOR latches. A pressure plate next to a door can reset the door. This type of lock has severe limitations its security. For example, not all the buttons could be used in the pin or there would be nothing to reset the system.\nFor a lock that can have a combination of any size, using all the buttons, and still have a wrong entry reset the system, you need a different way for it to reset. To construct this, hook up a panel of buttons (any number, but four or more is preferred) to a parallel series of adjacent repeaters. Invert as necessary so that all the repeaters are powered and are unpowered by the press of the corresponding button. These repeaters power a row of blocks. On top of the blocks, place a torch corresponding to the incorrect buttons for the fist number in the PIN. For the correct button/number, place dust under the powered block which leads to a RS NOR Latch. Place a row of blocks above the torches for the incorrect buttons, with redstone dust on top. Then connect this dust to the reset of the first RS NOR Latch. Only the correct button will set the RS NOR Latch and all others will reset it. Connect the output of the RS NOR LATCH to half of an AND gate. After the first row of blocks with the reset torches, place another row of repeaters and another row of blocks. Again place torches for the incorrect buttons and dust under the correct button's line. Power will be fed from the buttons through the rows of repeaters and blocks for as many rows as there are digits in the PIN number. Connect the dust from the correct button to the other half of the AND gate coming from the first RS NOR Latch. Only if the two conditions are met, that the first button was pushed correctly, setting the first RS NOR Latch, and the second button is pushed correctly will the AND gate send a signal to set the second RS NOR Latch. Again, connect a reset line from the incorrect button's torches to the reset of the second RS NOR Latch. Delay the reset signals by one full repeater to give time for the next RS NOR Latch to be set before the reset happens. Continue building the array in the same manner until you reach the desired number of digits. In operation, when a button is hit, each RS NOR Latch checks (through the AND gate) to see if the previous RS NOR Latch is set, and the correct button for this RS NOR Latch has been pushed. Only when the correct buttons are pressed in order, will the signal progress through the conditional RS NOR Latches to the end. Connect the output of the last RS NOR Latch to a door and attach a line to a pressure plate inside the door to reset the last RS NOR Latch.\nTutorial Video.\nCombination Lock RS NOR\nThere is also another way to make order-sensitive combination locks. It is based on several RS NOR latches that is placed on a row. The RS NOR latches are connected together, and each latch is connected to one button. The combination lock opens when all the latches are activated. To activate all of them, the latches have to be activated in the right order. If wrong button is pressed, the lock automatically sends a reset signal to the first latch, and resets the entire lock. The circuit also has a T flip-flop that controls the output. The T flip-flop turns on and stays on when the right combination is pressed. When the lock is open, all the buttons works like a reset button. This makes it easy to close the door from the outside. Just press a random button. It is also possible to connect buttons that overrides the lock and makes the output signal toggle like on a normal T flip-flop.\nCombination lock with order-sensitive reset.\nThis is an order-sensitive combination lock with order sensitive reset function. It works like an ordinary order-sensitive combination lock, but in addition it has a function that resets everything when a button is pressed too early. The function consists of AND-gates that sends a reset signal if the previous button hasn't been pressed yet. The lock does not need a reset button because it resets automatically when the code is wrong."}

They are particularly useful for the and commands, as they are only available in cheat mode otherwise. The command is especially useful, as it allows players to change the current time to a preset time at the press of a button.\nCommand blocks and functions can also be used to make text appear in the person's chat menu. The code to do this is , or . If the parameter is present only the nearest person will see the message. If a username was specified, the username will be sent the message. The player can also type: , e.g. and whenever someone walks over it, it will say: \"[(hover note{Defaults to @})] whispers to the player: &lt;username&gt;\".\nChanging the difficulty is accomplished by (e.g. ).\nAnother way to use command blocks and functions is to use to teleport between different bases in a world.\nBasic usage of commands.\nThere are many things players can do with command blocks. Here are examples of some of them:\nCookie announcer.\nWhen run in order, such as in a chain of command blocks or functions, these commands will give a random player 5 cookies.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTime warper.\nBy putting this command inside a repeating &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;, the player can make time speed up. Adjust the number to change how fast it goes.\nWireless redstone.\nRedstone can wirelessly be 'transmitted' by placing a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20block\"&gt;redstone block&lt;/a&gt; at a certain location. The downside to this method is that the chunks being transmitted to must be loaded. This method is often used with &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Custom%20maps\"&gt;Adventure maps&lt;/a&gt; to trigger more command blocks.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo not require loading chunks, the scoreboard is needed. The second command will only complete successfully if the first has been run. Either a &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; or chained conditional command blocks can detect the success. The second command block should be set to repeat.\n&lt;br&gt;\nWireless buttons.\nThe previous is often used in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s. Sometimes however, there might not be enough room to hide a command block. In that case, the player can use a repeating command block to test if a button on (x, y, z) is pressed.\nStarter kits.\nUsing command blocks users can give starter kits to new players.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe problem with this setup is that players can only get the starter kit once, even if they die. To fix this, use these commands. The first command should only be run once, probably by the player rather than a command block.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTeleporting.\nThe player can teleport by using the &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, where y is the vertical difference between the upper and lower elevator entrances. \nThe elevator can also be made to teleport a player to any coordinate just by leaving out the codice_1 before the numbers. When codice_1 is left in the command, the normal (x, y, z) is set to (0, 0, 0) where the command was made, such as standing on a pressure plate or wherever the player is standing when the command block received power. If a pressure plate was at the coordinates of (-36, 96, -12) that ran to a command block with a command of it would teleport the player to the coordinates of (-33, 100, -7). The same outcome can be achieved by having the command of one block must be subtracted from the x and z axis to get to the right coordinates. Using @p, @s, @a, or @e.\nSecurity system for mobs or players.\nCommand blocks can also be used to make a security system. Just put a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; which triggers a command block in front of an &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt;, which will be the entrance to the house. Insert the command: codice_3 and hook it up with &lt;a href=\"chain%20command%20block\"&gt;chain command block&lt;/a&gt;s to kill different mobs. this is to not kill you or other players. Do this second command in a command block to teleport all things in the vicinity: codice_4.\nMoving sidewalk.\nA similar concept to the elevator but made to move a player along the x or z coordinates. \nThis can be created by:\nUsers might want to turn command block output off since the chat will keep spamming command block output via using .\nReplacement for pressure plates.\n&lt;a href=\"Pressure%20plates\"&gt;Pressure plates&lt;/a&gt; only blend in with only gold, iron, stone, and wood planks, but cannot be concealed in any other floor; command blocks can be used instead. Pressure plates can be replaced with a command block by using the codice_5 argument in the command with a range and a clock circuit. The command will test to see if any players are within a range of 2 (the command block itself plus 2 more blocks in every direction). Range 2 is the range a player want for a command block under a floor. Keep in mind that it will produce a globe shaped trigger area (rather than a cube), so a range of 2 makes an approximately 5\u00d75\u00d75 area and a range of 1 makes a 3\u00d73\u00d73 area (more like a + pattern with an extra block above and below the center). The player can get around this by using the dx, dy and dz arguments. \nAlternately the player can specify the x, y and z coordinates in the command (e.g. but be warned that the range cannot be shrunk to the 1-block point. As with the non-xyz version range means center block plus range number of blocks around it, which makes sense from a command block (where \u201cjust the center block\u201d would mean you have to be standing in the command block) but doesn\u2019t make sense here. At any rate a range 1 sphere (+ pattern with an extra block on top and bottom) can be buried underground with just the top sticking out, provided the player know no one will be walking through the bottom 2 layers of the globe. Trying this with the non-xyz version of the command would require the command block itself to be embedded in the surface of the floor where it can be seen.\nImportant note: When writing the code in brackets codice_6, do not put spaces between commas codice_7 :\nDo not add / during coding unless instructed to.\nBad: codice_8\nBad: codice_9\nBad: codice_10\nGood: codice_11\nCommanding passwords.\nPlayers can now create passwords with command blocks, using the argument on . Place a command block. This will be the one you put input in. Place another command block, and type in the following command:&lt;br&gt;\nExample:&lt;br&gt;\nPlace a comparator connected to the second command block, and place a button on or next to it to power the block. Now type \"That's Numberwang!\" (without quotes). If the second command block properly finds the first, the comparator will activate whatever it's wired to. If you want the first command block to reset so the password isn't used by someone else, also place a command block with that activates after .\nIf you don't want to let people edit your command block, you can test for a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; instead, but this means having to test for the password separately on each of the sign's 4 lines. To add a touch, you can fill the sign with air, but remember to give it back using .\nThe Destroyer.\nThis allows the player to destroy a cube of materials around them as they walk, using . The command is or . Use the repeating command block with the \"Always Active\" option selected, and the cube of air will be created wherever a player go. Basically, takes out a specified amount of space, similar to , but it uses two coordinates and fills the space in between them with the material of the players choosing. In this case, that material would be air. Now, every time a player moves, it will fill a 3\u00d73 cube of air around the player. A destroyer is great for enemy bases, or simply being a crazy griefer. \nThe Landscaper.\nThis is a reversed version of the Destroyer. Do or . This puts a 3\u00d73 grass square under a player.\nBooby traps.\nAn extremely lethal booby trap would be a command block set to teleport someone into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can do in a command block below a block with a pressure plate to make a multi-use landmine that kills all nearby entities upon stepping on it (including players, item frames, and paintings)\nNote that booby traps that use can be dangerous due to the fact that non-player entities could trigger them (if something like a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; is used), resulting in the teleportation of the nearest player, no matter how far away they are and regardless of the fact that they haven't actually stepped on the plate. To get around this, players can either use the command as an invisible pressure plate, or they can do . Hook a clock circuit up to a command block programmed with , with the coordinates changed as appropriate. Note that as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt; a range of zero can now be specified.\nTeleporters.\nIt is possible to make teleporters using the command block. (e.g. ) Taking it one step further, a teleporting station can be made, with multiple button-activated teleporters that each teleport to different locations. Scouting and testing teleportation destinations first is advisable, to make sure players don't end up stuck inside blocks or in other unintended places. If players appear in ground while testing coordinates, use to get out (may require multiple uses).\nIf a player use the teleport command with the command block, one can use relative coordinates in the destination coordinates by placing an codice_1 in front of a coordinate (e.g. code: . This would teleport the player 8 blocks into the air).\nCommands that use coordinates (e.g. or ) add 0.5 to whole numbers when no decimal follows. This is so you appear centered over the block you appear on instead of at the edge or corner of it. For example, the number -33 would execute as -32.5, and 187 as 187.5. To prevent this behavior, add .0 (25.3, 90.0) after them, as these values are executed left as-is. It is also possible to teleport &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, with players in them. The command is .\nWorking minecart with dispenser.\nTo create a working minecart with dispenser, run this command:\ncodice_13 tells the game to render the block in the cart differently. codice_14 tells it to change it to a certain block ID (a Dispenser). See &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1969520-17-using-summon-give-datatags-in-map-making-tutorials/%23useful_links\"&gt;This Minecraft Forum article&lt;/a&gt; for a better explanation of this, and other useful things.\nAdd this command to the \"dispenser\" by right clicking it: \nSingleplayer non-Creative maps.\nBy swapping game mode it is possible to use &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"function\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;s in single player outside of Creative mode. Simply swap to creative mode with the command, set the command block command to whatever the player want, then swap back to . The command block only needs to be set in Creative, but will still function once back in normal.\nIt can also be used to teleport to certain areas (for example a far-away stronghold, a deep mining operation, or a floating island). If it takes the player a very long time to get there, and if they don't mind sort-of cheating, then you can set up a teleport system. Make sure that the player are on Creative mode while setting it (use the command . If they don't have cheats enabled, open the LAN and set the cheats on), but they can still activate it in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode. Type this command in when having the command block GUI open . Then, activate the command block with redstone (including buttons, levers, and pressure plates), and they will be sent to their destination. The player can set up multiple different teleports. This can also be used when doing a big project that spans over a very large area or if they are transferring chests to from an old house to a newer house.\nMultiplayer applications.\nThis section details the applications of the &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; in multiplayer.\nCommand-based flying.\n&lt;a href=\"Commands\"&gt;Commands&lt;/a&gt; can also be used for flying entities or structures. Most commands based flying machines use &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s so that when the player turns on an input, it activates certain command blocks. Unlike &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; based technologies, however, these cannot be legitimately made in &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; as command blocks require set up by an &lt;a href=\"operator\"&gt;operator&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; mode.\n/tp command.\nUsing the command, &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; can be teleported in a specific direction in small repeated increments, to exhibit a smooth flying. With clever &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; usage, movement can be controlled by various means such as holding a specific &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;\n/clone command.\nUsing the command, it is possible to more easily move structures by cloning them and teleporting entities in it with . It can be accomplished by cloning a structure relative to an entity with . The entity, in turn, can be controlled by some other means.\n/summon command.\nUsing the command, it is possible to lift an entity with &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s, somewhat similar to real life rockets. This can be done by spawning instantly detonating &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; below an entity. However, there is a multitude of disadvantages, including:\n/data (merge/modify) [entity] command.\nUsing the command (1.13+), it is possible to change the velocities applied to an entity rideable by the player, such as &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe equivalent command for versions below 1.13 is the command.\nTeleportation/Transport.\nThrough , one can create teleporters for public use on a server. It can be applied to a range of scenarios. For example, one could make a system of portals in a particularly large world in which all portals link to a central hub, which contains portals to all other portal locations creating a sort of \"Fast Travel Hub\" using &lt;X&gt; &lt;Y&gt; &lt;Z&gt;\nStop-Motion Animation.\nBy using the command with lots of different copies of it, slightly altered bit by bit, and then just clone the areas into one spot in sequence. That way the player doesn't have to be teleported, but the landscape around them can be animated as the clone commands copy the various animation \"frames\" near the player sequentially.\nLottery.\nThrough , one can create a lottery. Keep in mind that now, will directly put items into one's inventory, instead of throwing them on the ground in front of the character. \nAs mentioned above one can create a lottery but that lottery is usable by the public. A simple edit can change that... First create a new objective. (For example: ) Then use this command on a command block to enter players into the lottery then do to start the lottery and only the players chosen can be in the lottery.\nJails.\nBy rigging a fast clock to a command block executing , they can force a player to stay at a certain place. If they do this it would be advisable to either turn off commands in their chat settings or do . Using the \"Range\" and \"Minimum Range\" parameters, they can have it teleport players back only when they're a certain distance away.\nAlternatively, giving the player certain status effects at high levels using the command can mimic the effect of a jail. Use to keep the player from moving, and to keep the player from breaking things. If player really want to kick it up a notch, poison the player (use one of the previous two commands, but replace the first number with 19).\nCreative Only.\nBy using the parameter codice_15, only players in Creative will be affected by the command block.\nFun anti-creative mode trap.\nIf player place a repeating command block with \"Always Active\" option, they can set for hilarious (like really hilarious) results. This could be a way to get creative mode people to change to Survival and is also really fun to watch.\nAnnouncements.\nBy using in a command block one can create announcements that could play even when the admin or owner wasn't there.\nSecurity Scan.\nBy using , players can scan people for items. If they want to remove certain items, use . For example, on a server that doesn't want griefing, players could have a clock connected to a command block set to .\nRace Referee.\nUsing , the command block can report the nearest player. If the command block is placed after a finish line, it will say the finishers in order. Players can also do and when activated the message \"THIS IS A MESSAGE\" will come up on the chat system. Players can also color the text using \"color\" at the end of the next command .\nCreative Area/World Guard.\nCreating a \"Creative Only\" zone is possible through command blocks, but it is complex and more of a case-by-case basis. The basic idea would be to create a \"fence\" of command block affected zones so that, once a player flies in creative through it, they would be changed to survival or adventure mode. \nA \"World Guard\" zone would be a lot simpler, just have a command block do and when people leave, just have a button to change them to survival.\nOne could also utilize the distance argument defining an area-of-effect combined with a deactivating command block . Set both blocks to repeat and be self-powered and there should be a fairly \"seamless\" transition zone between normal and protected. The distance variables for the range of effect (specifically the reversion block) can vary, but a buffer between the X and X+2 variables should be there to accommodate the second block being at a different position than the protection block. The gap between the two variables in the reversion block need not be exactly 10 blocks, but a buffer helps for lag concerns in guaranteeing that once left, a player will revert back to survival mode. \nDo note that if you have a nether portal within the protection zone, that the player will NOT be reverted to survival once they step through, so place a reversion cube of any type (Impulse or Repeating) in the Nether on the other side of that portal.\nImproving PvP without Plugins.\nPlayers can use so players cannot steal each other's items. Also, using and to help move players around while in PvP competitions.\nStarter Kits.\nPlayers can easily give people a starter kit with a button without plugins: . \nTo prevent people pressing the button a second time and again getting their kit, players can make two command blocks activated in order: &lt;br&gt;\nColorful Messages.\nIt is possible to create a colored, clickable message players can send to anybody. The command is . Not to be confused with . The basic format is \nAn example would be . Simply place a comma and space with each addition. If you want other players to be able to click it, use codice_16. Here's the example: codice_17. This means when the player clicks the text, it will give them a stack of cooked pork. If you just want to tell them something without running a command, replace codice_16 with codice_19 and codice_20 with codice_21. Then just type the value text as a regular sentence, no slashes. If you want an easier job of it, here we have some tools:\nAlarm System.\nWhen a player walks over a pressure plate, it can trigger a command block with or . codice_22 can be used within the message to display the player closest to the command block upon triggering.\nRemove Players.\nUsing coordinate and maximum parameters, players can teleport everyone within a specific area to another specific area.\nReward Room.\nIf a certain player has been very nice, regular, or helpful to the server but not quite meeting the requirements to be promoted to an admin, players could have a room full of buttons connected to command blocks with helpful effects, like giving the helpful player a stack of diamonds or a bedrock block, then have it connected to another command block, sending them to the spawn point. (It is very important this room is reinforced with bedrock, hidden, and you can only get in by teleporting to its co-ordinates to avoid abuse).\nWeather Machine.\nCommand: \nAssuming only admins can get to it, a weather machine can be quite useful, players can turn rain on and off at will. One of the more helpful uses of this technique would be to use a combination of villagers (they run inside when it rains) and some form of redstone machinery to create and automatic rain disabler, this would allow you to shut off the rain almost immediately without needing to use the command, or to have an admin present. It can also be used to create, and/or end, a scenario where it is more advantageous to have rain as opposed to sunlight, and vice versa; such as during a forest fire, or when a thunderstorm is spawning monsters.\nObstacle Course Prizes.\nwith and , players could make an obstacle course or maze that when finished will give a player a prize, and will teleport them back to spawn or some other area.\nTime Machine.\nBy making two similar places on one map, players can have a button activate a command block to teleport them from one to another, while also changing the time of day. This can be used to look like time travel.\nProximity Mine.\nBy using a condition such as hooked to a short clock and one or more &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; blocks via a comparator, the command block can act as an undetectable proximity mine against all players except the placing player.\nSecure Doors.\nBy using a condition such as , the command block can detect a door's owner within a certain radius and open a door for them, and only for them.\nCustom Commands.\nBy using a trigger objective, players can create commands that players can use on a server.\nFirst, add the objective: . Place a command block connected to a Redstone clock with the command . Then place another command block connected to the clock with the command . Place a comparator facing away from that command block, activating a command block with the command . When a player uses , they will be teleported to (x,y,z) coordinates in the command block.\nApplication in custom maps.\nThis section details the applications of the &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; in custom maps.\nIf one wishes to create a singleplayer adventure map, use to allow all other commands to be used.\nOne map that takes advantage of a lot of the features of the command block is the Hypixel's Gladiator Arena in which the fighting system is almost only based on this.\nSilent Command Block.\nSometimes it's important in a map to keep the command blocks silent, may it be to keep the magic of the suddenly appearing items in the inventory, or because the channel telling that the player was teleported, it can break the mood of a map. To keep them silent (except when you ask them to speak), just use the following:\nSafe Haven/Arena Fight Zone.\nUsing pressure plates or tripwire, make areas (like a castle for instance) a different difficulty (in this instance peaceful). the doors could have &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt; to a command block that changes ones difficulty to peaceful, creating a sort of \"Safe Haven\". one could also do it the other way around, creating a more dangerous zone, such as arenas having the difficulty of hard, rather than normal or easy. Note that in multiplayer this will change the difficulty everywhere in the world, and thus may not be desirable.\nDetecting Cheaters.\nUsing parameter codice_15, the player can affect those who are in Creative, or Survival with parameter codice_24.\nIt's bigger on the inside.\nThis is a simple one, just have a system of teleporting command blocks at the entrance/exit of a place, and players can build the interior somewhere else, allowing them to cheat space restriction. (example of use: you want interior walls to be wool, but exterior walls to be wood (normally 2m thick walls).\nYou can make the outside of the house be 8x10 m, and the inside of the house be 8x10 m.) Or, have the inside of the house 20\u00d720 instead.\nSave game.\nBy using the command, one can easily make a button-activated checkpoint.\nLava parkours.\nAs said before, there is a command that makes the player able to keep their inventory upon death: . Simply connect this to a pressure plate before a parkour level over lava and you don't have to use any kind of chest minecart (especially useful when the player has it's full inventory, which is bigger than a single chest).\nStill want a bed?\nIt's true that the command can be useful because you don't have to wait for the night to create a checkpoint, but sometimes you may want to have a BUD switch connected to the bed or something similar, so that you don't have to type the command in every time. To do this, you just need to have a discreet pressure plate connected to a block with the command, and it will set the time to night so the player can sleep.\nTime and weather following the scenario.\nMany times, a player will be building something, and it will start raining or start to get dark, which both can be disturbing to the player. Fortunately, you can use commands to turn off the rain, as well as make the sun go back to sunrise. To toggle rain on and off, just use the command. Use codice_25 if you want to clear the weather, or codice_26 or codice_27, if you would like to toggle on rain or a thunderstorm. For example, if you want the weather to be rain but not thunder, type in the command. \nAlong with this, you can also use with a number: codice_28 is sunrise, codice_29 is midday, codice_30 is sunset and codice_31 is midnight. So, if you want to set the time to sunrise, type in the chat: .\nDetecting Players who switched to Peaceful.\nCreate a hostile mob (so it disappears when switching to Peaceful) that never despawns if the player is far away. To do so, use a name tag on the mob (or third party software if you are playing in a version previous to 1.5.2) and place it on a pressure plate. Make sure it will keep it pressed infinitely, so make sure surround it with 2 high blocks or fences, so that it can't jump or walk away. Make a redstone circuit that causes a command block to activate when input from pressure plate ceases to exist. Place a message inside the block that informs the player on chat that the map has been broken and must be redownloaded. This way, switching to Peaceful will cause the mob to vanish and activate the message. You can even make a teleportation command block so that a cheater is banished from the map to a small room without a way out as soon as they switch to Peaceful.\nTalking Adventure Map.\nThe command is extremely useful because it simply prints text into the chat. It may be one of the better uses of the &lt;a href=\"Command%20Block\"&gt;Command Block&lt;/a&gt; as you don't need silly signs or long books to show the game rules. Just put a bunch of command blocks in lines with repeaters set to two or three ticks (to avoid spamming players) allowing you to easily remove a chest of books or a large number of signs. \nAnother use of is talking NPCs and other mobs. Imagine you enter a butchery and you want the butcher to say something. Usually, you might use signs or books, using up room in the butchery and having seemingly random objects strewn around a map. With the command you can make the butcher talk. Maybe a pig behind the counter could even beg for mercy! Let's take another example: you are in a factory and an alarm suddenly rings and says in chat it will explode. Having it in the chat, especially if the text is long, keeps the stressful mood; the same thing works for bomb timers. The situation might feel tenser if the chat displays '10..' '9..' 8..' individually as well.\nLast but not least, it makes it easier to create a Quest System. Let's say the player gets in a butchery. It activates through a pressure plate connected to a RS NOR Latch (to avoid activation twice) and a command block with the command in which the butcher asks for the player's help: they need to kill a pig. The player gets to the pig that is standing on a stone pressure plate, that turns off when the pig is dead. So, when the player gets back to the butchery, it activates another circuit containing yet another RS NOR Latch and two command blocks with two commands. First, the command in which the butcher thanks the player, and another one, the command, so the player gets the reward. Along with that, don't forget to use the @p command so the butcher says the player's name. For example, if the command block is set to do this: , the channel will say: \"[@]: Thanks, &lt;name of the player&gt;. You helped me a lot killing that pig.\" This increases immersion into the map, as the NPCs seem tailored for the player. You could also change [@] to [Butcher] by renaming the command block using an anvil.\nMaking a Store.\nBy using and you can make a shop system that trades a certain amount of exp for items. For instance, if you made a command block with and another with connected to the same redstone current, it will take 5 levels from the player, and in return, give them 64 grass blocks.\nCustom villagers selling whatever you want can be created with command blocks. Custom villagers are not available through Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. &lt;br&gt;\nThe part labeled \"Buy\" is what the villager is accepting as payment, the part that says \"sell\" is what he's giving in return. You can change the maxUses to 1000 if you never want the offer to run out, or to 1 if you want to make it a one-of-a-kind item. Note that the first item there (the gold sword) has an out of range enchantment (sharpness 9). Yes this works, but always research what exactly the enchantment does before making an out of range one as some stuff does nothing or even does negative effects (respiration's \"see underwater\" side effect makes everything a blinding white at high levels, as if you dove into slush-filled arctic waters). As for that gold sword, keep in mind that gold swords wear out insanely fast (there's a reason people call them butter swords after all). A level 10 Unbreaking enchantment should bring a gold sword up to a decent durability level. Also notice that the other 2 \"weapons\" are actually a Stick and a Blaze Rod with weapon enchantments on them. Using any non-weapon as a weapon does the same damage as an empty hand (1 damage, aka half a heart) but the enchantments on these ones make them the equal of an unenchanted sword. The advantage is that sticks, blaze rods, or other items is that you can use it infinitely. The same trick can be used with &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;s and respiration 3 to make an infinite durability scuba mask.\nSpawners.\nCommand blocks can create spawners using the command, e.g.: }} Anything that counts as an entity can be spawned (except a player), which includes all mobs, as well as minecarts, fireballs, arrows, snowballs, ender pearls, custom thrown potions, fireworks, primed TNT, falling sand, red sand, or gravel, paintings and item frames, experience orbs, and even dropped items of any type. \nPig, cow, or chicken spawners can be placed in the butcher's backyard in a village to create a constant meat supply. E.g.: }} Note that the spawner in the last code example will spawn a chicken riding a pig. There doesn't seem to be a limit to how many levels of riders you can use. For example, you could create a chicken riding a pig riding a cow riding a horse riding a silverfish riding a villager (\"Say, that's a mighty odd hat you have on, Farmer Brown\"). \nPlease note that if you want to use the RequiredPlayerRange tag you have to use the MaxNearbyEntities tag as well. The same thing applies to codice_32 and codice_33. Lastly, note that the y value used in both of those spawner example codes was ~-1, which (assuming the player are not flying) will put the spawner in the surface level of the ground at your feet.\nIf you don't want to target a specific player, you can use codice_34, codice_22, or codice_36 instead of codice_37. Keep in mind that you can use codice_22 (which means closest player) in player issued commands as an easy to type 2 character replacement for your own name as the closest player to you will always be you.\nPart 1: The Basics.\nThis code will create a zombie &lt;a href=\"Monster%20spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; 2 blocks from you in the x direction. Note that the name given for mob spawners in this code (codice_39) is the long version and you can leave out the codice_40 part.\nThis next code is also pretty basic but it includes the 6 basic parameters that can be set.\nNotes:\nPart 2: Custom monsters.\nThe next thing to do is to modify the spawn data. Spawn data is what tells the spawner you want a non-standard version of a monster, such as a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; with a diamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and a chain &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nUsing ~ without any number after it in the coordinates counts as zero. Because of the fact that none of those 6 parameters from the last example are used, they will all be defaults.&lt;br&gt;\nNote that there are now two types of item slots, Hand and Armor. Hand items are in the order Mainhand, Offhand, while armor items go in the order Boots, Legs, Chest, Helmet. You must even specify empty slots (the { }, parts), unless they're after the last non-empty slot. So, if you want your custom mob to have a helmet, you have to specify all 5 slots, but if it's just boots, you can leave off the other 3. Likewise, if you want them to have leg armor. you have to specify the boot slot, but not chest and helmet slots.&lt;br&gt;\nRemember that creatures that burn in sunlight are safe if they have a helmet on, although it damages the helmet instead.\nAs for the count tag, most codes can get away with leaving it out; however, it is important. An item without a count tag is a stack of zero, better known in the community as a \"Ghost Item\". A player trying to use a ghost item will have it disappear out of their hands with its first use (which is a failure). While monsters can use ghost items without problem (hence why codes get away with leaving it out sometimes), if they drop the items the player who picks it up won't be able to use it, so it is highly recommended to use the count tag.&lt;br&gt;\nThe next example of customized monsters, consists of a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; with an enchanted &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; (Flame) with a custom &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;, internet connection required or it's just Steve) with Protection 2 riding a Skeleton &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nAs of 1.12, passengers can control their mounts to an extent, which means that former issues with Zombie passengers are no longer extant. A more in-depth look at the behavior of passengers and mounts can be found at &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Summoning%20jockeys\"&gt;Tutorials/Summoning Jockeys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;\nThe skeleton horse has Tame set to 1 (yes). Note that there is currently an ongoing bug where summoned mobs riding horses with saddles cannot move, regardless of whether the horse is tame. Technically you can have multiple levels of riders, although this gets silly quickly.\nPart 3: SpawnPotentials.\nUsing the codice_41 tag, you can create a mob spawner with multiple mobs in it. It will randomly pick one each time when the timer is reset (a second after spawning the previous mobs). Since these codes contain multiple mobs, they tend to be quite long codes. Here's a version of the SpawnPotentials code, that is easier on the eye:br&gt;\nIt contains a lot of codes, because of the fact that it is actually 6 separate mobs. In order we have:\nOther than the ninja, it's a straight tour of the 5 tiers of swords and armor. Note that the codice_42 tag, used right after the codice_43 tag in each codice_44. That determines how rarely it's picked. Specific numbers don't mean anything, just the ratios between the numbers. For example, if you want all the potentials to have an equal chance just set all the weights to 1. Changing them all to 8 wouldn't do anything different (they're still all the same size as each other), however, changing all but one to 8 would make that one 1/8th as likely as the rest. In this code, 4 is the default. The ninja only has a weight of 2 (making him half as likely to be picked) and fake Herobrine has a weight of 1 (making him 1/4th as likely to be picked, and thank god!)\nPart 4: Rideable Monsters.\nMobs can be ridden by using Minecarts or Boats on their heads. The command is fairly simple:\nTips: \nMore commands in fewer command blocks and recursion.\nThere are several ways to combine groups of commands into just one command.\nUse the following sets of commands for recursion:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo run multiple commands, summon a command-block minecart riding another command-block minecart riding another, with the commands in reverse order, on an &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;. There are also commands called one-command tool that use this tactic.\nUsing a map item as a scroll.\nA YouTuber called SethBling used a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; as a scroll to perform commands (summon creatures, teleport). The player will have an empty map in the inventory and when the player uses it, it becomes a filled map which immediately disappears and a redstone task is done.\nPros\nCons\nBuilding the mechanism\nThe player can change the display name of an item to give the player a better understanding of the object and use the tooltip display. Use the following command to give the player a custom named map:\nDetecting the activation of the map\nGoing further\nThe command can check for other interactive items:\nNote that spamming the reel, or hooking a mob, may damage it more than 2, so make another one of these every 2."}

This tutorial assumes the reader is already familiar with the command.\nSidebar.\nThese examples demonstrate how to display command stats in the sidebar. This can be useful when testing commands, monitoring command block creations, etc.\nPlayer sidebar.\nWe'll use five \"fake players\" to hold the five command stats. Let's call them \"Blocks\", \"Entities\", \"Items\", \"Query\", and \"Success\".\nFirst, create the scoreboard objective that will be used to store the command stats.\nSecond, set the sidebar to display the CommandStats objective.\nThird, add the fake players to the sidebar by setting their CommandStats objective to 0. These five commands can be executed in any order, and a new fake player should appear in the sidebar after each one.\nFinally, use the command to specify which player should be used to update the sidebar with the command stats of the commands they execute. These five commands can be executed in any order. Replace \"player\" in the commands below with the name of the player (the player does not need to be online when the commands are run). If the player runs the commands themself, the Entities and Success entries in the sidebar will start updating after each command after they each are set up (because each command below should return a command stat of 1 for AffectedEntities and SuccessCount).\nCommand block sidebar.\nTo have the sidebar show the command stats of a specific command block instead of a player, run the first three steps described above in \"Player sidebar\" to set up the sidebar, but use these commands for the final step (replace \"x y z\" with the position of the command block in absolute coordinates or in &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Tilde%20notation\"&gt;tilde notation&lt;/a&gt;).\nMultiple sidebars.\nThe sidebar can be set up to show different objectives to different teams. By setting up multiple objectives to be updated by different blocks or entities, players can switch which command stats they're looking at by switching which team they're on. Let's try setting up two teams, one for monitoring the command stats of a player, the other for monitoring the command stats of a command block.\nFirst, create the scoreboard objectives that will be used to store the command stats.\nSecond, create the teams.\nThird, set the colors for the teams so the sidebar will know which objective to display for that team. Let's use \"blue\" for \"Block\", and \"red\" for \"Player\".\nFourth, set the sidebar to display the BlockStats and PlayerStats objectives for the correct team.\nFifth, add the fake players to both sidebars by setting their BlockStats and PlayerStats objectives to 0. If you're running these commands from the chat, it might be useful to put yourself on one team or the other now to see the fake players getting added.\nFinally, use the command to specify which block and player should be used to update the sidebars with the command stats of the commands they execute.\nNow players can switch which stats they see in the sidebar by changing their team. Players who can execute commands can use the following commands:"}

{"id": "43698", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=43698", "title": "Tutorials/Comparator update detector", "text": "A comparator update detector or CUD switch is a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; mechanism that exploits a feature in the game in order to detect &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; updates. Comparator updates are updates that only update comparators, for example, interacting with a container. Block update detectors cannot detect comparator updates, but CUDs can detect block updates.\nThere are many different designs, but they are all based on the same general idea: a comparator is turned on while it should be turned off, or the other way around. To get a comparator in such a state, the player have to make sure that it doesn't realize that it should change. This can be done in several ways.\nWhen the comparator gets an update, it will realize that it should change state. This update can be a block update, or a comparator update. CUDs can detect comparator updates next to the comparator, but also 1 block in between, provided that the block in between is a solid block.\nWhat it detects.\nThe CUD switch detects everything a BUD detects, however the CUD can detect updates from the following blocks 2 blocks away from the comparator horizontally (but only if a solid block exists between the comparator and the target block). This means that the player can have a CUD behind a wall that detects the following updates in front of the wall:\nTypes of CUD Switches.\nThe CUD can be only based on a comparator because only comparators can detect comparator updates. Each time players does one of the actions listed above, a comparator update is being sent 2 blocks away in all the 4 directions. \nChest based.\nThis method uses the mechanics of a chest. When a chest is locked, the comparator doesn't realize that it shouldn't be turned on anymore. When the player updated the comparator, it realizes, and resets the system.\nUsing Ocelot.\nIt's also possible to block the chest with an &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;. When ocelot sits on a chest, the player can't open it. The player can move them using pistons, minecarts or water. Using minecarts, players can make a silent CUD, besides the meow-sound of the ocelot or cat.\nCauldron based.\nThis method uses a filled cauldron that is being pushed by a piston, the comparator doesn't notice that the cauldron has been pushed down and stays powered until it gets an update. Note that the cauldron should contain water.\nRedirecting based.\nThis method is often used in BUD's. The player can turn any repeater-based BUD into a CUD by replacing the repeater with a comparator. They can redirect redstone with a detector rail, redstone block or a solid block, blocking 2 redstone diagonal to each other. Again, the comparator doesn't realize that the redstone isn't pointing the right direction anymore and it will stay turned on until it receives an update.\nItem frame based.\nComparators can take a redstone output from an item frame, but only if the item frame's position isn't occupied by a block. Many blocks will break the item frame, if they are in the same position, but some blocks don't. Examples are water, fence gates, skulls and flowers.\nVariations.\nOther devices can be built using the same underlying principle as the CUD switch. CUDs can be made stackable and even tile-able. They can be turned into a toggle-CUD. CUDs can be made pistonless using ocelots.\nT-CUD.\nA T-CUD toggles between 2 states. The first update will turn the comparator off, and the second update will turn the comparator on again.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known CUD-switch was made by RedsMiners. The bug it was based on has been fixed in 1.5.\nDvirWi found out that it can detect the clicking inside of chests.\nShort time later, NiceMarkMC made a version that used DvirWi's technique, despite not knowing it was a CUD.\nRedstone Sheep then found out that it would detect most &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; changes and had a chat with NiceMarkMC, giving it the name Tile Entity Data Update Detector (TEDUD).\nNiceMarkMC then uploaded a video of DvirWi's version and called it Tile Entity Update Detector (TEUD) to keep it shorter, and viewers suggested calling it Data Update Detector (DUD) which became a widely used name.\nNiceMarkMC accepted the name DUD, but then renamed it to CUD because the other names were technically incorrect.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"17w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt;), CUDs can no longer detect note blocks, since it is no longer a block entity."}

However, it is generally accepted you 'complete' the game upon killing the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis tutorial shows the steps necessary to locate and enter &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; dimension, and then defeat the ender dragon, as well as killing the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes:\nThe first section of this article is a brief overview on how to finish Minecraft. If you would like to have a more detailed explanation, scroll down, and you will find many steps explaining in great detail how to get to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; and how to kill the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nWhen first beginning a game of Survival or Hardcore (recommended for true adventure style, and it\u2019s also really hard), collect &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; from nearby trees. Wood is needed to create a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and a wooden &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. The wooden pickaxe is necessary to harvest &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow you to create a &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe and a minimum of 1 furnace, although 3 are recommended later on. Also useful at the &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; level, a stone &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is advised as one needs to upgrade to iron next, and it is likely that will take a while and night will probably come before then, and some degree of protection is advised. After a stone pickaxe is obtained, use it to harvest a minimum of 3 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and a minimum of 1 &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended to harvest 32 iron ingots to create iron &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and an iron sword, along with an &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe and &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. At this stage, if you want to try to go to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; and you are having a hard time finding diamonds, you could also gather an additional 6 iron to make 2 buckets, fill one with water, and find a natural lava pool on the surface. Once you have found it, you can place the water and lava next to each other around a backboard to create a frame. Note that you need to have the lava turn into obsidian quickly, because it will flow down and make it harder to fill the frame.\nNext, it is recommended that players obtain full diamond gear, preferably all enchanted, before venturing into the Nether. A minimum of 31 &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s must be harvested (24 for full armor, 3 for a pickaxe, 2 for a sword and 2 for an enchanting table). Finding a naturally occurring cave or fissure that drops to the last 16 levels of the world will facilitate diamond mining. It is also recommended to look around lava, because you will see more open rock at once. It has never been proven or confirmed that diamonds are generated more around lava pools. Remember, upon finding diamonds, dig around them first to ensure that they won't fall into lava and burn. A &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; of water is found to be very useful as one bucket can diffuse an entire lake of lava, and still retain the bucket. You need 5 diamonds to start progressing: the first three should go to a diamond pickaxe for mining obsidian and the other two for an enchanting table. If 2 more diamonds can be found, it is recommended to craft a diamond sword. Also, grab any &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ore\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; (for golden apples), &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli%20Ore\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; (for enchanting) that you see and at least some of the &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Ore\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; (for potions). If still in the bowels of the world, it is likely obsidian may have been spotted. A minimum of 10 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; must be harvested using a diamond pickaxe to create a frame for a nether portal and an enchanting table. Once a minimum of 10 obsidian has been harvested, return to the surface, collecting 1 &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; on the journey up. 1 iron ingot will also be needed. If you are having trouble finding diamonds, you can also find diamond from structures such as &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.\nOnce breathing fresh air again, decide whether to collect &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s or collect &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s first. Note that ender pearls can aid in traversing nether terrain, however ender pearls are valuable resources. If you decided to harvest ender pearls, aim for a bare minimum of 12, though a highly recommended number is between 15 and 20. You can find ender pearls 3 ways: \n1. The simplest choice but possibly the most dangerous, killing &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;. Endermen rarely spawn in the Overworld, but if you have access to the Nether, they will spawn frequently in a &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt;. \n2. If you happen to find a village, expert-level Clerics have a 2/3 chance of trading 5 &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;emeralds&lt;/a&gt; for an ender pearl, which is the safest way but might be the most time-consuming. \n3. If you have lots of spare &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ingot\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and access to the Nether, you can barter it to &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt;. Piglins have a small chance of giving you 2-4 ender pearls if given a gold ingot. Make sure to collect a lot of gold if you go this route. \nIf you chose to collect blaze rods, proceed to build a nether portal frame, and craft a &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;. 14 blocks of obsidian are needed for a full portal, but you can skimp on the corners if you don't have much obsidian and the portal will still work. It is also recommended to have a stack of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; to use as markers when venturing through &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Activate the portal with the &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, and enter the nether. Once in the Nether, locate a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, proceed to locate &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, and neutralize them until you have harvested enough blaze rods to account for half of the ender pearls you have or plan on having. It is recommended to obtain at least 10 blaze rods, but more are good. 1 blaze rod will create 2 &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce the &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; have been obtained, combine the two to create &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;. Bring at least 3 for locating an end portal, and 12 for filling the end portal, although most end portals already have 1 or 2 eyes of ender already in them. Launch an eye of ender to obtain a starting direction, and head that way. Launch another eye of ender once in a while to ensure the correct path is being followed, and that the nearest portal hasn't been passed. Ensure that the eyes are recollected at every given chance. When an eye heads into the ground, a portal has been located. At this point, one can attempt to find a cave that leads to the stronghold (true adventure style), or mine a spiral stair all the way down, so as to avoid digging straight down. Try to avoid falling into the pit of lava which is found under every portal.\nOnce the portal has been physically located, activate every frame and the portal to the end will be revealed. Enter and prepare for a long and somewhat uneventful fight. A &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; with Power and Infinity, a diamond sword with Sharpness, full diamond armor and several slow falling potions are recommended, or you can take a water bucket instead.\nFighting the dragon is very difficult. Shoot the non-caged crystals with your bow, climb to the top of the caged towers, break into the cages and destroy the crystals. If the dragon launches you into the air, drink a slow falling potion or place a water bucket on the ground just before impact. Watch out for the dragon's breath and shoot the dragon with arrows. Periodically, the dragon flies down to the end portal, and it become immune to arrows. Melee attack it, but beware of its head attack. If the dragon is not killed then, the dragon will fly away, once again vulnerable to arrows. Continue this combat until depleting the dragon's health bar, at which point the dragon will explode in a spectacular white explosion. A large amount of experience will fall from the sky. At this point, the end portal will open. Jump into it to see the end credits and complete the game.\nStep 1: Building the nether portal.\nAfter you have played in a Minecraft world for a while, hopefully, you have acquired at least four &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s along the way, whether you smelted them or found them in a chest. You will need to craft three of the ingots into at least one bucket that will be used to create &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;. The only other way to make a nether portal without &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s involves mining already-created &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; with a diamond pickaxe. Acquire a piece of &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt;, as well.\nThe easiest way to make a nether portal \"without\" a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20pickaxe\"&gt;diamond pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;:\n1) With your iron, craft a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;. One bucket is all you need, but the more buckets you have, the more efficient this job is going to be.\n2) Fill a bucket with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. If you have more than one, fill all but one with lava, and the last one with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\n3) Make the shape below using &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. (note that these are all top view)\n4) Place water over the lava blocks. The lava should have turned to &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. If it turned to &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, then the lava was flowing and not a solid source block. Break the cobblestone, put lava in it and try again. It should work this time.\n5) Place on the top of the previous blocks following:\n6) Place water over the two lava blocks.\n7) Do step 5 and 6 two times more on top of the current layer.\n8) Finish the top with a shape similar to the bottom.\n 9) Remove all dirt blocks. From the side, it should look something like this. \n10) Make a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; with your flint and iron and use it to light the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 2: The Nether.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20survival\"&gt;Nether Survival&lt;/a&gt;\"\nFirst of all, gear up. The nether is dangerous, especially with all the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and the creepy hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Pack away anything unrelated to weapons and food. Equip yourself with following items:\nStep 4: Boss fights.\nThere are two bosses in Minecraft (three in Bedrock Edition): the Ender Dragon, the Wither, and the Elder Guardian\u200c. \nEnder Dragon.\n\"For a full guide, see: &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20the%20ender%20dragon\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAt this point, you are in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. It is made up of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; and is filled with &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a single &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; flying around, assuming this is your first time in the End in that world. Note that you can come back to The End at any time after you have killed the ender dragon, and it will not have respawned, if you do not respawn it. WARNING: You cannot get out of the End until you destroy the dragon!\nWither.\n\"For a full guide, see: &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20the%20wither\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating the wither&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThe Elder Guardian.\nIn the middle of a vast &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, there may lie a gigantic &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;, with treasures of &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20gold\"&gt;blocks of gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wet%20sponge\"&gt;wet sponge&lt;/a&gt;s. The mobs inside are dangerous, however. It is the place where 3 &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Guardians\"&gt;Elder Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, which are considered Bosses , spawn."}

They can be part of the &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt;, possess a &lt;a href=\"stony%20peaks\"&gt;barren surface made of stone&lt;/a&gt;, or have &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt;. Conquering a mountain can be quite a challenge, especially for unprepared players, due to the several dangers, including deep patches of &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;, the ramming &lt;a href=\"goats\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, its steep and towering heights. However, not all mountains are generated equally as it can sometimes just be a big meadow hill or a short mountain peak, so it's best to find one with very tall terrain and a \"peak\" biome. \nThere are many reasons for conquering a mountain. Perhaps you want to harvest its massive reserves of &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; (Snowy slopes and frozen peaks only), &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt; (Jagged peaks only), &lt;a href=\"Log\"&gt;spruce wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; (except Snowy slopes), or even &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Ore\"&gt;emerald ore&lt;/a&gt; or build something cool on top, or try to find a &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; underground for an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Exploring%20an%20ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient city&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe you simply want to do it for the fun or challenge."}

This tutorial will help you construct some of the most useful as well as some of the most impressive buildings available to \"Minecraft\".\nBasic house.\nA basic house is anything from a 5\u00d75 square to a castle the size of a Minecraft world. They can be made of any material, in any biome, anywhere. The most common type of starter house is a hole dug into a hill or mountain (similar to the Cave House). \nThe Cube.\nYou can make a cube house which is a shelter when you come back from mining or fighting, for example.\nThe Fortress.\nThis is the best choice if you wish to create a permanent base. This consists of a large fortified wall with an overhang to keep spiders out, as well as a wet or dry moat (optional). This will surround your entire settlement. This means your farms, houses and any other buildings you have will be protected. You may also wish to build a secondary fortification inside as well as a real-world castle (see topic below), just in case of a breach. In addition, you will want to build guard towers in each corner of the compound. This is to help keep your walls clean of mobs. These towers, if possible, should protrude from the corners so that you can clearly see and shoot anything near your wall. Be able to do this for the entire length of the wall to the next corner, or minimally to the halfway point between the two towers. This type of building is recommended for a player with large amounts of resources at their disposal.\nThe Castle.\nEssentially the cube, except it has battlements containing (imaginary) snipers and cannons. One of the major differences between the castle and the cube is that the castle is supposed to actually look good. To make it look good you can extend out your cube and add blocks or slabs on every second block.\nThe cobblestone can be replaced with any block.\nBuild this on all 4 sides of your castle using cobblestone, wood, or both!\nAbove-ground Bunker.\nA half-buried structure, it has the conveniences of underground shelters with the provision for windows which double as above-ground firing ports. You enter from the top, which has a trapdoor.\nAlso, iron doors or trapdoors are a good choice when keeping the hordes\nout, or even better an underground system of tunnels connecting to multiple pillboxes or a base. \nFree-standing Structure.\nA basic house that is built on flat land and is completely open. These houses are easy to spot and maybe multiple floors. On average, these houses use anywhere between 2 and 10 stacks of materials.\nCave House.\nInstead of having to build a house, use what \"Minecraft\" provides you, and build your house in a cave or other naturally-generated structure. They use minimal resources but may cost a significant number of pickaxes. They are hard to see, and a landmark is recommended. It is also helpful to acquire useful items like stone, iron, and coal while you're digging out an area for your house.\nLean-to.\nA house that is a part-free-standing house, and part-cave. An ideal combination of both worlds. The pickaxes are used here to gather materials for the main house while making more room underground.\nSpace Needle.\nThese houses are basically a large point leading up to a crazy height. They offer excellent views, and are quite &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;-resistant, especially if the bottom few layers are made of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are very hard to expand, cost extremely high amounts of materials, and are rather monotonous to ascend. Building an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Elevators\"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt;, preferably a two-way design, would solve the third problem.\nBunkmates.\nIf you find an NPC Village, you can make your home in a villager's house! These are ready-generated houses handy for you to use, and expansion can be done with the help of a few spare materials.\nPlease note that if you are not on peaceful mode, you may cause a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20siege\"&gt;zombie siege&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimple-framed Building.\nA simple and good-looking house can be made by making 4-to-5-block-high pillars arranged in a square or rectangle. These pillars can be made of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. Join them at the top with &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; beams. Then fill in the gaps with wooden &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;. You can also add windows. To make a roof cover the top and place wooden &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; on it, arranged in a pitched fashion. &lt;a href=\"Log\"&gt;Log&lt;/a&gt;s and white stained clay (or &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;) can be used instead to make a Tudor house.\nUnderground Shelter.\nThis is a type of building under the ground, like a bombing shelter or nuke shelter. This is for a more hidden type of shelter under the ground/ocean and makes a nonpublic safe house. They may be hard to find, so create a landmark to let you know it's there. It is safer than a shelter above ground. Advantages are no one/thing can find you, and you are more protected. You can also use it as a point where you can have a mine. Disadvantages are you can't have windows, so you have to actually exit your shelter to see outside (or make a hole in the ground to see outside) and the fact that every expansion requires a pickaxe. Also, if you break a hole and there's lava or water, you are stuck and you are very likely to die.\nCast and Molding.\nCasting and molding are slightly different than other methods. \nFor molding, one uses or or another cheap, non-flammable material to fill in all the blocks they want hollow. Then, they fill it in with wait for it to settle, cover the source block, cover in , and, lastly, break the dirt. \nCasting means one fills layer by layer with lava source blocks and pours water over them, turning it into obsidian. It is very difficult as one needs a diamond pickaxe for mistakes and large amounts of buckets for effective transport of water and/or lava, not to mention the high danger of working with lava. For a large amount of lava needed, it is advisable to either find one or more lava lakes or to go to the Nether. (more to come)\nFor something new, try lava on a tree, then just add water when it seems right to you.\n&lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; House.\nThis is basically any type of house built in the Nether. It is highly recommended that you make it out of a blast-resistant block, such as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick\"&gt;nether brick&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have much resources, use some &lt;a href=\"warped%20stem\"&gt;warped stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crimson%20stem\"&gt;crimson stem&lt;/a&gt;s, and/or &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandmarks.\nMountain Marking.\nA simple way to mark a spot, if it is next a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; or extreme-hills biome, is to put some torches on the top. You can also add lava on them.\nStatue.\nStatues, especially big ones, can be used to indicate a certain spot.\nMaterials needed:\nLight Beacon.\nBeacons/Pillars can be used to mark the location of a house/structure.\nMaterials needed:\nYou could also use a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; block, but these are expensive to make and cannot be crafted early in the game.\nNavigational Towers and Lighthouses.\nNavigational towers and lighthouses can be created to help you find your way home after a trip to say, the beach. You'll need enough of some kind of block to make a tower of your desired height, a light source, and enough ladders to climb that tower.\nLava Pillar.\nAnother useful landmark tool is a lava pillar. Though slightly more costly than a lighthouse, it can be spotted much more easily, during the day or night. To build one, you need one bucket of lava, and enough materials to build one pillar of your desired height.\nFlaming &lt;a href=\"Netherrack\"&gt;Netherrack&lt;/a&gt; Piles.\nYou can also find your way home with burning netherrack piles. Just put a lot of netherrack on a hill or a mountain, and set the whole thing on fire. Once trees and grass burn down, it can become quite easy to see houses.\nPillar and Frames.\nTo do this, you require item frames, and the items you intend to use to indicate such a structure.\nFor example, you can designate a mine by building a pillar and putting a pickaxe on the item frames on all four sides of the pillar.\nExamples include:\nFarms.\nFarms are ways of getting &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resource\"&gt;renewable resource&lt;/a&gt;s in a relatively time-efficient manner. See the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials%23Item%20Farming\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials%23Mob%20Farming\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; farming tutorials for more information."}

Your mileage \"will\" vary elsewhere, as the &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; have changed a little bit.\nBefore even attempting this, you should &lt;a href=\"Setting%20up%20a%20server%23Mac%20OS%20X\"&gt;run a server instance by hand&lt;/a&gt;, to make sure everything works. If you are able to run your server and actually connect to it from a remote computer, you can start thinking about creating a daemon.\nWord of interest about sudo.\nIt's best to always use codice_1 for each command needed to do as root. Many people believe that codice_2 is the best option. Although this may be easier, it's also much more dangerous to do so. Forgetting you're as root and doing something awkward gives you more chances to destroy your computer.\nIt is much safer and therefore strongly recommended to first move to the proper folder and then do the action for a precise file or folder. This is becausemany people who have tried to create this without moving it to the proper folder, have mistakenly pressed return while doing a nasty command and applied it to their whole computer. It's preferable that you don't learn to move it to the proper folder first the hard way.\nThe final reason that it's better to use codice_1, is because every sudo command is logged in your Console, meaning you know what happens, and if you made something incorrect, you can review your log and know what you did to try to repair it. Doing a codice_2 will only show that. However, it's your computer, it's your habits, do whatever you want with it!\nCreating a _minecraft daemon user and group.\nThis section is technically optional, but for security considerations, you should do it, preferably &lt;a href=\"%23The_hard_.28and_correct.29_way\"&gt;the \"hard and correct way\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is very important to do one of the following methods, specifically the hard and correct way, as if you don't do anything, anybody who hacks your computer through Minecraft will be able to do anything they want. Therefore, if you don't want this to happen, you should do it the hard and correct way.\nThe easy (and incorrect) way.\nOnce you have finished these steps, you are done! However, this creates a full-fledged user, whilst Mac OS X expects a daemon user. As a side bonus, you can run this as your own personal user, or any other possibilities for users. However, if your Minecraft user gets hacked, the hacker will have a full account to have fun, accessing all your software, and be able to modify everything that's public. Therefore, although this method may be easy, it is not entirely safe, which is why it is recommended to create the _minecraft daemon user and group the hard way.\nThe hard (and correct) way.\nThe user will be created with an underscore first, denoting it's a daemon and should be hidden from user view. It will also be created with a daemon UID.\nWe will use &lt;a href=\"http%3A//developer.apple.com/library/mac/%23documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dscl.1.html\"&gt;dscl&lt;/a&gt; to create a user and group. Obviously, it needs to be done with privileges. Open Terminal and type\nLet's move to the base folder for what we need to do (less typing)\nIf you are running a Mac OS X Server use Apple's supplied Workgroup Manager [WGM] to create the user, group and home folders with minimal effort. Make sure you use ID numbers less than 1024 (300 is used in this example).\nIf you have other directory authentication, you might have to move to an other folder instead of Local. Use the codice_5 command to view the different folders. To know if you are in the good place, you should have a Users folder with different underscore-prefixed names (like _coreaudiod, _softwareupdate and _www).\nCreating the group (GID).\nThis will show up a list of all the created groups on your computer, along with their GIDs. It doesn't matter what they are, just an empty GID is wanted, potentially in the daemon range (less than 500). Verify if 300 is unused.\nAt this point, your group should be created, and assigned the 300 (or any number you chose) GID. You can verify it with the codice_6 command and you can compare it to others with the codice_7 command.\nCreating the user (UID).\nThis will show up a list of all the created users on your computer, along with their UIDs. Again, it doesn't matter what they are, but an empty UID is necessary, again in the daemon range (less than 500). Verify if 300 is unused. You can select a different UID and GID, they need not to be identical, but it's certainly tidier if they are.\nThis created your user. Obviously you need to modify the UniqueID (UID) for the one you chose in this step, and the PrimaryGroupID for the one you chose in the &lt;a href=\"%23Creating_the_group_.28GID.29\"&gt;previous section&lt;/a&gt;. You can also choose a different home directory. You can put your Minecraft folder with the other users, but it's fine to put this anywhere you want, really.\nLike for the GID, you can use codice_8 and codice_9 to make sure everything is all right.\nNow, we said to the user we have a group (PrimaryGroupID) but we need to tell the group it has users:\nAnd we're done!\nYou might want something like this to prevent the user from showing up in the login dropdown:\nCreating the user home.\nWe now need to create the home folder. Assuming you previously described it as codice_10, please type:\nWhoa, there are many codice_11 here! Here is a version where you can understand something (don't go run this, that said!)\nHere ... better! If these commands go through, it means your user and group were properly created in the previous steps. At this point, the ls -la should give you something like\nMoving the server files.\nThat's a walk in the park compared to what we went through. First, make sure your Minecraft server is not actually running, or you'll definitely lose data! Then...\nOf course, you want to adjust as needed, with the starting path being where you actually installed your Minecraft server in the first place, and please look-up &lt;a href=\"%23Creating_the_user_home\"&gt;the previous section&lt;/a&gt; for an explanation of the chown command. \"And please don't forget the dot at the end of the mv command, it's barely visible but it's there, it means the destination is our current folder! Otherwise, command will fail\"\nTip #1: If you press Tab once, it will auto-complete the name of the file/folder for you. That's very useful for quickly writing special characters like the evil space bar that needs to be written with a backslash first.\nTip #2: If you press Tab twice, it will show you all possible auto-completion possibilities, to give you a quick choice if you forgot how it's actually written.\nTip for the astute reader: Instead of doing a chown once in the previous step, and a chown at this step, it's quicker to simply move the folder, and chown -R the resulting folder. One less command. The reason why it is recommended to do it twice is to make sure your User and Group are properly created in the previous step. But no reason.\nSupport files.\nYou need a few files in order to make this work adequately. It could be done with less files, but it's more readable that way. Please copy them carefully and modify what has to be modified accordingly. One good option is to use &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.vim.org\"&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt; as a text editor since it keeps my carriage returns at their proper places and doesn't try to be intelligent with me. However, it's also (with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\"&gt;emacs&lt;/a&gt;) one of the hardest editor to use, from another era. GUI-wise, Apple TextEdit should be fine for this, as long as you follow the instructions from the &lt;a href=\"Setting%20up%20a%20server%23Mac%20OS%20X\"&gt;Mac OS X Setting up a server&lt;/a&gt; page (IE: Make as Plain Text).\nNote: these should be created in a temporary location, like your desktop. Instructions for moving to the final location are further below.\nminecraft.command.\nExplanation.\nBack in school, I'm doing so much learning.\nTermination.\nMac OS X Launchd sends a SIGTERM (control-c or signal 15) to kill a daemon. Java plain returns when it receives one. Hence you need to codice_12 it before it reaches java. The whole codice_13 code could be added to the trap line (with many codice_14 and codice_15, but it'd be messy.)\nThe codice_16 script needs to be asynchronously started and codice_17 upon, as trap needs to exit codice_17 to execute properly &lt;a href=\"http%3A//tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_12_02.html\"&gt;See trap examples and explanation here.&lt;/a&gt;\nstop.sh.\nstdin redirection.\nIn the other Unix-like systems, the codice_19 command is used to create a separate screen TTY to execute the java system in. The main advantage being to be able to switch to that screen if someone wants to directly interact with the server. That would work if you were to put the launchd plist in your personal user folder, but it will not work in the startup daemon, and it's specifically not supported by launchd, although you can get an up-to-date screen that won't cause problems.\nThere are multiple ways to send out commands, including a mkfifo that will work well, but will cause problems with carriage returns. So, it is preferable to use a file, and append the commands you want to send to the java through a pipe.\nTermination.\nThe tail command will automatically terminate once java terminates.\nSupport files - A Variant.\nThe above may not work for some people for several reasons: the tail command never terminated, and launchd wasn't working properly with start.sh and stop.sh running in subshells. Also, it's best to have a clean shutdown where the server is told to save-all and stop rather than just being killed.\nminecraft.command: \nIn the above we source start.sh and stop.sh, rather than running them in subshells. We need java to run in the background though, so start.sh is changed to do that. It also saves the PID in minecraft.pid. Because tail wasn't exiting, I used a fifo too.\nstart.sh:\nNote that if you do not use craftbukkit, but rather the regular server. where it reads \"craftbukkit.jar\" it should read \"minecraft_server.jar\" Finally stop is changed to stop the server cleanly.\nstop.sh:\nSupport File - Singular.\nIt is not necessary to maintain multiple shell script files to launch and terminate Minecraft. The single script file below will suffice:\nnet.minecraft.server.plist.\nPlease modify your codice_20 accordingly, or remove that section altogether if you wish to run it as root. You should also modify your codice_21 to point to the proper path. The label is what will be shown in the Console tool.\nCopying and testing files.\nShell scripts.\nOnce you have created your files on your desktop, you can copy them:\nAgain, don't forget the dot at the end of codice_22 command.\nYou can try executing them (since you are in the good folder, it will work):\nThe command itself should never return, that's all right, but the server should properly start without any error messages, and you should see the java environment being started. You can do codice_23 to terminate the server. Although it seems inviting, you cannot really run any commands from that console, as stdin was redirected from a file, But if you wish, you can start a 2nd terminal and issue commands like codice_24 and they should execute.\nLaunch daemon.\nWe need to tell Mac OS X we wish to start the daemon with the computer when it starts, before you get to the login screen. That's a mere copy away from that point:\nAt this point, when you reboot your computer, it should automatically start your server! You can try it out immediately using the following line:\nThat should load your Minecraft server in its proper user. You should verify it's there and without errors by going to Console and looking at the System Log. You should also verify in the Activity Monitor tool the process was started, and is running under the _minecraft user. Obviously, trying to run a Minecraft game might be a nice thing to do.\nAt any time, you can unload the server (but remember it will start automatically when you reboot your computer unless you move away the file:\nAutomatic Startup/Shutdown.\nYou may wish to not have your server running all the time if no one is connected to it. This can be accomplished with just one more script :)\nBefore setting this up, get the 'Variant' method above working, as this will work best with it.\nserver_daemon.command.\nInstead of setting the launchd codice_25 file to run codice_26, set it to run codice_27 instead, after placing it in the server directory.\nExplanation.\nThis script listens for activity on the default \"Minecraft\" port, 25565 and runs the server when a connection is made. Because \"Minecraft\" clients send the username upon first contact, this script uses that to check if the player has access to the server, and ignores them if they don't. This could be changed to allow anyone to remotely start the server by removing the 'if' statement. Note that users must connect twice on a cold run: once to launch the server, and again once it is up and running.\nNext, the script simply checks periodically to see if there are any active connection on the \"Minecraft\" port, and if not, it waits for the server to shutdown before listening again for more connections.\nAreas for Improvement.\nThis script creates a lot of temporary files in the server directory, maybe they could be put in /tmp or in a temporary subdirectory?\nThis script does not use environment variables to customize settings such as port number and timeout interval.\nBackup considerations.\nIt's quite easy to start up regular backups. By extension, adding a backup codice_28 and command file is nearly a no-brainer. The following code will execute every hour, only when Minecraft is actually running, will stop the save, wait for the console to show saving was done, and start it back after you're done backing it up.\nTip #1: add your own backup code at the comment, or else, it will do nothing :)\nTip #2: this code runs as root. You can make it run as another user if you wish, like creating a second user in the same _minecraft group, meaning the backup system will be able to read the files but not modify them. That's left to the reader!\nTip #3: this code might receive a shutdown request, so there really should be a codice_12 command or else it could get interrupted while it's backing up.\nbackup.command.\n= Tying it up =\nThis article is rather loose, so please help clean this article up, or if you know much about this subject, add information or clarify existing information."}

If you simply want to add custom &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28Java%20Edition%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"loot%20table\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;s to your game, look into how to make a &lt;a href=\"Data%20pack\"&gt;Data pack&lt;/a&gt;, which does not require programming. Or look into how to make a &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt; if you simply want to customize textures (colors and designs), &lt;a href=\"model\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"splash\"&gt;splash&lt;/a&gt;es, fonts, or the &lt;a href=\"end%20poem\"&gt;end poem&lt;/a&gt;.\nOr perhaps you want to 'fork' a favorite mod to update for newer versions of Minecraft. In any case, this guide will eventually cover only the most basic elements of creating an item and creating an entity (a moving thing like a villager, sheep, zombie, etc.), and distributing the resulting mod package.\nMinecraft mods consist of jar files (example: yournewmod.jar) which contain class files, JSON files, and image files, to name a few of the most common.\nIf you have been playing Minecraft \"Java Edition\", you probably already have &lt;a href=\"https%3A//java.com/en/download/faq/java_win64bit.xml%23Java%2520for%252064-bit\"&gt;JRE&lt;/a&gt; (Java Runtime Environment). To develop a mod, you will need to find JDK (Java Development Kit), which includes the JRE and an emulator. Create a free account at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\"&gt;oracle.com&lt;/a&gt; and download JDK Standard Edition version 8. Then follow the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html%23CHDEBCCJ\"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; for installing it, and make note of the location it installs to. Pay particular attention to the section on \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html%23BABGDJFH\"&gt;Updating the PATH Environment Variable&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWith a Java Development Kit installed, and the IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment to manipulate Java with, you now have the tools to develop custom software that can be used in a variety of applications. While working on a mod, continue working through Java tutorials. The lessons will enable you to put your ideas into action, while the ideas will make the lessons more interesting and memorable.\nOne more tool you should set up before starting a mod is the Forge \"MDK\" (Mod Development Kit). &lt;a href=\"Forge\"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of useful resources and mod loader, designed specifically to simplify compatibility between Minecraft \"Java Edition\" and multiple community-created mods. This tutorial will focus on the MDK for version 1.12.2 of Minecraft \"Java Edition\", although Forge for 1.14.4 has been around for some time. An alternative to Forge is &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fabricmc.net/\"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt;, but Java is still used to code mods either way.\nThings not to do.\nThere are some things that you should be careful to not do when creating a mod. Keep this list in mind:\nFirst steps with Forge.\nThis wiki article aims to provide a foolproof walk-through of a few key elements of Forge's tutorial: https://mcforge.readthedocs.io. Bookmark their page, as it addresses many issues this article will not. Moreover, there's more than one valid way to achieve the desired result; this wiki article will focus on the simplest, which is probably not the most efficient or elegant. If you follow precisely the steps outlined here, you should soon have a functional mod, which you can then tinker with to your heart's content. If you use Linux, Forge's tutorial will probably be more useful for you. If you use Windows, read on.\nA note about placeholders.\nThis tutorial will use \"You\" to represent the User profile you are logged in with; if you copy-paste paths from this tutorial, be sure to replace \"You\" with your own Windows username. This tutorial will use \"yournewmod\" to represent sections you should replace with the mod name you choose for your project.\n1. Create a folder for your project.\nNavigate to codice_1 and create a new folder. The name of this folder may be changed easily later.\n2. Obtain a \"source distribution\".\nVisit https://files.minecraftforge.net and make sure the version selected is the version for which you want to create a mod. In the large \"Download Recommended\" box, click on the small MDK box. A dialog box will appear, asking where you want to save the file, and what to name it. Choose any convenient location, but leave the name unchanged.\n3. Copy key files to your project folder.\nOpen the \"forge-1.16.5-...-mdk\" folder (with or without unzipping it first) and copy-paste the following 5 files from this folder to the project folder you created in the first step: \n3\u00bd. A note about mappings.\nThere are two different sets of mappings available for method names - \"MCP\" community-based mappings, and \"Official\" mappings based in part on the official &lt;a href=\"Obfuscation%20map\"&gt;Obfuscation map&lt;/a&gt;s (though class names are different for technical reasons). The default in the MDK has recently been changed to 'official', but this tutorial will use the MCP mappings for now because function parameter names are not available in the official mappings.\nChange the following line in codice_6 line 34\n mappings channel: 'official', version: '1.version.minorversion'\nto\n mappings channel: 'snapshot', version: 'anyName-1.version.minorversion'\n4. Import the gradle project.\nOpen/Run the IntelliJ IDEA program. In the landing screen, click on Open. A dialog box will appear, asking which file to import. Navigate to your project folder and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20190711103354/https%3A//imgur.com/RERxnaM\"&gt;select \"build.Gradle,\"&lt;/a&gt; then click OK.\n5. Designate the JDK.\nIn the next window, click in the \"Gradle JVM\" field and navigate to the JDK files you installed earlier. If you got version 8 update 282, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20230508120445/https%3A//imgur.com/k3BbGcl\"&gt;select the folder&lt;/a&gt; named \"jdk1.8.0_282.\" Click OK and wait for the build to finish, Showing the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20190711103354/https%3A//imgur.com/fgJMDlk\"&gt;results in the bottom field&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"[TODO: I didn't get another window, need to verify what happens on a fresh IDEA install]\"\n\"[Note: Confirming that on IntelliJ IDEA 2021.1.2 window doesn't appear, most likely that it detects JDK itself, so it will only appear if it failed to locate appropriate JDK]\"\n6. Set up workspace.\nNo Dependencies needed to be Installed. Move to next step as new update in Forge command setupDecompWorkspace is not needed\n7. Configure Run settings.\nAfter refreshing gradle, open the gradle panel and double-click the \"genIntellijRuns\" entry in the \"fg_runs\" folder. This will create new run configurations that allow your mod to be run. Next, open the \"Edit configurations\" window of Run settings and look approximately halfway down, for \"Use classpath of module.\" Click on its dropdown field, and select the option that ends with codice_8, then click Apply. If the settings you just finished editing were for the Minecraft Client, click on Minecraft Server and repeat the steps to set the classpath. \"[TODO: Is this necessary anymore? It was already set]\"\nYou can now select and run codice_9 in the run configuration drop down menu. This will start the Launcher with your mod included. When you get to the landing menu, you can check whether your mod is present.\nCreating a mod for Forge.\nIdentifying your mod.\nThe project as delivered with the MDK is called \"examplemod\" with the package name \"com.example.examplemod\". You will need to rename this to your own names in the following places\n- rename the class files\n- build.gradle\n- META-INF/mods.toml\nPackage names should be based on a domain name in reverse order, or a name that is not a valid domain name if you do not own a domain name.\n\"[TODO clearer instructions, set up MODID variable]\"\nSetting up Item Registration.\nYou can create a class to put your definitions in. Here we call it ModItems, though in theory you could just add it to the main class. Having at least one class file (or, ideally, a package) to put registrations in without any non registration related code provides better organization for when you expand your mod.\nFirstly, create a DeferredRegister of type Item. This is effectively a list that is used to register items. Then, in order to register an item, create a RegistryObject as shown below.\npackage com.example.examplemod;\nimport net.minecraft.item.Item;\nimport net.minecraft.item.ItemGroup;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.RegistryObject;\nimport net.minecraftforge.registries.DeferredRegister;\nimport net.minecraftforge.registries.ForgeRegistries;\npublic class ModItems {\n public static final DeferredRegister&lt;Item&gt; ITEMS\n = DeferredRegister.create(ForgeRegistries.ITEMS, ExampleMod.MOD_ID);\n public static final RegistryObject&lt;Item&gt; ITEM_NAME = ITEMS.register(\"ITEM_NAME\",\n () -&gt; new Item(new Item.Properties().tab(CreativeModeTab.TAB_MISC)));\nIf you want to add more options add . [dot] at the end of , CreativeModeTab.TAB_MISC) \"\nwhen its completed register item in your item class like this:\npublic static void register(IEventBus eventBus){\n ITEMS.register(eventBus);\nthen in your main class constructor add the code to create an event bus and register:\nIEventBus eventBus = FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus();\nModItems.register(eventBus);\nor you can do with this code below.\nIn your main class, set it up to automatically be called at the appropriate time, in the codice_10 constructor:\nModItems.ITEMS.register(FMLJavaModLoadingContext.get().getModEventBus());\nAnd now you need to translate this item. Inside resources add a directory named assets and inside add lang like this\nJSON and Texture Files.\nLanguage File.\n\"resources\\assets\\examplemod\\lang\\en_us.json\" (&lt;- en_us.json is the language)\ninside \"en_us.json\" write:\n \"item.examplemod.ITEM_NAME\": \"TRANSLATED_NAME\",\nthe item.examplemod.ITEM_NAME needs to match the name you put inside ModItems class [where your items are].\nItem Model File.\n\"resources\\assets\\examplemod\\models\\item\\item_name.json\"\nInside add the following.\n \"parent\": \"item/generated\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"layer0\": \"tutorialmod:item/item_name\"\n\"item/generated\" is the default with no special features for rendering.\nTexture File.\n\"resources\\assets\\examplemod\\textures\\item\\item_name.png\"\nThis is where you should add your texture image file.\nCreating a Custom Block.\nSetting up Block Registration.\nFirstly, create a new DeferredRegister of type block which will be used to register any blocks. Make sure to import \"net.minecraft.block\" rather than any of the other options.\npublic static final DeferredRegister&lt;Block&gt; BLOCKS = DeferredRegister.create(ForgeRegistries.BLOCKS, ExampleMod.MOD_ID);\nNext, you need to register the method with the IEventBus parameter. If you have a separate ModBlocks class then add the following method to it, otherwise add it to your already existing register method.\npublic static void register(IEventBus eventBus) {\n BLOCKS.register(eventBus);\nTo create blocks easily add the following two helper methods to your class. \"registerBlock\" registers the block while \"registerBlockItem\" registers the associated item.\nprivate static &lt;T extends Block&gt;RegistryObject&lt;T&gt; registerBlock(String name, Supplier&lt;T&gt; block) {\n RegistryObject&lt;T&gt; toReturn = BLOCKS.register(name, block);\n registerBlockItem(name, toReturn);\n return toReturn;\nprivate static &lt;T extends Block&gt; void registerBlockItem(String name, RegistryObject&lt;T&gt; block) {\n ModItems.ITEMS.register(name, () -&gt; new BlockItem(block.get(),\n new Item.Properties().group(ModItemGroup.TUTORIAL_GROUP)));\nFinally, like with items add the register call to your main class.\nModBlocks.register(eventBus);\nRegistering the Custom Block.\nThe following code shows how to add a simple block.\npublic static final RegistryObject&lt;Block&gt; EXAMPLE_BLOCK = registerBlock(\"example_block\", () -&gt; new Block(AbstractBlock.Properties.create(Material.ROCK).harvestLevel(2).harvestTool(ToolType.PICKAXE).setRequiresTool().hardnessAndResistance(5f)));\nBlockstates JSON.\n\"resources/assests/examplemod/blockstates/example_block.JSON\"\n \"variants\": {\nLanguage File.\n\"resources\\assets\\examplemod\\lang\\en_us.json\" (&lt;- en_us.json is the language)\n\"block.examplemod.example_block\": \"Example Block\",\nBlock Model JSON.\n\"resources\\assets\\examplemod\\models\\block\\example_block.json\"\n \"parent\": \"block/cube_all\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"all\": \"examplemod:block/example_block\"\nAssociated Item Model JSON.\n\"resources\\assets\\examplemod\\models\\item\\example_block.json\"\n \"parent\": \"examplemod:block/example_block\"\nTexture.\n\"resources\\assets\\examplemod\\textures\\block\\example_block.png\"\nPut your texture image here.\nCreating a Custom Tool.\nLet's make a simple spear, with damage ability similar to a stone sword.\nSo, to start off with we need to make a new directory called tools in your package. Next create a new Java enum called ModItemTier. In this file you need to type a variant of the following:package com.example.examplemod;\nimport mcp.MethodsReturnNonnullByDefault;\nimport net.minecraft.item.IItemTier;\nimport net.minecraft.item.Items;\nimport net.minecraft.item.crafting.Ingredient;\nimport java.util.function.Supplier;\n@MethodsReturnNonnullByDefault\npublic enum ModItemTier implements IItemTier {\n CUSTOMNAMEHERE(1, 131, 4.0F, 3.0F, 5, () -&gt; Ingredient.fromItems(Items.FLINT));\n private final Supplier&lt;Ingredient&gt; repairmaterial;\n private final int enchantability;\n private final float attackDamage;\n private final float efficiency;\n private final int maxUses;\n private final int harvestLevel;\n ModItemTier(int harvestLevel, int maxUses, float efficiency, float attackDamage, int enchantability, Supplier&lt;Ingredient&gt; repairmaterial) {\n this.harvestLevel = harvestLevel;\n this.maxUses = maxUses;\n this.efficiency = efficiency;\n this.attackDamage = attackDamage;\n this.enchantability = enchantability;\n this.repairmaterial = repairmaterial;\n @Override\n public int getMaxUses() {\n return this.maxUses;\n @Override\n public float getEfficiency() {\n return this.efficiency;\n @Override\n public float getAttackDamage() {\n return this.attackDamage;\n @Override\n public int getHarvestLevel() {\n return this.harvestLevel;\n @Override\n public int getEnchantability() {\n return this.enchantability;\n @Override\n public Ingredient getRepairMaterial() {\n return this.repairmaterial.get();\nNext, you need to register your item. Go to your item registry class[?] and make a new item like the one here:\npublic static final RegistryObject&lt;SwordItem&gt; NAME_SPEAR = ITEMS.register(\"name_spear\", () -&gt; new SwordItem(ModItemTier.CUSTOMNAMEHERE, 5, -2.8f, (new Item.Properties()).tab(ItemGroup.TAB_COMBAT)));.\nThe numbers are the base attack damage [added to the damage set in the ItemTier] and the speed modifier, the values chosen for the example are intermediate between a sword and an axe.\nAfter this, you need to make a JSON file in src/main/resources/assets/examplemod/models/item called what you set earlier, like so:\n \"parent\": \"item/handheld\",\n \"textures\": {\n \"layer0\": \"examplemod:item/name_spear\"\nThen, go to your textures folder and input the texture you will make in the next step. If you want to know more about durability I recommend &lt;a href=\"https%3A//mcreator.net/wiki/how-make-tool\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.\nTextures from Scratch.\nOpen an image editor, preferably one that supports transparency, and create a new image, with a size that is a multiple of 16x16 (eg. 32x32, 64x64. etc.)\nThis example is using a 32x32 pixel image and is made in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//gimp.org\"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt;. \nCreate your file, making sure it is in pixels and not inches, millimetres, or any other measurement. \nCreate a new layer, and delete the original canvas. If you don't do that, then your image will have a white background. \nUsing a brush of 1x1 pixel, start drawing your item. Make sure to use separate layers for separate parts of the item to allow changes to be made easier. \nWhen you're done creating your art, press file to save. If you're using GIMP or another advanced editor, it won't save as a .png. For GIMP, it saves as a .xcf. \nNavigate to the export dropdown or press codice_11 on Windows or codice_12 for macOS. This is to export the file. Make sure you export as a .png, not a .jpg or any other file extension. If it is not saved as a .png, it will have a white background and won't look correct. \nIf you're following along with this tutorial and wish to use this image, you can download this finished pixel art .\nCreating a Custom Mob.\nModels from Scratch.\nThe best way to model mobs is probably blockbench (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//blockbench.net/\"&gt;blockbench website&lt;/a&gt;). Blockbench is a free modeling tool, and it would be much faster and easier than taking the other approach, which is slow. If you want to model with it, simply make a cube, position it, rotate it, size it, and make your model the way you want to make it. If you need more cubes, you can easily make a new one. This is probably the best method for this. It is fast, easy, and customizable.\nSharing Your Mod.\nTo build your mod, run gradlew build or ./gradlew build for macOS. This will output a file in build/libs with the name [archivesBaseName]-[version].jar. This file can be placed in the mods folder of a forge enabled Minecraft setup, and distributed. Then you can upload your mod to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods\"&gt;CurseForge&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//modrinth.com/mods\"&gt;Modrinth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther Reading.\nhttps://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/\nAdditional Info.\nRecommended: "}
{"id": "35001", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=35001", "title": "Tutorials/Creating a challenge map", "text": "If you want to create a challenge map, but don't know how, or need some pointers, read through this tutorial.\nPlanning.\nIf your map is going to be more than a sequential bunch of random puzzles, it is very helpful to plan out your map in advance.\nThough a plan can range from a simple bullet list to a block-by-block blueprint of the entire world, a good plan should include:\nTypes of Challenge maps.\nBefore you choose to make a challenge map, you need to choose what type of map you want it to be. Here are some types:\nTips and tricks.\nCustomize the Superflat world type.\nChanging the &lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; options can make a good Superflat survival world.\nMake a spawn area.\nYou could make a spawn pad, a pre-made house, or anything you can think of!\nAdd bonuses.\nHide some little rewards for the player. Extra surprises make a challenge map exciting and fun.\n&lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s work well, because it can be a fun way to keep score. If you want a surprise ending for the players to build up to (literally and figuratively), make the maximum bonus count a multiple of 9, only if the prizes are diamonds, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;lapis&lt;/a&gt;, emeralds, or &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; (maybe even &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;!) to make the necessary block; for others, it may vary.\n&lt;a href=\"Beacon\"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt;s give extraordinary powers, so you can add a mystic powers room. Power the beacon so that it produces haste, speed, strength powers etc. You can also add an &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;, the experience farm outlet, and some positive splash &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s (maybe add some negatives for the lulz.)\nMake obstacles.\nAdd pits, traps, and more to your map to make it more interesting and challenging. Check out the Puzzles and Traps section of this page for more. Note that if you want to build something enormous and complicated, such as a giant slime dispenser of doom, you would probably want to have a lot of redstone and/or MCEdit knowledge.\nAdd a kick-death.\nIf you want to make a map to frustrate the player, make people who play the map get kicked by a player with an optional reason. For example, use, \"You are banned from this server! Reason: went to illegal point.\" When the player dies, they are kicked out of the game for 1 minute! However, note that this is very hard to do in vanilla survival, without the codice_1 command being hacked.\nAdd a permanent death.\nMost challenge maps have unlimited tries to solve a puzzle. However, if you make a tripwire that sets a new spawn point for players and the players fail, then they need to re-download the map. In the fail room, add a large game over sign and a message saying: \n\"Unfortunately, you lost all of your tries to complete and you need to re-download the map.\"\nAlternately, you can make a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; that prevents players from moving, as well as a command block saying: \n\"Game over. You must re-download the map.\"\nThis adds an extra degree of difficulty to the map. If you want to warn the players so that they can expect to re-download the map, have a command block say this at the beginning:\n\"Warning! If you fail, then it is game over and you need to re-download the map.\"\nThen players will be extra careful, especially in the \"test your brain\" test!\nMake dungeons.\nMaking pre-made dungeons hidden around your map can give players a very fun time! Dungeons can be used especially when a player can go anywhere in a map, rather than on a set course.\nAdd some fancy stuff.\nUse /give to \"hack\" stuff into your inventory. &lt;a href=\"Monster%20spawner\"&gt;Monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s would be useful for some traps or funboxes (3x3x3 spaces with walls of spawners), or simply decorations. &lt;a href=\"End%20crystal\"&gt;End crystal&lt;/a&gt;s are elegant, but due to their obstructive and explosive powers, they can be used as sorts of obstacles the player has to safely destroy. (Check out the \"Look before you Detonate\" trap!)\nMake a boss.\nYou can make a boss out of &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s. They are a great way to end any map.\nAlso, you could spawn an &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; in a room. Just remember to use the command , so that the bosses won't be able to destroy blocks. Alternatively, add your own boss. Customize your own boss mob by adding extra data tags (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Command%20block%231.7%20uses\"&gt;Tutorials/Command block#1.7 uses&lt;/a&gt;). Even better, create custom mods with your own made-up boss! \"NOTE: To do this, you must be able to use Java programming or data packs (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creating%20a%20data%20pack\"&gt;Tutorials/Creating a data pack&lt;/a&gt;).\"Also, you can download &lt;a href=\"Mods\"&gt;Mods&lt;/a&gt; To make bosses even better!\nOther tips.\nCheckpoints can be created by placing &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s, with &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s underneath them. \nYou may even want to have secret &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a player gets given a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, and if they shoot a button, a secret door or path appears, leading them to a bonus room. It is ideal, though, to have obstacles in the way of the button, so take this into consideration when making the map.\n&lt;a href=\"Bedrock\"&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;s could encase areas where you do not want the player to escape from, and is a genius idea for spawn jails.\nFirework finale.\nWhen you finally finish the map, you can create a fireworks show for celebration. Hook up &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; to some &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, craft up some &lt;a href=\"fireworks\"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt;, and then let them fly! Alternatively, you could just add some diamond dispensers. Either way will look amazing, and are great ways to celebrate the completion of a challenge map.\nIf you don't want to use dispensers, use &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn fireworks.\nTexture Packs.\nTexture packs is a great way of making your world different. It makes it unique, and fun. If you want to make your own texture packs, then the people playing your map will really love it more!\nPuzzles and Traps.\nIdeas.\nBasic parkour.\nMake a large room and put lots of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom. Then, place down blocks over the lava, on which the player has to jump from one to another. Make a small alcove at the top with a chest in it, which is where the player must get to.\nAny blocks sitting next to the wall can be controlled with &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s to extend and then go back into the wall, to time jumps. \n\"Tightropes\" can be made by putting strings of &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cakes Are A Lie.\nPlace 5 &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;s in a line over BUD switches for the player to eat. One of the cakes, when eaten, will push up a small chest area with valuable stuff. The remaining 4 will send the player into a very deep lava pit! If you want, you can have a riddle written out on &lt;a href=\"signs\"&gt;signs&lt;/a&gt;, and have the correct answer on the correct cake.\nThat Hurt!\nCreate a tripwire hooked to an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; that one &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt; is on. The victim will start running, and then get pushed down a hole, causing fall/lava and arrow damage.\nThis trap is avoidable. If the victim runs fast enough and/or realizes, then the victim avoids the trap, but if you put a furnace facing in, the player might think that the dispenser is just an ornate tripwire dropping a prize.\nWhat Tiles?\nCreate a room with a grid of wooden and stone &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s. Only some plates are safe to the player. For example, wood pressure plates are safe to walk on while stone ones push the player into the Void. This can be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"command%20blocks\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt; to teleport the poor helpless victims to y=-64, or just by setting the command block to perform the command codice_2\nBe Flamin' Careful.\nCreate a maze with &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; sides at ground level. Set the netherrack on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Players will find it hard to complete this maze without a scald. To stop them from jumping over the flames put some floating &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt; blocks, two blocks above the maze path. To make it more challenging for the player, make it a maze that climbs upwards and then add a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; with a sign saying \"Trophy,\" which when pulled will create a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow that chases the player, who has to either burn in lava or burn in fire.\nBe smart....\nPut a hard question to solve with 3 answers. To do so, put 3 &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s and 3 &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s with answers. The correct answer will open a path for the player to pass. Others will throw &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; into the room. Take advantage of the fact that &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s can place lava, and then suck it back up. Or, if you wish for a fancier way to kill your hapless victims, you can always use command blocks to do cruel stuff, such as striking a player with a lightning bolt, or blow the player up with instantly detonating &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Here's the command:\nIt's in my way!!!\nIn a very long corridor/mine, put a block at head height and place a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; on it. Connect it to a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; just below a \"huge\" tower of &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;! When the player breaks the torch block, the piston will retract and the gravel will fall down! Alternatively, make a double NOT gate (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Basic%20logic%20gates\"&gt;Tutorials/Basic logic gates&lt;/a&gt;)leading to a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; that teleports the player to a Funbox room! However, this can be bypassed with &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, but you can solve this problem by putting &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom.\nIt's just H2O!\nMake a path that goes slightly underground, then fill it to the ceiling with water. Add some air pockets so your players can breathe, using &lt;a href=\"signs\"&gt;signs&lt;/a&gt; or open &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s. Spawn some &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; to annoy players even more.\nIn third party mods, you could make the squids hostile and make them shoot ink to damage and blind the players. Or you could go for a similar effect in vanilla Minecraft and have some &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s that cause &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt; every time the player touches a squid. In addition, you could use &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, to deal damage, or maybe, even, a room with an &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Bedrock!\"\nMake a BUD switch next to a bed that detects when a player is in that bed. Hook it up to a command block that teleports the player to a bedrock room that you made!\nCreepers.\n&lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s are nice for dealing with your challenge map victims but can blow up parts of your structure, so try building the creeper room out of obsidian and add some inaccessible charged creeper spawners. Alternatively you can use to make it so that &lt;a href=\"creepers\"&gt;creepers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s can't damage the environment.\nAlso, you might want to drop the player into a pit full of creepers. One of the nice things about this is the pit gets bigger as the creepers blow up. Give them a cheap tool such as an iron &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, to kill the creepers with, and add some small elevations or safe spots, or a complex redstone device that can make them invisible. You could also add a disabled \"creeper generator\" that adds in creepers, and the player has to break it to stay alive.\nLook Before You Detonate\nBecause of the fact that &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s explode when broken, you can use these for your advantage when making traps on your custom map.\nPut some lines of TNT underground, 1 block under the floor. Line these up to a central end crystal obstructing the player's way. A simple lesson: look before you detonate something.\nSand Falls....\nTripwires are a very good tool and plays a role in this trap. Place a tripwire, then wire it up to a set of pistons. Make sure that the &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt; is in a place where it's impossible or very difficult for the player to see it. When the player comes along, they will not see the tripwire, so they will trip over the wire, and stumble into a pit that you made beneath the pistons.\nMake it fall into a ravine, a funbox or, if you are really mean, an end portal.\nRun Fast.\nThis trap takes advantage of the very fast speed you can achieve by sprint-jumping in a two-block high passageway. First of all, build a two-block tall passageway of whatever length you want. Put a pressure plate at the beginning of the hallway, and connect it to pistons that will retract the floor. Put in a delay, so that the floor will retract just after a sprint-jumping player gets through. If they aren't fast enough, they fall to the bottom and from there, it's up to you what happens to them...\nTest Your Brain.\nPut numbers along with the game that players have to remember, then add a room to enter these numbers. If they get it right, they can move along. If not, they would fall into a deadly trap, such as &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. It is probably a good idea to prevent the players from going back to these numbers somehow, for example, using &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s to create a door that locks behind the players. \nIf in multiplayer, a good idea is to have one player could be in the number room, and one could be in the question room. The one in the number room can tell the person in the question room the answer, and then the one in the number room is stuck but he can use the codice_3 command to teleport to the one in the question room and carry on (this will only work if cheats are on).\nDoor Explore.\nMake &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; doors with multiple keys. One idea is to make an End Portal Frame with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; next to it, that must be activated with a hidden &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt;. Another option is to make a combination lock. You could also make one where the player must rename a &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt; to the correct name (hidden on a secret sign!) and put it in a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; chest, powering a &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; for the door.\nThere! Oh, no, never mind..\nMake something like Indiana Jones-ing. Put attractive blocks such as &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; stuck to a wall. When the player touches it -pressure plate/tripwire etc. etc.- the block would come to the other side and the player would fall into something dangerous of your choice, such as &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nYou could also make an observer system to detect when the block is broken. For instance, there could be sand placed above the object of value. When this object is broken, the sand falls down, and an observer get triggered as the block falls down. This could lead not the object of value, but the whole player into the aforementioned sources of danger. \nIndiana Jones-ing... again....\nNow that &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s can face upwards, fill them with &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s and put a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; or tripwire on top for an instant semi-hidden trap.\nIndiana Jones-ing... a third time....\nPut attractive blocks such as &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; on a pedestal. 13 blocks below, place a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; that fires every so often (1 second is good.) Because pistons can push a maximum of 12 blocks, nothing will happen until the player takes the block, because the piston will extend if they don't put another block (like &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;) in its place. Connect the piston to a BUD switch to activate some traps and hope the players remember to grab their hat!\nIndiana Jones-ing 4th time.\nPut 2 Lines of ladder over a big drop! \nYou will have to climb over it\nFalling Floors.\nTo make your level exciting, arrange a floor of TNT, with &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; on top. Then add a pressure plate on the gravel, so when you step on it, it disintegrates. Make some parts of the floor \"not\" fall (replace TNT with any other block), or a fail would render the level unplayable.\nButton Brain Mash.\nUse buttons, or possibly comparatored item frames, for a simple combination lock.\nMinecart Mania.\nMake a huge underground minecart roller coaster and give them a bow. Add some hard to shoot wood buttons. The aim is to shoot all the buttons and get them all to activate, turning on an And gate that changes the track to the next room.\nThe danger chests.\nFirst, fill the first trapped chest with useful loot and then place a block underneath the chest and then TNT. Then place a second trapped chest 2 blocks away from the first chest and place a block then a dispenser with flint and steel and then minecart with TNT underneath. Then place a regular chest 2 blocks away from the chest. Then fill it with useful loot. Add signs next to the chests like: Armor/food/swords/reward inside!\nHere's a side view:\nThe ender puzzle.\nThe End can be tough due to the dragon and &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to make a course, then direct it the finish portal and add a \"huge\" reward at the end. Add something that really helps them in the game like the Strength V, full diamond enchanted &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, a stack of enchanted &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, Resistance II, an enchanted bow with arrows, to buy stuff they get 5 stacks of the stuff they need to use to buy and an extra reward for players, they get to keep their inventory! Kill the dragon first or you get spammed.\nInvisibility Cloak.\nMake a long room (made of bedrock or obsidian) filled with creepers. In the beginning, make a chest with a 3:00 minute Invisibility potion. The player must reach the exit in time, or have all the creepers explode on the player.\nCake Shaft.\nGive a few really strong hunger potions to each player. Make a huge vertical shaft of &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;. The aim is that the players must drink potion and eat the cake to go down to the next brain teaser. Optionally, to make this into a challenge, add lava coming down on them so they have to eat the cake quickly!\nSplitup path.\nThis divides your players into smaller groups and make 2 doorways and place iron doors at the front. Then place pressure plates next to them. Make a different route from each other. Make sure all of them direct to the same finish line.\nAlternatively, you could make it that only one of the paths wins, and the other players will be turned into some fresh cooked meat by some lava. The surviving player is the \"winner\".\nRUUUUUNNN!\nThis is similar to the other one except add some curves to make it trickier and holes and blocks that crush you. Make a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; that affects you with speed III. Otherwise, this puzzle will be unwinnable.\nFake trap.\nPut pressure plates around a diamond block or chest, or make it look like there's redstone coming from a trapped chest. The player may think this is a trap, and may decide to quit the map.\nChain reaction.\nYou can wire up your traps with some &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Rube%20Goldberg%20Machine\"&gt;rube goldberg wiring.&lt;/a&gt; As well as looking cool, some of these things can be deadly. Take Greenstone as an example; you could stack a lot of sand on the sand, and when it falls, the player will fall through it and when it lands, they won't be able to breathe anymore. Get as creative as possible.\nFunbox.\nFunboxes are 3x3x3 rooms of spawners that are very hard to disable.\nTypes of funboxes.\nDeathdome: Use MCedit or commands to make primed TNT spawners. Set them to 1 tick minimum and 20 ticks maximum. Set to 8 ticks as current time. Add a spawning range. Don't forget to cover the room with obsidian including the spawners or weep! When the players enter the room, hundreds of TNT will explode right into their faces! Add diamond armor for them. \nDon't look: Add endermen spawners. Make the room out of bedrock. When the players look at the endermen, they will attack them! Don't say I didn't warn you!\nMonster maker: Add random hostile mob spawners. Then it will be chaos!\nMeat room: If you are feeling nice, then add a reward with a funbox of pig spawners so players can kill them for food? Add fire aspect swords or a furnace with a chest of coal. If you don't want players killing pigs, then add a cooked pork funbox.\nPotion funbox: Make a funbox out of positive potion spawners (add negatives for the lulz.). Also, put it in an enchanting room!\nBuried alive: Make a funbox out of falling sand or gravel spawners. (Add the rare anvil.) Fill the large room with sand. Give the players some stone shovels. Add blockades to the room. Set the spawning cooldown to 4 ticks minimum to 5 ticks maximum. Set the current spawning cooldown time to 4 ticks. When players dig up the sand, the room will rapidly start to fill up with sand and then they will die! Give them one torch each to remove some of the gravel.\nThat hurt!: Make an arrow spawner. This is better than the dispenser one since it has unlimited ammo. Add leather armor for them.\nThe sudden ultimate death \"Peaceful\" map.\nMake a detector that detects players that switched to peaceful, then create a command block that teleports them to another room. Make a sign saying:\n\"You have switched to peaceful and therefore you must complete this \"peaceful\" map to continue.\"\nMake a command block that clears their items from their inventory. Make a new spawnpoint for the unlucky player in a bedrock room with no way out. Make a map that is near impossible to complete. (E.g. Parkour map.) Add a few small rewards for the player to progress. Make the level really long with no checkpoints. When the player reaches the end, make a hidden button teleporting to the end of the adventure map in a good way. (WARNING: Contains spoilers) In the bedrock room, make a sign saying: \n\"GAME OVER. You have failed the sudden death challenge on this map and you need to re-download the map.\"\nYou could also take the post down after a certain amount of views is reached, so they'll never be able to download it again, allowing for bigger consequences if they fail the map.\nThe Test Series.\nCreate a series of challenges, where if you fail, you get teleported to the next test. But, if you win, you get a reward like armor and a sword. After a certain amount of tests have them go to the End and fight the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; with their current equipment. This is a...\nBullethell.\nUse command blocks to shoot projectiles such as arrows and fireballs at the player, or even spawn entire blocks of lava that the player needs to dodge. Custom death messages are optional but can be added.\nElytra Crawlspace.\nCreate an upside-down &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; tunnel which is only accessible by using &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;. Fill it with &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; to add some enemies to fight. (deprecated: as of 1.13, you can swim through, and as of 1.14, you can crawl through.)\nMultiplayer map ideas.\nGold Rush.\nThis map is for getting as much gold as possible. First, use commands to fill Y=1-Y=64 with stone, removing all ores and generated structure. Have 1 layer of grass blocks on Y=64, and turn off mob spawning and mob griefing. Set the difficulty to hard. Build a hollow barrier cube, 2048*2048 (l*w), all the way down to bedrock, and up to the world height limit. Then, make a layer of diamond blocks at Y=40, and a layer of gold ore at Y=10. Have eight bedrock cubicles, one for each player/team, with two floors each. On the first floor, of the cubicle, include only an entrance to the barrier arena. Have 6 furnaces and a chest with mining supplies. Only include one iron pickaxe for each team member. For the rest of the items, add only one iron shovel, one stack of wood, cobblestone, coal, and torches, and 2*(#of players) stacks of food. On the second floor, include a double chest, for all the gold ingots. Have the judge in the center of the arena with a 12 hour hopper clock linked to bells around the whole arena. Cover 8 wither skeleton spawners with barrier in a way that lets the skeletons spawn. Give each person/team a sapling.\n\"replace wheat with sapling\"\n\"Layered Blueprint is corner of the arena\"\nCubicle\nThe EXTREME survival challenge.\nCreate a superflat world and make a 400*800 barrier cage. Have the map on Hardcore mode. Add spawners for monsters that don't naturally spawn, such as vindicators, cave spiders, drowned, and a command block to summon a wither. At evening, bring in the contestants. Clear everyone's inventory and give each person a diamond sword, a full set of iron armor, and a bow enchanted with Power II and Infinity. Give everyone an arrow and a shield. Don't forget to give everyone some blocks. When the competition starts the wither should be summoned. Have everyone fight the monsters. Whoever is alive the next day gets a prize and can keep the wither's nether star and mob drops.\nHopper Ball.\nHave a large 20*20 floor made of hoppers pointing at other hoppers, in a way that there will be no dead ends, but a lot of infinite loops. When the game starts, throw a diamond into one of the hoppers. Watch the contestants open the hoppers to try and get the diamond. Whoever gets it will win the competition and can keep the diamond.\nThe size of the arena depends on the # of players.\n1v1 PVP.\nHave criminals go into a cage and give them sets of equipment. Watch them fight. The winner gets freed and can keep the equipment. Best for medieval cities.\nHave a cow in the cage so the two people can get milk.\nEquipment sets:\nArcher:\nMelee Warrior:\nWitch:\nFisherman:\nExtreme Raid.\nHave two teams split up by a high barrier. On each side, create a village, but don't give the villagers defenses. The two teams should each protect their own side. \nSimilar to a regular raid, but more challenging. Best for Java Edition, because there are illusioners.\nExtreme Raid waves:\nMultiplayer arena ideas.\nCustom Skywars.\nPlay on a skywars map or create your own. Build floating islands and have hidden chests. Give everyone some basic armor.\nExample Start Island:\nExample central island:\nLoot tables:\nTip: Scatter the items so it looks like a generated structure chest.\nStarter chest\nAdd a stone sword, diamond sword, or diamond sword with sharpness II.\nAdd 7-12 steak and/or 4-15 bread. \nAdd an iron block 15% chance.\nAdd a bow 60% chance.\nAdd 8-24 arrows, only if there is a bow.\nAdd 1-3 golden apples, 5% chance.\nAdd 2-8 wood logs 50% chance.\nAdd 3-15 wood planks 65% chance.\nAdd 2-4 sticks 80% chance.\nAdd an enchanted golden apple 1% chance.\nAdd a water bucket 70% chance.\nAdd 2-4 pieces of leather (60%) or iron (40%) armor.\nAdd 15-40 dirt.\nCenter chest\nAdd 2-4 iron (40%), diamond with sharpness III + Fire Aspect I + Knockback I (30%), or diamond with sharpness V + Fire Aspect II + Knockback II (30%) swords.\nAdd 7-12 golden apples.\nAdd 5-15 diamonds.\nAdd 1-3 netherite ingots 30% chance.\nAdd 5-17 rotten flesh 80% chance.\nAdd 2-3 potion of healing 60% chance.\nAdd 1-3 iron blocks 60% chance.\nAdd 2-3 splash potion of harming 50% chance.\nAdd 1-3 lava buckets 40% chance.\nAdd 12-75 cobblestone 80% chance.\nAdd 1 smithing table if there are netherite ingots.\nAdd 2-4 bows, unenchanted (50%), power III (30%) + Punch II, or power V + Flame + Punch II (20%).\nAdd 2-3 enchanted golden apples 5% chance.\nAdd 2-6 pieces of iron armor with Protection II (50%), diamond armor with Protection II (30%), or diamond armor with Protection IV (25%)\nHidden chest\nAdd 3-5 iron blocks, 65% chance.\nAdd 1-2 diamond blocks, 40% chance.\nAdd 5-17 rotten flesh, 80% chance.\nAdd 4-7 golden apples, 65% chance.\nAdd 12-75 cobblestone, 80% chance.\nAdd 1 bow with Power X, Flame III, Punch IV, 5% chance. (requires cheats)\nAdd 1 netherite sword with Sharpness X, Fire Aspect III, Knockback IV, 5% chance (requires cheats)\nAdd 10-32 tipped arrows of harming (50%) or poison (50%), 40% chance.\nAdd 4-6 enchanted golden apples, 5% chance.\nAdd 4-16 logs, 80% chance.\nAdd 1-3 pieces of netherite armor with Protection VI, 5% chance. (Requires cheats)\nExtreme Night Survival.\nCreate a 500*500 barrier cage. Position all the players. Have command blocks hooked to redstone clock to summon powerful monsters, such as vindicator with Sharpness V axe, zombie in full diamond armor, skeleton with Power V bow, charged creepers, etc. Summon an ender dragon or wither as well. Keep the map on adventure mode so people can't break the redstone.\nEach player should have a full set of diamond armor, a diamond sword with Sharpness II, a bow with power II and Infinity, 64 steak, 10 golden apples, a water bucket, and 2 stacks of cobblestone.\nThe players should fight each other and the monsters. The last person alive gets to keep the players' equipment and mob drops.\nSample section:\nTargets are mob spawn spots.\n12 Pyramids.\nAnother idea for making a challenge map is something I like to call \"12 Pyramids\". Here is how to make this exciting new game\nSetup.\nFirst, you go to a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//perchance.org/t6v8f5zo3f\"&gt;random item generator that also gives blocks&lt;/a&gt;. Next, you create a superflat world and set the difficulty to Peaceful mode. Without this, mobs will spawn while the map is still under construction. Then set up a command block to give you infinite night vision for building in dark places. Next, go to your generator and select 15 items to generate. Click \"Randomize\". Write down those items. Or not if you are running the generator on a different device. Return to \"Minecraft\", and give yourself one possible stack of each item you just wrote down. Ok, there should be plenty blocks in your invetory, and maybe even a consumable, armour, or tool. Go into survival mode, and use the items at your disposal to create a pyramid. Make sure to have rooms, halls and corridors, etc. This is ment to be like the Pyramids of Giza, or 12 or them. When you run out of placeable solid blocks, clear your invetory to make it easier and refill from the list. Make sure to put any non-placable items in any kind of storage system you get, for example, putting a wooden axe in a smoker would be good. Around the end level of each pyramid, go into creative mode and place a chain of command blocks that clear the player's invetory, teletorts him/her to the world spawn, and places a stone button at a spot. Save finishing the last command block for when you finish the next pyramid. Repeat this until you have a total of 12 pyramids, and have an iron door at the entrace of each one. This makes them have to do the map in order, but make sure you leave a stone button for them at the starting pyramid. And, if you are playing Java edition, you could make it so the world is a desert to add a theme to the pyramids. Shaders could make it look much better, however this will fry your Windows. Kinda sorta reccomended. Use your interactable blocks \"wisely\". For example, line some furnaces along a wall and hide a treasure somewhere in one. Or, if you have observers, pressure plates, dispensers and arrows, you could make a trap. Also make decorations, and if you have orange \"and\" purple terracota, \"make a desert temple design\". Avoid crafting anything whatsoever. You could make special rooms based on the materials you have, for example, turtle eggs could be used in a hatchery, armour stands on an armory, etc.\nCommunity.\nNow that you got the basics down, when you are done, set the default gamemode to Adventure, destroy the Night vision command block, set the difficulty to Normal (Or hard, for more of a better challenge, but not hardcore otherwise it might be a little too hard) and \"share it to the community!\""}
{"id": "93821", "revid": "55466696", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93821", "title": "Tutorials/Creating a data pack", "text": "This tutorial shows how to create a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting started.\nData packs can be used to add or modify &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28Java%20Edition%29\"&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"loot%20table\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt;s, world &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"advancements\"&gt;advancements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dimension\"&gt;dimensions&lt;/a&gt;, predicates and world generation.\nWhat not to do.\nThere are some things that you should not do while creating a data pack. Here is a list of \"don'ts\":\nCreating a data pack.\nTo create a data pack, start off by navigating to the codice_1 folder inside the world folder.\nTo find the world folder, locate the codice_2 folder inside your game directory, which is &lt;a href=\".minecraft\"&gt;.minecraft&lt;/a&gt; by default.\nOnce you are in the codice_1 folder, create a folder with a name of your choice. It will be your data pack's name. Enter the data pack folder.\nThe first thing to do after you are in the folder is to create a codice_5 file. This lets \"Minecraft\" identify your data pack.\nCreating an MCMETA file.\nTo create an MCMETA file, right click within your data pack folder and create a new text document. Name this file \"pack.mcmeta\".\nMake sure the file extension is codice_6 and not codice_7 when you rename it! In other words, remove your old file extension. You may be warned that changing a file name extension could make the file unusable. However, this actually indicates that you have renamed the codice_5 file correctly.\nIf you are using Microsoft Windows and can't see file extensions, for Windows 10, you can turn them on by going to the \"View\" menu of the file explorer and checking the check box for file name extensions. For Windows beneath Windows 10, you can uncheck \"hide extensions\" in folder settings.\nFor Windows 11, to turn them on, open the \"View\" dropdown menu, then hover over the \"Show\" option, then turn on the \"File name extensions\" option that pops up when \"Show\" was hovered.\nText editor.\nAny text editor should work. It is recommended that the chosen text editor supports &lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt;, which is the format used by files of codice_9 extension and most other files in a data pack.\nNote that most text editors do not recognize codice_9 extension as JSON. Thus, you need to configure the editors manually.\ncodice_5 content.\nOpen codice_5 in your text editor and paste or type the following:\n \"pack\": {\n \"pack_format\": 15,\n \"description\": \"Tutorial Data Pack\"\nThis file is written in JSON! This tutorial does not go into specifics about the format now, but be aware about how things are laid out. Be very careful not to forget quotation marks, colons, and curly or square brackets. Make sure to not write trailing commas. Missing one of these can lead to your data pack not working correctly! To check your files you can use a JSON validator, such as the one found on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//jsonlint.com\"&gt;JSONLint&lt;/a&gt;.\ncodice_13.\nThe value of codice_13 tells \"Minecraft\" what release the data pack is designed for, and is different for certain versions. The following list shows what versions each value is associated with:\n\"Note: As more updates are released, values may be changed or added.\"\ncodice_15.\nThe text following codice_15 can be any string or a &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Raw%20JSON%20text\"&gt;raw JSON text&lt;/a&gt;. It will show up when you hover over your data pack in the output from and in the data pack UI when creating a world.\nIn codice_5, it is possible to use the \u00a7 symbol (see Minecraft &lt;a href=\"Formatting%20codes\"&gt;Formatting codes&lt;/a&gt;) in the description of codice_5 and the data pack name.\nTesting your pack.\nOnce you have created your codice_5, try testing it out in-game! Open the world or, if you are already in the world, type , then type . It should list two entries. One should be codice_20, the second one should be named like codice_21, where your data pack's folder name goes at codice_22. When you hover over your data pack's entry, you should see the description of your data pack as you have written in of your codice_5.\nWhen your pack shows up, you are ready to move on.\nTroubleshooting.\nIf you don't see your pack in the list, make sure your codice_5 file is correct and saved. Look for any missing curly brackets , commas , colons , quotation marks , or square brackets . Remember that for each open brace, quotation, or square bracket, you must have a closing bracket, quotation, or square brackets. If you still don't see your pack, make sure it's in the right folder.\nNote that the correct JSON syntax may differ slightly based on your version of Minecraft (e.g., in Minecraft 1.21, the JSON codice_25 name was replaced with codice_26). The JSON examples on this page attempt to reflect the most up-to-date version of Minecraft.\nThe correct data pack file structure may also differ depending on your Minecraft version. For example, in Minecraft 1.21, the codice_27, codice_28, codice_29, codice_30, codice_31, and codice_32 folders were changed to be singular (codice_33, codice_34, etc.).\nNaming.\nMake a folder called codice_35 in your data pack folder, where you have placed the codice_5 file in. In this codice_35 folder you have to create one or more folders which will act as your namespaces.\nEntries in data packs have resource locations in a fashion of codice_38. The corresponding file would be located at codice_39. Note that codice_40 characters in the path will be translated into directory separators.\nA few examples:\nLegal characters.\nNamespaces, paths and other folder and file names in the data pack should only contain the following symbols:\nThe preferred naming convention is codice_51, called lower snake case.\nNamespace.\nMost objects in the game use namespaced resource locations to prevent potential content conflicts or unintentional overrides.\nFor example, if two data packs add two new minigame mechanisms to \"Minecraft\" and both have a &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28Java%20Edition%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; named codice_52. Without namespaces, these two functions would clash and the minigames would be broken. But if they have different namespaces of codice_53 and codice_54, the functions would become codice_55 and codice_56, which no longer conflict.\nMost of the time when \"Minecraft\" requires an ID, such as for , you should provide the namespace in addition to the path. If you don't specify the namespace, it will fallback to codice_57. \nMake sure to always use your own namespace for anything new that you add, and only use other namespaces if you're explicitly overriding something else, or, in the case of &lt;a href=\"tags\"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt;, appending to something else.\nFor example, \"Minecraft\" uses the codice_57 namespace, which means that this namespace should only be used when the data pack needs to overwrite existing Minecraft data or to add its entries to vanilla tags.\nFunctions.\nFunctions are a set of commands that can be run in order.\nTo add functions, first create a folder named codice_28 inside the namespace folder. Then, create a file named codice_60 in this folder or in any of its subfolders. This will be your function file. Your function will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 when the function file is located in a subfolder.\nLoot tables.\nLoot tables will tell \"Minecraft\" what should be dropped when a mob dies or what should be generated inside containers, like chests, when opened for the first time, they can also be called by the &lt;a href=\"Commands/loot\"&gt;/loot&lt;/a&gt; command.\nTo add loot tables, first create a folder named codice_34 inside the namespace folder. Then, create a file named codice_64 in this folder or in any of its subfolders. This will be your loot table file. Your loot table will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 if the file is located in a subfolder. All the vanilla loot tables are in the minecraft namespace.\nHere is an example of a cow's loot table, it can be used as a reference:\n \"type\": \"minecraft:entity\",\n \"pools\": [\n \"rolls\": 1,\n \"entries\": [\n \"type\": \"minecraft:item\",\n \"functions\": [\n \"function\": \"minecraft:set_count\",\n \"count\": {\n \"min\": 0,\n \"max\": 2,\n \"type\": \"minecraft:uniform\"\n },\n \"function\": \"minecraft:looting_enchant\",\n \"count\": {\n \"min\": 0,\n \"max\": 1\n \"name\": \"minecraft:leather\"\n ]\n {\n \"rolls\": 1,\n \"entries\": [\n \"type\": \"minecraft:item\",\n \"functions\": [\n \"function\": \"minecraft:set_count\",\n \"count\": {\n \"min\": 1,\n \"max\": 3,\n \"type\": \"minecraft:uniform\"\n },\n \"function\": \"minecraft:furnace_smelt\",\n \"conditions\": [\n \"condition\": \"minecraft:entity_properties\",\n \"predicate\": {\n \"flags\": {\n \"is_on_fire\": true\n },\n \"entity\": \"this\"\n ]\n {\n \"function\": \"minecraft:looting_enchant\",\n \"count\": {\n \"min\": 0,\n \"max\": 1\n \"name\": \"minecraft:beef\"\n ]\n ]\nTo learn what each tag means, see &lt;a href=\"Loot%20tables\"&gt;Loot tables&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a list of vanilla loot tables on that page.\nStructures.\nStructures can be used with &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"jigsaw%20block\"&gt;jigsaw block&lt;/a&gt;s and/or can overwrite how certain vanilla structures look in \"Minecraft\". It is saved in an NBT format. You can create an NBT file by using a structure block or by exporting a build using a third party program like MCEdit.\nTo add structures to a data pack, first create a folder named codice_67 inside the namespace folder. Then, put your structure file in this folder or in any of its subfolders. Your structure will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 if the file is located in a subfolder.\nWorld generation.\nCustom world generation allows &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;s to change how the world generates. This is particularly useful in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"custom\"&gt;custom&lt;/a&gt; worlds.\nTo change world generation, first create a folder named codice_70 inside the namespace folder. Then, put your noise_settings file in this folder or in any of its subfolders. Your changes will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 if the file is located in a subfolder.\nAdvancements.\nAdvancements can be completed by players and give various rewards.\nTo add advancements, first create a folder named codice_73 inside the namespace folder. Then, create a file named codice_74 (You can't put spaces in the file name. Use lowercase letters in the file name). in this folder or in any of its subfolders. This will be your advancement file. Your advancement will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 if the file is located in a subfolder.\nRecipes.\nRecipes are used to let players craft items.\nTo add recipes, first create a folder named codice_77 inside the namespace folder. Then, create a file named codice_78 in this folder or in any of its subfolders. This will be your recipe file. Your recipe will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 if the file is located in a subfolder.\nShaped crafting.\nThe first common type of crafting is shaped crafting.\n \"type\": \"minecraft:crafting_shaped\",\n \"pattern\": [\n \"123\",\n \"231\",\n \"312\"\n \"key\": {\n \"1\": {\n \"item\": \"Resource location of the item\"\n \"2\": {\n \"item\": \"Resource location of the item\"\n \"3\": {\n \"item\": \"Resource location of the item\"\n },\n \"result\": {\n \"id\": \"Resource location of the item\",\n \"count\": Number of items produced\nThis is a rough example of a shaped crafting recipe, as specified by the codice_81 type. codice_82 is a list used to specify the shape of the crafting recipe. It contains a maximum of 3 strings, each string standing for one row in the crafting grid. These strings then contain a maximum of 3 single characters next to each other, each character standing for one spot in the crafting grid. You don't need all 3 strings, nor do you need to have 3 characters in each string. But each string should contain the same amount of characters. You can use spaces to indicate empty spots.\ncodice_83 is a compound used to specify what item should be used for which character in codice_82. This can either be specified using codice_85 followed by an item ID or codice_86 followed by an item data pack tag.\nThe codice_87 compound speaks for itself, it specified what the resulting item should be. codice_88 is used to specify how many of the item should be given.\nThis is the original recipe for a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; (can be used as a reference):\n \"type\": \"crafting_shaped\",\n \"pattern\": [\n \"TTT\",\n \"#X#\",\n \"#R#\"\n \"key\": {\n \"R\": {\n \"item\": \"minecraft:redstone\"\n \"#\": {\n \"item\": \"minecraft:cobblestone\"\n \"T\": {\n \"tag\": \"minecraft:planks\"\n \"X\": {\n \"item\": \"minecraft:iron_ingot\"\n },\n \"result\": {\n \"id\": \"minecraft:piston\"\nShapeless crafting.\nThere's another common type of recipes, a shapeless recipe. The list with multiple items allows alternatives for the given slot such as Oak Plank and Birch Plank.\n \"type\": \"crafting_shapeless\",\n \"ingredients\": [\n \"item\": \"&lt;item ID&gt;\"\n {\n \"item\": \"&lt;item ID&gt;\"\n [\n \"item\": \"&lt;item ID&gt;\"\n {\n \"item\": \"&lt;item ID&gt;\"\n ]\n \"result\": {\n \"id\": \"&lt;item ID&gt;\",\n \"count\": 5\nAs specified by the codice_89 type, this is a recipe without a codice_82. The codice_91 can be put in the crafting grid in any shape or form. In the example, there's a list inside the codice_91 compound. This means any of the items in this list can be used.\nThis is the original recipe for &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Charge\"&gt;Fire Charge&lt;/a&gt; (can be used as a reference):\n \"type\": \"crafting_shapeless\",\n \"ingredients\": [\n \"item\": \"minecraft:gunpowder\"\n {\n \"item\": \"minecraft:blaze_powder\"\n [\n \"item\": \"minecraft:coal\"\n {\n \"item\": \"minecraft:charcoal\"\n ]\n \"result\": {\n \"id\": \"minecraft:fire_charge\",\n \"count\": 3\nIt is also possible to create new smelting recipes.\n \"type\": \"smelting\",\n \"ingredient\": {\n \"item\": \"&lt;item ID&gt;\"\n \"result\": {\"id\": \"&lt;item ID&gt;\"},\n \"experience\": 0.35,\n \"cookingtime\": 200\nThis is a rough example of a smelting recipe. \"ingredient\" is used to specify the item you are going to smelt. \"result\" is going to specify the result. In \"experience\", you are able to choose the amount of xp gained for smelting, and in \"cookingtime\" the amount of time that it will take for the item to smelt, which in this case is 10 seconds (200 ticks = 10 seconds).\nThis is the default smelting recipe for a diamond ore:\n \"type\": \"smelting\",\n \"ingredient\": {\n \"item\": \"minecraft:diamond_ore\"\n \"result\": {\"id\": \"minecraft:diamond\"},\n \"experience\": 1,\n \"cookingtime\": 200\nTags.\nTags are used to group blocks, items, entities, or functions together. Additionally, the codice_93 function tag is used to run functions every tick and the codice_94 function tag is used to run functions every time the world is (re)loaded.\nTo add tags, first create a folder named codice_95 inside the namespace folder. Inside this folder, create folders named codice_96, codice_97 and codice_28. Then, create a file named codice_99 in one of these folders or in any of their subfolders. This will be your tag file. Your tag will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 if the file is located in a subfolder.\nPredicates.\nPredicates are technical JSON files that represent the conditions for loot tables, codice_102 command, or &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Selecting%2520targets%2520by%2520predicate\"&gt;codice_31 target selector argument&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo add predicates, first create a folder named codice_31 inside the namespace folder. Then, create a file named codice_105 (You can't put spaces in the file name. Use lowercase letters in the file name). in this folder or in any of its subfolders. This will be your predicate file. Your predicate will be named in the game as codice_61 or codice_62 if the file is located in a subfolder.\nDimensions.\nDimensions are JSON file used to specify all the dimensions a world contains.\nTo add dimensions, first create a folder named codice_108 inside the namespace folder. Then, create a file named codice_109 (You can't put spaces in the file name. Use lowercase letters in the file name). in this folder. This will be your dimension file.\nCustom dimensions can be accessed in game using codice_110\nUtilities.\nMany utilities have been created in order to make programming in mcfunction easier. This is a reference list for utilities such as transpilers or syntax highlighting plugins. Please apply reasonable caution when downloading software onto your computer, as the creators are responsible for the content provided.\nAnother option is to use a visual interface to create the framework or the content for your project.\nIf you use an IDE you might want syntax highlighting for the mcfunction syntax.

{"id": "66812", "revid": "51893258", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=66812", "title": "Tutorials/Creating a resource pack", "text": "Preface.\nResource packs allow users to include files that can modify or add custom textures, models, animations, music, sounds, user interfaces, and languages that change the way some things in \"Minecraft\" behave or look.\nWhat NOT to do.\nThere are some things that you should \"NOT\" do when creating a resource pack / texture packs, which includes but is not limited to:\nIn any case, you should always follow the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//account.mojang.com/terms\"&gt;Terms and Conditions&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; website.\nIt is also suggested that you never extract game files to your desktop, as it can result in technical issues.\nGetting started.\nMaking a resource pack.\n\"Minecraft\" has a unique mechanic that allows for text and media files to be added to the game files that allow for everything from custom block textures and models to custom credits and sound events. This tutorial is meant to help with setting up the file systems in order to implement them. Since the files are essentially code, there are technical rules for how to format files and certain things may change from version to version. As such, what is written in this tutorial may not apply to every situation, but in the case where the difference is significant and specific, it provides a framework on the changes needed for different versions. \n\"This tutorial is geared toward the latest release of\" Minecraft\", which is currently 1.20\"\n { \n \"pack\": {\n \"pack_format\": 15,\n \"description\": \"My Resource Pack\"\n \"language\": {\n \"LANG_COUNTRY\": {\n \"name\": \"My Custom Language\",\n \"region\": \"Country/Region name\",\n \"bidirectional\": false\nTools.\nCreating custom files for \"Minecraft\", whether in the forms of resource/data packs or mods, is somewhat technical and can be difficult. There are many rules that must be followed in order for add-ons to work correctly, most notably how the files are formatted. There are many tools that can help mitigate these issues, some of which are listed here.\nFile archiver.\nTo access the base assets of \"Minecraft\" to edit textures, models, or sounds, a file archiver is needed. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.7-zip.org\"&gt;7-Zip&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.rarlab.com/download.htm\"&gt;WinRAR&lt;/a&gt; are suggested. MacOS has a built-in file archiver called \"Archive Utility\" that can be used, but if an alternative is wanted, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//apps.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353%3Fmt%3D12\"&gt;The Unarchiver&lt;/a&gt; also works.\nEditor.\nMaking a resource pack involves creating &lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; text files, which can be tricky to use and format correctly. Many File Editors assist with formatting these files and making sure proper syntax is used, as well as help organizing files in a project. Here are some suggestions:\nAudio editor.\nIn order to add sound files, you must put it in the proper format (.ogg). While this can be done using one of numerous sites online, an audio editor program is suggested to allow customizing or trimming of audio files. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.audacityteam.org\"&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular audio editors.\nImage editor/3D modeling tool.\nTo add textures or custom models, it is suggested to use a modeling program that allows for a visual-based editing system. Like with audio conversion websites, there are many online tools, though a common recommended program is &lt;a href=\"https%3A//blockbench.net\"&gt;Blockbench&lt;/a&gt;. Most image editors suffice to modify textures, but it is recommended to use an editor that supports &lt;a href=\"transparency\"&gt;transparency&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.getpaint.net/index.html\"&gt;paint.net&lt;/a&gt; or https://pixlr.com/ so that you may add transparent pixels to textures.\nCreating a resource pack.\nAll the resources and instructions in a pack reside in the pack folder, which lives in the \"resourcepacks\" directory. You may wish to use an IDE to help keep track of the files within your resource pack if there are multiple.\n\"In versions 1.11 and higher, all file names within a resource pack should use lowercase letters only.\"\nCreating the folder.\nThe first thing we need to do is create the folder that contains all the resource pack files. Create a folder on your desktop or another easily accessible location and name it codice_1. This eventually becomes the name displayed in the resource pack menu.\nCreating a .MCMETA file.\nWithin your resource pack folder, we need to create a file. This lets \"Minecraft\" know that the folder is a resource pack and contains useful information such as:\nTo create this file, we need to create a text file within the folder and name it codice_2. Make sure the file extension is and \"not\" or the pack may not be detected. When renaming you may get a warning that changing a file name extension could make the file unusable or may switch the program required to open it. You can still open this file in a text editor by right-clicking the file and selecting the \"Open With\" option. \"Note: You may need to select a program using your file browser.\"\nFormatting pack.mcmeta.\nOpen in a text editor or IDE of your choice and type or copy+paste the following:\n \"pack\": {\n \"pack_format\": 18,\n \"description\": \"Tutorial Resource Pack\"\ncodice_3.\nThe value of codice_3 tells \"Minecraft\" what release the resource pack is designed for, and is different for certain versions. The following list what versions each value is associated with:\n\"Note: As more updates are released, values may be changed or added.\"\ncodice_6.\nThe text following codice_6 is displayed under the pack title in the selection menu, and must be put inside quotes codice_8. If you wish to use special characters, you can enter the Unicode code for the character in the format codice_9, where codice_10 is the Unicode hex code for the character. Say you want to use the letter \u00df, which has code codice_11. Inside the description you would type . Make sure that you are using the correct slash, or it may not work. A list of Unicode codes can be found . \"Note: Only the characters 0000\u2013FFFF () are supported.\"\nCorrect syntax.\nBe very careful not to forget quotation marks codice_8, colons codice_13, braces codice_14, or square brackets codice_15. Missing one of these can lead to your resource pack not being detected by Minecraft. Make sure that your codice_2 file matches the one shown above.\nTesting your pack.\nAt this point, you can test if the pack is formatted correctly by putting it in the game! To do this you must place your resource pack folder in the \"Minecraft\" pack folder. You can access it by selecting \"&lt;a href=\"Options\"&gt;Options&lt;/a&gt;\", then \"Resource Packs\", then \"Open Pack Folder\", or you can navigate to it from your file browser:\nOnce you have the folder open, you can drag your custom pack folder and drop it in.\nIf you have formatted the files correctly, you should see your resource pack appear in the menu.\nTroubleshooting.\nIf you don't see your pack in the list, make sure your file is correct and saved in the folder. Look for any missing braces , commas , colons , quotation marks , or square brackets . Remember that for each open brace, quotation, or square bracket, you must have a closing brace, quotation, or square bracket.\nPack icon.\nIf an icon is not specified, a &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; icon appears next to the pack. If you want to use your own pack icon, you can place it inside your resource pack folder with the name codice_17. The file must be a PNG, and works with any square resolution, but a 128\u00d7128 pixel image renders the best.\nAdding content.\nStructuring the assets folder.\nNow that you have your resource pack set up, you can start adding content to it. You add most files into a subfolder called codice_18. Simply create a new folder inside your resource pack folder named codice_18. This, codice_2, and codice_17 should be the only files located directly in your parent resource pack folder. Any other resource files must be located somewhere in codice_18 or they won't be read by \"Minecraft\".\nAdding a namespace folder.\nNext, inside your assets folder are your namespace folders. These help separate the files in your resource pack so that there is no confusion between which files are located where. If you plan on modifying or replacing vanilla resources, those files would go into the codice_23 namespace folder. Custom additions should go in your own namespace folder, which for this tutorial is named codice_24. In the future, you should use a significant or unique namespace so that there isn't a possibility of other resource packs confusing which files belong where when multiple packs are loaded.\nAccessing the vanilla resources.\nIf you plan on editing multiple resources, or to help ease of access, you may want to save a copy of the vanilla resources in an accessible location in case some things rely on other files within the directory. To do this, you need to navigate to the vanilla resources file by opening the codice_25 folder inside the codice_26 directory. You should see a list of numbered folders, which correspond to versions that you've loaded or used in the past. Open the folder corresponding to the version you want for your resource pack (in this tutorial it would be 1.19) and extract the JAR file located inside, which can be done by right clicking the file and selecting a file archiver from the \"Open With\" option. You may want to save this in an accessible location for future reference, as certain tasks such as modifying block models require textures in addition to the model files. If you do not have a program that can open .jar files simply change the extension from .jar to .zip.\nModifying an entity's texture.\nThis section goes through the process of modifying a texture, using the creeper texture as an example.\nFinding the vanilla texture.\nFirst, you need the vanilla resource to get the texture you want to edit. This is located in the extracted version folder that was created in the previous section. In the extracted folder, navigate to codice_18\u2192codice_23\u2192codice_29\u2192codice_30\u2192codice_31 where you can find codice_32. Save a duplicate of this file somewhere accessible or keep the folder window open during the next few steps.\nNext you'll need to replicate the folder structure of the vanilla pack within your resource pack, which lets \"Minecraft\" know to use the texture. Since we are modifying a default texture, this is in the codice_23 subfolder of our codice_18 folder. Within the codice_23 folder of \"your resource pack\", do the following:\nNow that you have the normal creeper texture placed in your resource pack, open it up in the image editor of your choice. It should look something like the image shown. \nSince texture files are very small, you may need to zoom in. \nIf you've never seen a texture before, the above image might surprise you. A lot of textures look this way and are \"wrapped\" around a model, like wrapping paper around a present.\nNow it's time to be creative! Edit the texture however you want. For simplicity, this example adds a headband. Note where the changes are and compare it to the color-coded texture above.\nOnce you are happy with your texture, save the file as codice_32. It is important that it is saved with the same name as the default asset or otherwise it cannot detect and load your texture.\nNow you can load up \"Minecraft\" and spawn a creeper with your custom texture! If it doesn't show up, make sure that you've selected your resource pack. If it still doesn't work, make sure you've named the file properly and placed it in the correct folder.\nPack hierarchy.\nIf you are playing with multiple resource packs loaded, there may be some textures that are in your pack that aren't being shown. This is because of the way resource packs are loaded in \"Minecraft\". All selected resource pack files are loaded from the bottom up as they are shown in the selection menu, so if there is a resource pack that is loaded above yours, it may replace files that you've changed. This can cause various issues with using multiple themed resource packs that have differing textures, so make sure you have your resource pack at the top.\nModeling blocks and items.\nSometimes you may want to change one of the \"Minecraft\" models. To do so you need a file archiver to get the default model and texture along with a 3D modeling tool to edit the model. Blockbench works well in this case since it can export directly to the codice_38 format needed for models. \nReplacing a block.\nBecause the default &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; in \"Minecraft\" isn't 3D, you can replace it with your own model. First, get all the ladder's files into this resource pack: \nNow you can either edit the using your preferred image editor, or you can edit it in your preferred modeling editor.\nNote: If you are doing a basic \"Just Simple Nonanimated Textures\" resource pack, the .json files are unnecessary. Otherwise, if you are doing special features to change what the texture looks like when certain parameters are true or false, then the .json files would be necessary. For example, if you created a resource pack that makes grass blocks smooth, the .json files would prevent you from having dirt lines everywhere in your world that already uses code.\u00a0 \nModeling the ladder - Blockbench.\nIn modeling the ladder, we use \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//blockbench.net/\"&gt;Blockbench&lt;/a&gt;\". Once you have opened the program, press to open the model selection menu. After the open dialog has appeared, go to the location where you saved codice_39 and select .\nYou then should be facing a ladder that is on the south side of the box. \nNow we have created a new model for the ladder block in Blockbench.\nTexturing the ladder - paint.net.\nGo to getpaint.net and get paint.net or go to ninite.com, select paintNET and run it after it downloads to install paint.net for free.\nFinishing off.\nWhen you have completed the 3D model of the ladder and saved it, launch \"Minecraft\", and test it out. Place a ladder on a wall, and you should see its replaced model.\nChanging existing sounds or music.\nJust like modifying the default textures or models, you can substitute custom sounds in place of the default ones. This example shows how to change the boss music in the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; fight.\nFinding a sound's path.\nSimilar to the custom texture and models, you'll first need to know the \"path\" of the sound you want to change.\nTesting your sound.\nIf everything went according to plan, you have now replaced a sound in \"Minecraft\". To test it:\nAdding new sounds or music.\nIn addition to modifying default sounds, you can add your own! In this example, a new player hurt sound can be added without replacing any of the current player hurt sounds.\nFinding the sound path.\nIn order to add a sound, you'll need to know where it should actually go by determining its \"path\". Unlike replacing sounds, you should go straight to your resource pack folder and search in there.\nChanging the sound event.\nBecause we are adding a sound, we must change the associated sound event in .\n \"entity.player.hurt\": {\n \"sounds\": [\n \"name\": \"damage/hit1\"\n {\n \"name\": \"damage/hit2\"\n {\n \"name\": \"damage/hit3\"\n {\n \"name\": \"damage/hit4\"\n ],\n \"subtitle\": \"Hurt\"\nTesting your sound.\nIf there is an error anywhere in your file, none of the sounds described in it appear in-game. If this happens, you should check the spelling and file paths.\nIf everything went according to plan, you have now added a sound to \"Minecraft\". To test it:\nAdding languages.\nYou can add new languages to \"Minecraft\" using a resource pack. Assume your language code is 'LANG' and country/region code is 'COUNTRY', looks like:\n \"pack\": {\n \"pack_format\": 15,\n \"description\": \"Tutorial Resource Pack\"\n \"language\": {\n \"LANG_COUNTRY\": {\n \"name\": \"Tutorial Language\",\n \"region\": \"COUNTRY/REGION NAME\",\n \"bidirectional\": false\nIf you want your language to be right-to-left, set to .\nThen, put in inside your resource pack. When you launch the game, choose your resource pack, open the &lt;a href=\"Language\"&gt;Language&lt;/a&gt; selection screen, and your new language should be there.\nThe goes in the root folder of your resource pack, not in the folder. Also note that the above is the same file as the file that you have created a while ago. As of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7-pre\"&gt;1.7-pre&lt;/a&gt;, you can choose multiple resource packs at once. If you want to use your new language and resource pack for before 1.7, you need to combine them manually because multiple resource packs could not be selected before the version.\nAnimation properties.\nAn example of an animation file is this:\n \"animation\": {\n \"interpolate\": true,\n \"width\": 1,\n \"height\": 7,\n \"frametime\": 1,\n \"frames\": [\n \"index\": 0,\n \"time\": 0\n 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 2\nAll you really need to make a texture animated is the following code. By default, it makes each frame last only one tick:\nSave the file as the same name as the texture you want to be animated with an in the same folder as your texture.\nTexture properties.\nAn example of a texture property is this: \n \"texture\": {\n \"blur\": false,\n \"clamp\": true\nFonts.\nCharacter sizes in fonts are determined by the last line of pixels that contains pixels that contain a non-zero alpha. This allows additional padding to be added around characters by adding a color with an alpha level of 1, which \"Minecraft\" considers as part of the character.\nTesting your resource pack.\nIf you decide you want to make some changes to your resource pack, edit your resource pack, go to resource packs in options, remove your pack from the active list and exit, go back, and reapply it. Alternatively, saving the texture to the resource pack and pressing reloads the pack without the need to reload the default textures first.\nPackaging resource packs with worlds.\nFor use in singleplayer worlds, you can package your resource pack as a ZIP file named inside the world directory. This is then automatically used when playing the singleplayer world.\nServer resource packs.\nIf you are the owner of a server, you may set it as the resource pack of your server. \nServers can have an icon that appears in the Multiplayer list.

{"id": "43101", "revid": "49177426", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=43101", "title": "Tutorials/Creating a village", "text": " \n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s are useful passive mobs. &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s can get items that are normally hard to obtain (like enchanted diamond &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;) or downright impossible (&lt;a href=\"bottle%20o%27%20enchanting\"&gt;bottle o' enchanting&lt;/a&gt;) via &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with villagers using &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s as currency. However, finding a village with live villagers can sometimes be difficult, but there is a simple solution - to make your own village.\nHousing.\nA &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; needs a house to stay in and be sheltered from threats such as &lt;a href=\"illagers\"&gt;illagers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, which attack villagers on sight. Below are a few houses that you can make for them. Please note that as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;1.14&lt;/a&gt;, villagers consider a bed to be a house.\nSimple.\nThis is for those who want the &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s to start &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, or are low on supplies.\nBreeding huts.\nAn easy way to make buildings that can make your &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s multiply a lot. They're designed to be practical more than attractive, though.\nAnother way to do this:\nTrading hall.\nSkipping to the advanced version, you can make a large building to house (imprison) many villagers for convenient trading. Entry should be blocked by fence gates or iron doors to prevent escapes, and the entire building needs to be well-lit and otherwise defended from invading monsters; otherwise the design and appearance is up to you. The core of the trading hall is the series of cubicles where the villagers spend their lives. \nThese can be separated by walls, fences or blocks, with a fence-gate for you to get in or let a villager in or out. These need to have at least four blocks of floor space each: Two for a bed, one for a job site block, and one for the villager to stand. The open space should be between the head of the bed and the fence gate. Ceilings should be three blocks high to allow iron golems to move around, and allow villagers to breed. You can also add beds to many, if not most Villager rooms in the Trading Hall once you get enough resources. You may also have a \"breeding hall\" or dorm with several beds, to breed yet-unemployed villagers. Use fence gates to block off any stairs you may need, and trapdoors to block any ladders.\nDefense.\nArtificial Villages can be attacked by &lt;a href=\"zombie%20siege\"&gt;zombie siege&lt;/a&gt;s and illager &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s too, so you need to establish defenses for them as well, and you can do it before bringing the first Villagers there! (note: if you already have an artificial village populated with Villagers, refer to regular Village Defenses)\nFirstly, you need to build a wall around the area where you plan to build the artificial Village. As the player selects the terrain, and there is no rush, you may incorporate erratic terrain to your liking, but make sure safety accommodations are made for the villagers including lakes/rivers, lava lakes (most important), caves, and two block or more holes/4 or more block drops. Also, make sure you use fence gates to get in and out of the walled area. It is also a good idea to put a block or two out from the top of the wall so spiders can't climb in, so you would be safer.\nNext, you need to light up the area inside the Village to minimize hostile mob spawning at night. After that, make sure that you placed at least one bell, making sure it has a considerable distance from the wall. Afterward, make sure there are at least 10 beds inside the wall. (It is advised to move the beds inside houses with wooden doors later if they are not already.)\nNext, it is time to bring in the villagers. make sure there are at least two, and that you have spawned an iron golem inside (note you can also kidnap iron golems via boats).\nNext, do some rapid breeding (or bring in more Villagers) until there are at least five Villagers (more if the enclosure is more than 80 blocks long or wide or tall (only include tall if you use the air for a multi-level village).\nAfter that, you can build the village to your heart's desire, but make sure that additional areas are also walled, and don't tear down the preexisting wall until the new walls are up and the new area is well lit.\nYou can also spawn &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt; using blocks to defend the villagers from hostile mobs. You can spawn iron golems by placing 4 iron blocks in a T-shape with a carved pumpkin on top. Iron golems spawned this way will not attack the player. Iron golems can also be spawned when a villager is fleeing from a zombie, or when villagers gossip.\nObtaining villagers.\nThere are two general ways to obtain &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s from the surrounding natural environment. Once free, villagers are hard to control, but you can lead them around by placing a job site block for them, then once they have reached it and taken a profession, you can break the job block and place it further along where you want them to go. Once you have actually traded with a villager, their profession can't change, so for those, you'll need the \"right\" job-site block for their profession. Once you've installed them in their home, place the job-site block for the profession you want them to have, and then trade with them to make that profession permanent.\nKidnapping from a village.\nAn easy way to obtain villagers involves using a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; to move villagers from the nearest village to a more convenient place. Boats can be moved on level ground (without water). A villager can be made to enter the boat by pushing the villager into the conveyance (or driving it into the villager), and the villager does not leave until the boat is broken. However, boats can move only downward but not upward. You can, however, push a boat upward using a piston and a redstone torch.\nCuring a zombie villager.\nCatching and curing a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; is another way to obtain a villager. Zombie villagers can be found in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basements, or in &lt;a href=\"Village%23Abandoned%20villages\"&gt;abandoned villages&lt;/a&gt;, but occasionally they can be found anywhere in the overworld. It is recommended to build traps (like large holes 2 or 3 blocks deep) to hunt them. They do not spawn in other cases where normal &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn; e.g. from &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s or as a reinforcement spawned by an attacked &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen found, zombie villagers must be detained and covered with a roof (or soaked in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;) to prevent them from burning in sunlight. They can be cured with a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, they can be carried to their &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s (but recommended to settle their village in the vicinity after having them).\nAdditionally, if you're in a snowy biome and haven't found a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, you can start up your own by finding an &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; with a basement. This is a reliable method for creating your own village in a snowy biome. In the basement of the igloo, there is a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; (in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the villager may be any profession). By curing the zombie villager, you'll have two villagers (one of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the cauldron being their &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block), which you can transport to the top of the igloo via Minecarts or upward &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column\"&gt;Bubble Column&lt;/a&gt;. \nNext, place down at least 6 valid beds around the two villagers, and give them some food (3 pieces of bread each) to make them \"willing\" to breed. After the two villagers breed and create a &lt;a href=\"baby%20villager\"&gt;baby villager&lt;/a&gt;, you can create a simple infinite villager breeder. Note that villagers cannot infinitely breed without stopping, because they also need to rest at home, sleep, gossip, and work (or wander around if they are a nitwit). Additionally, they need food in order to be willing.\nExpansion.\nTo get more &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, one can repeatedly add in more houses to let the villagers breed more and make more villagers. After obtaining two villagers, place down at least 6 valid beds around them and give them some food (3 pieces of bread each) to make them \"willing\" to breed. If the conditions are met the two villagers will eventually breed and create a &lt;a href=\"baby%20villager\"&gt;baby villager&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo assign a profession, just place their &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block; see &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Professions\"&gt;Professions&lt;/a&gt; for more information. \nAlso, if the villagers are gossiping a lot, an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; can spawn, which can be an aid in defense or serve as a source of &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Gossip\"&gt;Gossip&lt;/a&gt; is based on certain player actions (curing, attacking, killing, or trading).\nPlease note that the larger your village is, the more prone it is to a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20siege\"&gt;zombie siege&lt;/a&gt;. In order for a zombie siege to occur, there must be at least 10 beds or 20 villagers and the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must be present in the village.\nIf you build a village in a biome where an &lt;a href=\"illager%20patrol\"&gt;illager patrol&lt;/a&gt; can spawn, be careful; they will try to kill villagers, and killing the patrol captain triggers a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; in your own village. Fences or walls can keep them out easily, or let an iron golem kill the captain; otherwise, you can equip yourself with a &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk bucket&lt;/a&gt; and/or try to kill everyone but the captain (if you accidentally kill the captain in the village, drink the milk immediately and hope for the best). Then lead the captain well away from the village (over 32 blocks from the nearest bed) to kill them, and drink the milk before returning to the village.

On the other hand, other shapes, such as circles and triangles, are more difficult to make. Although there can never be a perfect circle or perfect triangle in the blocky world of Minecraft, this tutorial shows the closest to a circle or triangle you can make. \nAny blocks can be used when making the shapes from this tutorial, with the exception of gravity blocks such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; if the shape includes height as one of its dimensions.\nSome helpful sites, listed up here for convenience:\nUsage and Basics.\nKnowing how to build triangles and circles can be very beneficial if you build very often. Although knowing how to build these shapes will not help you at all with survival skills, when making statues, pixel art, house, and/or large fountains, adding triangles and circles to your building will give it much more depth.\nOnce you know how to build certain shapes, you can build an infinite number of things, and impress other players greatly. Some ideas include a statue made only of triangles, a mansion which looks like a giant sphere from the outside, or a giant oval arm. There are so many possibilities of things to build when you don't have to stick to building squares and rectangles - use your creativity!\nThe two main categories of shapes are 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional. 2-dimensional shapes consist of only 2 of the following: height, length, or width. 3-dimensional shapes consist of all 3. 3-dimensional shapes are usually either a combination of two different 2-dimensional shapes, or two 2-dimensional shapes of the same type but rotated different ways. To make specific shapes, read on.\nAngled lines.\nThis table shows the segments of lines from angles 0 to 45 degrees. To create a line of arbitrary direction, find the angle or slope closest to what you want, then build the segment provided under Line. Build the next segment at the corner of the block and repeat as necessary.\nFor convenience, here are two links that will generate (approximately) the above sequences of steps:\nSet the range for n as far as necessary for maximal accuracy, default is 1-20. The slope and angle chosen in the links are purposefully very close to each other, 3/17 = 0.176470588 and arctan(10 degrees) = 0.172792435, a difference small enough that won't be noticed for ~270 blocks. (Note arctan(3/17) ~= 10.007980degrees).\n2-dimensional shapes.\nThese 2-dimensional shapes have only length and height, or only length and width. Most 3-dimensional shapes are based on one or more 2-dimensional shapes.\n\"Note: Each of these demonstrations for the shapes only shows how the perimeter of the shape should look. If you would like, you can fill the center of the shape in. Also, remember that for the grids, the shapes will look wider than they really are.\"\nRight Triangle.\nRight triangles are perhaps the easiest triangle to make, because of the fact that two of their sides are straight lines, going either vertical or horizontal. Only one side is diagonal. The following grids show how to make a right triangle with a 4 block base and height, and one with a 9 block base and height.\n&lt;br&gt;\nRight triangle extensions.\nYou can make right triangles with different bases and heights, but they are harder to make, because they don't use an exact line for the diagonal side. The right triangle shown before is for a 45-degree diagonal side.\nFor a diagonal side with a 65 to 70 degree angle, repeatedly place 2 blocks upwards for the diagonal line, before going towards the vertical line, like so:\nFor a diagonal side with a 20 to 25 degree angle, repeatedly place 2 blocks horizontally for the diagonal line, before going towards the vertical line, like so:\nFor angles in between 25 and 45, and angles between 45 and 65, you must use combinations of patterns from both of the slopes that the angle is in between. (see Angled lines above)\nEquilateral Triangle.\nEquilateral triangles are a little bit more abstract than right triangles, but they still have a clear way to build them. First, build a line of blocks however long you want your triangle to be. Then, build one block up on the edges of the lines. Continue by building in sets of 2 blocks up, going 1 block inwards each time. Look at the following grids for examples:\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNotice how the triangles look more triangular the bigger they are. \nTriangles made in this way have angles of 70 degrees at the bases and 54 degrees atop, and the sides are 20% longer than the base. A true equilateral triangle has sides of 60 degrees, which can be approximated using the \"angled lines\" char above as a 30-degree angle from the perpendicular or vertical. This could be approximated by doing a 1-block segment every (alternately) two and three 2-block segments, but this may end up looking uneven, and the difference will only be apparent for fairly large triangles. A perfectly equilateral triangle is possible if it is not orthogonal to any of the coordinate axes, but rather orthogonal to the space diagonal of a block.\nParabolas.\nParabolas are conic sections that are U-shaped curves. A formula for a parabola is y = x. Using this, it is relatively simple to build. Just step 1 block, then increase the number of blocks by a constant.\nCircles.\nCircles are rather difficult to make in Minecraft, partially because of the fact that unlike triangles, there is not one way to make any size of circle; each size uses a completely different arrangement of blocks. As you look at the different sizes of circles, you will see that not all of them have the same shape, and none of them are a perfect circle. This is because different sizes of circles must have different arrangements of blocks, so that they can look as close to a circle as possible.\nThe pattern of blocks for every circle cannot be explained, because, like mentioned earlier, each size has a completely different pattern. The best way to make a circle is to just experiment with different block arrangements, or look at images made by other people who experimented with block arrangements and made a circle. The diagrams only show quarter circles; the full circles are obtained by reflecting the quarter-circles along the top and left edges. For circles with odd diameters, reflect along the center of the first line of blocks. \nEven diameters\nOdd diameters\nYou can use this generator to create other sizes.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//donatstudios.com/PixelCircleGenerator\"&gt;donatstudios.com&lt;/a&gt;\n3-dimensional shapes.\n3-dimensional shapes are composed of length, width, and height, and are usually made up of either 1 or several 2-dimensional shapes. 3-dimensional shapes are often much more complex than 2-dimensional.\nSphere.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.plotz.co.uk/plotz-model.php%3Fmodel%3DSphere\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nPyramid.\nTo make a pyramid, first make a square and build a pillar in the middle to denote the height. Then start at the midpoint of one of the sides and build up by a number of blocks, and after every set of those blocks go in by one or two blocks and repeat until hitting the top. Then repeat on all 4 sides. Then, starting from the top, connect the 4 sides of each level of the pyramid with a square ring. Progress downward, each square bigger than the last, until hitting the bottom. For an even better pyramid, use stairs or slabs to smooth the angle. For a steeper pyramid, use a steeper angle, and vice versa.\nCone.\nYou can use a similar process as with a pyramid, but with circles instead. Start with a circular base and decrease the size of the circle as you go up. To create a concave or narrowing cone, increase the height of each layer as you rise. For a convex cone, start with thicker layers and decrease the height of each layer."}
{"id": "64513", "revid": "56440731", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=64513", "title": "Tutorials/Creeper farming", "text": "Creeper farming is one of the most reliable methods of obtaining large amounts of gunpowder, aside from farming ghasts and witches. You can either burn them using campfires or kill them with a Looting III sword which multiplies the drop rates significantly.\nCharged creeper farming is a variant of creeper farming which produces &lt;a href=\"Creeper%23Charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creepers&lt;/a&gt; for later detonation to obtain a &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;. As charged creepers are only created when a creeper is struck by lightning, charged creeper farms can be difficult to build. The simplest design is the 'creeper field' design, where creepers are kept in cells below the ground in a flat area.\nFarm designs.\nCreeper only farm.\nWhen trapdoors are placed on a 2-block high ceiling, it lowers the height to blocks high. This is tall enough to allow &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn, but short enough to prevent other mobs such as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. , this mechanic may not work. Be aware some Creeper farms can also spawn &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s. This is easily avoided by removing 3-by-3 areas in the farm. For example, carpet can be placed with 2 blocks between them to block spiders with a minimal loss of spawn area for the creepers.\nYou can make a creeper farm by placing a spawning platform in an ocean to maximize spawning rates. Make a 2-block wall and the roof must be trapdoors. Place cats in boats in the end of the farm to scare the creepers away and it will direct the creepers to the other end in which you will have a water stream guiding the creepers to a kill mechanism which can be manual, with campfires, magma blocks...\nAnother way to get the creepers to move into a killing zone it to place a snow golem at one end. These snow golems must be at least 3 blocks away from all creepers otherwise the creepers explode, killing the golems. Snow golems are the only creature that players can create that naturally attack creepers.\nChapman's design.\nThis design requires 2 cats. It's a simple build and despite its small size, it produces around 700 gunpowder per hour which is enough in the early game. The build layout is in the form of an hourglass, and to make sure only creepers spawn, trapdoors are placed on the roof as creepers are slightly smaller than zombies and skeletons. An AFK platform is built high-up in the sky to increase pack-spawning. To improve the rates further, it is recommended to light up the nearby areas and caves. The farm is also expandable by digging underground. Creepers are killed using campfires or lava, but it's recommended to use campfires as gunpowder can be burned in lava.\nNamiature's design.\nThis design is best used on the cold ocean biome, although it can be used on land, albeit with a bit of spawn proofing to boost the rates. Namiature's design is almost like Gnembon's creeper farm, but instead of using a redstone timer to push the creepers away, the creepers are transported to the killing chamber by using cats. Also, instead of using glass pillars, carpets are used to increase the rates further. The creepers are killed by using magma blocks in an X-shaped pattern and the top of the farm is covered with slabs to allow pack spawning. The AFK platform is 127 blocks from the ocean level, with a 21-block bridge made from glass protruding towards the farm. At the 21st block is where the AFK platform is situated. According to the creator, this is to boost the rates further. The farm itself is expandable, requiring more building blocks, cats, trapdoors, glass and slabs. More layers meant better rates for this farm and is one of the best to build.\nSB737 would later modify this design by making a water chamber pushing the creepers towards a nether portal. In the nether, a glass tube is built around the portal, with creepers falling to the killing chamber. SB737 would then kill them after some time, with 5 minutes of AFKing from his 11-layer farm producing over 10 stacks of gunpowder (the Looting III is also applied which amplified the rates). This is also a good source of XP to mend your equipment.\nCharged creeper farms.\nThis farm works with a general mob farm attached to a filter to obtain only the creepers. It then gives each creeper its own 'cell.' The system detects when lightning strikes a cell and then moves the charged creeper into a separate area.\nThis type of farm is very expensive to build and is not recommended unless you have a lot of time and resources. It is probably better to create a creeper only farm and use a channeling trident to charge the creepers. The mob filter however may be interesting for platforms which do not have reliable creeper only farms.\n&lt;a href=\"Creeper%23Charged%20creeper\"&gt;Charged creepers&lt;/a&gt; are necessary to obtain &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;s (except for wither skeletons'). Charged creeper farming is one way to create charged creepers. Since the introduction of &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s, these methods have mostly become obsolete. However, they may still be useful in some editions.\nFor a creeper to become charged, lightning must strike within a 4x4 area of it. Charged creepers despawn just like regular creepers, so it may be prudent to &lt;a href=\"Name%20Tag\"&gt;nametag&lt;/a&gt; any creepers that you wish to keep for an extended period.\nChanneling trident.\nYou can use a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment to summon lightning during a &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;. Simply create a collection area for a &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt; farm that is small enough that the creepers will be within 4 blocks of the lightning strike. Then, wait for a thunderstorm and throw a channeling trident at one of the creepers. Note that the creepers must be exposed to the sky for the Channeling enchantment to work. It is recommended to have the &lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on the trident to allow for easy retrieval.\nCreeper field.\nCreeper fields are one of the simplest charged creeper farm designs. They consist of a flat field with 'cells' dug into ground containing creepers. This kind of farm is easiest to create on flat surroundings. Once built, the farm can be set up to supply mob heads with minimal effort. This can be achieved by placing &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s underneath the cells leading to a 'detonation chamber,' a room for blowing up other mobs with the charged creepers to obtain heads.\nIt is possible to make this type of farm more efficient by surrounding the creeper with other mobs. If there is an entity within a 3x3 area of the lightning strike, the lighting will strike at that entity instead. Manipulating lightning like this is known as \"lightning farming.\" For more information, see &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm%23Lightning%20mechanics\"&gt;lightning mechanics&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinecart storage.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16&lt;/a&gt;, mobs that are riders of other entities do not despawn. This includes passengers of &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, which means a mob is both prevented from despawning and removed from the mob cap when caught in a boat or a minecart. A possible application of this is to create charged creeper farms without the use of name tags. \nTo operate, the farm requires a creeper-only farm connected to a storage system. As creepers spawn, they are put into minecarts, which prevents them from despawning and removes them from the mob cap. These creepers are then stored, and when a &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt; hits, these creepers will be unloaded (because minecarts will be destroyed by the lightning) in a tight area, and the player can throw a Channeling trident at an armor stand with sky access, and the lightning will charge all creepers in the process. These charged creepers are now loaded in minecarts again and can now be stored until further notice. A nearby regular mob farm that produces zombies, skeletons and creepers can now be connected to the charged creeper storage, enabling mob head farming."}

{"id": "44384", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=44384", "title": "Tutorials/Crop farming", "text": "Crop farming allows players to &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; any of several &lt;a href=\"vegetable\"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, which then grow over time and can be harvested for &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;. This page covers four separate crops, all of which share essentially the same growth mechanics, though they produce different crops. All four seeds need to grow to maturity to produce more crops.\nStarting out.\nEach crop requires a &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt; for planting, and getting the first few can be non-trivial. After the first few seeds, or the first carrot or potato are planted, they eventually produce more seeds or vegetables than you started with. These can be used to replant, and plant more empty spots, until you've filled your farm. All four crops provide food for the player, and also to breed various farm animals. In addition to the sources listed below, all four crops can be found in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; farms, and sometimes in village chests.\nPlayers may want to set up a &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; farm early on, to provide &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; as their first food supply; however, as the game progresses, better foods become available, and the wheat farm can be re-purposed for breeding animals. Carrots, potatoes, and beetroot are usually not found until somewhat later in the game. \nCrops can also be used to lure and &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; various farm animals: Wheat for &lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; (or the rare &lt;a href=\"Mooshroom\"&gt;mooshrooms&lt;/a&gt;), seeds (\"any\" kind) for &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;, and any of carrots, (raw) potatoes or beetroots for &lt;a href=\"Pig\"&gt;pigs&lt;/a&gt;. Carrots (or &lt;a href=\"Flower\"&gt;dandelions&lt;/a&gt;) can also be used for &lt;a href=\"Rabbit\"&gt;rabbits&lt;/a&gt;.\nSowing.\nThese crops can only be planted on &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, which is produced by using a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s. If there is no &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; nearby, farmland dries out and reverts to dirt, but only if there is no crop yet planted on it. The water can be a \"still\" source block, or flowing, but either needs to be within four blocks of the farmland horizontally, on the same vertical level or one level above. If farmland becomes completely dry \"and\" a crop is planted on it, the farmland does not revert to dirt. Thus, it is possible to grow crops without water (say, in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;) by hoeing the dirt and immediately planting a crop. The farmland does not revert until after the crop is harvested, and even so that can generally be avoided by immediately replanting. Note, however, that this \"dry farming\" makes crops grow slowly.\nAt the beginning of the game when &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s are not available, you can till the dirt at the edge of a pond or &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps digging a trench to extend the water supply inland or straightening the shoreline by adding or removing dirt blocks at the top layer of the water's edge. However, once the player has a comfortable amount of resources, setting up some &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;d farm plots prevents mobs from trampling the crops and attacking the farmer.\nA basic repeatable farm plot consists of a 9\u00d79 square of farmland with the center square dug out and filled with a water source block. This gives 80 blocks of farmland which can be fenced with 40 pieces of fence including &lt;a href=\"gate\"&gt;gate&lt;/a&gt;s and is the most efficient arrangement for simple farms. For larger farms, this plot can be repeated in both the X and Z &lt;a href=\"direction\"&gt;direction&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLeaving the water source uncovered poses a risk of falling into it and then trampling some of the farmland when jumping out of it. The water can be covered with any block, but using a &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;, or other block that can be walked onto without jumping is better to prevent trampling. In modern versions of the game, you can also place a slab \"in\" the water block, providing a walkable surface with the farmland. In cold &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, covering the water with a solid block also guards it against &lt;a href=\"Ice\"&gt;freezing&lt;/a&gt;. An alternative that also provides &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; so some crops can continue to grow at &lt;a href=\"night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt; is to suspend a block above the water with one space of &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; between them\u2014so you can neither fall into the water nor jump on and off the block\u2014and place torches on that block (or use a &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; as the block).\nPlacing &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or other light sources near the crops allows them to continue growing at night or underground, and it prevents &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; mobs from spawning near them. Planting crops in alternate rows (that is, rows separated by bare farmland or a different crop) speeds up growth as well.\nGrowth and harvesting.\nGrowing conditions.\nAny of &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es grow only under the following conditions:\nIn single-player or in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; with only one player nearby, crops do not grow faster while the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"sleeping\"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt;. However, if torches are not being used, sleeping skips past the nights when the crops would not grow.\nWheat, carrots and potatoes have a total of 8 growth stages. Beetroot has 4 growth stages. For wheat, each stage is a little taller and darker than the last, and the crop is mature when the wheat turns brown. Carrots and potatoes have only 4 distinct appearances\u2014each pair of stages appears identical except that stage 7 shares the appearance of stages 5-6 (so the player can tell if it's fully mature or not, otherwise the fully mature and its previous stage can confuse the player). When mature (stage 8 for carrots and potatoes, stage 4 for beetroots), carrots and beetroots show bright crops protruding from the ground, while on a potato plant, the leaves appear significantly taller than in previous stages.\nGrowth happens at random intervals and is affected by growing conditions. The average duration of each stage ranges from 5 &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;minutes&lt;/a&gt; (in ideal conditions) to 35 minutes (in worst-case conditions). Aside from being placed on &lt;a href=\"hydrated\"&gt;hydrated&lt;/a&gt; farmland, \"ideal conditions\" include having light sources (for night growth) and planting crops in alternate rows: each row of plants should be next to either a different crop or empty farmland. For the plants on the edges of the plot, it's \"also\" ideal to have more farmland beyond the row ends and the outer rows; however, this is rarely done since it amounts to leaving the edges of the available field empty. Full details of the growth mechanics are given below.\nAccelerating growth.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;Bone Meal&lt;/a&gt; on any crop plant has a chance to advance it a random number of growing stages, allowing you to harvest it faster.\n&lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to accelerate the growth of crops by pollinating them. After collecting pollen from flowers, bees visually drop pollen particles as they make their way back to their &lt;a href=\"Beehive\"&gt;hive or nest&lt;/a&gt;. If these particles land on a crop, the crop advances one growth stage. Each bee can pollinate up to 10 crops per trip. Players can utilize this behavior by placing their crops between beehives and &lt;a href=\"Flower\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt; to maximize crop pollen exposure. For more details, see &lt;a href=\"Bee%23Pollinating\"&gt;Bee \u00a7 Pollinating&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarvesting.\nCrops can be harvested at any time by &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;left-clicking&lt;/a&gt; on them with or without a &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, but when immature, they yield only one of the corresponding seed item. When mature, wheat yields 0-3 &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; and one item of wheat. Carrots and potatoes yield 1-4 of the crop when mature. Mature potato plants have a 2% chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"poisonous%20potato\"&gt;poisonous potato&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the normal potatoes. Beetroots drop 0-3 seeds and 1 beetroot.\nBecause harvesting one block at a time can become very tedious, &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Crop%20farming%23Farm%20designs\"&gt;methods&lt;/a&gt; for automatically harvesting fields have been developed. The most common tactic is to flood the field with water (which harvests all the plants it touches), but other methods are possible as discussed below.\nGrowth rate.\nThe progression of crops over time is shown in the plot to the right. Each line represents the probability of finding a given crop in that particular growth stage, assuming ideal conditions. The plots for non-ideal conditions look similar with only the scale of the x-axis (time passed) being longer.\nEarly in the game it may be helpful to maximize the growth rate of a crop in order to quickly multiply the &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s and/or get some &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; quickly. Doing so requires some understanding of the growth mechanics which are discussed here.\nCrop growth is prompted by random &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014the same random events that, for example, causes &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;Zombified Piglins&lt;/a&gt; to appear in Nether portals. For a given block, a random update occurs an average of once every 68.27 seconds in Java Edition, or once every 204.8 seconds in Bedrock Edition. However, the delay can vary widely, and it is rare, but possible for plants to gain a stage the moment after planting or grow two stages a moment apart.\nDuring every update, a crop plant gets a chance to grow to the next stage with the exact chance depending on conditions:\nIf any plants of the same type are growing in the eight surrounding blocks, the point total is cut in half, unless the crops are arranged in rows. That is, having the same sort of plant either on a diagonal or in both north-south and east-west &lt;a href=\"direction\"&gt;direction&lt;/a&gt;s cuts the growth chance, but having the same type of plant only north-south or east-west does not. The growth chance is only halved once no matter how many plants surround the central one.\nFrom this we can figure the growth periods for the common cases:\n \nLater in the game, the highest yield per area of a given field may be more important than the fastest growth per seed. Fields sown solidly to achieve this with a single crop do grow at half the speed, but they also let you separate each type of crop into its own respective field and harvest one type all at once. However, one large field with alternating rows of different crops would still grow faster than smaller fields each sown solidly with a single crop.\nFor &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s:\nFarm designs.\nClassic farm.\nThe basic farm plot is a 9\u00d79 plot of farmland with the center block replaced by water (often surrounded by fences, making it 11\u00d711). This basic plot can be used for wheat, beetroots, carrots, or potatoes, or even for &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pumpkin%20and%20Melon%20Farming\"&gt;pumpkins and/or melons&lt;/a&gt;. As described above, it may be planted solidly, or in alternating rows for fastest total yield per area. For night growth, light may be suspended above the water block and placed around the edges. The central water hole can be covered with a bottom-slab, to avoid falling in; in recent versions, a top-slab can be placed \"in\" the water hole (that is, a waterlogged slab), for a flat surface.\nThe field can be harvested quickly by simply dumping a bucket of water over the center, washing all the crops up against the fence.\nThis design may be easily extended in both the X and Z directions. If lighting the field for night growth, additional lights is needed (again they may be suspended in the air) where the corners of the basic plots meet.\nTo farm multiple crops in a single field's footprint, you can stack the fields making a vertical farm. One complication here is that a block is needed to hold the water on each level. A &lt;a href=\"Jack%20o%27Lantern\"&gt;Jack o'Lantern&lt;/a&gt; can be used to both hold up the water and provide central lighting, or any block can have torches placed on it. The fields can be stacked with two-block or three-block spacing. Harvesting can be easily done by using a &lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom of the lighting block (three block spacing) or the top of the waterlogged slab (two-block spacing, but must manually break the corner plants). Alternatively, you can irrigate all levels with a waterfall through the (empty) center block spaces. and provide lighting elsewhere.\nSemi-automatic harvesting.\nThe next extension of that idea is to provide a touch of automation. Expanding the field to 9x10 (with two water blocks in the middle) and stacking the fields with two-block spacing allows automating the harvest, with a double central column between the water blocks: Two jack-o-lanterns on the bottom, and two outward-facing &lt;a href=\"dispensers\"&gt;dispensers&lt;/a&gt; on top , each loaded with a water bucket. The dispensers also support the water above; note that with just one central column and a 9 by 9 block farm, a single water dispenser wouldn't be able to reach all the crops. The dispensers can be triggered with buttons or tripwires; either way, they need to be on top to avoid displacing some crops with the button or hook. Adding plot borders with fences, a stairway along one edge, and four layers expands the whole system to 12\u00d712\u00d712. Some notes on this scheme:\nInstead of going for a 9\u00d710 expansion, it is also possible to stay in the 9x9 field (11x11 fenced) footprint by adding four water dispensers on the four corners of the fence. This variation takes more dispensers to make, but all products fall into the water hole for easy collection. When you make the farm vertical, a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; can be used to contain the water while allowing the items to fall through to the bottom layer, where a hopper may lie.\nMicro farms.\nMicro / Nano farms are useful when space is limited. They grow the crops by firing bonemeal at them from a dispenser. There are 2 basic designs, a semi-automatic one that requires the player to stand and plant the crops and a fully automatic one that uses villagers to do the work for you. \nThe farm shown in impulseSV's Farm Design video does not work anymore as of 1.13, but with a workaround it still gets the job done.\n\"See the images to the right.\"\nImpulseSV's farm design.\nThis is a semi-automatic design suitable for all types of crops.\nFrilioth's 1.14.4 potato, carrot, and wheat farm design.\nThis design uses a villager wearing a straw hat to plant and harvest carrots, potatoes, or wheat\nMikecraft's farm design.\nThis design is slower than others, but it doesn't require the player to manually plant seeds.\nSemi-automatic farming.\nThere are ways to harvest crops semi-automatically.\nAutomatic harvesting is generally an all-or-nothing business - harvesting every plant regardless of whether it is mature. In this situation, it is best not to wait for every last plant to finish growing, as there are always a few that take much longer than normal. The optimal time to harvest wheat in particular turns out to be when 80% () of the plants have matured, and this is at least acceptable for carrots and potatoes. Assuming that the field is immediately replanted, harvesting at this time results in the greatest overall rate of production, along with a surplus of seeds for wheat. The section on growth rates gives the optimum harvesting time in minutes for some common planting arrangements.\nBecause bonemeal can force crops to grow more quickly\u2014ignoring normal concerns like growth rate or ambient light\u2014it can be used to create large amounts of wheat or other crops quickly. A number of farm designs focus on using bonemeal exclusively, sacrificing volume and growth efficiency for speed/ease of planting and harvesting. An example which takes advantage of the inventory mechanics to minimize the time required to plant and harvest can be seen here:\nFlooded-cell farm.\nThis farm is divided into cells of 29 plants, where each cell is flooded individually by a single piston and water block (or bucket-bearing dispenser). The drops are washed into a stream, gathering them to a single point.\nThere\u2019s a stream of water in the center of the farm, which needs to go down 1 block every 8 blocks toward a collection point. This can be mirrored on the other side of the collection point, to cut the total depth needed.\nOn one or both sides of the stream are farming cells. The cells are separated from each other with two block high walls. If a 1-block high wall or fencing is used, some of the drops may fall onto the barrier and out of the flow. Under every wall separating the cells from each other is a source block of water, to hydrate the farmland on both sides of the wall.\nThe design as shown uses a piston to control the flow of water. The piston is normally extended. Above the extended piston shaft is a water source block, surrounded by 8 (or even 4) glass blocks or panes. Glass is needed so that light goes through the plants. When the switch is turned off, the piston retracts and the water flows through.\nThe piston setup can be replaced with a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; containing a bucket of water and using a button instead of a lever for the switch. Either way, the pistons or dispensers should be wired together behind the cells with &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s as needed, to allow triggering them from some central point. \nWhen released, the water harvests the crops and washes them into the stream. At the end of the stream, you can collect your drops, or place a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; to do it for you.\nFully automatic farming.\nFully-automatic farms can be constructed using Farmer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s to replant the crops. Three general designs are possible:\nIn all cases, the farm must be entirely within the bounds of a village or must be more than 32 blocks away from the outer boundary of any village. Otherwise the villager attempts to make his way to the nearby village instead of tending the crops.\nFrilioth's one chunk farm design.\nWheat and beetroot module\nPotato and carrot module"}

{"id": "39604", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39604", "title": "Tutorials/Curved roofs", "text": "To get a roof that looks curved in \"Minecraft\", you should generally expect to work on quite a large scale. If the curve radius is less than about six meters, the roof will tend to look like a normal pitched roof with a strange mixture of pitches. At smaller scales, it is easier to correctly interpret a dome structure as curved, but other curves may not even be recognizable.\nCurve Basics.\nFor reference, this image shows a set of pixel-perfect circles with diameters from 1 to 18 pixels. It was generated from a simple graphics program zoomed in to 800% and with the grid turned on. If you want to generate larger circles for yourself, or ellipses or other curves, Paintbrush (macOS), Microsoft Paint (Windows), and GIMP (free software available on most platforms including macOS, Windows, and Linux) are all useful tools. However, if you need to generate more sophisticated shapes, then you may begin to need more powerful tools than just a basic bitmap editing package.\nWhen constructing a curve, one would usually treat one pixel as corresponding to one &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;. By using stairs and half-slabs it is sometimes possible to treat one pixel as a quarter of a block, but because no quarter-pixel blocks exist in the game as yet, it won't always be possible to match the desired curve perfectly.\nWe now consider the main curve options, in approximate order of how easy it is to make them look convincing.\nDomes.\nDomes are often seen in temples and other large, 'monumental' or civic buildings. Domes 'work' because in \"Minecraft\" one tends to assume a small symmetrical blob is supposed to be a dome even if it is actually quite angular. By comparison, other curved shapes are a lot harder to interpret, and because of this, they must be of much better quality before they look acceptable.\nNote that building domes by hand, especially using &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"slabs\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt;, is very fiddly. It is strongly recommended that you use an external tool such as MCEdit to make these shapes.\nSegmented dome.\nA \"segmented dome\" can be created by taking just the top rows of a larger-than needed dome. The effect is to produce a dome that joins the building walls at a shallower angle, whereas a hemispherical dome would be fully vertical at the point it joins the walls. In this image, the top three layers (diameters 14, 12 and 6) of a diameter-22 dome were chosen.\nAnother way to make a segmented dome is to use a normal dome 'recipe' but use slabs instead of stairs. You can also use both methods combined. The right-hand example uses diameters of 13, 11, 9 and 5 meters.\nSurmounted dome.\nA \"surmounted dome\" is a dome raised on a cylindrical base. It is shaped like a large cylinder with a rounded end. Shown on the left is a diameter-17 surmounted dome, with a four-block cylinder height, and on the right is a segmented, surmounted dome.\nOther dome types.\nDomes do not necessarily have to be \"circular\" domes. Other possibilities include ellipsoidal domes, bell domes, onion domes, surmounted domes, segmented domes, compound domes and more. With the exceptions of the surmounted and segmented domes, these other shapes tend to be harder to model well than a simple semi-circular dome, so unless you are working on a very large scale project and have computer assistance it's probably best to avoid them.\nHow to construct a hemispherical dome.\nIf you do want to make a dome by hand, the rough procedure is as follows:\nTip: Note that successive rings for a dome will always have odd diameters, or always have even diameters. If you ever switch from odd to even or vice versa you have made a mistake.\nHow to construct a segmented dome.\nFor example, if you choose the top three rows of a diameter-22 circle, you get 14, 12, 6. That would be a usable set of widths for a size-14 building. The resulting segmented dome would have a diameter of 14 meters but would only need to be three blocks high.\nHow to construct a surmounted dome.\nExample 1: The diameter-17 standard dome can be made into a surmounted dome by altering its diameter list to 17, 17, 17, 17, 15, 15, 13, 11, 9, 5 and building accordingly. The more 17's you add to the list, the greater the height of the mount.\nExample 2: In the right-hand image the top three layers of a diameter-22 segmented dome have been used for a surmounted dome. The diameter list was adjusted to 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 12, 6, producing a surmounted segmented dome.\nBarrel roofs.\nA roof with a cylindrical section, as might be seen for the roof of a barn, a warehouse, a hangar or many other large, comparatively simple structures, is termed a \"barrel roof\". The barrel part does not necessarily have to use a full half-circle curve; this picture shows a diameter-18 curve with a height of seven blocks.\nArched roofs.\nA roman arch is simply a semicircle. An arched roof that uses a roman arch is simply a &lt;a href=\"%23Barrel%20roofs\"&gt;barrel roof&lt;/a&gt;. A \"gothic arch\" is pointier. You can generate a gothic arch by drawing two circles of the same radius so that they overlap. To make a pointier arch, move the centers of the two circles \"further apart\". \"Gothic roofs\" are rare on residential buildings, and are much more likely to be found on larger buildings such as meeting halls, churches and other such structures. Even barns may have gothic roofs, although they tend to have quite 'fat' arches rather than the much sharper curves seen for churches. There are many technical terms for other types of arches, but they are usually used for openings \"inside\" a building, not as its main roof shape. \nConical roofs.\nA cone-shaped roof, as might be seen atop a circular tower or for a church spire, can be constructed in a similar way to the method used for domes. As for domes it's also possible, in principle, to 'smooth' the curve a bit using &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"slabs\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt;, but this is still fiddly and is not recommended except for practiced builders. Recognizable cones are very hard to model except at large scales, or possibly by using \"Minecraft\" plugins to tweak the shape of the curve.\nHow to construct a conical roof.\nFor a conical roof, a workable manual construction procedure is as follows:\nThis example produces a conical roof which shrinks from diameter 8 to 2 while rising 12 meters. It's not uncommon for a sharp spire to rise 3\u22125 blocks, sometimes more, before its radius reduces. You can also change the rate at which the cone reduces in size to give give it a slightly curved profile. For example, instead of a radius reduction every 5 meters, you might start at 4, then increase to 6, 8, 10 as you work up the spire.\nTip: Note that, as for domes, successive rings of a conical roof will always have odd diameters, or always have even diameters. Unless you are using a different construction method of your own, if you ever switch from odd to even or vice versa you have made a mistake.\nTip: You can make an odd-diameter spire look pointier by adding &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence posts&lt;/a&gt; of some kind as additional levels above the topmost block, and by replacing the diameter 3 circle with four blocks arranged in a diamond rather than eight blocks forming a hollow square.\nOther complex curves.\nComplex curves, including saddle shapes and nested arches, may be seen in large modern buildings like the Sydney Opera House, many stadiums and skyscapers. Older buildings may have 'ogee roofs' \u2212 roofs whose profile follows an .\nThese curves can be quite easy to do provided the building is sufficiently large that Minecraft's one-meter 'block resolution' is fine enough, but such structures tend to require a minimum building size of at least 20\u00d720 blocks and often more. If you are working at this scale you will probably be using external computer programs or graphics tools to help with the design.\nConcave curves.\nRoofs with concave curves, as in the style of some traditional Japanese buildings made with bamboo are by far the hardest shapes to model well in \"Minecraft\". At small scales \u2212 that is, at comparable sizes to NPC village buildings \u2212 it is probably best to approximate them using straight sections, possibly using fence posts, signs, or different materials to make the straight lines less obvious."}

You can then download these maps and play them. Note that this is not a list of maps; this just has suggestions of how to play and use maps. You can find a list of maps on other websites.\nImporting maps.\nBefore you can import a map, you will need to download one. There are many websites online for this purpose.\nOnce you have downloaded the map, it should be in .zip format. Extract and copy the compressed folder. Next, start the Minecraft Launcher and click Launch Options on the top right corner. Select your profile and click Open Game Dir. The .minecraft folder should appear. Finally, paste the copied map folder into the saves folder and start Minecraft. The world should have appeared in your worlds list.\nJava Edition, Simpler Map Transfer\nAfter the map is downloaded, take the .zip file, and copy it. Now, go to the \"Type here to search\" area on the taskbar. Type Run, and write %appdata%. After You Find The .minecraft folder, go to the \"saves\" folder, and paste the world\nOnce you have downloaded the map, it should be in a .mcworld or folder format. \nTo import the .mcworld format on Windows 10, you should be able to double click the file to open it in Minecraft, the world will be automatically imported.\nTo import the .mcworld format on a mobile device, you should be able to click a share/open in button or double tap it to open the file in Minecraft, the world will be automatically imported.\nTo import the map as folder format for all OS, you will have to drag the world folder manually to Minecraft/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/ folder.\nMap types.\nPlaying the maps is the most fun part. Custom maps often have objectives and sometimes a storyline. They can be great fun and there are many types. Here are a few of the types, as well as some tips to completing them.\nPuzzle.\nThese are obstacle courses involving puzzles to complete. They might have a scoring system, such as &lt;a href=\"chests\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; hidden with &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. The more you collect, the higher your score. Here are some obstacles you may see:\nAction.\nGenerally, these maps involve fighting and survival skills.\nPVP.\nThese maps are for Player vs. Player. They are great if you get tired of fighting the same in-game mobs, since the AI can be very predictable.\nParkour.\nParkour means to jump over blocks. They are usually organized in stages. There are several kinds of jumps, ranging from corner jumps, S - jumps, and &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; jumps. These maps are a test of agility and timing.\nCreative.\nThese are maps with no real goal in mind. They often have stunning scenery or mechanics. The website &lt;a href=\"https%3A//planetminecraft.com\"&gt;Planet Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; is filled with these. They can sometimes have a purpose, like as a map for a server.\nAdventure.\nComplete a long and winding storyline. Often has lots of content. Sometimes puzzle, sometimes action, sometimes parkour. You cannot break any blocks in these maps, unless specifically told or allowed otherwise.\nHorror.\nGenerally an Adventure map with jumpscares and a dark/ambiguous storyline. Ghosts, past memories, death, and locked-in are common themes.\nSharing maps.\nFor importing a map, you will first need to open the minecraft saves folder. This can be found by opening the launcher, clicking Launch Options, and clicking Open Game Dir. Once you are in the .minecraft folder, navigate to the saves folder and find the world you want to share. To make it easier to send to others, you will probably want to compress the folder into a zip file.\nOptionally, you can also go to a site such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//mediafire.com\"&gt;MediaFire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curseforge.com/\"&gt;CurseForge&lt;/a&gt; and find their uploads screen. Paste the file in and follow the instructions. The Internet can now see your creation!\nExporting a map is easiest on Windows 10. In Windows 10, open Minecraft and click edit on the world you wish to share. Scroll to the bottom and click the \"Export World\" button and choose a location to save the .mcworld file to.\nOn mobile, you will first need to locate the Minecraft folder. In iOS, you can access this in the \u201cFiles\u201d app in the \"On My iPhone\u201d or \u201cOn My iPad\u201d or \u201cOn My iPod\u201d category. Once in the Minecraft folder, you will need to go to \"Minecraft/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/\" In this folder, you can find all of your Minecraft worlds in folders with randomized names. It may be helpful to sort the folders by date modified.\nOnce you have found the desired world, you can verify its name by opening the \"levelname\" file contained inside. If you compress the contents of the folder (not the folder itself) and rename it to have a .mcworld extension rather than .zip, it should be easy to share and open in Minecraft.\nPlease note that you can also not compress the map and change the extension to .mcworld and just share the world as a folder. But to import the map as folder format you will have to drag the world folder manually to Minecraft/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/ folder.\nCompressing maps.\nLarge maps files can get very big, however there are ways to combat this by reducing the total file size. Keep in mind that every map will have a file size, larger maps much more so. It is impossible to get a map below 1kb, but some can be as little as 200kb. Note that this information is written for and may not be the same for .\nRemoving player data.\nA lot of maps don't require prior knowledge of the player playing it before it is loaded for the first time, and most of the time the final release has no reason to keep old player data generated by the developer(s). If your map doesn't require any playerdata, such as someone's advancements, position, inventory, or otherwise player-specific data, you can remove the \"advancements\", \"playerdata\", and \"stats\" folders found in the root of the map folder. If your map has custom advancements, do not delete those. Only delete the advancements folder inside the root of the map. (.minecraft/saves/Map_Name/advancements, not .minecraft/saves/Map_Name/datapacks/Maps_Datapack/data/namespace/advancements)\nRemoving automatically generated files.\nBoth session.lock and level.dat_old are files that are not needed to be packed along with the map file. You can safely delete both these files, since they will be regenerated once the map is loaded. You can also remove the \"poi\" folder, but this will incur a slightly longer loading time. The \"poi\" folder will be regenerated on map load.\nMinifying JSON files.\nJSON is meant to be read both with and without newlines. We can remove all newlines that are part of the JSON file (be sure not to remove any \"\\n\" inside strings!) to reduce its file size. You can also remove spaces between JSON values. Minifying JSON files doesn't save that much space since they are made of text. However, over a large number of files, the space saved could add up.\nFor example, the JSON:\n \"\",\n \"text\": \"To do list: \",\n \"color\": \"blue\",\n \"underlined\": true\n]\ncan be shorted to:\n[{\"text\":\"To do list:\",\"color\": \"blue\",\"underlined\":true}]\nHere, we remove the spaces and newlines between the \"text\", \"color\", and \"underlined\" values. Note that spaces \"inside\" the \"text\" string were not removed. The useless \"\", at the start was also removed as it serves no purpose. Some generators erroneously add that. The trailing space at the end was removed; however this might not always be wanted. Be careful when editing \"text\" strings. If your resource pack has a custom language file, you can compress that as well.\nCompressing resources.\nIf you are using a resource pack, the textures and sounds can add a hefty amount to the package size. Compressing them or making sure they do not have unnecessary high resolution can help lighten the load.\nA lot of textures can become very large without the benefit of improved quality. Some textures could be as large at 2048x2048 (almost 4K UHD) even if the player will never notice much difference. At most, textures should be 256x256 and they should not need to exceed this. Usually, textures can safely be in resolutions of 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64. Either way, try not to exceed 256x256, as this level of details is not easily be seen by the player. After finding an acceptable resolution, try using image compressors. These can sometimes reduce your file size by up to 90%, but may come at the cost of a loss of color depth (24-bit colors to 16-bit). This reduces the file size because there are not as many colors to store, but vibrant textures may become more \"grainy\", or \"static-ey\". If you still think there is data that can be shaved off, try removing all EXIF data from the image. Note that this will remove any copyright notes the image has (if any are present), and you may have to manually add credit (you should always give credit manually, but this is a legal matter).\nOgg Vorbis is meant to reduce filesize, but sometimes just the format isn't enough. You can also reduce the bitrate of the audio or reduce amplitude and manually increase it with /&lt;a href=\"Commands/playsound\"&gt;playsound&lt;/a&gt;. You can also try mixing the track down to mono, meaning the audio will have 1 track, instead of 2. This can result in quality reduction if not done carefully. It is recommended to mix small sounds down to mono, as players won't have enough time to distinguish the stereo version from its mono counterpart.\nRemoving region files.\nThis is not recommended for most users as it can delete parts of your map. Be sure to make a backup before attempting this; you never know if something might go wrong.\nBefore you start, it is recommended to read up on &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Region%20file%20format\"&gt;region files&lt;/a&gt;. As a summary, chunks are 16x16 regions of a world, and region files are a 32x32 chunks. There are 1024 chunks, or 262144 blocks, in a region file.\nUse &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dinnerbone.com/minecraft/tools/coordinates/\"&gt;Dinnerbone's Chunk Coordinate Finder&lt;/a&gt; and input coordinates of a block in every chunk in intervals of 16. For example, find the chunk file at chunk number 0, 0 and then at chunk number 0, 32. Make sure to find the blocks in positive \"and\" negative chunks, too. Once you have a full list of chunks that you want to keep, make a backup of your current world. Once you've made your backup, delete any chunk files that are not in your list. For example, if your list contains the regions:\nyou would not delete r.0.0.mca, r.0.1.mca, r.0.-1.mca, and r.3.4.mca. Delete all other files that do not match. This will remove any regions that are unused which can greatly reduce the map's total file size."}

{"id": "15363", "revid": "44196195", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15363", "title": "Tutorials/Custom texture packs", "text": "The purpose of this article is to teach you how to create a custom &lt;a href=\"texture%20pack\"&gt;texture pack&lt;/a&gt;. It focuses on the extraction of appropriate files from the game Java Archive codice_1, their editing, packing the newly created textures, and putting them back into the game.\nExtraction.\nThe original textures are located in the game Java Archive file codice_1. Any zip archiver should be able to extract files from it as the Java Archive format is just a subset of the common zip format. The exact procedure for locating the game archive and extracting the files from it varies by the operating system. Below is a list of files and subfolders of interest while creating a new texture pack:\nWindows.\nTo extract the editable files for a texture pack, first download a compression program, such as 7-Zip or WinRAR, and make a folder on your desktop for texture pack storage. For Windows Vista/7, go to the \"start\" menu on your desktop and search codice_3. On Windows XP, go to \"start\" menu, click \"run\", and type in codice_3. There may be a file called codice_5, if so open it, and one of the folders inside should be called codice_6, unless the codice_5 folder was not existent. Open this, and inside open the folder titled codice_8. (If you have a newer launcher there may not be a codice_8 file. If that is so just open the folder codice_10 and select the newest version's folder) Then go to the codice_1 file or a file with the current version with codice_12 at the end (for example, codice_13) and right-click on it. In the menu of options should be either \"7-Zip\" or \"WinRAR\". Follow the arrow from that option to the menu of actions, and choose \"Extract to 'Minecraft/'\". (It is best that your folder for texture packs have the word Minecraft in it. For example, mine is \"Minecraft-desktop\"). Find the extracted files. They should have been extracted to your desktop folder and be in a sub-folder titled \"Minecraft\". Open this file, and there will be 1,335 .class files. Delete every one of these. An easy way to select them all is to type .class in the search bar and press ctrl+A then delete (be sure not to delete the \"splash\" file, which will be selected because of the splash 'best in class). Now you are ready to edit. \nMacOS.\nThe Mac comes with a program called Archive Utility. First, open Finder and go to Finder&gt;Library&gt;Application Support&gt;minecraft&gt;bin. If the folder is not there, check Finder&gt;(User)&gt;Library&gt;Application Support&gt;minecraft&gt;bin Find codice_1 and right-click (or control+left click) and click \"Open With\" and \"Archive Utility\". Archive Utility will create a new folder called \"Minecraft\". Notice that this is a new folder, and that minecraft.jar is still intact. You can therefore modify and delete the new folder without altering your codice_1. Create a new folder on your desktop, and drag all the necessary files into it. Now you are ready to edit.\nIf using Archive Utility results in a file called Minecraft.jar.cpgz, try instead changing the file extension from .jar to .zip to achieve the desired effect.\nGNU/Linux.\nOn GNU/Linux-based systems, the game archive is usually located at codice_16 where \"~\" is the user's home folder, usually located in codice_17. Many desktop GNU/Linux distributions come with graphical archiver utilities that integrate with the desktop environment. If the codice_18 and codice_19 command-line programs are available, the files can be simply extracted to a folder on the desktop using the following command in the terminal:\ncodice_20\nEditing textures.\nThe textures are in the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format and can be edited with any image editing program that can handle the format including transparency. Many different programs support this, some free ones include Paint.net (Windows) (which even Notch uses), GIMP (Windows, Mac, Linux), Paintbrush (Mac), and many more. Edit each PNG file as desired and save them with 32-bit color depth to preserve transparency.\nAlthough Microsoft Paint does not handle transparency, it can still be used to make/edit textures. If you open a PNG image in Windows XP, a window should pop up showing transparency as a white and gray checkered pattern [does not work Win7 - no options of this type available]. There is a tool located on the toolbar that should have a screen tip with 'Change to transparent' or something similar. Go into Microsoft Paint and create/edit your texture(s). Find a color not used in the texture, and fill in the white space with it. Then, select the area desired to copy and paste it onto the PNG image. Paste it onto your PNG image and make sure to cover it completely. Simply change your unwanted color to transparent using the tool mentioned earlier, and every last pixel of that color on the current document will be changed to transparent. Beware, make sure that you do not click the wrong color, as this may mess up all textures in the document.\nPacking and installation.\nOnce you are done editing, create a zip file of the files modified (or, in Minecraft 1.3, you can use a folder with the files too), preserving all folder hierarchy. The root folder of the zip must have the files and folders listed below, or else they will not be changed. If you find that nothing changes when you select your texture pack, make sure that the files are in the root of the zip and not one folder in.\nWindows.\nSelect all the files (edited or not) Then choose the 7-Zip or WinRAR option after right-clicking and select \"Add to archive...\". The archive will open, and you can name the file. Then hit \"OK\", and the program will make all the files into a zip archive. To put it into Minecraft, simply start the launcher, log in, and at the title screen go to the button \"texture packs\". In the lower-left, click the Open Folder button and drag your ZIP into the folder. Select your texture pack, and view it on your computer.\nMac OS.\nHighlight all the files in your folder, right-click, and click \"compress (#) items\". A new file called \"Archive.zip\" should appear. Rename the file to your liking. Go to Finder&gt;Library&gt;Application Support&gt;minecraft&gt;Texture Packs, and drag your .zip in. Now you can use your texture pack by selecting the button \"mods and texture packs\" in the main menu of Minecraft, and clicking on your pack.\nUbuntu/GNOME.\nFolder Layout\n~/appdata/roaming/.minecraft/resourcepacks/MyPack/(assets etc.)\nIn Terminal, run this command...\n cd ~/.minecraft/resourcepacks/ &amp;&amp; zip -r MyPack.zip MyPack\n...then launch Minecraft and enable the resource pack."}

To create a more complete world, it is necessary to refer to how the world is generated in the vanilla version.\nThis tutorial roughly explains some of the vanilla world generation files in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.20.1\"&gt;1.20.1&lt;/a&gt;, making it easy for creators to read and understand the vanilla world generation.\nHow to obtain vanilla world generation files.\nAfter 22w42a, most of world generation files can be found in the directory in &lt;a href=\"client.jar\"&gt;client.jar&lt;/a&gt; or server.jar. However, &lt;a href=\"Custom%20dimension%23Multi-noise%20biome%20source%20parameter%20list\"&gt;multi-noise biome source parameter list files&lt;/a&gt; do not contain details of biome parameter list presets of the vanilla overworld and nether.\nThrough &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Running%20the%20data%20generator\"&gt;running the data generator&lt;/a&gt;, you can directly generate all vanilla data pack files, as well as biome source parameter list presets of the overworld and the nether.\nThe vanilla world generation files before 22w42a can be obtained on &lt;a href=\"Slicedlime\"&gt;Slicedlime&lt;/a&gt;'s github, located at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/slicedlime/examples\"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; repository. Missing versions in the repository commit history mean that the world generation files have not changed in these versions.\nFinal density function of the overworld.\nFinal density function of the overworld is the codice_1 field in &lt;samp&gt;worldgen/noise_settings/overworld.json&lt;/samp&gt;.\nIn which, the sloped_cheese used to determine the height and shape of the surface terrain is located in &lt;samp&gt;data/minecraft/worldgen/density_function/overworld/sloped_cheese.json&lt;/samp&gt;.\nUsing a spline function, obtains the distribution of mountain ranges based on continentalness, erosion, PV value, and weirdness value. It is 0 in most places, but positive in areas with high continentalness, low erosion, and high PV values, and larger in areas with negative weirdness\nIn which, the depth to determine the height of general surface terrain is located in &lt;samp&gt;data/minecraft/worldgen/density_function/overworld/depth.json&lt;/samp&gt;.\nSurface rules of the overworld.\nSurface rules of the overworld are the codice_3 field in &lt;samp&gt;worldgen/noise_settings/overworld.json&lt;/samp&gt;.\nNotes.\nBasin.\n&lt;a href=\"Terrain%20feature%23Erosion\"&gt;Basin&lt;/a&gt;s (aka. erosions) existed in all biomes before the surface rules were added. When the surface depth is less than or equal to 0, the topmost layer of the terrain is directly removed, leaving a bare stone basin. However, after the surface rules were added, they are somehow limited to only two biomes, &lt;a href=\"frozen%20ocean\"&gt;frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"deep%20frozen%20ocean\"&gt;deep frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a bug when judging the water surface. In previous basins, blocks above sea level (blocks with Y&gt;=63) were air, otherwise they were ice or water (Note that there were no aquifers or noise caves at that time). In the current vanilla surface rules, it is air when there is no water \"above\" it, which can lead to flowing water along the coast.\nCarver.\nDue to a mistake in the code about carver, the behavior of the condition during carver generation is inconsistent with that during terrain generation. When generating terrain, the offset value is relative to the air-liquid contact surface (i.e. the block position of the air block). While during carver generation, the offset value is relative to the block position of the top liquid block. And because during carver generation, surface rules are only applied to dirt below when carving grass blocks or mycelium. The game assumes that there is no water above grass blocks and mycelium. Then during carving, grass blocks and mycelium may be carved into water, so there is at most one block of water above the dirt being processed by surface rules. Therefore, the offset value during carver generation can also be said to be relative to the top surface of the processing dirt.\nTherefore, when generating terrain, offset values of 0 and -1 have the same effect: only succeed when there is no liquid above. But When carvers generates, if the offset value is -1, the condition is always successful, regardless of whether there is liquid above.\nWhen surface rules were first added into the game (21w41a), the developers were not aware of the mistake in carver code and set the offset value to -1 when checking whether there is water above. As a result, grass blocks can be generated underwater during carver generation. Afterwards (21w43a and 22w07a), in order to resolve this bug, additional redundant conditions with offset values of 0 was added to the blocks that should not be generated underwater. Therefore, the current overworld surface rules in the vanilla game are slightly chaotic, but they can basically work as expected.\nFor pack and mod creators, it is important to avoid setting offset value to -1 in to ensure that it behaves the same during carver generation and terrain generation.\nBiome source parameter list presets.\nThrough &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Running%20the%20data%20generator\"&gt;running the data generator&lt;/a&gt;, biome source parameter list presets of the overworld and the nether can be obtained. They are located in &lt;samp&gt;generated/reports/biome_parameters/&lt;/samp&gt;. The biome generation defined therein is explained in detail on the &lt;a href=\"Biome\"&gt;Biome&lt;/a&gt; page."}

{"id": "63573", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=63573", "title": "Tutorials/Daylight detector", "text": "As a night time detector.\nBy connecting the &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20Detector\"&gt;sensor&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit%23NOT%20gate\"&gt;NOT gate&lt;/a&gt; (inverter), it outputs a signal when the light level is \"less\" than 4, so players can, for example, make lights that turn on at night, or gates that automatically close.\nPlayers can also detect moonlight by blocking off the detector so it cannot see light, then pointing a comparator away from it.\nAnother way to detect nighttime is by right-clicking the daylight detector, which turns it into an inverted daylight sensor. Using the inverted daylight detector instead of a not gate to turn on lamps makes the lights turn on early evening to sunrise.\nAs a clock.\nBecause you can measure exactly what light level it is, you can make a clock. For example, for every light level it is, 1 light goes on a board. When it is night, the word \"Night\" is illuminated on the board displaying light level or time. This can be useful for servers, especially if you do not have the ability to create one using piston memory, or do not wish for one as it can be complicated or laggy.\nAs a time bomb.\nThe daylight sensor can be placed on top of TNT unlike most redstone devices. If planted at about midnight, this can make for an excellent timebomb, as the TNT ignites when the sun rises.\nSince the skylight is measured, which is shadowed out by blocks above, the sensor on TNT can be used in traps for players breaking the (e.g. ore or cake) blocks above the sensor. The Daylight sensor bomb can be rigged to go off at different times. If you want it to go off during the day, wire redstone to the TNT from the daylight sensor. While you can just place the sensor on top of the TNT, the TNT glitches to cause the TNT to appear above the daylight sensor. For a bomb to go off during the night, a &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit%23NOT%20Gate\"&gt;NOT Gate&lt;/a&gt; is needed. Other than that, it is the same. For a bomb to go off at noon, you need a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;. The daylight sensor goes through the TNT, but because the lever is always full power, and the daylight sensor gets best power at noon, the bomb explodes at noon.\nTimed jingle.\nUsing some note blocks and redstone circuitry, you could make a set jingle that plays at certain times of the day, such as a device that warns you that nighttime is over, or is beginning. This could be used as a sort of morning alarm if you do not use a bed.\nAs a signal.\nThe daylight sensor can easily be used to signal things at different times of day. With &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s in the game, it can do many more things, like broadcast messages or change everyone's gamemodes.\nBelow are different methods for it.\nMining signal.\nIf you are &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; and you want to come up at a time of day, you can connect the daylight sensor and make it either send a redstone pulse down your mine or broadcast a command block message.\nCommand block command for message:\ncodice_1\nNOTE: On servers this broadcasts a message to the entire &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can instead use this command to tell only yourself:\ncodice_2\nAs a server signal.\nMessage.\nYou can send out a message to the entire server at a certain point of day. The command block command for this is:\n&lt;br&gt;codice_1\nOR\ncodice_4\n&lt;br&gt;First broadcasts a message to the server, second one tells a message to a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a Weather Monitoring Station.\nUsing a redstone clock that is synchronized with the Minecraft day that is broken up into segments according to the daylight sensor power output schedule, it is possible to use many daylight sensors to build a rainstorm and thunderstorm detector. Use a comparator to reduce the redstone clock's signal strength to below that of the daylight sensor's clear day output. Wire this into the side of another comparator that has a daylight detector wired to the back. The wire coming out of the end of the comparator deactivates whenever there is a storm. Using this you can detect both rain and thunderstorms using two lines with adequate comparator sensitivity. Using this you can signal an alarm whenever there is a storm, count the number of storms, count the duration of the storms using another clock and some type of memory, and even all three. Note, however, that if the chunk is unloaded for any length of time, the redstone clock falls out of sync with the daylight sensors."}

Nether fortresses are the only place where &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s spawn, the latter of which's &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s being required to craft and fuel &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;s and craft &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt; to access &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. It also features &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; as loot, which is a key ingredient in &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful, however, because these structures are huge and you can easily get lost or killed by powerful &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBenefits of defeating a nether fortress.\nThere are several benefits of defeating a nether fortress:\nPreparation Checklist.\nPreparing before you even enter a nether fortress is essential. As always, the items you should bring depend heavily on your skill level, but some recommended items to bring:\nPreparation Equipment.\nSword.\nYour sword (preferably iron, diamond or netherite) is useful for taking out mobs within melee reach, oftentimes &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s that haven't flown up. If you have access to enchantments, the most important enchantments will be either &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;. Sharpness adds a slight but noticeable damage increase against all mobs. A case can be made for Smite as well, since it deals far more damage although it can only be used against &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs. Most of the mobs you will be fighting in melee anyway are wither skeletons, an undead mob. &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; are optional but recommended.\nBow.\nYour bow is invaluable in the Nether in general, doubly so in a nether fortress. This will be used for taking out high-flying blazes (a common threat) along with &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s as you roam on bridges.\nFor enchantments, &lt;a href=\"Power\"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; is always useful, along with &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; is good although not required, &lt;a href=\"Punch\"&gt;Punch&lt;/a&gt; will have little effect since most mobs you shoot at will be far enough away for a slight amount of knockback to have no effect, and &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; has little to no effect except against a few mobs like &lt;a href=\"piglins\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hoglins\"&gt;hoglins&lt;/a&gt; and normal &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s.\nArrows.\nYour bow is useless without &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven't picked up some &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; yet or find some within easy reach, go ahead and mine it because it will be useful for brewing, powerful lighting, and to make &lt;a href=\"spectral%20arrows\"&gt;spectral arrows&lt;/a&gt;. Four &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt; and an arrow makes two &lt;a href=\"spectral%20arrows\"&gt;spectral arrows&lt;/a&gt;. A spectral arrow, when it hits an entity, makes it &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;glow&lt;/a&gt; for a brief time which can help with visibility. If you are low on arrows, using spectral arrows can double your arrow count.\nArmor.\nYou will not survive long in a fortress without &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; (what are you doing in the Nether with no armor anyways). Powerful armor is always essential, so &lt;a href=\"Netherite\"&gt;Netherite&lt;/a&gt; is preferred. If you cannot afford them, &lt;a href=\"diamonds\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; will suffice (most of the time). Also, you will want to have at least one piece of &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; armor on (preferably &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmets&lt;/a&gt; as you probably won't need the exclusive enchantments) to ward off &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt; attacks. While they don't directly spawn in Fortresses, if the Fortress is near a &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;Nether Wastes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt; biome, a pack can come to attack you without provocation while you traverse the exposed bridges. Even if they can't get near you, some are armed with &lt;a href=\"Crossbow\"&gt;Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s and will try to shoot at you.\nFor enchantments, stock up on &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; (especially on gold armor) and &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; are useful to prevent unforeseen knock-offs, inflict recoil damage and prevent armor breaking mid-combat, leaving you vulnerable.\nPickaxes.\nYou should bring at least a stone pickaxe, or an/a iron/ diamond pickaxe if you can afford it. Diamond/Iron pickaxes can tear through &lt;a href=\"Netherrack\"&gt;Netherrack&lt;/a&gt; fast enough to possibly not give you time to react if you hit a hidden lava stream, but a stone pickaxe can be used to break them slower instead. The Diamond/Iron pickaxe is better for breaking down the Fortress, made up of much sturdier &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;Nether Bricks&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor enchantments, pickaxes don't actually need many enchantments in the Nether. It's not recommended to enchant the stone one because if it breaks, you can just make a new one with your cobblestone/logs. But for the iron/diamond pickaxe, &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; is useful, along with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; for quickly mining through the nether fortress if you have to make a quick escape.\nGolden Apples.\nIf you have one or more &lt;a href=\"golden%20apples\"&gt;golden apples&lt;/a&gt;, it is recommended to bring at least one of them. These can be lifesavers in a difficult combat. If you have an &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt;, stash that back home and go back for it later. It will be useful in closing a blaze spawner, as seen below.\nFood.\nYour main healing item. Highly nutritious food is necessary, such as &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Carrot\"&gt;Golden Carrots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cooked%20porkchop\"&gt;Cooked Porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Steak\"&gt;Steak&lt;/a&gt;. Bringing at least half a stack of them ensures you don't run out at a critical moment.\nCobblestone.\n&lt;a href=\"Cobblestone\"&gt;Cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; is useful for many purposes, like making stone tools, staircases, blocking passages off, etc. Bring at least two stacks of it, but a third stack is good to have.\nTorches.\n&lt;a href=\"Torches\"&gt;Torches&lt;/a&gt; are good for navigation, marking explored areas, and extensively cutting down on mob spawns in areas you've already gone through. Try to bring three or more stacks, at least two, or bring a lot of &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; so you can craft more torches as you need them.\n&lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Table\"&gt;Crafting Table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;Chest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Furnace\"&gt;Furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point in the fortress you will want to set up a small base containing several important items and the ability to make more. When you set up a camp with these items, try to use a bit of spare logs and cobble to create another set so this place is a safe space.\n&lt;a href=\"Log\"&gt;Logs&lt;/a&gt;.\nWood is eternally useful, not just in a nether fortress but indeed throughout your Minecraft career. Bring at least 16 (32 is a good number) logs for crafting more tools and minibases and such. As of the 1.16 update you can also find wood inside the Nether. Nether wood, unlike normal wood, is fireproof, making it a good wood choice if building. Keep in mind that you can't use nether wood as fuel though, and they can't be made into &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire resistance makes the player immune to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and as such makes the player immune to blaze's ranged attacks, (but not their melee attacks.) The only source of fire resistance potions before entering the nether is &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt;: if they are set on fire they will begin drinking a fire resistance potion, and if they are killed before they finish there is a small chance they will drop it, making them farmable. A bow with the Flame enchantment and Power IV is a likely candidate for this. Once you enter the nether, a second source is &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt; which requires large amounts of gold. Finally, you can of course &lt;a href=\"Brewing\"&gt;brew&lt;/a&gt; potions, but brewing requires at least 2 blaze rods- you will have to attack a previous nether fortress before having access to this. \n&lt;a href=\"Totems%20of%20undying\"&gt;Totems of undying&lt;/a&gt; can give you fire resistance. However, totems of undying are rare and can only be found by killing an &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;, a rare and powerful mob. You will also have to die for the totem to activate and give you fire resistance. You will likely not have fire resistance on your first time through, but once you get two blaze rods (see 'Brewing' below)(coming up) make fire resistance potions as quickly as possible.\nShield.\nA &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, when used, can help with deflecting a few of the threats of nether fortress, such as mob melee attacks, blaze fireballs, and the explosions caused by ghast fireballs. Successfully blocking a blaze fireball also prevents it from setting the player on fire (but it will not protect the player should the fireball set the ground on fire).\nBuckets.\n&lt;a href=\"Buckets\"&gt;Buckets&lt;/a&gt; (at least two are recommended) are good for clearing up easily accessible lava. Also, if you bring a few &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;s combined with a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; (see below, ), or a &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow%20bucket\"&gt;powder snow bucket&lt;/a&gt;, as they are ways of extinguishing yourself in the Nether.\nCauldron.\nA &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; allows you (in conjunction with water buckets) to extinguish yourself in the Nether by placing the cauldron and filling it with your water buckets, and then hopping in. When used, you can insert the cauldron in the ground for easier access. \nPortal-making supplies.\nEspecially if your nether fortress is far from your base, it is nice to have a backup way to get to the Overworld. Bring at least 10 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;. The flint and steel is not necessarily required, since they can be found in chests or a passing blaze or ghast might help you out, but it is good to have a guaranteed portal lighting device. Also remember to have a flint and steel somewhere in the Nether in case your original portal gets blown out.\nIf you don't have enough obsidian to build a portal, you can obtain some through &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt;.\nRespawn Anchor.\nIf you tend to die a bunch in the Nether, bring a &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;. It will enable you to set a spawn point anywhere in the Nether. Bring &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; blocks to charge it up. Make a safe room with a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; to hold glowstone. You will know when it is ready because the top will have the nether portal texture, the circle will be full and the area will be lit up. Right click once more to set respawn. Be careful though it has only four charges. When you die, you will respawn there and it will use a charge. You can charge it up if you have more glowstone.\nFinding a Nether Fortress.\nNether fortresses generate in all Nether biomes. To do so, the game splits the Nether into regions in which one of either a fortress or a &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt; can generate. The regions are 432\u00d7432 blocks and 480\u00d7480 blocks . \nEach region has a four chunk separation located on the south and east borders of the region in which neither a fortress nor a bastion can generate. \nThis leaves only a 368\u00d7368 block section or 416\u00d7416 block section where a structure can generate. \nTwo structures never generate in the same region, although they might overlap if they generate close to the separation border. , the chance of a fortress generating instead of a bastion is (40%), while the chance of a fortress generating instead of a bastion is (33.3%).\nNether fortresses can generate buried in &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. In such a case, the interior is not filled with netherrack; all hallways and passages are clear except for open walkways and bridges. It is possible but rare for &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; or crimson and warped &lt;a href=\"huge%20fungi\"&gt;huge fungi&lt;/a&gt; to generate inside the fortress pathways.\nIf you are playing in 1.16 or after, the apparent distance between nether fortresses was dramatically increased in the 1.16 &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Update\"&gt;Nether Update&lt;/a&gt;. Be prepared to venture several hundred blocks, possibly even thousands, in multiple directions to find the fortress. But once you have found the fortress itself, its fruit is sweet.\nAdvanced Tips.\nWhen you create your nether portal near your spawn point in the Overworld, your original nether portal will be close to the world center in the Nether. This might be hard to understand, but the Nether is divided into several hundred block wide regions, each containing either a nether fortress or a bastion remnant. Four of the closest of these regions surround the center of the Nether, on the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast directions. You preferably want to find a close nether fortress, so you can revisit it whenever you need more blaze rods and wither skulls. So you want to check out each of these four regions to know if a fortress is in there or not. If you see a bastion remnant, you can guarantee that there will not be a fortress in the same region. At this point, turn around and search another region, until you find a nether fortress.\nThere is a chance that your world will not have a fortress within the four closest regions. Since the chance for a fortress to generate in a region is (40%) and (33.3%) , there is only a 13.0% chance and a 19.8% chance that this is the case. So be prepared if there are no close-by fortresses in your world, but also keep in mind that there's more likely to be a nearby fortress than if there isn't.\nGeneral structure.\nThe nether fortress is made of nether brick, which is fire resistant. The structure contains corridors with chests in them and contain &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ingot\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horse%20Armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt; and even armor. There are stairwells that will lead you to different parts of the fortress. The structure also spans over lava lakes and may be broken in places.\nSpecific Structure Features.\nA nether fortress has two types of easily distinguishable walkways: corridors and bridges.\nCorridors.\nCorridors are the \"indoors\" part of a fortress. They are easily distinguishable by their 3x3 walkway encased in nether brick with 2x1 nether brick fences for 'windows'. Under the corridors solid nether brick generates to the surface. This is what makes the main 'fort' buildings of the fortresses: a set of nether brick corridors positioned above or around the surrounding bridges, with the solid nether brick to the surface giving it a fort-like look. Chests generate in the turns of these corridors and they can generate the all-important nether wart farm and blaze spawners. They are in most ways the safer parts of a nether fortress, because unless you've mined through the walls or ceiling you cannot fall off or be attacked from afar.\nBridges.\nThe bridges look just like that: large bridges. They have a 5 block wide pathway with a one-block-high wall on both sides, all composed of nether bricks. Instead of the solid nether bricks that corridors have beneath , they have large solid arches. Note that the one-block-high 'railing' does not prevent you from falling off! The bridges often end broken-looking or abruptly end. The tunnels, when they generate, cut through netherrack which means if the fortress generates partly encased in netherrack, the bridges will generate as tunnels with a nether brick floor and netherrack walls and ceiling. Be careful when wandering around here, because if you're not careful you could be thrown off the bridge by an explosion, knocked back by an attack, or attacked from the other side of the fortress by the marauding blazes and ghasts.\nHow They Generate Together.\nThe bridges part generates first, and a lava well room acts as a transition between the bridges and the corridor. The corridors contain all the loot chests and nether wart farms, and the bridges contain both blaze spawners.\nDefeating the fortress.\nThe fortress can be hard to see, as it looks like the Nether terrain, especially in nether wastes or crimson forest. When you find blocky structures made of nether brick, you have found it. Mark your \"entrance\" in some way. Use the right hand torch rule for navigating the fortress.\nDon't stand around or waste time. Eating, checking your inventory, and not paying attention can risk you getting killed by a monster. Every few blocks, make a 2 block tall arch so you can escape wither skeletons.\nYour key prizes are a nether wart plantation and a blaze spawner. There are two levels in a fortress, the corridors and the bridges (described above). The nether wart plantations are by the large staircases up to the bridges. The plantations are usually in an intersection, so be sure to block off the tunnels with a non-flammable block before harvesting the warts. Also take the soul sand, as relying on finding some is not smart. The blaze spawners are on top of the bridges, partially enclosed by fences.\nTry to find as many chests as you can, and take the loot. If you find a plantation, dig up all the nether warts and soul sand. Don't forget to fill in the hole to avoid falling in.\nIf you are on a multiplayer server, it is good practice to replant the nether wart below the staircase, as that allows players that arrive later to obtain their first nether wart.\nBlaze Spawner.\nWhen you run into a blaze spawner, you have to light it up. You need to place glowstone, shroomlight, jack-o-lantern, or anything light level 15 surrounding the spawner on all sides. Be ready to fight a lot of blazes. It is recommended to defeat the spawner with fire resistance. To get fire resistance, you can get a potion from bartering with a piglin, or use a totem of undying. if you're feeling sneaky, you can switch to peaceful, build the farm around the spawner, then switch back, and you can completely avoid being killed.\nMonsters.\nWither Skeletons.\nSprint attack them, like creepers, or shoot it with arrows. You don't want to get the Wither status effect. Also, take advantage that wither skeletons are 2.5 blocks tall by putting a slab above their head so you can run freely but they can't, creating pockets of wither skeletons you can easily pick off one by one.\nSkeletons.\nDon't sprint hit. Strafe with A and D keys, or block with your shield and hit the skeletons. Also, you can shoot them.\nPiglins.\nAlthough piglins don't spawn in a nether fortress, you can run into them if the fortress is in a crimson forest or nether wastes. It is advised to wear atleast 1 piece of Golden Armor around them. If you really want to, kill them like normal (JUST WHY).\nZombified Piglins.\nDon't provoke them, just ignore them so that they leave you alone. They can kill you quickly, or knock you off the fortress bridges. Even better, you could trick a mob with a ranged attack (Blazes, Skeletons) into shooting a zombified piglin, causing them to retaliate against that mob, and causing a helpful distraction (be careful not to perform a sweep attack on them).\nBlazes.\nThey spawn from spawners. Kill them with fire resistance if you can get the potion/totem of undying. Their ranged attacks will have no effect if you have fire resistance. It is possible to kill a blaze without fire resistance. Shoot it with a bow, or knock it back with a sword. Blazes don't take fall damage, but snow and water can damage them.\nPotions.\nThe base components required for all &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; (except for weakness potions) can be found in a nether fortress. &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20Rod\"&gt;Blaze rods&lt;/a&gt; are required to craft and fuel a &lt;a href=\"Brewing%20Stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; is required to make Awkward Potions, the intermediate step to all potions except for &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; potions. Raid your nether fortress until you find some nether wart, and then mine it and the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; under and take it all home. On your way out, kill some &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;blazes&lt;/a&gt; if you haven't already to get two blaze rods. Now head back to base, and you can start brewing!\nUse one blaze rod to craft a brewing stand, and then craft the other into &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20Powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look into the brewing stand GUI if you haven't already. There are three slots for &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Bottle\"&gt;bottles&lt;/a&gt;, an unmarked slot for ingredients, a blaze powder shaped slot, an indicator for fuel, and an indicator for progress on your currently brewing potions. Drop a blaze powder in the blaze powder slot, it should disappear and the fuel indicator will go solid orange. This fuel gets depleted once for every 20-sec operation you do, and a blaze powder has 20 'charges'. Be sure to kill some more blazes later on for more powder to fuel your brewing stand.\nBefore going further, you'll want to replant your nether wart back at base so you don't run out. &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart\"&gt;Nether Wart&lt;/a&gt; acts like &lt;a href=\"Carrot\"&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potato\"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt; except it only grown on soul sand. If you want to expand your plot you can retrieve more soul sand from the nether. Anyway once you've done that, acquire some &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; (smelt &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;) and craft three &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Bottle\"&gt;glass bottles&lt;/a&gt;. Fill them with water at a nearby water source. Put all three water bottles into the bottom 3 bottle slots in the brewing stand. Put a piece of nether wart into the top unmarked slot. The bubbles indicator will start filling up and resetting and the arrow will slowly fill. Wait 20 seconds while you figure out what potion to brew first. A more comprehensive list can be found at &lt;a href=\"Brewing\"&gt;Brewing&lt;/a&gt;, but below are some simple potions you should brew (this section will be added shortly). It is highly recommended to get some spare &lt;a href=\"Glowstone%20Dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt; from the Nether, and you should have lots of spare &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; by now. The materials are hard to find sometimes, but making &lt;a href=\"Fermented%20Spider%20Eye\"&gt;fermented spider eyes&lt;/a&gt; will be worth it. Any spare &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; can be useful as well.\nFirst and foremost, if you plan to thoroughly loot the nether fortress, close/farm a blaze spawner, or even just be in the Nether, you'll want Potions of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. These wonders will make you immune to fire and lava damage, which includes blaze ranged attacks and &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Cube\"&gt;magma cubes&lt;/a&gt; melee attacks. The potion, sadly, does not defend from a blaze's melee attack. To make these potions, you need &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;, which is accessible through a number of ways:\nIf the components are quickly accessible, Fire Resistance potions should be the first you brew. Lengthen then by brewing &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; into the Fire Resistance potions. To keep brewing potions past awkward, you'll want to put all three potions back in their slots if you took them out, and then put the magma cream in and then the redstone after that finished. Voila, you have 24 minutes of Fire Resistance.\nOther useful potions can be found in the list below.\nClosing a Blaze Spawner.\n&lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt; spawners, especially if attached to an often-traversed bridge or corridor, can be a major hazard. You risk being fired at by tons of blazes when passing. Blazes can spawn within 4 blocks of the spawner at light levels 11 or lower, so you can either layer the area with &lt;a href=\"torches\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, or use more sparsely placed &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shroomlight\"&gt;shroomlight&lt;/a&gt;. The following pattern should work to remove blaze spawns (reused from the amazing &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20survival\"&gt;Tutorials/Nether Survival&lt;/a&gt; guide):\nThe jack o' lanterns can also be replaced with glowstone, shroomlight or other light level 15 block. Notice from the 3D image that an additional light block is needed above the spawner. If the area around the spawner is to be cleared, an additional light block is needed below the spawner as well.\nActually getting to the blaze spawner is a different issue. While getting there and placing light emitting blocks, you will probably spawn 2-3 blaze spawns with up to 4 blazes each. Drink &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration,&lt;/a&gt; pack your best sword, bow, and armor, and fight off the blazes to the best of your ability.\nBlaze farms are effective as XP farms, as blazes drop twice as much XP as other normal mobs. These farms can be found at &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Blaze%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Blaze Farming&lt;/a&gt;\nAftermath.\nYou've raided the fortress to it's fullest extent. You've looted all the chests, found all the nether wart, and killed plenty of wither skeletons/blazes while you were at it. What to do with the nether fortress now?"}
{"id": "135668", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=135668", "title": "Tutorials/Defeating a bastion remnant", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Bastion%20remnants\"&gt;Bastion remnants&lt;/a&gt; are large, castle-like &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; in all of the biomes except &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;. They generate in four distinct variants, each with a unique structure and set of loot. &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in these structures on generation, and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s may also spawn on generation in the bridge and hoglin stables variants. Bastion remnants are the only place to find &lt;a href=\"gilded%20blackstone\"&gt;gilded blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, the Pigstep &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;, the snout &lt;a href=\"banner%20pattern\"&gt;banner pattern&lt;/a&gt; and armor trim, the &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;, and the netherite upgrade &lt;a href=\"smithing%20template\"&gt;smithing template&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating a bastion remnant allows the player to obtain lots of loot, including valuable &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; items, the Pigstep music disc, and the Snout &lt;a href=\"banner%20pattern\"&gt;banner pattern&lt;/a&gt; and armor trim. Exploring them is also required to unlock the &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; tier, as they are the only place where netherite upgrade &lt;a href=\"smithing%20template\"&gt;smithing template&lt;/a&gt;s can be found. Due to having &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Remnant%23Treasure%20room\"&gt;treasure room&lt;/a&gt; bastion variant only), bastion remnants also provide a good source of &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;. Bastion remnants are one of the toughest and most dangerous structures to beat, so extra care has to be taken to survive. You will see &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s in the bastion, so be careful.\nFinding bastion remnant.\nBastion remnants generate in all Nether biomes except &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;, although a bastion may extend into one. If a bastion tries to generate in a basalt delta, the bastion does not generate, leaving the region empty. To generate the structure, the game splits the Nether into regions, in which either a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; or a bastion remnant can generate. The regions are 432\u00d7432 blocks and 480\u00d7480 blocks . Each region has a 4-chunk separation located on the south and east borders of the region in which neither a fortress nor a bastion can generate. This leaves only a 368\u00d7368 block section or 416\u00d7416 block section where a structure can generate. Two structures never generate in the same region, although they might overlap if they generate close to the separation border. , the chance of a bastion generating instead of a fortress is (60%), while the chance of a bastion generating instead of a fortress is (66.6%).\nPiglins, piglin brutes, and hoglins that spawn upon generation in bastion remnants neither despawn naturally nor do they hunt each other. Piglin brutes also spawn exclusively here upon structure generation, and do not despawn unless killed, or if &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is set to Peaceful (they remain but become passive in Peaceful difficulty). Like &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, once these mobs are killed, they do not respawn, though the bastion continues to spawn normal mobs depending on the biome it is located in.\nWalk in the nether until see a bastion remnant. Be careful not to fall into lava.\nStructure.\nBefore exploring a Bastion remnant, knowing its structures is quite important.\nBastion remnants generate as 4 types of structures: bridges, hoglin stables, housing units, and treasure rooms. Each type has its own set of structures that compose it. These structures may be supported by ramparts that contain cave-like paths. &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s spawn frequently throughout. Unlike &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es, when over the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20features%23Lava%20sea\"&gt;lava ocean&lt;/a&gt;, they do not generate pillars of solid blocks down to the solid terrain beneath, but float above, entirely even.\nAll bastion remnant structures found below are located in the folder &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"client.jar\"&gt;client.jar&lt;/a&gt;/data/minecraft/structures/bastion&lt;/samp&gt;.\nBridge.\nThe bridge consists of a large ruined rampart structure with a piglin face carved into it. The inside of the \"mouth\" consists of multiple levels of walkways surrounded by lava. A damaged bridge goes out from the mouth, with a support pillar on the far side. \nHoglin stables.\nThe hoglin stables consist of a three-part rampart with damaged hoglin stables on either side. Hoglin stables' pieces are contained in the subfolder &lt;samp&gt;hoglin_stable&lt;/samp&gt;. They contain the hoglin stable chests.\nHousing units.\nThe housing unit consists of multiple ruined two-part ramparts arranged around a central courtyard with &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; growing in the middle. Housing unit pieces are contained in the subfolder &lt;samp&gt;units&lt;/samp&gt;.\nTreasure room.\nThe treasure room structure consists of a large rampart supported by buttresses, with a bridge going between it and the treasure room itself. The rampart contains several treasure chests and a handful of &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20gold\"&gt;blocks of gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe treasure room consists of many bridges suspended above a lava floor. At the bottom of a treasure room, there is a &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt; monster spawner, and a center loot area consisting of &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20gold\"&gt;blocks of gold&lt;/a&gt;, as well as 1 or 2 treasure chests. Additional chests generate in the bastion, but they use the \"generic\" loot table instead of the \"treasure\" loot table. Treasure room pieces are contained in the subfolder &lt;samp&gt;treasure&lt;/samp&gt;.\nMobs.\nGeneral.\nUnlike most &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, piglins, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s are \"not\" immune to fire damage. This makes bastion remnants one of the few places in the nether where the &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; enchantments can prove beneficial.\nPiglin brutes.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin%20brute\"&gt;Piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s are variants of piglins that are unique to bastion remnants and are capable of dealing massive amounts of damage in a single hit thanks to their &lt;a href=\"golden%20axe\"&gt;golden axe&lt;/a&gt;. The higher the difficulty, the more damage they deal, up to 19 attack damage in hard difficulty. Their heavy hits also mean that &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; offers much less protection: A full set of unenchanted iron armor only reduces the attack damage by 22%. To make matters worse, due to the fact that piglin brutes use axes instead of swords, they have the ability to disable shields.\nFortunately, unlike regular piglins, piglin brutes do not respawn when killed, meaning you won't have to worry about them reappearing once you clear all of them out of the bastion.\nHere are some tips and tricks on how to defeat piglin brutes:\nRanged weapons\nWhen forced to draw some sort of weapon against a piglin brute, the use of ranged weapons is your best bet. Try to shoot them off ledges and preferably into lava. The &lt;a href=\"Punch\"&gt;Punch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; can assist. If they land in lava, there is nothing they can do and they burn to death. Only XPs and possibly a golden axe will be at-risk of disappearing into lava. This will have to be done from a long range, so that a horde of angry piglins don't rush up at you while you are charging your ranged weapon. Engaging in head-to-head melee combat with the piglin brute is to always be avoided (especially if playing on \"Java Edition\") unless you know what you are doing.\nIf you're good at sniping, you may also be able to avoid aggravating nearby piglins as piglins can only alert nearby allies that are within 16 block away from the area \"where the piglin took damage\", not the player's location.\n2-or-3-block tall pillar.\nWhen piglin brutes are rushing towards you, and there is no low ceiling, you may want to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar up&lt;/a&gt; 2 blocks. Standing on a 2 block tall column will prevent piglins from being able to reach you. However, a third block is required if you wish to attack the piglin brutes. Otherwise, the vertical knockback from your attacks might provide enough height for them to knock you off your platform. Alternatively, if you are in a situation where you can't place the third block, piglins cannot swim in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, meaning lava can be used to safely take out brutes without fear of them swimming upward.\nWhen building your safety pillar, make sure there are no piglins nearby that can use a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; to shoot you off your pillar. Additionally, be mindful of what's above you when you pillar up, or else you may get ambushed from above.\nDiamond and netherite &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs mentioned above, the high amount of damage that piglin brutes deal in a single hit will cause your armor to suffer a massive penalty. To mitigate this, bring either diamond or netherite armor, as in addition to the extra \"Armor\" points the sets give, both give an extra stat called \"Armor Toughness\", which reduces the severity of any armor reduction caused by an attack. Using a full set of diamond armor \"halves\" the armor reduction that you receive - while a full set of unenchanted iron armor would only reduce damage by 22% in Hard mode [(armor points x 4%) - (damage \u00d7 2%)] = 60% - 38% = 22%, a full set of unenchanted diamond armor would reduce damage by 61% [(armor points \u00d7 4%) - (damage x 1%)] = 80% - 19% = 61%.\n&lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen piglin brutes are rushing towards you, you can simply place boats in front of their pathfinding. If you do this correctly, the piglin brutes will enter the boats while running towards you. Once they are in the boats, they are stuck; they are unable to exit or break the boats. You still do not want to go too close to the boats or hop in the boat, as the piglin brutes can still attack players within their reach. Using a ranged weapon will be the safest option to kill them, however a sword or axe will do the job if far away enough.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava%20bucket\"&gt;Lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nArguably one of the strongest items you can bring to a bastion due to the fact that unlike most &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, all piglins, brutes included, are not immune to fire damage, which makes lava buckets a very efficient way to kill them. Simply use the lava bucket on the block underneath the piglin brute to deal high amounts of damage. Additionally, Minecraft does not keep track of who places lava, meaning lava buckets can be used to deal damage without alerting other nearby piglins. However, remember that lava flows 3 times as fast and twice as far in the Nether, so a single lava source could potentially kill lots of piglins or make exploring the bastion harder. This is why you might want to quickly refill your bucket and place the lava again over and over until the brute dies.\nUsing a lava bucket prevents the piglin brute from dropping any &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;s upon death. However, the ability to damage piglin brutes without aggravating other piglins usually makes this option worth it, especially when there're a lot of other ways to get XP.\nSummoning iron golems.\nIf you have enough inventory space to hold iron blocks and carved pumpkins, then consider how powerful &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s are. Iron golems automatically attack piglin brutes, and can kill them in 3 to 8 hits, with an average of a 4-hit kill (observing that on average, the iron golem will do damage). Also, because iron golems have so much health, they can take 6-20 hits (depending on two factors, difficulty and edition. The easier the difficulty, the smaller the damage piglin brutes do, and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; piglin brutes do less damage). Healing the iron golems with &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s will make the golem last longer. Additionally, due to the fact that the golems were created by you, they will not attack you should you accidentally hit one. However, they will attack your friends when aggravated, so care should still be taken if you are tackling the bastion remnant on multiplayer.\nBlocking yourself off.\nIf a piglin brute is closely chasing you in a corridor with a ceiling too low to build a pillar, your best bet is to rapidly place any solid block to block yourself off. Once the piglin brute is blocked off, you can then mine one of the blocks away, making sure the piglin brute doesn't have a gap to get through and reach you. Once you can see the piglin brute through the gap in the wall you built, shoot the piglin brute until it dies, or riskier, kill it with a melee weapon. The latter is incredibly risky as there is a chance they will still be able to hit you and deal massive damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf you have already gathered &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;s from a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, splash potions can prove effective against piglin brutes, especially if you encounter a group of them. Slowness can slow down their fast movement speed, poison can allow you to gradually drain their health while staying at a safe distance (it also damages them without angering other piglins), and weakness can help reduce their massive attack damage, which also reduces the penalty to armor that their heavy hits cause. If you're in a pinch and need to make a quick escape, a Turtle Master potion augmented with &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, while making piglin brutes incredibly resistant to damage, will slow down their movement speed to 10% of normal speed - even stronger than an augmented slowness potion.\nYou can also use a potion of Harming to instantly deal a large amount of damage. However, unlike Poison, Harming potions \"will\" anger nearby piglins.\nBringing a drinkable Fire Resistance potion is also a good idea for any nether trip in general should you lose your footing and fall in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nPiglins.\nThere are many ways to overcome &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. Here is a list:\nHoglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Hoglin\"&gt;Hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s don't appear in bastion remnants too often, but they do sometimes. Keep these in mind when fighting them:\nMagma cubes.\n&lt;a href=\"Magma%20cube\"&gt;Magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s can come from monster spawners hanging from chains over lava. They are very hard to reach and the cubes can knock you into lava. Although breaking these monster spawners works and protects you, the problem is that you can no longer use them for magma cream farms. Here is a list of some strategies:\nMagma cube monster spawner disabling.\nThere is always 2 magma cube &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s in each bastion remnant of the treasure room type. It is located close to the bottom of the large room, above a lava pool, guarding the ultimate treasure: a pile of gold blocks, and a chest. Most players would just easily disable the spawner by breaking it, as magma cubes spawn at any light level, torches won't do anything, and it takes a lot of time and blocks to fill up the entire 9\u00d73\u00d79 spawning area, enough time for the local piglins, piglin brutes and magma cubes to tear you into pieces. However, there exist a simple way to disable a magma cube spawner entirely and reliably, using as little as 9 blocks.\nThis disabling grid makes use of the mechanic that a magma cube, no matter large, medium or small, checks for the space requirements of a large magma cube before it spawns. Since a large magma cube is slightly wider than 2 blocks, there is no horizontal space within the 9\u00d73\u00d79 area for it to fit in. Also, a monster spawner can only spawn a mob's \"feet\" at 3 heights: one block below the spawner, same height as the monster spawner, or one block above the monster spawner. No matter which layer it chooses, even the lowest layer, since a large magma cube is slightly taller than 2 blocks, its \"head\" will slightly intersect with at least one of the solid blocks, cancelling the spawn attempt.\nDefeating the bastion.\nGeneral\nRegardless of what part of the bastion you're trying to explore, it's a good idea to start exploring from the top and work your way down. Piglins won't hesitate to take fall damage to get to you, which can easily result in you getting ambushed if you start exploring from the bottom. A Piglin Brute landing on top of you is especially deadly, as they can disable your shield, leaving you completely vulnerable to their high damage attacks. Because of this, it is highly recommended to bring at least one &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; to a bastion remnant.\nGetting to the top can be treacherous though; building to the top carries the risk of being shot off by crossbow-wielding piglins (if you've angered them or aren't wearing gold armor), &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, or even &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s if you're near a nether fortress, which can cause you to fall to your death or into lava. Digging through nearby netherrack to the top avoids these threats, but can result in you digging into a lava pocket and getting yourself melted. A &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Slow%20Falling\"&gt;potion of Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; can help protect you from the dangers of building up to the top and a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;potion of Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; will keep you safe from any lava pockets you dig/fall into.\nOnce you have reached the top of the bastion, it is highly recommended to secure a respawn area, set a &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt; and lay a nearby chest or hopper with a supply of glowstone, should you need multiple respawn attempts. If you die in the bastion, getting your items back will be extremely difficult since Piglins can be very tough without armor, and will steal your armor leaving you unable to get it back. Because of this, it is also worth having a chest with back-up armor so you can safely retrieve your stuff without being instantly killed again by piglins and piglin brutes.\nBecause the bastion remnant is almost completely made of &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, navigation can become difficult as the monochrome makes it hard to spot un-explored stairs or corridors. Marking your path (especially where you entered the bastion) with torches or brighter blocks like cobblestone can help you can see where you've already been. The ruined pathing of the bastion also means you should have a good supply of blocks to fill in the holes in the paths so you don't fall through them.\nRemember that all nearby Piglins will become hostile if you attack a Piglin Brute, even if you're wearing gold armor. Most of the time, this makes it a better idea to avoid or trap brutes instead of fight them. You can also pour lava on the brutes to kill them, since this does not count as player damage, other piglins will not become hostile. If they're guarding a chest or there's no practical way to avoid fighting them, it can be a good idea to take out the surrounding Piglins first, especially the ones with crossbows, so that you can have an escape route ready if things don't go as planned. This also holds true for when you want to loot a chest or gold blocks, although you may not have to do this if there aren't any Piglins around; they can only detect you doing this from up to 16 blocks away.\nYou'll likely find your inventory filling up easily, given how much loot and equipment bastion remnants can hold. &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es and an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; can greatly expand your maximum item capacity, but you can store the excess loot in chests that are already there if you're okay with making return trips. A &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to smelt all the gold weapons and armor you'll come across into nuggets; just make sure to leave one piece of gold armor unsmelted so you can equip it in case the one you're wearing breaks while you're exploring. Enchanted items can be disenchanted for experience with a grindstone.\nSpecific bastion types\nWhen exploring a hoglin stable, you should kill the hoglins first. They have more melee range than the piglins, are inherently hostile, and deal a lot of knockback, which can easily push you off the pillars and bridges of the bastion. Be careful not to hit any Piglins while doing this; hoglins are dangerous enough when fought by themselves.\nWhen exploring a treasure room, after clearing out the areas above, you should fill in the surrounding lava and disable/close off the magma cube monster spawner. &lt;a href=\"Gravel\"&gt;Gravel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; can help you fill in the lava from above, as the lava pool is only 2 blocks deep with the exception of the occasional hole in the base of the bastion. A potion of Fire Resistance can save your life if a magma cube knocks you into the lava pool while you're trying to fill it. Note that because magma cubes spawn at all light levels, the only way to disable the spawner is to completely cover it with blocks in a ~9\u00d75\u00d79 area with the spawner being in the center, one block under the top of that area. It's usually more practical to wall off the 9\u00d75\u00d79 area they spawn in instead.\nThe entrance also has at least 4 chests at, so make sure to loot those as well. You can loot one room, then mine into the left side (facing the entrance), and the second chest room will be on the other side.\nWhen exploring a bridge, the gold statue is generally somewhat safe to mine. It is on a 3-block-tall podium, so piglin brutes and piglins with swords are easy to kill. Crossbow piglins can knock you off, so prioritize killing them first with a ranger weapon. After killing the piglins that rushed to you, the bastion is somewhat safe in the center. Avoid melee combat, as it is easy to get pushed into lava. A Punch bow will help shove piglins and brutes into the lava columns. Turning left will bring you to another dangerous area, so snipe the piglins from afar. Make sure to block off all entrances when opening chests, as piglins will be aggravated, so you can take your time picking out the lodestone and other valuables in the chest. Afterwards, open a small hole if piglins are nearby trying to attack you. If none are there, the bastion is pretty much free to explore."}

{"id": "143719", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=143719", "title": "Tutorials/Defeating a monster room", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Monster%20room\"&gt;Monster room&lt;/a&gt;s are structures that generate underground connected to caves or other generated structures. They contain up to 2 loot chests and a &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; that spawns &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. The spawner can be farmed for &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and mob drops and the chests can contain useful and valuable items as well, so they are very good to find.\nFinding a monster room.\nMonster rooms generate at any altitude provided they are next to a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;, even if \"Generate Structures\" is turned off. If you stumble along naturally generated &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; when mining or exploring underground, that's a good sign you might have found a monster room; however, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; mixing also generates cobblestone, so be careful when investigating. &lt;a href=\"Mossy%20Cobblestone\"&gt;Mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; generates a lot in the floor, and there are only five naturally occurring sources of mossy cobblestone: &lt;a href=\"monster%20room\"&gt;monster room&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruin\"&gt;ocean ruin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone%20boulder\"&gt;mossy cobblestone boulder&lt;/a&gt;s. So, if you're not in a &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biome or aboveground, you've found a monster room.\nMonster rooms also generate next to caves. Turning sound on can be significantly helpful and subtitles still help. If you hear a lot of mobs of the same type in one direction, chances are there's a &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; in a monster room. The spawner has a chance to be a zombie (50% chance), skeleton (25% chance), or spider (25% chance). Unlike most generated structures, monster rooms cannot be located with .\nDefeating the monster room.\nOnce you've located your monster room, turn on subtitles or sound to determine what type of monster room it is and how to prepare. \nIf you've found a zombie or spider monster room, immediately block up the entrance with building blocks, and make a 1x1 hole in the monster room's wall. If you can reach the spawner from the hole, place a torch or another light source on or near the spawner as soon as possible, so that fewer mobs will spawn in. Use your sword to fight the zombies and spiders as they come. New groups of 1-4 zombies or spiders will spawn every 10-40 seconds if the light level is insufficient, so when you've defeated all the current mobs in there, quickly break in and scatter &lt;a href=\"torches\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt; everywhere to deter mob spawning. Don't look in the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s unless you're absolutely sure no mobs will spawn, as being ambushed while looking at a chest can be deadly. Remember that all monster rooms generate an entrance, so you could be attacked by creepers or skeletons from outside if you haven't prepared well.\nThe spawner in the center of the room is the key prize. You can destroy it if you like (it gives a modest amount of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; when broken with a pickaxe) but that is strongly discouraged unless you never, ever, ever want to farm the spawner. Once you're done, look in the chests. The loot normally contains a lot of things, but the best prizes are &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"horse%20armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf you've discovered a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; spawner, follow the advice above except always have your shield at the ready. Skeletons will fire at you from afar, so have a bunch of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s and know how to shoot as soon as the bow is fully charged. If you have enchantments on the bow, relatively high levels of &lt;a href=\"Power\"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; can kill a skeleton in one shot.\nAftermath.\nSpawners can make very useful &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and mob drop farms.\nAll of these mobs will also drop &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; upon death.\nAdvice on how to make farms of these mobs can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Spawner%20traps\"&gt;Spawner Traps&lt;/a&gt; page."}
{"id": "63776", "revid": "47297785", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=63776", "title": "Tutorials/Defeating a monument", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20monument\"&gt;Ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s are dangerous for unprepared players, as they have many dangers, including &lt;a href=\"guardians\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardians\"&gt;elder guardians&lt;/a&gt;, and many rooms that are easy to get lost in. However, they provide a treasure of eight &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20gold\"&gt;blocks of gold&lt;/a&gt;, are the only sustainable source of &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt; variants, as well as the only place where &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s can be obtained.\nReasons for defeating a monument.\nThere are a several benefits of defeating a monument:\nDangers.\nThe most common mob within the monument are &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. They swim quickly, have health, and have two ways to damage the player:\nEach monument also contains three &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. They have health and a somewhat stronger laser attack which deals points of damage, but move slowly and infrequently. They also inflict any player within 50 blocks with &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; III for 5 minutes. , the elder guardians check for nearby players to afflict every 60 seconds. , they afflict players immediately without waiting, so if you try to defeat a monument in Bedrock Edition, you can count on being afflicted with Mining Fatigue 100% of the time until all three elder guardians are killed. Bringing a cow into or near the monument and several Buckets is also a viable strategy, giving you roughly 55 seconds of normal mining if you drink a Bucket of Milk to cleanse the curse every time. This only works in \"Java Edition\". If you do a \"dry-run\" of raiding the monument, aka without Water Breathing, this is a decent approach.\nUnder the Mining Fatigue effect, you take about 370 times longer to break blocks and your attack speed is reduced by 30%. When an elder guardian inflicts you with Mining Fatigue III, then you could drink a bucket of milk. However, drinking milk also removes Water Breathing, and you just get Mining Fatigue soon afterward (immediately in Bedrock edition) anyway. Wait until you have defeated all 3 elder guardians before drinking milk. Until then, simply avoid breaking blocks, and travel only through pre-made passages. If you must place blocks, such as in the case where you need to run around a pillar to break line of sight with the guardians, use slime blocks, honey blocks or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Slime blocks, honey blocks and TNT are breakable instantaneously even under the effect of Mining Fatigue. There are still ways to brute-force your way into a monument, which is covered later.\nBe sure to kill the elders in a manner that counts as a player kill so that they drop &lt;a href=\"wet%20sponge\"&gt;wet sponge&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be smelted in a furnace or placed in &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; to make dry &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s. A dry sponge, strategically placed, is a quick way to clear out a large volume of water.\nLocating a monument.\nMonuments are found only in deep ocean &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, so you'll need to find an ocean and explore it. Being underwater, the monument may be difficult to see, but the &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s are distinctive and are easily visible if you're looking for them, especially at night. The top of the monument is generally close to the surface, making it possible to search for it in the day, however may be easier to miss. You can also listen for the sound of guardian lasers as they attack &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe right seed\nThese seeds tend to be island survival worlds; it is possible to defeat the nearest monument, but see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Island%20survival\"&gt;Tutorials/Island survival&lt;/a&gt; for survival tips.\nSurvival searching\nOther Methods\nEquipment checklist.\nEquipment that is particularly helpful when infiltrating a monument:\nAfter the elder guardians are dead and the Mining Fatigue has worn off, some additional equipment is helpful for looting the monument:\nDefeating the monument.\nThe first step is to get inside the monument, which can sometimes be difficult as guardians spawn outside the monument and can attack you. There are several ways you can get in:\nOnce inside, it can be advantageous to set up a base of operations. Doors or slime blocks can be used to seal any entrances to a chosen room, and sponge blocks can be used to quickly clear it of water. Then you might move in resources such as furnaces for drying sponges, chests to hold potions and other supplies, a bed in case you die, a nether portal for easier access via the Nether, and a cow for milk refills.\nA conduit can be set up in a 3 block high undrained room for up to 31 blocks worth of Conduit Power merely by placing a slime block, honey block or block of TNT on the floor one block diagonally in from the corner, placing the conduit on top and breaking the block. This removes any worries about air and helps speed up breaking through the prismarine if that is necessary.\nYour goal inside the monument is to take out the elder guardians to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; III that hinders your ability to obtain the resources from the monument. There are three per monument: one in the \"penthouse\" at the very top and one in each of the wings flanking the main entrance. The elders themselves are not extremely difficult if you're prepared with strong armor and weapons, since they move and attack relatively slowly, but finding them within the maze can pose a challenge. It might help to wall off dead ends as you investigate them, and note that the wings are connected by a long hallway around the back of the monument that bypasses the maze. Alternatively, you could simply mine through the ceiling of the elder guardians' rooms with a high-level Efficiency pickaxe, to counteract Mining Fatigue.\nAfter that is done you can simply raid the monument of its &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and leave. Alternatively, you can turn it into a base or a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Guardian%20farming\"&gt;guardian farm&lt;/a&gt;. Now that Mining Fatigue is no longer an issue, you can use any method you'd like to accomplish this. If you were lucky enough to find a sponge room (or three), the sponges are particularly helpful in this task, as the sponges soak up a lot of the water. Even if you did not find a sponge room, you can use the sponges from the elder guardians, or previously-obtained sponges from other monuments.\nAftermath.\nOnce you are done raiding, you can do these things:"}

They are flooded with &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, both inside and in the surrounding area, making it a difficult challenge for any player to conquer it. Note that this can be achieved at any point during the game.\nFinding an outpost.\nPillager outposts can be found in any biome that a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; can, and can additionally generate in all &lt;a href=\"mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Despite that they are often found next to villages, this is simply a coincidence, as the generation of these two structures is completely independent. The spawning of &lt;a href=\"pillager%20patrol\"&gt;pillager patrol&lt;/a&gt;s is also unrelated to the location of outposts, so do not assume that a patrol means an outpost is nearby.\nItems needed.\nBecause a pillager outpost can be found anywhere, it can be hard to prepare. Ideally, a player should have:\nOptional:\nOutpost surroundings.\nPillager outposts typically have smaller buildings around it. These can be used for cover. If a cage has an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; in it, let it out so it can help you fight. If it survives, do what you want with it, such as using a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; to bring it to a nearby village.\nTactics.\nSniper.\nIt's possible to go around with a ranged weapon and pick off all the pillagers from a far. If using a crossbow, don't fire fireworks unless you're sure the fuse time is right and you're firing at a large group. Once the coast is clear, go in the outpost, deal with any pillagers inside, kill the outpost captain if you haven't already, and collect your loot. This tactic takes the longest.\nBlitzing.\nWith good armor, this tactic can be effective. Run in with your shield and sword, blocking arrows and hitting pillagers nearby as you go. Run into the building, grab what you want, kill the captain, and leave. Once you're at the top of the outpost, you can use the sniper tactic to get rid of the rest if you like, or just leave. Ender pearls can help in this tactic.\nMachine gunner.\nThis tactic is expensive and not always reliable but can work. Load your entire hotbar with loaded crossbows, get into relatively close range, and as soon as you fire a crossbow draw your next one. This allows you to fire multiple arrows quickly, but it is ineffective against large groups unless most or all of the crossbows are enchanted with piercing and/or multishot. Also, it takes a long time to reload all the crossbows, even if some or all have quick charge, so you may be able to do this only once. It can, however, be combined with the blitzkrieg tactic as you're charging in, as after you unload the crossbows you can equip a melee weapon and have a shield in your offhand the whole time. This tactic is ineffective at long range due to the time it takes to range the target is about the same as the reload time for a bow or crossbow or the time it takes for a loyalty trident to return. Overall, this tactic would be better for a single target with a large amount of health, like a &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. Crossbows could also be loaded with fireworks for more firepower.\nCowboy.\nGo around the pillager outpost, getting all the pillagers to follow you. Because they clump together, they might friendly fire while trying to shoot you, which can further assist you. Once you have all or most of them behind you, you have several choices as to how to get rid of them all in a short time.\nMinimalist.\nAlternatively, a pillager outpost can be conquered using nothing but a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; (the person who proved this possible also brought &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not absolutely necessary to bring food to conduct this strategy). This is not a reliable strategy, but can be done. The idea is not to be seen by the pillagers. It is a good idea to release the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; in the cage if it generates to distract the pillagers. Next, make it to the top of the watchtower and then use the bucket to wash any pursuing pillagers down the staircase. Collect the water after looting the chest and use the remainder (which should be flowing out of the building) to break your fall. This can be conducted early-game (as it does not require armor or weapons), but can be challenging.\nUnderground passage.\nCreate a \"mine\" to approach the fort safely from underneath. Keep dirt/sand at all times in case you breach the surface or reach water. \nDive bomber.\nSimilar to the minimalist method above, it is possible to build straight up with dirt at a reasonable safe distance with a water bucket in hand. Then build a platform above the outpost and place water directly above the center of the tower. If possible, also collect a bucket of lava (or just another bucket of water) for combat before dropping in, and keep dirt on hand for escape. Swim down to the roof of the outpost, break through the roof and drop either the water or lava down the stairs and collect your loot. Leisurely climb back through the ceiling with dirt and swim back up to the platform above. If you used lava, watch as the world burns. This is an admittedly labor-intensive method of defeating an outpost, and you don't get any pillager loot from killing pillagers, but it is a mostly foolproof strategy, and can also be done early game and requires only a bucket, and two to three stacks of dirt/cobblestone. This method is easier if there are hills or tall trees nearby. Stone tools and food may be useful but are not required.\nBarricade.\nQuickly enter the outpost and run to the top level. Seal off the stairway and shoot the pillagers from there. Subsequently, work your way down.\nPillager deletion.\nTurn your difficulty into peaceful to get rid of all pillagers, but without gaining any drops or experience, and raids are not possible in Peaceful mode.\nTNT.\nThis uses a lot of TNT, and you should invest in a creeper farm to try this. Rush in and place TNT as quickly as possible around the base, and light one and sprint away.\nPsychopath.\nPlace a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; close to the outpost, free the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; from the cage, start killing the &lt;a href=\"pillagers\"&gt;pillagers&lt;/a&gt; as if on a rampage, rush the outpost, clear floor by floor of pillagers until they are dead. Do not destroy your bed until all the pillagers are dead, as a lone pillager can kill you.\nThis tactic can be useful if well executed.\nRoof dropping.\nBuild a bridge up to the top of the Pillager outpost. When you do so, get inside the top floor of the pillager outpost. Quickly seal off the stairway. Loot the chest and make your way up to where the bridge was on the roof, and quickly go down the bridge.\nStructure.\nA pillager outpost consists of a 4 level watchtower with other smaller structures around it.\n&lt;a href=\"Structure%20block\"&gt;Structure block&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to manually load pieces of the pillager outpost from the folder in &lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt;. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter , and press LOAD.\nAftermath.\nMost players would consider the outpost conquered once all the pillagers are killed, and the player has taken the loot. You can do the following once you have conquered it."}

{"id": "109826", "revid": "54549363", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=109826", "title": "Tutorials/Defeating a village raid", "text": "This tutorial will show you how to defeat a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaid basics.\nRaids are events during which , s, , and s (which can summon ) invade a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; to kill as many as possible ( also spawn but they are passive to villagers, they also attack iron golems and the player and heal other illagers with beneficial potions). They can be difficult to tackle early-game and can result in many villager deaths if not properly handled.\nPreparation.\nGetting good gear.\nGood gear is required to start a raid. Good gear increases your chances of survivability and the victory of a raid. For armour, get the Protection IV, Unbreaking III, Mending and Feather Falling IV. For the sword, get Sweeping Edge III, Sharpness V, Fire Aspect II, Unbreaking III and Mending. For the bow, get Infinity, Power V, Flame, Punch II and Unbreaking III. For the axe, get Efficiency V, Sharpness V, Unbreaking III and Mending. Optional weapons include a crossbow enchanted with Quick Charge III, Piercing IV or Multishot, Unbreaking III and Mending, a trident enchanted with Riptide III, Unbreaking III and Mending and a shield enchanted with Unbreaking III and Mending. Shields are recommended substitute to a totem, in case this is your first time to start a raid. Be aware though that shields are disabled 100% of the time when a vindicator with an axe hits you while your shield is up for 5 seconds, so try to run away when your shield is disabled. A bunch of totems can be handy to get out of sticky situations and potions can provide beneficial effects to you.\nPreparing the village.\nBefore the raid starts, a good idea is to prepare the village before the raiders attack. There are multiple ways to do so: \nWalling off the village.\nA solid strategy is to wall off the perimeter of the village using a strong block, such as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;. As there are no ways for raiders to destroy solid blocks, they will not be able to penetrate the wall, and will, therefore, be stuck attempting to pathfind around it. Once you have walled off your village, you can use &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s to scale the wall and shoot the raiders with a bow. You can alternatively use &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s to border your village. Be aware that pillagers can still shoot and evokers can summon their fang attack or vexes to attack both the villagers and iron golems.\nSetting traps.\nOnce you have walled off your village, you can set traps outside of the perimeter to deal damage. &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; traps and &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt; traps can slow down and damage the raiders, and iron golems can dispatch of them rather quickly. Holes surrounding the outside of the wall can also be used to trap the raiders and prevent them from progressing any further. A moat is also helpful with water, lava or just a deep ditch. Raiders will not walk off edges so an easy way to get them in a hole is to make steps down. Raiders will path-find into the hole but not walk out (to deal damage you can add magma, lava, wither roses, or sweet berries.)\nIf you're playing in a desert village, try to grab all the &lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; in the area around the village and place them around strategic points around the village with a height of 2-3 blocks. Don't worry, the ravagers in the raid cannot break the cacti.\nBlocking villager doorways.\nA very effective strategy is to wall off entrances to villager houses; this way, there is no way for the raiders (other than &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt;es) to access the villagers inside the houses, effectively keeping them safe while you deal with the raiders. An easy way to get the villagers into their houses to begin with is to ring a bell. Have some villagers hidden underground. If possible, have a dispenser that splashes them with invisibility.\nIf the raid is in a desert village, block the windows as well, no matter how high they are since desert village houses don't have any windows for covering but only a thin slot in some and probably a tall window if a potted cactus is there.\nRinging the bell to get all villagers back into their houses.\nRing the bell couple times when the raid bar starts generating so villagers that don't hear the first bell can go back into their houses safely. Immediately seal the doors (or windows if you're in a desert village) so the raid mobs cannot open the doors or attack from the windows.\nIron Golems.\nBuild as many &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt; as you can to help you defeat the raid, defend the village and assist you in battle. They can also provide a distraction to the raiders, so you can kill the illagers while they're attacking the golem. Don't worry about accidentally shooting the golems, as they won't fight back since they're player built (unless you have cheats on and summoned the iron golems), but try not to shoot or hit them, as they lose health if you have a strong weapon. Throw healing splash potions or regeneration potions at them or use iron ingots on them after the raid. \nIf you're hurt during the raid quickly find your iron golem (or multiple iron golems if you have more than one) and throw a splash potion of healing at your feet, which heals both you and the iron golem at the cost of one potion.\nIf you accidentally hit a naturally spawned iron golem (or one you summoned) and the iron golem starts attacking, go find some raid mobs and make the iron golem attack the raid mobs as a distraction. Use the time to calm down the iron golem (staying away from the iron golem for a minute or turning the gamemode to creative and back to survival).\nPreparing yourself.\nEquipment.\nThe minimum equipment to at least fight off a village raid is a full diamond armor with a shield in your offhand. However, vindicators, vexes and ravagers still does a ton of damage even with just unenchanted armor so it's much better if you apply Protection IV on the armor pieces. Even though if the damage is reduced by 64%, be careful if you're fighting multiple mobs at once, as their combined firepower can eventually overwhelm you.\nGood spawn point in the village.\nMake sure you set your spawn in the village so if you die you can get back to the village before the raiders kill all of your villagers. Using a bed or the command codice_1 can help you set your spawn point in your desired location. A spawn point around the middle of the village is a good place since all the places around the village is around the same distance from you.\nMilk.\nGet plenty of milk before the raid or breed cows and let them wander around the village so you can grab some milk from a nearby cow along the path if you're out. Milk saves you from negative status effects from splash potions if &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; spawn in the raid. If you're playing on easy difficulty you don't have to worry about this one.\nFood.\nBring plenty of healthy food such as &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pumpkin%20Pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt;, or all any type of cooked meat (such as &lt;a href=\"steak\"&gt;steak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Porkchop\"&gt;cooked porkchop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Chicken\"&gt;cooked chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Mutton\"&gt;cooked mutton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Rabbit\"&gt;cooked rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Cod\"&gt;cooked cod&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Salmon\"&gt;cooked salmon&lt;/a&gt;) because they restore the most hunger points in case you lose too many hunger points and cannot run if your hunger points are at 6 (three ham bars). \nAvoid foods that cannot stack or food that have to be placed (such as &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; or any type of stew or soup) because you cannot eat them efficiently.\nHealing from golden apples and enchanted golden apples.\nIf you have a good supply of gold, use them to craft golden apples, as they can heal you pretty fast, give you temporarily 2 extra hearts and fill your saturation. You can additionally use a god apple, as they give stronger effects and a 20% damage reduction and fire resistance for 5 minutes. However, god apples are very rare so it's better to use normal golden apples instead of them. \nPotions.\nIn a raid, you can also bring potions (it's best to prepare them before the raid rather than brewing them when the raid has started) to heal yourself and damage enemies as potions can be effective. Brew negative potions as splash potions (either a harming potion, a poison potion, a slowness potion, or a weakness potion) to throw at your enemies. Be sure to watch out because if you splash yourself with the potion then it can be bad. Poison potions and weakness potions don't work on witches, since they are immune to poison and don't use melee attacks. Use harming potions to finish them off instead (or your weapons) and watch out for any potions thrown from the witch. \nIn the meantime, you can also brew positive potions to heal yourself (either a regeneration potion, a healing potion, a strength potion, an invisibility potion, a slow falling potion, a swiftness potion, or a fire resistance potion to counter vex swords with Fire Aspect) or give yourself some beneficial effects and if you have enough &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; you can use splash potions to heal yourself quicker. You can also heal any villagers or iron golems that are damaged using the positive splash potions or you can also give them positive effects (swiftness works for them as they can get to their enemies quicker and escape quicker and invisibility works for them as well because they can be undetected). Be sure not to heal any enemies when throwing the potion, since they are supposed to be killed.\nYou can throw a same healing or regeneration potion at any of your allies when they are in a group because that conserves the potion. Throwing a harmful splash potion at a group of raiding mobs can also help conserve the thrown potion.\nNote: If you play Java Edition and is on hard difficulty, \"think twice\" before starting a high-level raid, particularly if you aren't very confident with your capabilities. Even with a full set of enchanted netherite equipment, you may get killed if you don't have the proper tactics, skills and potions that are necessary for tough combats. In Bedrock Edition this is usually not as big a problem since Bedrock Edition still uses older combat mechanism, but can still be very risky.\nStarting the raid.\nThe only way to trigger a raid is through the effect, which is obtained after killing an &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;illager captain&lt;/a&gt;. Illager captains wear &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt;s, also known as illager banners on their heads and appear as part of &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, the latter of which can spawn several over time. \n, if multiple raid captains are killed in succession, the Bad Omen level will stack to a maximum of V, increasing the likelihood of pillagers and vindicators wielding enchanted weapons. When the level of Bad Omen is higher than I, the resulting raid has an additional wave with a raider composition identical to that of the last wave. This does not work in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo begin the raid, walk into a chunk comprising at least one &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; and one claimed bed with the Bad Omen effect. Raiding illagers will then spawn within 64 blocks of the registered &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeating the raid.\nOnce the raid starts, your immediate priority should be to locate the raiders and swiftly kill them before they kill any villagers, which can wipe out your village easily if they don't get back to their houses in time. \nRing the village &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; to alert villagers and afflict any nearby raiders with the status effect and determine their locations. .\nPrioritize s, s and es. Witches heal other raiders , ravagers destroy crops, and evokers spawn vexes which deal heavy damage and pass through solid walls and floors.\nOnce the current wave has been eliminated, the next one will start shortly. This process will repeat until every wave has been defeated.\nPost-raid.\nOnce the raid has been defeated, any player in the village boundary will be awarded the &lt;a href=\"Advancements%23Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; advancement and be affected with the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; status effect for 60:00 or 3 in-game days.\nVillagers will &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village%23Gifts\"&gt;throw gifts&lt;/a&gt; at nearby players once the raid has been defeated.\nWaves.\n, the number of waves depends on the difficulty. If the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; level is higher than I, an additional wave spawns with an identical raider composition as the last wave.\nThere are three waves on Easy, five waves on Normal, and seven waves on Hard difficulty. Depending on the difficulty, up to 2 additional pillagers and vindicators may spawn per wave, and an additional witch may spawn on the third wave onwards.\n, as Bad Omen is not cumulative, there are no additional waves, and additional illagers do not spawn as well. s do not ride s.\nWave 1:\nThere are only s. Simply charge up to them and dispatch them with your sword, blocking any arrows, or snipe at them from a distance if they are still grouped together. If they are in a line or a clump, it's best to use a crossbow enchanted with &lt;a href=\"multishot\"&gt;multishot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"piercing\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt;, so you can shoot them all from a distance. \nWave 2:\nThere are s and s. Melee tactics are enough for now, but always fall back to ranged combat if you\u2019re facing many illagers at once. You can also &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar jump&lt;/a&gt; to kill the vindicators easier or trap them in &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;boats&lt;/a&gt;.\nWave 3:\nThere is a and some s. You may need to use hit-and-run tactics against the ravager, as it can resist knockback. Alternatively, get to high ground and pelt it with arrows. Using a lava bucket on the ravager might also work, just try to lure it into an open area so you don't burn any houses down. Kill the pillagers as per normal.\nWave 4:\nThere are es, s, and s. Catch the witches by surprise and quickly strike them until they die, such that they do not throw harmful potions that make you vulnerable. Another way to kill the witches is to get the pillagers and vindicators to chase you, and when you run into the witch, quickly move out of the way so the witch will throw the harmful potions into the pillagers and vindicators. The pillagers and vindicators will fight back at the witch, allowing you to shoot the witch without the witch targeting you alone. It's best to quickly locate the mobs in this raid, since they might separate when in the village. \nWave 5:\nThere are s, s, an , and a riding a ( there is an additional ). Shoot the pillager mount from a distance or fling the pillagers off the ravager with a fishing rod before closing in on the ravager. Corner the evoker into a small space (while dodging its fangs) for melee combat, or snipe at it from a distance. Ignore any vexes that spawn since killing the evoker will prevent more from spawning and they will despawn by themselves. Kill the other raiders as per normal.\nWave 6:\nThere is only one , but many s and s. Try to single out the evoker first as es can be troublesome to deal with. Kill the other raiders as per normal, but be especially careful to not get swarmed.\nWave 7:\nIt\u2019s a massive raiding party consisting of almost all raiding illager types, including an and riding a each. s constitute the majority of raiders. Be careful and try to single out illagers to reduce group sizes. Snipe at the mounted evoker first to make the ravager less of a threat and defeatable with melee strategies. As with the third wave, attack the witches quickly, and by surprise, to avoid potion chaos. You can also make the witch throw the harmful potions at the other raiding mobs to pose a distraction. Use a water bucket or a lava bucket to dispatch vindicators without getting hit by large hordes.\nTraps.\nUsing any traps while you're getting chased is a better idea since you know where the mobs are chasing you. Putting traps around the village before the raid is not a good idea as villagers and iron golems can run into them and you cannot guaranteed 100% that the raid mobs will pass that location. \nWater bucket trap.\nThis is not really a trap, but it slows down mobs since they cannot push against the flow of the water unlike the player. Placing a water bucket at the raiding mob's feet slows them down, allowing you to take the raid mobs down using a bow from a safe distance. Pillagers will try to use melee attacks when in water, so you can kill the pillagers with ease.\nBe careful of ranged mobs, such as pillagers and evokers (and witches if the water bucket distance if not too big) because they can still snipe you from a distance, even when getting slowed water.\nLava trap.\nThe best place to use this trap is away from the village houses, since many of them can catch fire from the lava. Putting cobblestone around the village houses allows you to use this trap anywhere. Dump a bucket of lava if you're away from the mobs and stand behind the lava. The raid mobs that see you goes towards you and gets burned in the lava between you and the mobs. Since this trap destroys most mob loot, it's not a recommended trap in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nCobweb trap\nPlace cobwebs in a line in front of you so the mobs get stuck there. Shoot them safely with a bow or kill them with your axe or sword. This trap won't work for pillagers, since they can still shoot from cobwebs. While in the cobwebs, evokers can also summon vexes or evoker fangs that can still attack the player. Make sure you kill the ranged mobs before moving to melee mobs, as the ranged mobs can still shoot.\nBoat trap.\nPlace boats between you and the vindicators to trap them inside. This allows you to focus on the other mobs instead of getting high damage from the vindicators. After the other mobs have been killed, shoot at the vindicators from a distance or get close enough where you can hit them but they can't hit back. Boats also trap other mobs but not the ravager.\nWall trap.\nThis isn't really a trap but what it will do causes the mobs' AI to mess up, and they'll try to funnel through one place, making them an easy kill. Beware of ravagers and evokers though, since a ravager has a wider range of attack and evokers can either summon their fangs or their vexes to attack you.\nNotes.\nTutorials/Defeating a pillager outpost"}

A mansion is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;s, and is one of the only places where a &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained. Besides &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, a mansion's interior lighting is sufficiently low for other Overworld monsters to spawn. &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20mansion\"&gt;Woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s are massive structures found in &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt;s. They are highly anticipated to explore because they are one of the only ways to find the &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; and the useful &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt; mobs, and are the only structure to contain the &lt;a href=\"vex%20armor%20trim\"&gt;vex armor trim&lt;/a&gt;. and contain valuable loot in large quantities.\nExploration checklist.\nExploring a mansion requires a lot of preparation, but not everyone has the same skills. So depending on how skilled you are, different preparations may be needed. The following is a suggested collection of equipment you might need:\nPreparing equipment.\nIt is important you grab the necessary equipment to distract and kill the illagers in the mansion, don't bring items you don't need such as all your diamonds or you might lose them forever.\nSword / Axe.\nYour &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; is your primary melee weapon for eliminating vindicators or cornering evokers. Although the durability of axes decreases more rapidly when used as a weapon, critical hits deal extremely heavy, if not fatal, blows to your target, and they can also be used to punch through walls for uncovering secret rooms.\nBow / Crossbow.\nYour &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, a secondary weapon, should be used for taking out enemies from a distance if there are many gathered together. When in melee combat, it is always safer to fall back to ranged combat if you\u2019re swarmed by illagers. If you take a crossbow with you, however, make sure that an arrow has already been loaded for a faster first shot.\nArmor.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; is a must-have when exploring a mansion, because vindicators have one of the strongest direct attacks of any hostile mob, and vexes also have substantial melee damage. Iron armor should be worn at minimum, and &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; helps to reduce damage from evocation fangs that would otherwise completely bypass armor and shields.\nFood.\nNutritious food, such as &lt;a href=\"steak\"&gt;steak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cooked%20porkchop\"&gt;cooked porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; are absolutely necessary for healing after a fight. The food can also heal your hunger bar so you can sprint.\nExpendable blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Cobblestone\"&gt;Cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; are the go-to expendable block for building a protective cover to heal, towering or bridging your way across. Although &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; is much easier to gather, keep in mind that it\u2019s not as tough and can be destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; explosion. However, if evocation fangs are coming your way, use dirt instead of cobblestone to build a barrier such that you can quickly mine and escape if the fangs pass through.\nTorches.\nA few stacks of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt; provide better visibility in dark corners, and prevent common mobs such as &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; etc. from spawning.\nWater bucket.\nUsed to break your fall. Necessary for all missions, no matter the difficulty.\nShield.\nA &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; (or two for backup) is recommended for a mansion venture because it can be used to block melee attacks. Just be more careful when using a shield against vindicators, as their axe attacks can disable it.\nExplorer map.\nThe main way to locate a woodland mansion without cheats. Woodland explorer maps can be obtained from cartographer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nElytra.\nAs mansions are typically thousands of blocks away, a pair of &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; combined with &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s will suffice for a speedier and more efficient journey to the mansion. Just make sure you\u2019ve packed enough &lt;a href=\"phantom%20membrane\"&gt;phantom membrane&lt;/a&gt;s for repair, or enchanted the elytra with &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; (and possibly &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;) for it to last longer.\nHealing items.\nPowerful illager attacks can bring you to a vulnerable state at times, so &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;healing potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;regeneration potions&lt;/a&gt; will come in handy for a swift healing cover. &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;Enchanted apple&lt;/a&gt;s can heal you more than regular ones, but since they are extremely rare, use them sparingly if you get your hands on some.\nIf you do obtain a &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;Totem of Undying&lt;/a&gt; by killing an evoker, do place it in your left hand slot as soon as possible, as &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s aren\u2019t as useful against &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicators&lt;/a&gt; as their axes disable shields. \nHelpful potions.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;s enhance your performance, which can be highly beneficial although not necessary. &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Strength potions&lt;/a&gt; can give you the edge in combat, while &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;invisibility potions&lt;/a&gt; can allow you to sneak into loot rooms given that you\u2019re unarmored. \nEnder chest / shulker boxes.\nThese make transportation of loot much easier, as mansions are sometimes very far, often thousands of blocks apart. You should pack backup gear in the &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;, which you can place at the mansion\u2019s entrance along with a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, such that if you die, you\u2019ll be able to respawn at your ender chest and quickly ready yourself and rescue your items. Bring at least 6 shulker boxes and put them in your ender chest. Bring a silk touch pickaxe to pick up the ender chest. There is a lot of loot and most of the furniture can be dismantled for additional blocks. You will want a way to store them, and you don't want to clutter your inventory. Diamond hoes, chestplates, and totems of undying are non-stackable and can take up a lot of space in your inventory.\nEnder pearls.\n&lt;a href=\"Ender%20pearl\"&gt;Ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s can be used for quick travel across mansion floors, or escaping from a crowd of illagers. On the journey, if your &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; breaks while you are flying, throw an ender pearl to the ground to break your fall.\nBells.\n&lt;a href=\"Bell\"&gt;Bell&lt;/a&gt;s are normally used in villages during raids, where they give the &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;Glowing&lt;/a&gt; effect to raiders, making them easier to locate. This glowing effect doesn't just apply \"during\" a raid - it applies to all raid mobs, including vindicators and evokers, under all circumstances. Bringing a bell to the mansion can help you see these two dangerous mobs through walls at a distance of 32 blocks, so you can have a better idea of their exact locations, as well as to confirm whether an area is completely cleared of illagers or not.\nName tags.\nUsing the \"Here's Johnny!\" tactic, you can easily distract the vindicators and kill them easier. To do this you need an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; or if you already have an anvil back at your base, name them \"Johnny\" (without quotes) before you go to the mansion. \nOnce you got the &lt;a href=\"Name%20Tag\"&gt;name tags&lt;/a&gt;, find a vindicator with hostile mobs to the vindicator. Once that is complete, name the vindicator \"Johnny\" with one of your name tags it'll attack all non illager mobs in the area. The point of this is not to make the vindicator do your dirty work, but to distract it on another mob so you can kill it without it coming towards you. \nIron golems.\nYou can bring a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; or make your own, but it is suggested that you make the iron golem yourself as they won't retaliate if hit by you unlike the naturally spawned golem. It's also hard to move the iron golem across rivers and trees if you decide to steal one from a village, so it is ill-advised to do so as it could die along the way. \nIron golems can assist you in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Illager\"&gt;illagers&lt;/a&gt; or distract them, and if the iron golem survives the battle, you can use &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;Iron Ingots&lt;/a&gt; to repair it for another room. It is also advised the you make the iron golem before you enter combat as you will often die trying to make it in time. \nUse leads to move the iron golem around or lure mobs into the iron golem's sight so the iron golem will attack it. Keep on repeating this process until you can't find any more illagers in the mansion. After that, you can loot the mansion, turn it into your base, or burn it down.\nBlue sheep.\nBringing a &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; from a nearby village or finding one around the mansion can be good for distracting evokers. Bring some &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dye\"&gt;blue dyes&lt;/a&gt; so you can dye the sheep blue. Bring the sheep in the mansion when you see an evoker. Dyeing the sheep blue can provide a distraction to the evoker and gives it a cooldown time before it could summon anything else. \nTo move the sheep around, either hold wheat to make it follow you or use a lead if you have one. When you see an evoker you can bring the blue sheep and your blue dyes to the evoker. Make sure you dye your sheep blue before you approach the evoker, as it sees a normal sheep it might do a fang attack instead, hurting both you and your sheep. If the evoker sees the blue sheep it will dye it red, giving you time to dye the sheep blue again and hit the evoker a couple times while it is still on its cooldown. \nDo this to every evoker until all the evokers in the mansion is dead, then you can take any vindicators you see in the mansion. Don't worry too much about vindicators killing your sheep, since they will attack you instead of the sheep. Make sure you know where your sheep is before you die in case if you die it wanders out of the mansion or it gets lost in a corridor.\nGetting there.\nIn the majority of worlds, a mansion is typically thousands of blocks from the spawn point, requiring a long journey. Use the following advice to embark on that journey.\nObtaining the map.\nPlayers begin their mansion journey with a &lt;a href=\"woodland%20explorer%20map\"&gt;woodland explorer map&lt;/a&gt;, which can be obtained by trading with a journeyman &lt;a href=\"Trading\"&gt;cartographer&lt;/a&gt; for around 14 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt; . If you are playing on hard mode, you can convert villagers to zombie villagers and convert back using a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20weakness\"&gt;splash potion of weakness&lt;/a&gt; It makes the price discount. This is totally optinal, the cartographer always sells the map, but , they have a chance to sell it. Besides a map\u2019s regular features, the explorer map has a house-shaped icon that indicates where the mansion is.\nFinding new places.\nSince the journey to the mansion is extremely long, chances are you\u2019ll discover new places along the way, some of which contain extra loot. Do explore them before continuing on your journey as you might be able to stock up on supplies for your upcoming raid. Blacksmiths in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and temples are among the more useful structures you\u2019ll find. You can also find many other biomes and rare structures. If you find a ocean monument, keep the coordinates of it because ocean monuments require different equipment.\nTemporary camp.\nBefore you enter the mansion, you should set up a small base at its cobblestone entrance, where it is pre-lit by &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. Build a fence around the entrance to prevent hostile mobs from trespassing. Bring a bed so you can sleep at night and set your spawn point here temporary unless you want to use the mansion as your base. Make a &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt; to prepare extra food and position your &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; beside your bed. Don\u2019t forget to bring along your &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt; if you have one, as you can store more items with it! Surround your camp with a roof to prevent hostile mobs from attacking you while you're sleeping.\nNavigating the mansion.\nStay alert as you explore. There\u2019s nothing more awful than getting surprised by a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; explosion and dying on the spot, losing all your experience points in the process. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt; ambushes are another threat as they deal hefty amounts of damage, also having a chance to kill you if you're playing on hard difficulty.\nFor added security, you could head to the second floor immediately to kill an evoker and get its &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Undying\"&gt;Totem of Undying&lt;/a&gt;, before exploring normally afterwards floor-by-floor.\nIf you spot groups of illagers in the distance, use a ranged weapon to take them out one-by-one. Against lone ones, however, don\u2019t hesitate to dispatch them with your sword or axe.\nDon't bother looking in storage room chests; they contain nothing, and looking through them leaves you vulnerable to vindicator ambushes.\nAlways look out for solid walls where windows should be, or strange missing spaces in-between rooms; these could indicate a secret room behind. Two of them contain &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20diamond\"&gt;diamond block&lt;/a&gt; in the center, so be sure to take with you a diamond pickaxe to extract the diamonds within.\nIf you plan to make the mansion your base, be sure to light up every room to prevent hostile mob spawning. Be careful not to accidentally set anything on fire or let creepers sneak up on you, although having a clump of vindicators near you while the creeper is about to blow up could be an advantage.\nStructure.\nBefore exploring a woodland mansion, knowing its structures is quite important.\nAlthough their exact structure varies, all woodland mansions have some things in common: they all have three floors with a variety of rooms, and generate a &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; foundation underneath the entire structure if there are any gaps between the bottom of the mansion and the ground. The top floor is about half the size of the lower floors, but the size of each top floor is pretty random for each mansion, depending on how many rooms are going to be generated on the top floor. Each mansion includes a large foyer that leads to the corridors connecting the rooms, a giant staircase also generates there, which leads up to the second floor. The foyer is dark and many hostile mobs spawn under the staircase. \nRooms.\nA woodland mansion contains many types of rooms. Because the layout is randomly generated, some room types may not be present. Furthermore, certain rooms within the mansion are not readily accessible \u2013 some may have sealed entrances, while secret rooms have no entrances at all.\nOne may access the individual structures of a woodland mansion by using &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt;s to manually load room structures from the codice_1 folder in &lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt;. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter codice_2, and press LOAD. A list of possible rooms, the names of these structures, and small descriptions are provided in the table below. Note that the room names are conjectural.\nMain and secret rooms.\nA woodland mansion can sometimes generate secret rooms on each floor. A secret room can be one of the following type: \"X\" room, spider room, fake end portal room, obsidian room, birch pillar room, clean chest room, lava room, and attic room, with the 'X\" room being the most common, and the \"lava\" room being the rarest. A way to look for a secret room is looking for gaps between normal rooms, this way is the best on the first floor, as there are no windows. Another way is looking through the windows through the second and third floors of the mansion, since some secret rooms are exposed to windows. A last way to look for a secret room is cutting down the roof, which works best for the third floor alone. Then you can see any secret rooms from the roof of the floor, as the whole floor's layout. \nIn the table below, a indicates either a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with random loot, or the spawn point of an &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling the mobs.\nVindicator.\n&lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s have HP, which means they\u2019re not the beefiest mobs out there. However, their punishing axe blows deal a maximum of damage on Hard difficulty, and are especially dangerous if their axes are enchanted.\nEvoker.\n&lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;s have HP like vindicators, but have a more unconventional fighting style. When within a 16-block radius, they summon a row of evocation fangs that bypass armor and shields, and when cornered, they summon a ring of said fangs instead. Evokers may also summon three vexes to join the fight, and flee at the player\u2019s sprinting speed when cornered.\nVex.\nSummoned by evokers, &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es can fly through walls and floors to attack their target by surprise. Despite their low health pool, they deal up to damage on Hard difficulty, meaning that they\u2019re not to be trifled with.\nGeneral Strategy.\nMost people do this strategy when raiding the woodland mansion.\nBring all your things with you and don't forget your ender chest containing your shulker boxes. When you enter the mansion, start illuminating it. Kill any hostile mobs you see. When you are looting a room, kill all hostile mobs and light the room up. Take all the furniture and loot because they will be useful later. This will also remind you that you have raided this room. \nYou can also mark the entrance if you don't want the furniture. Punch holes in the walls to check for secret rooms. If you find loot and your inventory gets full, open your ender chest and take out a shulker box to store your loot. Quickly put the shulker box in the ender chest so you don't risk losing it. Repeat for the other rooms. On the second floor and third floor, there are evokers, which summon vexes. Kill them first by sniping or cornering them. If your sword has Knockback, it is unrecommended to attack an evoker with it because you will knock it away and it can sprint as fast as the player. Once the evoker is dead, kill the vindicators and take the loot and furniture. \nAgain, punch holes in the walls to check for secret rooms. Some rooms are more dangerous than others and the loot and furniture are different, such as the conference rooms, where five vindicators and one evoker generates within. If you take all the loot and furniture, you will gain a lot of useful resources. Aside from the woodland mansion chest loot, you will get a lot of mob drops, carpets, stairs and slabs from furniture, bookshelves, flowerpots, flowers, banners, cauldrons, chests, diamond and lapis blocks, cobblestone, redstone, iron doors, dirt, wheat, seeds, melons, pumpkins, and dark oak saplings. Even those things aren't much value, they are worth taking because they can save you some resources. There are also many alternative strategies to loot a woodland mansion, it is based on personal preference.\nAlternative strategies for defeat.\nMelee Warfare.\nRequired Items:\nProcedure:\nUsing a sword or bow, attack the &lt;a href=\"illagers\"&gt;illagers&lt;/a&gt; head on. Take down the mansion room by room, and punch holes in the walls to look for secret rooms.\nWater Defense.\nRequired Items:\nProcedure:\nWhen a vindicator spots you, apply the water bucket right underneath you to make a water pool. Stand in the water and hit the vindicators with your sword, as they will have a very hard time getting to you, since they cannot go to you while the water is flowing towards them.\nArrows from Above.\nRequired Items:\nProcedure:\nClimb to the top of the mansion where you\u2019ll set up camp. From there, destroy the roof and whip out your ranged weapon of choice to shoot any illagers from above, room-by-room. After clearing a loot room containing illagers, use your water bucket to head downwards, extract the loot and head to the roof again for more shooting. This method is great in the sense that all secret rooms are guaranteed to be uncovered.\nInfiltration.\nRequired Items\nProcedure:\nEnter the mansion invisible. Trap illagers you see in blocks, making sure that you don\u2019t come too close as they might notice you.\nRaid Squad.\nRequired Items\nProcedure:\nThere are many different ways to raid a mansion in a group. It\u2019s easiest to go full-on \u201cMelee Warfare\u201d with a team, though more organized players might assign roles for each teammate (e.g. melee fighter, sniper, potion lobber, etc.) before heading in.\nWolf Army.\nRequired Items\nProcedure:\nUse regular stategies to go about raiding the mansion. Your wolves will serve as your guardians and increase your survivability. Make sure you heal them after defeating an illager or some illagers in a room. \nHere\u2019s Johnny!\nRequired Items\nProcedure:\nName vindicators \"Johnny\" such that they attack other hostile mobs in the mansion, which will make your raid much more pleasant. Invisibility potions reduce the likelihood of the vindicators noticing you as you name them, but you can charge up to them from behind and name them, then run.\nMass destruction.\nEquipment\nProcedure:\nIt\u2019s simple as blowing up parts of the mansion to destroy illagers, or burning everything away to reveal hidden chests. Just stay away from fires and explosion, of course! Don't do this if you want to keep the mansion as your base.\nLoot.\nMany mansion rooms contain chests with \u201c&lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; loot\u201d in them, along with a extra &lt;a href=\"Music%20Disc\"&gt;disc&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from loot chests, there are several valuable blocks that the player can scavenge from the mansion's rooms: the secret \u201cobsidian room\" and \"lava room\" both contain a &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Diamond\"&gt;diamond block&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the structures, and the \"illager statue room\" contains a hidden &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli block&lt;/a&gt; in the illager\u2019s head, to name a few.\nFor further information, please see the page \nPost-Exploration.\nAfter the mansion is looted, there are a number of things you can do with it. You can turn it into a home, burn it down, systematically dismantle it to get extra resources, or just leave it as it is. Like Outposts, You can just leave. Hostile Mobs can eventually respawn if there isn't any light.\nTurn it into a home (or your new base).\nThe woodland mansion is a nice looking structure. Turn the mansion into your base. Light it up and clear out all hostile mobs. Fix all creeper holes and fire damage. You can use the original rooms, or tear down the inner walls and build them how you want. You can take all the furniture to add your own. Make sure to change the wool beds in the bedrooms into \"real\" beds so you can sleep in them. Placing two beds next to each other makes a wide and good-looking bed. Add a kitchen, bathroom, better bedrooms, anything you want. You can even redesign the whole mansion, but it will take a long time to do so. Be careful if you want to redesign the sides of the roof to make it look nicer, as you can fall from up to twenty blocks and possibly die. Putting farms on top of the mansion's roof can be effective for food since sunlight helps crops grow faster. Don't worry about Illagers as long as you've explored all the rooms and killed all of them since they never respawn, unlike pillagers.\nExpanding it.\nSince the mansion is in a dark forest, you can make a giant basement and carve windows into a cobblestone foundation that is taller than one mansion level (roughly around ten blocks, but you can make it as tall as you want). The first floor doesn't have windows since the trees around obstruct it, but you can carve windows into it. The dark oak wood from the trees around it blends nicely with the rest of the mansion. You can also chop down trees around and use the logs to expand the mansion to that area too.\nTurning it into a village.\nMaking houses with the dark oak wood from the nearby trees around the mansion can turn the area into a nice looking &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Villager%20farming\"&gt;villager breeder&lt;/a&gt; consisting of at least 2 &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; (you can bring villagers from another village or cure any &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;zombie villagers&lt;/a&gt; you find) to populate the mansion. Make job sites for the villagers and put beds in the upper rooms of the mansion. After you get lots of villagers and claimed beds, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt; can spawn and protect you and the villagers from hostile mobs such as &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. \nMake a villager breeder or any type of mob farm inside.\nYou can build some type of farm(s) inside. You can make a spider farm with the spider spawner, bring in villagers for villager trading halls, or make the building a giant crop farm, which works best on the roof, as crops uproot if not connected with sunlight. An &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Animal%20farming\"&gt;animal farm&lt;/a&gt; works too, but you need some food to breed them.\nBurning it down.\nSimple as that, set an entire mansion room on fire using &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Charge\"&gt;fire charges&lt;/a&gt; and run out of the mansion. Stay at least 10 blocks from any nearby fires since the fire can burn through the trees.\nBuild a community building.\nUse the woodland mansion for a community building. Redo the inner walls and move it to the location you want using mods. Some ideas are making a hotel, town hall, or factory."}
{"id": "86027", "revid": "43947952", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=86027", "title": "Tutorials/Defeating an End city", "text": "&lt;a href=\"End%20City\"&gt;End cities&lt;/a&gt; are special structures found in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. They are highly anticipated to explore, because they are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, and are the only place where you can find &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, an extremely useful set of wings that you can use to fly. Since elytra can only be found here, end cities are a great place to go before going on long journeys. Players would go to the end to loot the end cities; this act is nicknamed 'End Busting'. \nEnd city exploration checklist.\nExploring a city requires a lot of preparation, but not everyone has the same skills. So depending on how skilled you are, different preparations may be needed. The following is a suggested collection of equipment you might need:\nPreparing equipment.\nSword.\nYour &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; (preferably diamond or netherite) will be used to take out &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as provoked &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;. You should &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt; your sword with &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt; V, to deal as much damage as possible. &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; is ineffective against the shulkers, since they cannot move without teleporting, but it works against the endermen. If you have &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; on your sword, any endermen you hit will be harder to deal with, since they teleport upon taking damage. However, if endermen get set on fire, they will still get weaker for every &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Fire%20damage\"&gt;firetick&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; is also extremely useful, because it will allow you to get more &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt;s from shulkers, and more &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s from endermen.\nBow.\nThe &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; will be your secondary weapon, for taking out shulkers. It is ineffective against the endermen, since they will teleport away from the arrow, but it works against the shulkers. You should enchant your bow with &lt;a href=\"Power\"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; IV or V, to deal as much damage as possible, and &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, so that you don't run out of arrows while exploring. &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; is also recommended, but not required. &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; is extremely useful, because shulkers will almost never teleport if they get set on fire. &lt;a href=\"Punch\"&gt;Punch&lt;/a&gt; is ineffective, since they are immune to knockback. Shulkers will deflect arrows if their shell is closed, so wait for them to open their shell before shooting them.\nCrossbow.\nIf you do not want to use a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; is a great alternative, since it deals more damage and has a longer range. However, a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; cannot be enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; so it is possible to run out of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s whilst using it. If the player does plan to use a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, they should enchant it with &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Charge\"&gt;Quick Charge&lt;/a&gt; III, so it reloads faster, and &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt;, to shoot multiple enemies in a line or a row respectively.\nTrident.\nIf you don't have &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; or lots of arrows, a trident with a high level of &lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; serves as a great replacement since they do more damage than an unenchanted diamond sword does. However, , a trident is lost forever if it falls into the void, even when enchanted with Loyalty, making tridents an undesirable weapon for the End dimension. Note that , Loyalty tridents \"do\" return to the player if thrown into the void.\nArmor.\nYou will take a lot of damage when exploring a city, especially from attacks by shulkers and endermen. Therefore, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely essential. You should wear a full set of diamond or netherite armor enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV. Because of the narrow bridges, and the height of the buildings, &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; IV on your boots is almost necessary. &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; is also recommended, because it will damage provoked endermen when they attack you. However, Thorns has a high enchantment weight, so be sure to add &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; to your armor as well.\nPickaxe.\nMost materials in the End are stone-related. A &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; (preferably diamond or netherite) will be needed to collect these. The most common items to collect are &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;s, which require a pickaxe to collect. You should enchant your pickaxe with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; IV or V, to collect blocks quickly. And &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; is necessary to reclaim your &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nHealing items.\nSince shulkers and endermen can deal a lot of damage, healing items are absolutely necessary. &lt;a href=\"Golden%20apple\"&gt;Golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s are the most efficient healing item, because they provide &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt;, which will protect you from most damage while you heal, so bring at least 10 of these, also you can find 2 of potions of instant healing in the brewing stand of a end ship, but they are not enough when exploring end cities. Potent &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;healing potion&lt;/a&gt;s and extended &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;regeneration potion&lt;/a&gt;s are also required. &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;Enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s can heal you more than regular ones, but they are extremely difficult to find, so save them only for emergencies, and use regular golden apples otherwise.\nThe &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; can also be used, but it can only be accessed after you explore a &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; or defeat a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is absolutely worth it, because will prevent you from dying. To use it, simply place it in your off-hand and ignore that it is even there while you explore. When you take fatal damage, the totem will explode and cause an animation of fireworks, which will \"resurrect\" you and provide you with &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; and temporary Absorption.\nNote that totem doesn't protect player from dying in void.\nFood.\nThere should never be a time when you do not have &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; with you. &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Carrot\"&gt;Golden carrots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cooked%20porkchop\"&gt;cooked porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"steak\"&gt;steak&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most nutritious foods possible, so bring at least a stack of either of these. Bread can also be found in loot chests that are found along the way to the end portal. You don't have to worry about running out of food, because you can just collect some chorus fruit along the way.\n&lt;a href=\"Golden%20apple\"&gt;Golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;enchanted apple&lt;/a&gt;s can also restore food points, but they are mainly used as a healing item. Eat your normal food if you do not have full saturation, and only use golden apples when you take damage.\nOnly eat the enchanted golden apple if you are sure that you will die.\nPotions.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;s are highly recommended to have when you explore a city, to enhance your performance. &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Strength potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;invisibility potions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Swiftness\"&gt;swiftness potions&lt;/a&gt; can be extremely useful. When you use an invisibility potion, mobs can still see you if you are wearing your armor. To stay safe, take off all of your armor before drinking it, and put it back on at least 30 seconds before the effect expires. \nPotions can also be used for emergency healing, since you will take a lot of damage from shulkers and endermen. &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Healing potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;regeneration potions&lt;/a&gt; are different, because healing potions will heal you instantly, and regeneration potions will heal you gradually. However, both of them are great healing items, so bring at least six of each type of potion.\nWater bucket.\nA &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; is extremely useful to have in the End, because it can save your life in several ways. For example, it can save you from long falls, if you accidentally fall then you can dump the water below you before you hit the ground so you don't take any fall damage, and being in water also neutralizes Levitation. If you are in a city on a bridge, place down your water so that it falls to the ground. If you fall off the bridge, you can jump into the waterfall to survive. Water can even help you deal with provoked endermen. If an enderman gets mad at you, dump the water at your feet, and the enderman will get hurt and teleport away. \nBringing multiple water buckets is also a possibility, so you can flood the city with water and decrease the risk of dying to fall damage.\nChorus fruit.\nIt is extremely useful to have because the shulkers inflict Levitation, eat the Chorus fruit to instantly teleport to the ground or any hard surface.\nPotion of Slow Falling.\nThis can also be useful as you can actually control where you fall when getting inflicted with Levitation or accidentally dropping off the edge, as well as taking no damage when hitting the ground. If you fell off the edge, you must drink it quickly. If you don't think you can drink it that quick, use the water bucket. Splash potions of slow falling can work better since you can use them quicker. However, they have shorter duration, and if you fall off the edge, you can't use it because it won't effect you until it hits the ground. But both counterparts are useful, bring at least six.\nEnder Chest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Chest\"&gt;Ender Chest&lt;/a&gt; is where you put your most important items. It links with all other ender chests in the world. So if you die, all of your important stuff will be accessible (Except for hardcore mode) if you have another ender chest placed at your base(There is one at the city).\nEnder Pearls.\nEnder pearls will help you teleport away from danger or to new places. Bring at least a stack and if you run out, then you can kill endermen to get more.\nBlocks to Build With.\nYou should bring blocks that you can use to block up rooms or tower or build bridges. You don't have to bring them, because of end stone everywhere. Mining purpur blocks around the end city can also help. Keep in mind that you can bridge double the distance by crafting end stone into &lt;a href=\"End%20Stone%20Bricks\"&gt;end stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s. Or bring extra wood: a stack of logs converts to 8 stacks of slabs!\nCrafting Table.\nA must is a crafting table. There is no wood in the End so you cannot create things that you may need.\nOther Items.\nOther items and blocks that you should bring in preparation for defeating an end city are an anvil, a map, and a carved pumpkin.\nThe journey.\nBefore finding an end city, you must go to the &lt;a href=\"The%20End%23Outer%20islands\"&gt;outer islands&lt;/a&gt;. Between the central island and the outer islands is 1,000 blocks of deadly emptiness. Rather than building a 1,000 block long bridge, you can teleport yourself to an outer island by throwing an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt; or building a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; with redstone.\nOnce you arrive at the outer islands, start a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; so you can see which islands you have already explored. Apply a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt; to it so that you'll know where you are. Save the coordinates of your end gateway portal so that you don't get lost.\nTo cross a gap between islands, build a bridge, &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; as you go to avoid falling into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. Ender pearls can also do fine. Don't worry about them falling into the void, because they won't teleport the player if this happens. However, be very careful to not let them hit the sides of islands, as you will be teleported over the void, and it is very hard to save yourself from losing all your gear, and possibly valuable loot. This is more of a problem when traveling large distances. Try not to do this too much, as this will cost you ender pearls (though you can easily gain more by killing endermen if you run low).\nIt is recommended to bring an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; in case you find valuable items in the city, although some cities generate with ender chests in them, so you can just steal those ender chests.\nThere are much faster ways of finding end cities than going from island to island, like using websites such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//chunkbase.com\"&gt;Chunkbase&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you already have &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s, you can simply fly around to find end cities. If you run out of them, try to land on an island or you will slowly fall into the void, unless you throw an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; onto an island.\nHazards.\nOne is not likely to get lost in an end city, as down always leads out and up always leads in. However, it may be helpful to mark which towers have already been explored. A simple way to accomplish this is to break all the &lt;a href=\"end%20rod\"&gt;end rod&lt;/a&gt;s you see as you explore so that you know that you only need to go to the towers with end rods. \nYou will see that there are few &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; in the cities. Instead, the main hazards in end cities are &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s and falling. To stay safe, bring &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, preferably a full set of diamond/netherite armor with &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; such as protection and feather falling, as well as &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s to teleport if you fall. &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;s are also helpful, because they can block shulker bullets.\nAvoiding falls.\nEnd city towers are relatively empty. They are 3x3 tubes with blocks only on the edges, not the corners. Because of the emptiness, it is easy to fall when jumping up a step. Place blocks in the corners to complete the staircase.\nFighting shulkers.\nWhenever you see a &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;, wait until it opens. Then, hit it repeatedly with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or use the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s to damage it from some distance away. Tipped arrows such as Arrow of Poison and Arrow of Harming are recommended because they can do more damage. Deflect or destroy its bullets if necessary. &lt;a href=\"Firework\"&gt;Firework&lt;/a&gt;s can also be an effective weapon against these shulkers.\nIf you get hit with a bullet, you will also be inflicted with the &lt;a href=\"levitation\"&gt;levitation&lt;/a&gt; status effect but you shouldn't panic as there are a few methods to overcome the effect. See below for different methods you can use to avoid levitating too high:\nIf the shulker teleports out of sight, the battle is essentially complete because the shulker cannot attack anymore. If you happen to encounter the same shulker later, you can finish it off and collect the &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20Shell\"&gt;shell&lt;/a&gt;.\nShulkers may appear in inconvenient places, such as rooftops, outside walls, and even the undersides of platforms. To get to these shulkers, &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar jump&lt;/a&gt; to the shulker, or descend using &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;. Try to shoot the shulker only if it opens otherwise the arrow will not deal any damage. If you get hit, place blocks and as you go up, and make sure you are directly over your pillar. You can also break the shulker's support block, thus forcing it to teleport, hopefully to a better location. \nShulkers can help you get up some end city watchtowers quickly. If you want to get up the top of a end city tower and don't want to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar jump&lt;/a&gt; or use a ender pearl you can go provoke some shulkers so they can give you the levitation effect and you quickly go to the center of the tower, float up, and arrive at your desired destination. Make sure you press \"Z\" on your keyboard to see how long the levitation effect can last, and before the effect runs out quickly go to an &lt;a href=\"End%20Rod\"&gt;end rod&lt;/a&gt; to prevent falling down. Using this way to get up the tower isn't 100% safe, but it can be effective if you don't want to risk pillar jumping in case a shulker hits you or accidentally flying the ender pearl to somewhere else.\nStructure.\nEnd cities consist of tall skyscraper-like towers constructed out of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone%20bricks\"&gt;end stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;s. An End city may generate as a single tower by itself, or as a sprawling complex of inter-connected towers and pathways branching from a main tower. &lt;a href=\"End%20rod\"&gt;End rod&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s are the only source of light. Many shulkers spawn around the city, and guard its various treasures. Decorative &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s hang at the tops of some towers.\nSeveral types of rooms can be found in an End city, and several different floors, including:\nThere are two types of towers:\nBlueprints.\nSmall Towers.\nTowers are hollow, consisting only of a single &lt;a href=\"Purpur%20Slab\"&gt;Purpur Slab&lt;/a&gt; staircase. Can be placed everywhere on the roof of rooms.\nEach of these stairs are upside-down.\nLarge Tower.\nA Large Tower is three times the diameter of the smaller towers and consist of a treacherous double spiral staircase made of purpur slabs and end rods, as well as housing two shulkers.\nAll of these stairs are upside-down\nSmall rooms.\nSmall rooms have banners hanging on the outside, and a shulker hanging from the ceiling. Must be placed on top of &lt;a href=\"End%20City/Structure/Small%20Tower\"&gt;small tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarge rooms.\nLarge rooms hold complex staircases that often lead up to another tower or a loot room.\nLoot rooms.\nLoot rooms consist of two &lt;a href=\"chests\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; with valuable &lt;a href=\"End%20City%23Loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;; some rooms may have an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; as well as a normal chest.\nEmpty Room.\nEmpty Room acts as the entrance to most End Cities.\nBridge.\nDock.\nDock appears when the bridge is over, substituting the last part of bridge.\nSaving some shulkers.\nAlthough it may be attempting to kill all the shulkers in an end city, ideally you want to intentionally keep some shulkers alive, because they can be useful in their living form. Shulkers can be useful in two cases: for the \"How Did We Get Here?\" advancement, and for building a shulker farm.\n, the hidden advancement \"&lt;a href=\"How%20Did%20We%20Get%20Here\"&gt;How Did We Get Here&lt;/a&gt;?\" requires the player to obtain most obtainable status effects at once, including Levitation. Because shulkers are the only source of the Levitation effect, which only lasts 10 seconds, it is necessary to transport a shulker to the Overworld in close range with sources of other rare effects.\nA more practical use of the shulker is a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20farm\"&gt;shulker farm&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only way to obtain shulker shells and shulker boxes renewably, and is a must-have for long-term multiplayer servers. , the shulkers produced from shulker farms can further be used to construct a &lt;a href=\"mob%20switch\"&gt;mob switch&lt;/a&gt;, which can prevent hostile mobs from spawning elsewhere in the same dimension.\nTo save (and later transport) the shulkers, the best technique is to capture them in &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s. Because they cannot walk like most mobs do, shulkers must be transported in vehicles like boats and &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. Putting them in boats also keeps them from teleporting.\nSpecial rooms.\nWhen exploring end cities, you may find special rooms.\nTreasure room.\nIf a room has chests, simply collect the loot. Some rooms will have an ender chest beside the regular chest. Bring a pickaxe with the silk touch enchantment to pick these up.\nLarge shulker room.\nLarge shulker rooms have a spiral staircase around the edge, but it is much easier to go down than up. An easier way is to pillar jump, killing shulkers as you go. Another way of going up is letting a shulker hit you, use the levitation effect. If you want to try this, make sure that you have a good armor. After killing the shulkers, go down the spiral staircase and collect the shulker loot, or use a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn easy strategy to use is to sit at the top of the stairs leading to the room, looking down, and blocking with your shield. At first, almost every bullet will hit you, but as you float up, more will be caught by the shield. Make sure you keep yourself aligned to the middle of the room, and then land at the top with the loot chests. This strategy is effective because it causes the majority of the shulkers to start fighting each other. Generally speaking, by the time you finish raiding the loot chests, most of the shulkers are either dead or severely weakened.\nIf the room branches out at the top, place &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s along the walls and continue exploring.\nEnd ship.\nBefore going to the ship, make sure you have the &lt;a href=\"%23Fighting%20shulkers\"&gt;necessary equipment&lt;/a&gt; for end cities. In addition, have an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt; (both of which are fairly easy to obtain in the end).\nTo enter, you need to throw the ender pearl onto the roof of the ship or build a one block wide bridge to the ship. Then, you can go inside, and then to the treasure chamber. First, &lt;a href=\"%23Fighting%20shulkers\"&gt;kill&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;. Then collect the &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"chest%20loot\"&gt;chest loot&lt;/a&gt;. \nFinally, go to the bow of the ship (the front), where the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20head\"&gt;dragon head&lt;/a&gt; is. Place blocks around and under the head. Once it is secure, you can mine the head and return to the ground by building a bridge back to the pier, eating chorus fruit, or teleporting using an ender pearl. Alternatively, you can use your elytra to get back to the pier.\nBecause end ships contain extremely rare items, it is recommended to put the items in an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;. If the end city doesn't have one, but you brought an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20pickaxe\"&gt;diamond pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, just mine the &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom of the ship and then you can make an ender chest. Just like the dragon head, mine the purpur blocks around the obsidian and place blocks under the obsidian to prevent the obsidian from falling down. You can also simply mine the obsidian and then jump off the edge of the ship, be sure to place some water on the bottom before you hit the ground. \nTactics.\n&lt;a href=\"Shulker%20shell\"&gt;Shulker shell&lt;/a&gt;s are useful. Keep as many as you can, and using the chests from in the cities, you can create &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es. It is recommended to store stackable loot separately from the non-stackable loot. You may only need one shulker box to store the stackable items, but you will definitely need more than one shulker box for non-stackable loot. If you really would like to go on a spree, you can clear out your ender chest, as these can hold boxes too. Since the chances of death and/or getting lost are so high, it is best to store your loot in an ender chest. Unfortunately, recursive tactics don't work here, as shulker boxes cannot hold shulker boxes. However, the combination of shulker boxes and an ender chest allows for a quick and easy way to get home via the void.though you will lose your exp doing this and it doesn't work on hardcore).\nPost-Exploration.\nAfter looting the end city and killing all the &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, you have many things you can do with it. Using it as a home/base, destroying it, taking all the blocks for future plans or leaving it as it is are a few options.\nTurning it into your base.\nAn end city is a beautiful structure with many towers and maybe an end ship, you can build ladders or a spiral staircase inside the tower (or you use &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;ender pearls&lt;/a&gt; to get up) to get up easily. You can put &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Furniture\"&gt;furniture&lt;/a&gt; inside each tower or different rooms (brewing room, anvil room, tannery room, bedroom, etc.) inside each tower. Adding a gateway or a bridge to the end ship and repairing the ship with &lt;a href=\"Purpur%20Block\"&gt;purpur blocks&lt;/a&gt; (if you broke all the &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the ship) can make the ship look better, cleaner, and prevent you or other players from falling from the hole. Lighting up the island keeps &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; from spawning around the entrance. Make sure to put an ender chest in at least one of the towers so you can access your items in the end from the &lt;a href=\"overworld\"&gt;overworld&lt;/a&gt; note you cannot respawn in the end so dying will be a major setback. \nDestroying the end city.\nThis is not recommended, as blowing up the city wastes time and important resources, a better way is to collect the resources and important blocks before leaving if you don't want the end city as your base or you already have a base somewhere else. The best way of doing this is blowing the city up with &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; since purpur blocks cannot catch fire. Try to pillar jump to the desired block. place TNT, light up the TNT using &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, and jump down using a water bucket or an ender pearl before it explodes, and pillar jump again to another part of the city. Using an ender pearl might not be a good option as you can land somewhere else and fall down the end city. Keep on blowing up the city until it's gone.\nMining the resources and blocks.\nAnother way is to mine all the blocks or important blocks of the end city. This can be done if you start from the top of the city and mining down until you reach the bottom. Keep a few &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20Box\"&gt;shulker boxes&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom in case your inventory is full. Using an highly enchanted diamond or netherite &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, preferably with &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; 1-3 or &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; 1-5 can help you mine the city quicker and with less pickaxes. In case you accidentally fall while mining, keep an &lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; in your hotbar or a &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potion of slow falling&lt;/a&gt; can prevent you from falling and dying. Be careful of &lt;a href=\"Shulker\"&gt;shulkers&lt;/a&gt; hidden in the city that you didn't kill earlier, as they can give you the levitation effect and cause you to rise high and fall down. Keep on mining until the city is gone. \nBuilding a shulker farm.\nAs mentioned above, some shulkers can be intentionally kept alive, and can be used to build a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20farm\"&gt;shulker farm&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most productive shulker farm designs involve the use of &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s, which requires transporting a shulker to the Overworld, as nether portals cannot be built in the End. If you don't want to transport the shulkers, you can choose to build a 1-dimensional shulker farm right at the end city. They are not as fast as portal-based designs, but can still produce more than enough shulker shells for a singleplayer world or a small server."}

Four types of structures are covered in this tutorial:\nLocation with cheats.\n, the command Creative mode (or Survival with cheats enabled) does not distinguish between the four types of temple; the command locates whichever is nearest, no matter what kind of temple it is. It can be a desert temple, jungle temple, a witch hut, or igloo. If you are in one of the biomes where a temple can spawn, there is a better chance that the temple located is one that belongs to that biome.\nIn \"Java Edition\", each temple type has its own separate &lt;a href=\"Commands/locate\"&gt;/locate&lt;/a&gt; commands. The commands are case-sensitive.\nDesert pyramid.\nTo find a &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;, you can either look above ground, or search while mining.\nIf you are underground and you run into a large, square formation of &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, it is a desert pyramid.\nThere is also a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//chunkbase.com/apps/desert-temple-finder\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; that can find desert pyramids for you, in case you don't want to search them yourself.\nWhen attempting to enter the hidden chamber, the player must take care not to step on the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the pit, as the plate is connected to 9 blocks of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; just under the hidden chamber's sandstone floor. The pressure plate is situated directly under the blue terracotta. The TNT explosion is sufficient to kill most players (and may even destroy the player's drops), as well as destroy all four of the chests, including their loot.\nTo avoid the trap, you can dig out one of the blocks orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the center block, and reach the chamber by any of conventional methods. Or, if reached from below, it is possible just to mine the way into the chamber.\nTo see better in the treasure room, it is actually best to destroy the blue terracotta in the upper chamber first. During the day, the light from the sun shines down into the room, reaching into the treasure room if the terracotta is removed. If you are on a multiplayer server, you can rig up the chests to the TNT to get the better of an experienced player.\nThere are a number of ways one can get down into the treasure room:\nAfter reaching the bottom, your first act should be to mine the pressure plate in the center to avoid accidentally triggering an explosion. Don't forget to dig out the TNT after raiding the chests, because they can be useful later.\nJungle pyramid.\nFinding.\nThe dense foliage of &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes tends to block &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s from sight. The easiest way of clearing the path is to burn the foliage with &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, but you don't want to start a forest fire.\nThere is also a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//chunkbase.com/apps/jungle-temple-finder\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; that can find jungle pyramids for you.\nThe command can also be used and it's explained in the desert pyramid section.\nEntering.\nA jungle pyramid is made up of 3 floors. The top 2 floors are just entrances, windows, and walkways - all the treasure, puzzles, and traps are on the bottom floor. There is an entrance already made on the 2nd floor, but sometimes it is buried in the ground. \nIf the entrance is in plain view, it's usually easiest to enter through the entrance. Otherwise, you can either excavate the entrance, or just bust a hole in the wall and go through that way. If hardly any of the structure is visible, it may be best to go through the roof. It is strongly recommended to enter on the 2nd or 3rd floor and make your way down, so that when you enter the building, &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s shooting at you is not the first thing you must deal with.\nOnce you've entered, make sure to kill any monsters inside and light up everything with &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. When doing this on the ground floor, be careful not to step on any of the tripwires.\nPuzzle.\nIn each jungle pyramid, there is a puzzle, composed of a set of levers on the lower level. When the levers are flipped into the correct positions, a block on the middle level of the building is removed from the floor, and a small room with a chest inside is revealed.\nTrap.\nWhen attempting to open the chest, the player must take care not to step on the two &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt;s in the middle of the hall. One tripwire is in the middle hall and the other is in front of the chest. It looks like mossy cobblestone, but hidden behind some vines is a dispenser filled with arrows. The dispenser fires when the tripwire is stepped on or broken without &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;. If the player can't break it, hugging the wall on the right causes the arrow to fly harmlessly past the player. \nDestroy the tripwires and dispensers to prevent the trap from activating. Grab the arrows in the dispenser. You can also destroy the entire mechanism, which is a good source of redstone in the early game. Take the chest.\n\"Tip: A good way to locate a tripwire is by running your mouse cursor over the floor, and it is highlighted when pointed at.\"\n\"Tip: When destroying the tripwire arrow trap, destroy the tripwire hooks first before destroying the string to avoid triggering the dispenser to fire.\"\nIgloo.\nFinding.\n&lt;a href=\"Igloo\"&gt;Igloos&lt;/a&gt; generate in &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Tundra\"&gt;Snowy Tundra&lt;/a&gt; biomes and appear as a roughly spherical mound of snow with ice for windows and an entrance. They may be hard to find because they are made of the same block as the terrain.\nLooting.\nInside, there is a &lt;a href=\"Bed\"&gt;Bed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Table\"&gt;Crafting Table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Furnace\"&gt;Furnace&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Torch\"&gt;Redstone Torch&lt;/a&gt;, necessities for starting players. Take those things and place a torch in the igloo to light it up. In 50% of all igloos, there is a basement under the carpet. Dig out the carpet to find the trapdoor. If there is no trapdoor, you can leave. Inside the basement under the trapdoor, there is a cauldron filled 2/3 with water/&lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion\"&gt;Splash Potion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Brewing%20Stand\"&gt;Brewing Stand&lt;/a&gt; with Splash Potions of Weakness, a chest with basic loot and a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Apple\"&gt;Golden Apple&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villagers&lt;/a&gt; (one of them is zombified), and a cobweb for string. If you want to start a village, cure the zombie villager with the available supplies and bring the two villagers to the surface using a &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt; or a spiral staircase, and set up a village for them (more about that &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creating%20a%20village\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). You can also kill the zombie villager and take the golden apple and potion for yourself if you don't want to start a village. The cauldron also has 2 potions of weakness in it, so bring two glass bottles to get the potions. Be sure to mine the brewing stand, cauldron, and flower pot after raiding, because they are useful later. Remember to use a pickaxe or it drops nothing.\nWitch hut.\nFinding.\nWitch huts generate in Swamps and are a small house made of spruce wood with no door and a front porch. They are small and can be difficult to find.\nLooting.\nYour first step is to kill any witches that have spawned. Then, go inside and place a torch to light it up. Take the cauldron, crafting table, and the flower pot because they are useful. You can also tame the cat and bring it back to your base, or if you don't have raw fish then you can grab a lead and tie the cat to the fences on the windows.\nAftermath.\nAfter raiding a temple, there are many things you can do with it, such as making it into a home, destroying it, mining it for extra resources, or simply leave. Here on some suggestions:\nThese structures are nice looking and can be used to make a house. The desert temple is large enough to provide a long-term base, but the other 3 have to be expanded to make a large enough base. You can transform the structures to make them suitable for your needs. Include crafting tables, furnaces, enchanting room, brewery, and any other decorative rooms, such as kitchen, living room, or bedroom. For the desert temple and igloo, you can expand the lower chamber to add farms, mines, storage, or whatever you prefer. For the witch hut, you should redesign it into a larger base, and use the original structure bounding box to make a witch farm. If you want this structure to be your main base, and you have expanded it enough, consider adding villagers for a villager trading hall and large scale farms, such as crop farms, tree farms, cobblestone/stone/basalt generators, nether access, etc. Tip: The desert temple's 1st floor, above the treasure chamber, has many 1 wide slots, and those slots can be repurposed for a villager trading hall. You should also take advantage of the natural resources. In deserts, there is sand, dead bush, and cactus. There is jungle wood, bamboo, cocoa beans, pandas in jungles, snow in snowy tundra, and lily pads, blue orchids, slime, and clay in swamps.\nAside from the loot, these structures contain resources that you can get. For the desert temple, you get sandstone related blocks, terracotta, and the TNT in the treasure chamber. In jungle temples, there is cobblestone and mossy cobblestone. In the treasure floor, you can get redstone components, such as pistons, sticky pistons, dispensers, tripwire hooks, string, repeaters, and redstone dust, which can save you some redstone when building redstone contraptions. In the igloo, there is not many useful items, aside from the redstone torches, ice, bed, crafting table, furnace, cauldron, brewing stand, and the villager and zombie villager. The witch hut is almost useless as it only has a bit of wood. The only thing worth taking is the cauldron."}

{"id": "26132", "revid": "24559495", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26132", "title": "Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; is one of the two &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Boss%20mobs\"&gt;bosses&lt;/a&gt; in \"Minecraft\", the other being the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. She lives in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, and is usually considered the final boss of the game. The ender dragon is a highly anticipated boss to fight, as her downfall grants the player easier access to the End's &lt;a href=\"The%20End%23Outer%20Islands\"&gt;outer islands&lt;/a&gt; via an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;. It also activates the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; and allows the player to view the game's &lt;a href=\"credits\"&gt;credits&lt;/a&gt; and return to the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment checklist.\nDefeating the dragon requires a lot of preparation, as the only way back from the End is by either killing the dragon or by dying. Make sure to have everything in your inventory before jumping through the portal!\nHere is a list of items that can be useful to take with you:\nSword.\nThe &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; (ideally diamond or netherite) is used to damage the dragon on its perch as she is immune to arrows at this time. A secondary use is for provoked &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchanting the sword is highly recommended. Sharpness is useful for increasing damage to both the dragon and endermen. While &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; is ineffective against the dragon, it is helpful against endermen. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; makes endermen more difficult to deal with since they teleport upon taking damage for every &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Fire%20damage\"&gt;fire tick&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; does not help you with the fight but enhances &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; drops.\nAxe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; (also ideally &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt;) may deal more damage, but it isn't generally recommended in either &lt;a href=\"version\"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt;. , this is because of its pretty slow &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Attack_cooldown\"&gt;recovery&lt;/a&gt;.\nBow.\nThe &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; should be the player's main weapon; both for destroying the &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, and against the dragon while it is flying through the air. You should bring two to three stacks of arrows or the &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, though with enough practice you can get by with far less.\nIf you get the chance to collect some &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;s in your travels, it's a good idea to hang on to them until you either get Infinity or the means to craft or buy a large quantity of arrows from fletcher villagers. If you reach the end portal with only limited ammunition, you can save your arrows for the dragon, and use &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy most if not all the end crystals. Prior target practice is always a plus, though the rapid rate of snowball throwing can make up for inaccuracy if you brought enough. Thrown &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;s, and even &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, can be used the same way against end crystals, but the point is to use something easier to obtain than arrows, not harder. Pearls, though valuable, do teleport you to the top of the obsidian tower after destroying the end crystal, if that is where you want to be, assuming you don't miss and teleport to somewhere you don't want to be.\nHaving the &lt;a href=\"Power\"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on your bow greatly increases damage against the dragon, so it can come in handy. You may need poison to throw at the dragon.\nIf you get the chance to collect a supply of &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, you can craft arrows into &lt;a href=\"spectral%20arrow\"&gt;spectral arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. While this makes no difference against the ender dragon or end crystals, you end up with twice as much ammo.\nCrossbow.\nIf the player does not want to use a bow, a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; is a great alternative. The advantages of a crossbow are that it has a longer range and can inflict more damage than a regular bow. However, a crossbow cannot be enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, so it is possible to run out of arrows while using it. In addition, crossbows cannot be enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Power\"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; unlike bows, making the former deal less damage per shot than the latter. On the plus side, with the &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt; enchantment the arrows fired can pass through non-mob entities, so it is possible (although difficult) to destroy multiple end crystals with a single shot. Fireworks are not recommended since they do not destroy the end crystals and don't deal any damage to the ender dragon. Alternatively, &lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; can greatly increase your hit rate while the dragon is circling high around the tops of the towers, where it is usually a waste of arrows to even try with a bow or ordinary crossbow. \nArmor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; has an attack strength of with her head on &lt;a href=\"hard\"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt; difficulty. It is the fifth strongest direct attack of any hostile mob, topped by the &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;. , it is tied with the wither\u2019s dash attack making it the fifth-strongest. Therefore, the player should wear a full set of diamond or netherite &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV. Netherite armor also helps negate the ender dragon's strong knockback because of its natural knockback resistance. Wearing enchanted armor increases your chances of not dying, but it isn't necessary. Wearing an unenchanted full iron set reduces the damage on hard difficulty to about , a diamond or netherite set reduces it to .\nSince one of the hardest damage to avoid during the fight is &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; IV on the player's boots can be critical. &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; is also recommended, because it damages any provoked endermen when they attack the player.\nPickaxe.\nWhen the player enters the End, they might spawn underground, so some kind of &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; is vital to mine through &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; to reach the surface. Having a regular diamond pickaxe is just fine, you can enchant it with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; to dig your way free faster. A pickaxe with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; is necessary to reclaim an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;, though without one, bringing a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and extra &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ender\"&gt;Eyes of Ender&lt;/a&gt; will allow the player to easily recraft it, as it always drops 8 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nAn iron pickaxe (or even stone) is enough if you are not going to mine additional end stone and if you have brought enough building blocks.\nFood/Healing.\nAs you are going to receive a lot of damage from the dragon or the &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, healing items are critical to survive the fight. The higher the difficulty, the more food/healing you are going to need.\nYou should bring at least one stack of food items to prevent starving and allow for quick regeneration.\nAlso, potent &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;healing potions&lt;/a&gt; and extended &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;regeneration potions&lt;/a&gt; can bail you out of low-health scenarios quickly. It is recommended to convert them to splash potions to skip the drinking time.\nPotions.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;s are extremely useful in the fight to enhance the player\u2019s performance. Aside from the already mentioned healing/regeneration potions, here are some more potions to bring to the End:\nEnder pearls.\n&lt;a href=\"Ender%20pearl\"&gt;Ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s are extremely useful to have in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. The player can use them to get up to the tops of tall towers, or if the spawn platform is away from the island, the player can use them so that they don't have to waste their blocks. \nPearls can also be used to save yourself from getting kicked off the island or fall damage. Unfortunately, pearls don't fall faster than the player at most velocities, so throw the pearl straight down around 1 second before you would hit the ground. However, ender pearls cause damage to the player and has a slight chance of spawning an endermite, a hostile mob that deals damage to you on contact.\nIf you get knocked high in the air with a slow falling potion active, you can also use pearls to quickly return to solid ground.\nBlocks.\nBlocks can be useful for climbing up the towers or to pillar up in order to get a better angle to shoot the end crystals. You might also have to bridge over from the spawn platform if you do not have any &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;ender pearls&lt;/a&gt;. Harder blocks, such as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, offer no advantage compared to softer blocks such as &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, since the dragon destroys blocks instantly regardless of their hardness or blast resistance. &lt;a href=\"End%20stone\"&gt;End stone&lt;/a&gt;, which has the additional benefit of being dragon-proof, can also be used for this. It is recommended to use blocks to climb the taller towers and just shoot the &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on the short ones from the ground. However, the player might build to the top of the towers that have &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;cages&lt;/a&gt; around the end crystals. Alternatively, they can throw an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; to get to the top. The player can choose to use blocks or ender pearls to bridge to the central island if they spawned on an obsidian platform outside of the main island.\nAn alternative to blocks is &lt;a href=\"Scaffolding\"&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;, which can be placed even faster and are climbable. However, if the dragon collides with them at a low point, it will cause every piece above that point to break, potentially resulting in heavy fall damage. A good way around this is to wait until the dragon is perched before placing your scaffolding.\nYou should bring several stacks of blocks because mining end stone is slow, especially without a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;.\nLadders.\n&lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt;s can be an alternative to blocks to climb the obsidian pillars as the player does not need to break the ladders to get down. Ladders are generally easier to place down unlike blocks in which case the player must jump every time. Ladders can also be used to prevent fall damage, but this is difficult, and should just be replaced with a water bucket to prevent fall damage.\nWater bucket.\nA &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; is extremely useful to have when the player fights the dragon, and even before the fight begins. It can be used to put out &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; that is encountered while looking for the end portal. In the End, if the player falls off a tower and doesn't have enough ender pearls or slow falling potions, players can try to place a water bucket below their feet just before they land (water bucket MLG). The timing, however, is very tight, and messing up can have potentially fatal results. Water can also help them deal with provoked &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;. If an enderman is pursuing the player, dump the water at their feet (or yours) and the enderman takes damage and teleports away. The water also neutralizes the enderman on Java Edition, causing it to ignore the player again.\nWater buckets are another alternative to get to the top of towers, although this requires a little training.\nIt is also possible to use several water buckets to make a infinite water generator and flood big parts of the island. This gets any endermen out of the way and removes the need for slow falling potions or water bucket MLGs.\nBeds.\nBeds can be extremely useful for dealing large amounts of damage to the dragon. Placing them down when the ender dragon is on the exit portal and blowing them up removes up to 1/5 of the ender dragon's health. Although this is a good strategy, it is extremely dangerous and you have to be careful. The main way to not take damage is going inside the exit portal, placing a bed, putting a block next to that bed and then right-clicking. Doing this negates the damage to you, even without &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt; armor, as the explosion does not go down to hit your legs and the block you placed prevents your head from being hit. However, it is recommended to bring at least one piece of Blast Protection armor as a failsafe, just in case you accidentally leave yourself exposed to the explosion.\nAlternatively, end crystals may be used in place of beds. If you place several end crystals on the portal, wait for the dragon to swoop down and perch on the portal, then shoot the crystals with a bow or throw a egg/snowball at it. The dragon takes the explosive damage, plus 10 extra points of damage if the crystal was destroyed while the dragon is charging from it. This is significantly safer than using beds, and end crystal explosions don't create fires that beds do. However, end crystals are more expensive than beds, and it causes significant damage to the terrain.\nYou can also use a bed to set your spawn point in the Overworld just before you jump through the end portal, which allows you to return quickly in case of death.\nOptional items.\nThere are more items that are useful in the End, but are not needed to beat the fight:\nJourney to the portal.\nAll players begin the ender dragon fight with &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;, because they are needed to locate and activate the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. To make one, you need one &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; and one piece of &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt;. You need to set aside 12, because you need up to 12 to activate the portal, and you also need a few extra eyes to find the stronghold.\nStronghold.\nTo find the stronghold, throw an eye of ender into the air, and it floats upward in the direction of the nearest stronghold. It then falls back to the ground and you can pick it up and throw it again. Note that the eye has a chance of breaking when you throw it, so bring at least 15 eyes to spare. Make sure to go into third person view before throwing an eye so you can see the direction the eye flies in as well as whether it breaks or where it falls in case the eye flies behind you. Follow the ender eyes until they float downward, which indicates that a stronghold is underneath. If the eyes direct you to a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, the stronghold is most likely located under the village's meeting point.\nDig underground to find the stronghold. You might dig into a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; or even a &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;, so it could be difficult to find. Use water to put out any lava that is in the way. Keep exploring the cave or keep digging until you see &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, which indicates that you have found the stronghold. Once you break in, get out your &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es so that you can mark your exit and light up the area. You should also block off dead end passages with cobblestone to avoid getting lost.\nTriangulation.\nAn alternate method for locating strongholds is to use the angles, in which ender eyes move from two different points to mathematically calculate the coordinates of the stronghold. Given the coordinates of two points in the world, (X1, Z1) and (X2, Z2), and the exact angles at which eyes of ender move, A1 and A2 (all of which can be measured from the F3 debug screen), the stronghold is at the following coordinates:\nX = (Z1 - Z2 - X2cot(A2) + X1cot(A1)) / (cot(A1) - cot(A2))\nZ = (X2 - X1 - Z1tan(A1) + Z2tan(A2)) / (tan(A2) - tan(A1)),\nwhere tan(x) is the tangent function and cot(x) is the cotangent. By using this method to find the starting point for searching, it is usually possible to find the stronghold using only three or four ender eyes.\nAccurate positioning.\nA more sophisticated method to find a stronghold is to make use of the exact functioning of the eye of ender, as well as the generation rule of the stronghold. An eye of ender points to the &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; where a spiral staircase, the first room generated in the stronghold, is located. The center of this entrance staircase is always exactly at the chunk coordinates 4, ~, 4, although the eyes of ender leads to chunk coordinates 0, ~, 0 (the northwest corner of the chunk). So if the eye of ender travels downward when standing at the northwest corner of a chunk, the player should go to the 4, ~, 4 chunk coordinates (or one block next to it, so they don't fall down the middle of the staircase) and start digging downward. This method requires a lot of practicing and sufficient understanding of the mechanics, but is so far the least time consuming method to find a stronghold, and is widely practiced within the \"Minecraft\" speedrunning community. Note however that this doesn't apply to bedrock edition as the eye of the ender leads straight to the starting staircase.\nStronghold navigation.\nWhile exploring the hallways of the stronghold, a few techniques can be used to help not to get lost. First, notice the placement of oak and iron &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s. If the door is flush with the wall, the same way it's facing when you place the door between the walls, it means this doorway leads further from the entrance staircase mentioned above. If the door is carved into the wall, that means the doorway leads toward the entrance staircase. So if you enter the stronghold from somewhere other than the entrance staircase, it is recommended that you trace along the carved-in doors until you find a spiral staircase going upward that is not connected to a room above. This is the entrance staircase of the stronghold, and exploration from this point onward becomes much easier. \nA few things to keep in mind when exploring the stronghold:\nPortal room.\nKeep exploring the stronghold's hallways until you find the end portal room. Collect any &lt;a href=\"Stronghold%23Loot\"&gt;chest loot&lt;/a&gt; that you find. As soon as you see the portal room, run in as quick as you can, as an active &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; sits in the broken staircase that leads up to the portal. Kill all the silverfish in the room and destroy the spawner. You can also place a &lt;a href=\"Stairs\"&gt;stone brick stair&lt;/a&gt; in the empty space to complete the staircase, which eases the walk up to the portal. It is also recommended that you quickly turn the lava into obsidian because silverfish could emerge from the blocks beside the lava basin and it could cause you to be engulfed in lava.\nTo activate the portal, simply insert an eye of ender into each &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;portal frame&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the portal frames may already contain an eye. Once all of the portal frames have been filled, the portal activates and emits a loud, dragon-like roar, \"reminding\" that you are about to fight the ender dragon.\nSince the trip to the End is one-way, don't even think about jumping into the portal until you rearrange your inventory so that your hotbar contains the following:\nPut all of the items that you don't need in the fight, such as the loot found in the stronghold, into your ender chest. Pick up the ender chest using your Silk Touch pickaxe. Make sure you are wearing all of the armor, but instead of your helmet, wear the carved pumpkin. It is also recommended that you place a chest with things like: a chestplate (any type), leggings (any type), a shield, and a sword. You can use these items if you die, however if you have the gamerule \"keep inventory\" on, you do not need these. Holding the ender pearls, enter the portal when ready.\nThe fight.\nEntering the End.\nWhen you jump into the portal, you instantly get teleported to the End, giving no time to escape. When you arrive in the End, you spawn on a 5\u00d75 &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;obsidian platform&lt;/a&gt;. The platform usually generates on the surface of the island, so you can just walk off. If it generates underground, dig up to the surface using a pickaxe. If it is away from the island, throw an ender pearl to the island to save your extra blocks.\nIf you are playing on \"Java Edition\", it is strongly advised that you press + as soon as you enter the End, which shows the hitboxes of the endermen and the ender dragon. Because the background color of the End is dark, it can be hard to distinguish endermen from the background, thus the white-colored hitboxes can help you avoid accidentally looking at them. The dragon's hitboxes are also shown, which can help you determine the areas where the dragon can be damaged.\nGet to the center of the island as quickly as possible, and if you see the dragon diving at you, quickly jump out of its way. Drink a slow falling potion in case you get knocked off. Before fighting, you need to do a few things.\nTerrain.\nBecause falling into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; kills you and destroys your gear, you should stay as close to the center of the island as possible, or at least inside the circle of towers. If you get knocked off, you should immediately throw an ender pearl back up. If you are quick enough, and have aimed your shot correctly, it is possible to teleport out of the void and back onto the surface.\nBackups.\nIt is recommended to bring backups with you, because they can deal with the endermen while you are taking on the dragon. They may also clear the area in the middle of the island so that you have more space to move around. &lt;a href=\"Snow%20golem\"&gt;Snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s make the best backup because they have stronger and more effective attacks than tamed &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. The only difference between the two is that iron golems actually attack the endermen, while snow golems merely chase them away. Bring enough materials to spawn at least five golems.\nUntil you have spawned your golems, you should wear a carved pumpkin to avoid the endermen. The best time to spawn them is when the dragon is resting on its perch, when it does not attack you or your golems. You should also spawn them to the sides, in case it releases the dragon's breath.\nAfter the reinforcements are spawned, reorganize your inventory so that your hotbar contains the following:\nAs soon as your inventory is organized properly, quickly take off the pumpkin mask and put on your helmet. Now the showdown with the dragon begins.\nDestroying the end crystals.\nDestroying the &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s is a key part of the battle, because they heal the dragon. With all of the crystals active, the dragon recovers faster than you could ever hope to damage it under normal conditions. It is possible to defeat the dragon while some crystals remain, provided the dragon spends enough time away from them, but it is best to destroy all of them. One end crystal sits atop each &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20pillar\"&gt;obsidian pillar&lt;/a&gt;. There are usually eight to ten towers of different heights arranged in a circle around the empty exit portal. The crystals on the tallest towers may be difficult to see, but the healing beam they emit when the dragon is nearby reveals their locations. Try to destroy a crystal while it is healing the dragon because the dragon takes damage if you do this.\nShooting.\nThe easiest way to destroy the crystals is to shoot them with your bow or crossbow. You should move so that you can see it at least partially, aim your shot just above the crystal from your view, and adjust your aim if needed. When destroyed, the crystal generates a massive &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;. If you cannot see the explosion, you can listen for the explosion sound. You should always shoot the crystals on the shortest towers because they are the easiest to shoot, and if you are using a crossbow you should check how many arrows they have after every shot.\nAgain, if you are playing on \"Java Edition\", + can help you clearly see the bounding boxes of the end crystals, as well as that of your arrows. The hitboxes of crystals are quite a bit larger than their models, meaning you can see their hitboxes at angles where you normally cannot see their models. Being able to clearly see where your arrows landed is also a huge advantage, since you can stand still and adjust your shots, based on the landing sites of previous shots. Always keep your attention on the dragon though, since a charge attack or a dragon fireball can catch you off guard!\nClimbing.\nAttempting to climb to the tops of the towers is extremely dangerous. Even if you build up using a dragon-proof material, such as &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt;, the dragon can easily knock you off while you are climbing. Because of this, it is not recommended to climb the towers until the dragon is perched and you have drunk another slow falling potion. However, it is necessary to get up to the top of the caged towers somehow, because shooting them from the ground is ineffective unless you have the skill to find the gap between the obsidian and iron bars. If you choose to use the method of pillaring up with blocks, place water below so that in the event of you getting knocked off the platform, you can land safely in the water. Additionally, if you use water, and you have brought a Riptide trident, launch yourself into the air and land on the tops of the towers. However, this technique may be unreliable.\nIt is quicker and safer to use ender pearls than building up. One trick to measure your ender pearl shot is to fully charge your bow or crossbow and shoot an arrow just over the top edge of the cage. Throwing an ender pearl at the exact same angle can strike one block below the arrow's trajectory, teleporting you to the side of the cage. Break into the cage with your pickaxe, and wait for the dragon to fly away, since it cannot break the iron bars. If you have strong enough armor (ideally with &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt;) and are affected by &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt;, hit the caged crystal with your sword. Otherwise, build a safety platform few blocks away from the crystal and shoot it with your bow or crossbow. Alternatively, you can use &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the crystals with no need to break through the iron bars at all \u2014 simply place one piece of TNT on top of the cage, light it with a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, and then ender pearl back down (or retreat to the safety platform if you built one).\nOnce the caged crystal has been destroyed, don't go back down if you are still on the tower, because some towers are taller than the caged ones. Build a few blocks above the caged tower and shoot the taller ones with your bow or crossbow. If the dragon knocks you off, and you are not affected by &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt;, you should use an ender pearl to break your fall if you didn't start with water. Throw a pearl back to the top of the caged tower and try to shoot the taller ones again. You could also throw a pearl to the tops of the tall towers and destroy the crystals with your sword. If you are on the tallest tower, you can check how many crystals have been destroyed and how many remain. It is also a good spot to snipe the dragon.\nKilling the dragon.\nIf you are not sure that you have destroyed all of the crystals, let the dragon fly away. If you see a healing beam, then there is still a crystal left. Once the last crystals have been destroyed you can start to attack the dragon. You can also swap out your extra blocks with your water bucket, because you do not need the blocks anymore. There are many ways to attack the dragon, but there are many things to watch out for.\nHealing.\nThe dragon has three types of attacks: body attacks, the breath attack, and &lt;a href=\"Ender%20dragon%23Dragon%20fireball\"&gt;dragon fireball&lt;/a&gt;s. The more crystals you have destroyed, the more often the dragon attacks you. It inflicts damage if it hits you with its head on hard mode, but its wings inflict only damage (without armor). The dragon's breath inflicts damage per second. The dragon has an extremely high knockback ability and can throw the player into the air to fatal heights, so they should keep drinking their slow falling potions when they run out. They make the player immune to all fall damage.\nKeep track of health at all times. If you take at least damage at a time, hide behind a tower and eat a golden apple. You should use your healing potions if you're on the brink of death to recover instantly. If the totem of undying in your hand goes off, and you have another totem, quickly throw it in your off hand and resume fighting immediately.\nDragon's breath.\nIt is extremely useful to collect the &lt;a href=\"dragon%27s%20breath\"&gt;dragon's breath&lt;/a&gt; during the fight because it can be used to make &lt;a href=\"lingering%20potion\"&gt;lingering potion&lt;/a&gt;s, which can help if you want to fight the dragon again, or if you want to fight the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; (if you chose to fight the dragon first).\nTo collect the dragon's breath, wait for the dragon to perch and do its breath attack or shoot a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20fireball\"&gt;dragon fireball&lt;/a&gt;, either of which puff out into lingering purple clouds. The only difference is that the dragon's breath comes instantly from the breath attack, whereas you must wait for the fireball to slam into the ground. To collect it, simply hold out an &lt;a href=\"Glass%20bottle\"&gt;empty bottle&lt;/a&gt; and scoop up the clouds in the same way you would fill a bottle with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. However, you should avoid making contact with the clouds, because the clouds cause damage. Armor cannot protect you from damage from the dragon's breath, because it counts as &lt;a href=\"Damage%23magic%20damage\"&gt;magic damage&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon's breath is stackable, so you should collect as much as possible. Additionally, the leftover bottles from your used potions can increase your collection.\nAttacking.\nWhile the dragon is flying you can shoot it with your bow or crossbow. However, the dragon is difficult to shoot because it can fly fast, and shots miss if they don't line up properly. It is recommended to shoot at a spot in the dragon's flight trajectory, which is the area in front of it, and it flies far enough to get hit by the arrow. Try to mainly shoot it in the head because the dragon takes the most damage on its head.\nThe more crystals you have destroyed, the more often the dragon dives at the portal. When it's hovering over the portal, it is immune to arrow damage, and you are forced to use your sword. Here, get as many critical hits as possible, which deal more damage, and it is possible to get more critical hits when you have &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt;. It is also suggested to drink a strength potion because you can inflict more damage using the strength the potion provides.\nAfter a few minutes, the dragon's behavior changes. It dives at the portal once for every circle, so you should make sure that you always have the strength from the potions when the dragon perches. Remember the pattern of the dragon\u2019s attacks, so that your attacks can be efficient for the rest of the battle.\nOnce damage has been inflicted, the dragon dies and drops four rare rewards.\nAlternative Strategy.\nA alternative approach (for Java edition only) to defeating the ender dragon is based on trapping her in downflowing water while she is attempting to perch. This allows the player to easily attack the dragon until she dies, for example, by using a bow.\nThe rewards.\nWhen killed, the dragon floats upward and disintegrates, with bright purple beams of light erupting from her body. She then explodes and causes a sound effect to play that gradually fades away into the infinite darkness of the End, leaving almost no trace that it was ever there. Four rewards then appear.\nExperience.\nAfter the dragon disappears, &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs rain from the sky. These orbs can take the player from level 0 to level 68, which is worth 12,000 experience points. Some of the orbs may fall into the portal, so run a few laps around the portal and then sneak on the rim of the portal to grab some more. Since it takes progressively more experience to gain a level at higher levels, the player gains enough to make over ten level 30 enchantments. The best time for the player to enchant extra equipment is as soon as they go back home, in case they die and lose all of the precious levels they have earned (unless you have a lot of experience farms to get more levels than that).\nDragon egg.\nThe second reward is the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;. It sits on top of the portal when it first appears. However, it cannot be broken directly, as the egg teleports if the player attempts to do so. \nInstead, touch the egg once and let it teleport to a block of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt;. If the player can't find it, follow the purple teleportation &lt;a href=\"Particles%23Types%20of%20particles\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s. To pick up the egg, place a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; two blocks underneath it, and break the end stone block it is sitting on. Since the egg obeys the law of gravity, it falls onto the torch and break as a collectible item. If you forget to bring a torch with you, take one from the exit portal frame or use any other transparent/half block like a button, slab or pressure plate.\nAlternatively, if the player has a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; and a source of redstone (such as a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;), place the piston facing the egg and power it with the redstone source. The egg still breaks as a collectible item. To prevent the egg from falling into the portal, cover the portal with blocks.\nIf the player uses either of these strategies, they obtain the dragon egg successfully. It currently has no use other than as a trophy to show that the player has defeated the ender dragon, but it can serve as a beautiful decoration or an addition to a trophy room at the player\u2019s base.\nEnd gateway portal.\nPerhaps the biggest reward of defeating the ender dragon is the &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway%20portal\"&gt;end gateway portal&lt;/a&gt;, which generates after the dragon dies. The player cannot walk through it normally because it is too narrow to walk through. The easiest way to enter it is to throw an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; through it, but it is also possible to sprint-swim through it in if the player has a water bucket or fly through it with an &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; if the player already has one. In &lt;a href=\"Village%20and%20Pillage\"&gt;Village and Pillage&lt;/a&gt;, the player can also use &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s to crawl through the portal. This portal is sometimes considered the only reason to need to fight the dragon, because it gives the player easy access to the End's &lt;a href=\"The%20End%23Outer%20Islands\"&gt;outer islands&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only place where the player can find &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chorus%20tree\"&gt;chorus tree&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20head\"&gt;dragon head&lt;/a&gt;. Without the end gateway, they are about 1,000 blocks away from the main fighting area against the dragon (in any direction).\nNote that you can live in the outer islands and just wander around, and you can find a lot of treasure. If you go too far and you want to get back, you can jump into the void as long as you have \"keep inventory\" on.\nExit portal.\nSince the fight takes place in the End, the most important reward is the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only way back home. It appears all the time, but only activates when the dragon is killed. The portal looks like a fountain made of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es on the sides, and the \"water\" of the fountain is made of the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;portal block&lt;/a&gt;s that returns the player back home.\nWhen the player jumps into the portal, they are treated to the &lt;a href=\"End%20Poem\"&gt;End Poem&lt;/a&gt;, which tells them that they have basically \"completed\" the game. Even though it can be skipped, it is still highly recommended to read it. The player then &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;the Overworld&lt;/a&gt; at the respawn point, which can be the world spawn point, a &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;, or the last &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; the player had slept in. The player can then safely return to base.\nThe rematch.\nTo have a rematch with the ender dragon, the player must respawn it using end crystals. To make one, the player needs seven pieces of &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"ghast%20tear\"&gt;ghast tear&lt;/a&gt;. The player must go to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; to get some of these materials.\nTo respawn the dragon, place four end crystals one on each side of the exit portal. The crystals that are placed instantly deactivate the portal, shoot beams at the tops of the towers, and reset the crystals and cages on the towers. Afterward, all of the crystals shoot beams into the sky in harmony. The player hears an extremely loud roar and see a massive explosion, which resurrects the dragon to begin the fight again.\nTo respawn the dragon, place the end crystals in the configuration shown in the image below.\nSubsequent dragons drop less experience and do not drop another dragon egg, but it is still useful because it is the only way to obtain more dragon's breath. Also, it creates another end gateway, which can be used to find more end cities more easily, but the player must prepare the same equipment all over again. However, if the player does want to fight again, the player can use new equipment that could not be used in the first battle."}
