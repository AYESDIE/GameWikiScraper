The official name for the update, the \"Exploration Update\", was revealed on September 24, 2016, during the Opening Ceremony at &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202016\"&gt;MINECON 2016&lt;/a&gt;. During the \"Casual Chat with Jens\" panel at MINECON, he suggested that the name \"Expedition Update\" was more suitable to the theme of the update compared to the \"Exploration Update\".\nThe main features of the update were announced on the second day of MINECON 2016, during \"The Minecraft 1.11 Change Log\" on September 25, 2016. However, snapshots for the update initially began around two months prior to the reveal of the main features, with the features being added in a snapshot just a few days after MINECON. \nMojang released the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.11-pre1\"&gt;first (and only) pre-release&lt;/a&gt; for the Exploration Update on November 8, 2016.\nTrailer.\nA trailer documenting some of the Exploration Update's features was released on Mojang's official YouTube channel on November 14, 2016. The trailer was made by Mojang themselves instead of Hat Films, who have made updated trailers and videos for Mojang in the past."}

Journeyman-level cartographer villagers sell woodland explorer maps for 14 emeralds and a compass.\n, if the cartographer is in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, either spawned or transported, the trades for the map do not unlock. However, , the cartographer trades for the map are unlocked, but the purchased map shows the same layout as in the corresponding dimension and shows no destination structure, but if cartographer trades are unlocked in an old world type (prior-1.11.0), the game stops ticking.\nIn \"Java Edition\", each cartographer sells its own unique explorer map that points to a different location than other cartographers. Purchasing another explorer map from the same cartographer results in the same explorer map. In Bedrock Edition, a cartographer sells an explorer map that points to the nearest location, regardless of whether it is explored or previously mapped by another cartographer.\nChest loot.\nTreasure maps, in contrast to explorer maps, generate in underwater ruins or in shipwrecks.\nUsage.\nLocating structures.\nThere are three types of explorer maps: woodland, &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, and buried treasure. The maps differ from a normal map, in that it shows the area's land-water outline, with an orange striated (striped) texture for water, and the blank map texture for land. The maps show a section of land that contains a &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monument\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; respectively. This may not be the nearest such &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. The structures are displayed as a small icon. If the player icon is smaller than it would be on a normal map, that means the player is a great distance away. When the player is less than 1027 blocks away from the map border, the icon returns to the proper size. When the player reaches the map's area of land (512\u00d7512), the &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; fills in like a normal map.\nThe basic functions of a buried treasure explorer map are similar to that of the other two. However, instead of showing the structure icon on the map, it shows a red X instead. The &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; structure is located on the same X and Z coordinates as the middle of the X (the player marker may need to be aligned with the bottom of the middle 2\u00d72 pixel square of the X). To locate the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; spot, hold the treasure map with both hands, not in the offhand slot.\nCloning.\nThe parts of the world that have already been explored and mapped are copied, and newly explored areas appear on both instances. In Creative mode, cloned explorer maps can be obtained by pick blocking on the explorer map displayed on &lt;a href=\"item%20frames\"&gt;item frames&lt;/a&gt; (the map needs to be out of the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s inventory when using pick block, or else that map moves into the active hotbar slot).\nData values.\nMetadata.\n, the item &lt;a href=\"Data%20value\"&gt;Data value&lt;/a&gt; distinguishes explorer maps from one another:\nItem data.\nAn explorer map differs from a map in that its codice_1 tag is set, which includes a codice_2 and a codice_3; also its codice_4 list includes an entry for its target monument, mansion or buried treasure. Its &lt;a href=\"Map%20item%20format%23map_%26lt%3B%23%26gt%3B.dat%20format\"&gt;map item entry&lt;/a&gt; is identical to that of a normal map, except that by the time the player sees it, its codice_5 byte array is pre-filled with explorer maps' characteristic land-water boundary lines and water shading.\nIt should be noted that this additional data is stored in the Cartographer's NBT data and in the inventory item's NBT data, and not in the map file (e.g. &lt;samp&gt;map_0.dat&lt;/samp&gt;). If the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; were to use the command to give themselves a map with the same map ID as an existing explorer map, it would still have the Ocean Monument or the Woodland Mansion icon on the map, but it would simply be named \"Map\" instead of, for example, \"Ocean Explorer Map\"."}

{"id": "5450", "revid": "56508579", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5450", "title": "Explosion", "text": "An explosion is a physical event, generally destructive, that can be caused by several different circumstances. It can destroy nearby &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s, propel and damage nearby &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and cause one or more &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;s under correct circumstances. Explosions produce a \"shockwave\" &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nMultiple close explosions may propel objects further, but have no cumulative effect on the destruction of a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; - for example, no amount of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; will destroy a block of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, even if it all explodes at once. This is because explosion &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to blocks is evaluated individually (per explosion), and blocks' blast resistance do not become \"weakened\" from previous explosions.\nThe propulsion effect of explosions is often used for &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/TNT%20Cannons\"&gt;TNT cannons&lt;/a&gt;, and can also be used to shoot out gravity affected blocks.\nExplosion strength.\nDespite doing &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wind%20charge\"&gt;wind charge&lt;/a&gt;s do not destroy terrain and as such are not counted as conventional explosions.\n&lt;a href=\"Lab%20table\"&gt;Lab table&lt;/a&gt;s sometimes perform a non-terrain-damaging explosion when creating &lt;a href=\"garbage\"&gt;garbage&lt;/a&gt; item.\nEffect.\nModel of block destruction.\nAn explosion can destroy nearby &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s. Its blast effect is evaluated independently on many explosion rays originating from the explosion center, as shown in the right figure.\nFrom the above process, the following results can be deduced (where formula_1 is the function):\nDropping blocks.\nDestroyed blocks have a chance of dropping as collectible resources, where \"p\" is the explosion power. So, blocks destroyed by an (uncharged) &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;'s explosion have a chance of dropping. However, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"decorated%20pot\"&gt;decorated pot&lt;/a&gt;s always drop from explosions, though the &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s may be destroyed by subsequent explosions. In addition, explosions from &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"minecarts%20with%20TNT\"&gt;minecarts with TNT&lt;/a&gt; cause a 100% drop rate.\n, the drop chance of blocks in explosions can be customized via three &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt;s:\nThe precious blocks listed above always drop from explosions, regardless of the values of these game rules.\nInteraction with entities.\nAn explosion has different effects on &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s. Entities are damaged and propelled by an explosion if within its damage radius of 2 \u00d7 power. Note that the \"damage radius\" is different from the blast radius of explosion effect on blocks.\nFrom the above process, the following results can be deduced: \nCalculation of explosion exposure.\nThe approximation algorithm has sampling error that results in directional asymmetry of propulsion. For example, a typical &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/TNT%20Cannons\"&gt;TNT cannon&lt;/a&gt; has maximum range in the west direction partly because the primed TNT has largest sampled exposure in that direction.\nCausing fire.\nIf the explosion has the ability, it randomly starts fires in \u2153 of all destroyed &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s that are above &lt;a href=\"opacity\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nProlonged lag.\nIn addition to the initial lag from processing the explosion, which subsides once the explosion has occurred, there can also be a prolonged fallout from an explosion, that consists of dropped &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"liquid\"&gt;liquid&lt;/a&gt; physics, and increased render-complexity of the crater. Technically, the dropped items disappear after 5 minutes, however those 5 in-game minutes may take a long time to process during extreme lag.\nCertain rules and commands can be used to avoid this prolonged lag: setting the game rule codice_1 to false, for instance with , prevent dropped items from being generated by explosions. Also, the command destroys all dropped items.\nBlast resistance.\nThe following table shows blast resistance values for blocks as shown in Minecraft's code. In &lt;a href=\"Add-on\"&gt;Add-on&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, these values are multiplied by 5 when used for the \"explosion_resistance\" value in the \"minecraft:descructible_by_explosion\" component. \n&lt;a href=\"%20edit%20values\"&gt; edit values&lt;/a&gt;\nTypical damage radius.\nThe &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; receives &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, if within these radii of a 100% exposure ground 1 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, 2 blocks, or 4 blocks of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; explosion, with the amount of damage labeled on each circle in the figures below."}

These blocks include:\nAlthough it has the same appearance as its corresponding block and is also affected by gravity, the &lt;a href=\"TNT%23Behavior\"&gt;primed TNT entity&lt;/a&gt; is a different kind of &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; than the falling block entity.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Commands\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; are enabled, falling block entities can be spawned using the &lt;a href=\"Commands\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; . By tweaking the codice_1 NBT tag, it is possible to summon a falling block entity that normally does not fall as a block, such as &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, although it has the same behavior as a naturally spawned falling block.\nBehavior.\nA falling block continues falling until it lands on another block with a solid top surface. If it lands with the bottom center of its &lt;a href=\"Hitbox%23Entity\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt; in a replaceable block (&lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, etc.), and the block below can support it (i.e. not a replaceable block), then the falling block returns to its block state. Otherwise, it breaks and drops as an &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike most other &lt;a href=\"Entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, falling blocks are affected by &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s, can be launched by a moving &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;, can be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, can be slowed down by &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s, and can slide down the side of a &lt;a href=\"Honey%20Block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;. However, they do not bounce on a stationary slime block and can neither be pushed nor slowed down by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalling blocks pass through most entities without colliding with them, although projectiles such as &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s bounce off them. They do not have &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be attacked and do not take &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. They are also immune to all &lt;a href=\"Effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBy default, a falling block that has existed for more than 600 ticks (30 seconds) destroys itself and drops as an item. This can be changed by modifying the entity's NBT value. &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20block\"&gt;Suspicious block&lt;/a&gt;s also drop themselves after falling for more than 30 seconds, making this the only way to obtain suspicious blocks in Survival.\nCommands such as can change the moving and facing directions of a falling block, although there are no in-game mechanics that can alter a falling block's facing direction. They can be removed with the command.\nSome falling blocks, like anvils and pointed dripstone, deal damage to players and mobs in the same block space where they land. The damage is dealt only on landing, and is not dealt to players and mobs that collide with them in mid-air. A falling block that deals damage can be &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;ed if its tag is set to . The amount of damage dealt per block fallen can be customized via the tag, and the maximum damage dealt can be customized via the tag.\nSounds.\nSome falling blocks produce sounds when they land.&lt;br&gt;"}

The effects vary depending on which noise generator breaks (for traditional Far Lands, \"low noise\" and \"high noise\" are jointly responsible), as well as the player's distance on each axis (the \"Edge Far Lands\" refer to when noise breaks on only one axis, the \"Corner Far Lands\" on two, and the \"Vertex Far Lands\" on three).\nOther noise generators are capable of breaking down. Selector noise, a noise generator which determines whether low noise or high noise is used at a given position in the world, breaks down 80 times further than low and high noise by default, giving rise to what is known as the \"Farther Lands\".\nA full list of noise generators known to break down and give rise to their own unique effects is as follows. Note that it assumes that the X and Z axes are identical, and ignores the Y axis; in many cases, the Y axis has a different value from the X and Z axes, whereas in other cases the noise generator is entirely 2D.\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Noise generator\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Breaks down at...&lt;br&gt;(32-bit)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Version range\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n!

The following is a list of things which are commonly misattributed to being a product, effect or even type of the Far Lands, despite not being so.\nThe position where the world appears to render is considerably offset at the point where the Far Lands begin in Beta 1.7.3 and earlier, with a magnitude of one block, with the player appearing to be at the edges and corners of blocks at all times.\nHowever, \"this is purely a floating-point bug\", and exists whether or not the Far Lands themselves do. This can be demonstrated by the following:\nThis is also true of every other precision loss bug, especially those which were not fixed in Beta 1.8 and persisted into later versions after the Far Lands were removed in said version, demonstrating that they are two completely different things which are only associated with each other due to happening at high distances.\nThe Stripe Lands, a mostly Bedrock Edition-exclusive phenomenon which can only be seen in Java Edition through extensive modding, are another example of floating-point precision loss, and are not a terrain bug.\n\"Fake\" chunks at the world boundary are another anomaly that happens at high distances. Occurring considerably past the Far Lands' beginning, they are commonly said to be a \"part\" or \"layer\" of the Far Lands. While they are among the interesting effects which can be experienced when moving high distances from the world origin, their occurrence is a distinct phenomenon, and, to an extent, actually intended. This is further reinforced by them being at a rather round number (32 million), rather than the seemingly overall arbitrary 12,550,824 of the Far Lands, or power-of-two values such as 16,777,216 where precision loss worsens.\nIt is likely that them occurring past the Far Lands is accidental. Their original positioning at 32,000,000 was likely done to make the Far Lands, then at 33,554,432, inaccessible without modifying the game. However, when terrain generation was redone, the Far Lands moved closer to their familiar position of 12,550,824, despite the boundary remaining at 32,000,000, meaning that the Far Lands were once more accessible, with the boundary no longer making them inaccessible as intended; it is likely that Notch would not have thought to check this at the time due to the distances being ludicrous. Fake chunks beginning in Alpha v1.2.0 (as opposed to the void seen in prior versions) are also likely unintentional, probably arising due to changes in chunk handling for biomes, the Nether, or both, and would have presumably also flown under the radar given their inaccessibility in normal gameplay without external editors.\nWhile the Far Lands themselves are technically a hard limit due to arising from integer overflow, they are treated solely as a terrain phenomenon, and the game still functions fine with them. Integer overflows in other cases such as player position are much more dangerous and much harder to reach, and are considered separately."}

Most farms generate with crops, mostly &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s may also be found.\nIn addition, village farm plots have a 20% chance to generate with &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es planted, and a 10% chance to generate with &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt; planted.\nPost-generation.\nA player may create a working crop farm in any biome in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.

Given sufficient light, &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; or other crops may then be planted on the farmland and grown to maturity for harvesting.\nUse.\nWhile a village farm is a good ready-made source of food, a village is not required for farming crops.

The seeds eventually grow into &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; after a few day-night cycles. Once the crops have matured, they can be harvested and then used for &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, leading livestock, &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; livestock, or &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Breeding\"&gt;breeding villagers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Farmer\"&gt;Farmer&lt;/a&gt; villagers use a farm's &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Job%20site%20blocks\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt;.

The technique is typically used to get &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and other desired items. Specific types of farming are listed below.\nAutomation.\nFarms can be classified as manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. Manual farms rely mostly or solely on the player to harvest and restart the farm. Semi-automatic farms use mechanisms to automatically harvest the farm, but they are manually activated by the player. Fully automatic farms do not rely on the player at all and usually use mobs or more complicated mechanisms.\nThere are other limits to farming regardless of automation:\nMany farms require their &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s to be &lt;a href=\"Tick\"&gt;ticked&lt;/a&gt;;. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, all loaded chunks in the world are ticked, but in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", a chunk must also have a player nearby \u2013 specifically, some player must be within 128 blocks (horizontal distance only) of the chunk's center. This affects most block changes, including &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt; and other crop farms.\nMobs will generally despawn if they do not have a player nearby; details vary by version, but in general mobs \"can\" randomly despawn if no player has been within 32 blocks for at least 30 seconds (sometimes 10 seconds), or if no player is within 128 blocks. In either case, the chunk needs to still be loaded for the despawning process to work. This affects most mob farms, especially those which depend on hostile mobs.\nMany mobs are protected from despawning; by way of summary: \nWithin survival mode, this allows using properly-prepared hostile mobs as part of a farm, e.g., a nametagged zombie in an iron farm.\nExperience farming.\nThe reason to farm experience is to easily enchant items, or repair tools and armor. Many common experience farms require a difficulty above Peaceful, as they require mobs to spawn.\nOther uncommon farms use other ways to gain experience, such as fishing or furnaces.\nSpawner farming involves waiting at an active monster &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; for monsters to spawn. This includes &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that do not spawn naturally without the use of spawners, such as &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThese can be automated with a water pathway transferring the mobs to a convenient collection or killing area.\nA similar system can be used to adapt \"dark-spawn farms\" to experience harvesting: Mobs are funneled into a grinder to soften them up, then a killing chamber where you can take a sword to them without being targeted. There are several considerations here, the hard part is doing them all at once:\nEven in peaceful mode, certain crops can be auto-farmed and directed into an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Automatic%20smelting\"&gt;automated furnace or smoker&lt;/a&gt;. The experience from the smelting is accumulated until the furnace is manually emptied or broken. \nGiven automatic farms for smelting stock, fuel, and disposal, the only real limit is how much time a player is willing to let a furnace collect experience between harvests. A full chest of items contains 1,728 items, which requires 144 minutes (2 hours 24 minutes, over 6 game days) in a smoker, double that in a plain furnace.\nFuel is difficult to supply automatically, but a bamboo farm may be able to keep up. Alternatively, a fuel chest can be loaded with dried-kelp blocks. A chest full of 1,728 items can be smelted by 18 lava buckets, 22 blocks (or 216 pieces) of coal, 288 logs crafted to planks, 87 dried kelp blocks... or \"four\" chests full of bamboo. \nThe smelted result can be collected for use, or discarded.\nFishing provides a steady stream of experience, food, and treasure. Catches include enchanted rods, bows, and books, which can be used directly, combined in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, or converted to experience in a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nFishing initially yields an average of 12 experience points per minute, which Lure III can increase to 28 points/minute.

Patches of farmland are surrounded by &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;spruce trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. They also naturally occur in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPost-generation.\nA player may create a block of farmland by a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; block, &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nFarmland is required to grow eight of the game's types of &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt;.

Farmland is a partial block (15/16th of a block in height) and so mobs cannot spawn on it.\nHydration.\nA farmland block is created dry, and eventually reverts back to &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; if not hydrated and nothing is planted on it.\nFor farmland to become hydrated, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; must be present:\nThe blocks between the farmland block and the water make no difference. Flowing or still water also makes no difference.\nThe rate at which farmland becomes hydrated cannot be changed. Each farmland block within a 9\u00d79 grid of farmland with a single water block in the middle has exactly the same chance of becoming hydrated as a single farmland block in an ocean.\nFarmland can also be hydrated by &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;.\nDifferent types of &lt;a href=\"seed\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt;s grow faster on hydrated farmland than on dry farmland. Hydrated farmland yields a fully developed wheat crop in a little over a single &lt;a href=\"day/night%20cycle\"&gt;day/night cycle&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecay.\nFarmland eventually decays into normal dirt if is dehydrated and nothing is planted in it. Additionally, a farmland block becomes a dirt block, regardless of its state of hydration, if any of the following occur:\nWhen farmland decays, any crops growing on the block are dropped as items, as if they were harvested.\nA &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt; does not turn farmland to dirt when stepping on it, but it does destroy all crops."}

It does not affect falling speed.\nObtaining.\nAt level 30, Feather Falling is one of the rarest enchantments to obtain through an enchanting table. There is only a 2.7% chance for Feather Falling IV to appear on a pair of diamond boots when enchantments that require 30 levels are applied. However, Feather Falling appears much more commonly on an enchanting table at levels slightly lower than level 30. Below is a table with the chances of obtaining Feather Falling on diamond boots through an enchanting table at each level:\nAs seen from the table above, Feather Falling is most common at level 22 when enchanting diamond boots through an enchanting table. Levels 24 and 26 still provide chances of obtaining Feather Falling much higher than that at level 30.\nFeather Falling IV can also be obtained by combining two Feather Falling III enchantments on an anvil, or trading with villagers.\nIn Bedrock Edition, Feather Falling enchantment can be rarely obtained by fishing. Otherwise, it can be earned through enchantment table, loot chests, and trading.\nUsage.\nFeather Falling reduces all forms of fall damage taken, even though fall damage normally ignores &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. This is not limited to falling from a great height either - Feather Falling will reduce the damage taken from thrown &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s or from riding a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; that takes significant fall damage.\nFeather Falling will reduce damage taken from crashing into the ground with an &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, but it will not reduce damage taken from crashing into a wall.\nThe damage formula that Feather Falling uses will reduce fall damage by , up to a maximum of 48% with Feather Falling IV.

However, if combined with multiple Protection enchantments, the damage cap can be reached since Protection also reduces fall damage. In order to reach this cap using only Feather Falling, level VII would be required which is only possible with the use of &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelow is a list of how much fall damage is taken from varying heights when using each level of Feather Falling, with bold values indicating the point at which 10 or more hearts of fall damage would be taken:"}

Using a charged &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or the End also creates fire from the explosion.\nUsage.\nPlacement.\nFire can be placed using &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;. Fire created on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; becomes soul fire.\nWhen placed, a fire burns for a short and randomly determined amount of time. If nothing flammable is adjacent to it, the flames die out. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; that touches fire extinguishes it.\nIt cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.\nBurning entities.\n&lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s and many &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s burn when exposed to fire. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly. While inside a fire block, the fire inflicts &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; at a rate of per half-second unless the player or mob has &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; or a total &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; of 7 or higher. When the player is on fire outside the fire block, they take damage at per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. Soul fire deals &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; at a rate of per half-second, making it more dangerous than normal fire. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the fire (stored in a tag shared by all &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;dropped items&lt;/a&gt; that are in fire briefly catch fire and disappear. This includes the item forms of blocks that would not be flammable if placed, including &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. The only exceptions are these netherite-related items: netherite &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, netherite &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Netherite\"&gt;blocks of netherite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netherite%20scrap\"&gt;netherite scrap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netherite%20ingot\"&gt;netherite ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a mob able to drop &lt;a href=\"Drops%23Mob%20drops\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; dies while on fire, it drops the cooked version of it, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; that is dropped by &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. This also applies to the &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;'s uncommon potato drop; if a zombie dies while on fire and should drop a &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes a &lt;a href=\"baked%20potato\"&gt;baked potato&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; mobs are invulnerable to fire and cannot burn. Exceptions include &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Zoglin\"&gt;Zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s are also invulnerable to fire.\nBurning is not considered a &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; and therefore cannot be cured by &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpread.\nFire spreads over flammable surfaces and can climb up walls, across floors and ceilings, and over small gaps. More precisely, a fire block can turn any &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; block that is adjacent to a flammable block into a fire block. This can happen at a distance of up to one block downward, one block sideways (including diagonals), and four blocks upward of the original fire block (not the block the fire is on/next to). Therefore, if the player is using fire to build a fireplace, caution is needed. Blocks in the way do not prevent fire from igniting blocks above it\u2014so even if the player protects a wooden roof with cobblestone between it and the fire, the fire ignores that cobblestone.\nFire spreads from a still &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; block similarly: any air block one above and up to one block sideways (including diagonals) or two above and two blocks sideways (including diagonals) that is adjacent to a flammable block may be turned into a fire block.\nUnlike normal fire, soul fire cannot spread and does not burn any flammable blocks nearby.\nFire that naturally spreads into a valid &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; frame activates the portal.\nFlammable blocks.\nFire can spread onto and burn away any flammable block (or in the case of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, ignite it). On the other hand, a fire that is not adjacent to any flammable block and not on top of a forever-burning block does not spread, even to another flammable block within the normal range.\nIn the following table, the higher the \"ignite odds\", the more quickly a block catches fire if the fire is available to spread there. The higher the \"burn odds\", the more quickly a block on fire burns away. These are relative values; actual ignite odds and burn time depends not only on these values, but on &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, the age of the fire, the direction of the block relative to the fire, and multiple random values including how long the fire waits between &lt;a href=\"block%20tick\"&gt;block tick&lt;/a&gt;s and further checks based on the previous factors. Fire spread is reduced if tries to spread to a block more two blocks higher than itself. Fire spread is further reduced by 50% if the flammable blocks in a humid biome (&lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;, excluding &lt;a href=\"Jungle%23Jungle%20edge\"&gt;sparse jungle&lt;/a&gt;). \nNon-flammable blocks.\nNon-flammable blocks can be lit but do not burn away, and such fire does not spread. Non-flammable blocks other than &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s extinguish themselves quickly. In the End, &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; also does not extinguish itself.\nIf a block is a part of a flammable &lt;a href=\"material\"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt;, it catches fire from lava. However, certain blocks do not burn away:\nExtinguishing.\nFire burns out after a while when on a non-flammable block other than &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s; however, punching or hitting the side of a burning block extinguishes the fire on that side, making the \"Fire extinguished\" sound (see below). Hitting fire while holding a tool does not reduce the tool's durability. Placing blocks on the fire also extinguishes it. Water and lava extinguish fires that they flow into, and thrown &lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion%23Splash%20water%20bottles\"&gt;splash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Potion\"&gt;lingering&lt;/a&gt; water bottles extinguish fires in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it.\nMobs on fire are extinguished when in water or in a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; containing it. In the latter case, one layer of water disappears.\nFire extinguishes more quickly if nothing flammable is present, and soon after it consumes a flammable block immediately beneath it.\nIf a fire is exposed to &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, it extinguishes quickly.\nSoul fire never extinguishes unless punched or when it receives a block update and finds there is no soul soil or soul sand below it.\nEternal fire.\nWhen lit, &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s maintain fire forever, unless extinguished by any method except &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;. Bedrock in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; also burns eternally. Soul fire burns eternally anywhere. Eternal fire cannot exist on the sides of these blocks.\nThe blocks that can support eternal fire are defined per-dimension, in the &lt;a href=\"Tag%23blocks_infiniburn_overworld\"&gt;#infiniburn_overworld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tag%23blocks_infiniburn_nether\"&gt;#infiniburn_nether&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tag%23blocks_infiniburn_end\"&gt;#infiniburn_end&lt;/a&gt; block &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf is codice_1, fire lasts forever until it is put out by the player, and does not spread or affect flammable blocks.\nBees.\nSetting fire to a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; causes the contained bees to be ejected from the block.\nPiglins.\nSoul fire repels &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. Like &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, they are not fire-resistant, which is unique among &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; mobs.\nSounds.\nGeneric.\n (Normal fire):\n (Soul fire):"}

They can also be launched from &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s. If shot from a &lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; crossbow, then 3 rockets fire with the same effects.\nElytra.\n a firework rocket while flying with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; propels the player in the direction they are facing. The duration of the speed boost depends on the flight duration of the rocket. If the rocket is equipped with a firework star of any kind, the player takes damage when it explodes.\nCrossbow.\nA firework rocket can be used as ammunition for &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s, although it deals &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; only if it has an &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; effect. A higher flight duration gives the firework rocket a longer range, and more damage is added per firework star. The &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt; enchantment has no effect on firework rockets shot from a crossbow.\n, if a firework rocket shot from a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; hits an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;, the rocket instantly &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explodes&lt;/a&gt;, no matter the flight duration. Attempting to do this , however, results in the firework passing through the entity, so the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must plan where to aim.\nBehavior.\nOnce launched, fireworks fly out vertically, with random horizontal offset up to 5 blocks. , fireworks can fly in any of the 6 directions a dispenser can point. After &lt;a href=\"%23Duration%20and%20direction\"&gt;some time&lt;/a&gt;, the firework explodes into a colorful explosion based on the effects of the &lt;a href=\"firework%20star\"&gt;firework star&lt;/a&gt;s added upon crafting, or no explosion if no firework star was used. If multiple firework stars were added to the rocket upon crafting, they all explode simultaneously.\nThe explosion of a firework rocket deals damage to mobs and players that are within 5 blocks and not obstructed by &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;s. The maximum damage of a rocket with one firework star is , with the damage decreasing with distance. Each additional firework star on the rocket adds points of damage, for a maximum damage of with 7 stars. Using commands to add additional firework stars results in more damage. The damage dealt is unaffected by any other ingredients used. The explosion does not destroy end crystals nor damage the Ender dragon, but does destroy armor stands.\nThere is a delay between the detonation and the player hearing the sound, emulating real fireworks, but this sound travels much more slowly than in the real world. , the explosion of a firework can be seen 64 blocks away, regardless of its height. , the explosion can be seen from your render distance.\nIf the explosion exceeds the (unmodded) &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; limit of 16,384, the oldest particles are removed before displaying new ones, resulting in severely diminished firework quality / duration. At most a firework should have 3 trail stars, more than that could waste diamonds, firework stars, and other fireworks. Particle counts per star are:\nTwinkle effect adds 2 particles to the count.\nLike most other entities, they can be moved by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s, and teleported via &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s. They also cannot move through solid surfaced blocks, upon hitting one, they either move to a side or explode based on the duration. If a firework explodes under a block, its explosion is flattened.\nDuration and direction.\nFireworks travel different heights based on the amount of gunpowder added. The number is displayed as a tag on the item's tooltip with the description of \"Flight Duration\".\nThe height it rises is between 8 and 20 blocks with 1 gunpowder, 18 to 34 blocks with 2 gunpowder, and 32 to 52 blocks with 3 gunpowder. \nWhen spawned, fireworks have a vertical speed of .05 and a random small X and Z speed (random value near zero with a standard deviation of .001). Each firework also determines its lifetime in ticks by 10 \u00d7 (number of gunpowder + 1) + random value from 0 to 5 + random value from 0 to 6, after which it explodes. Each tick, the firework accelerates horizontally by multiplying its X and Z velocities by 1.15, and vertically by adding a constant factor of .04.\nFireworks can be made to travel different directions by being dispensed or launched under flowing water. The firework's direction combines with the flow of the water to go diagonally.\nFirework rockets without firework stars shot from a crossbow upon hitting terrain elements will traverse along until stopped by a ledge or into unobstructed terrains again continuing its original flight path. Ledges as tall as one pixel high (e.g. from &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s) will also block the firework. They will still vanish if they hit entities early amidst their flight.\nVillage Raids.\nAfter successfully defending a village from a &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt; the villagers may celebrate by setting off firework rockets.\nBoosting elytra.\nFireworks can be used to boost &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; when in flight. Normally, elytra can glide for a short distance, but with the use of fireworks, the player can fly a long distance, gain speed, and take off from the ground. \nSimply using the firework rocket with elytra spread boosts the player in the direction the player faces. It can leave behind a trail sometimes.\nAlthough fireworks with firework stars can be used, the player takes blast damage if they use it in flight. \nThere are four types of rockets, with three types of flight duration. Higher flight durations mean longer boosts. , the fireworks obtained from the Creative menu have a flight duration of 1, while , the fireworks obtained in the Creative menu have a flight duration of 1, 2, or 3.\nSounds.\nFirework rockets use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events."}

Fish can also spawn in player-created bodies of water, as long as they are within a river or ocean biome.\nIn \"Java Edition\", fish can spawn inside a water block at Y-level 50 to 63 (from 13 blocks below sea level up to inside the block one above it), that also has water above and below it. The spawn block and the block below can be any kind of water, such as a source block, falling water, bubble column, kelp, or even a waterlogged block (as long as the fish can be placed at the bottom center of the spawn block without colliding with anything solid). The block above must be pure water, such as a source block, falling water, or flowing water of any depth. Particularly, the block above cannot also be a bubble column, so fish no longer spawn inside bubble elevators. \n\"Bedrock Edition\" does permit fish to spawn in bubble columns.\nFish can spawn between 24 and 64 block spherical range away from the player. \nDespawning.\nFish can despawn at range of 40 blocks or more from the player, and will instantly despawn more than 64 blocks away, except when spawned using a &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20fish\"&gt;bucket of fish&lt;/a&gt;."}

Internally, the game runs a server for single-player games, this was done in order to make the single-player game experience consistent with the multiplayer experience and make it so that changes made to the game such as bug fixes apply to both single-player games and multiplayer games. Official server software is only available on in the release state. The &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Dedicated%20Server\"&gt;Bedrock Edition server software&lt;/a&gt; is currently in Alpha.\nTypes of servers.\nMultiple archetypes of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" servers exist, distinguished by the unique gameplay features, rules, and societal structures that they implement. No two servers are the same, and frequently the line between archetypes is blurred or indistinguishable. Many special types of servers rely on the use of map editors or the &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; game mode to build custom maps and the server software to provide additional features. Some of these servers are more PVP orientated, some involve aspects of Survival, Creative and Adventure mode, some have a built-in economy, and some of them contain built-in minigames.\nThe main server types are:\nHosting a server.\nThere are many tools provided for players to be able to manage and host a server. Note that servers have &lt;a href=\"Server/Requirements\"&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt; in order to run efficiently and smoothly.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Tutorials%23Servers\"&gt;Tutorials#Servers&lt;/a&gt; for tutorials on how to use these programs.\nManaging and maintaining a server.\nServers are generally managed by administrators and operators. The administrator generally takes responsibility for the server. It may be that the server is running from their machine, or that they simply have jurisdiction over a server. Operators generally assist the administrators to moderate a server and to prevent unruly players and griefers. Both operators and administrators have access to various &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; in order to ensure the smooth running of the server. On a default server, players are assigned as operator or administrator by using the command, or by editing the codice_1 in the server directory, then restarting the server.\nLocal servers do not strictly require access to minecraft.net, and so can be played on an isolated local network with no internet connection. They use minecraft.net as a repository of player skins and also a database containing a list of accounts, preventing hackers and griefers from using false names while on such a server. This and other settings are modified by editing the &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; text file.\nThe server saves the level in the \"world\" folder every 30 seconds if chunks have been modified, by default.\nKick messages.\nKick messages are messages that are displayed when an operator kicks the player, or the player has issues connecting to the server."}

The text before the equal sign is the key, which should not be changed. The text after the equal sign is the property's value, which can be edited.

Another option is to use the command in the server console or in-game, which will also allow changes to be reloaded.\nIf the file does not list all properties (such as if a new version of the server adds new properties, or if the file does not exist), then on startup, the server rewrites the server.properties file with the new properties listed and set them to their default values.\nThe file is simply a normal text file with UTF-8 encoding, despite its extension, and can therefore be edited with any text editor such as Notepad for Windows, TextEdit for Mac, or nano and vim for Linux.\nJava Edition.\nFile location.\nThis file is automatically generated upon the first start of the server (if it does not exist).\nDefault content.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2023w31a\"&gt;23w31a&lt;/a&gt;, server.jar generates the following if no server.properties is found:\nenable-jmx-monitoring=false\nrcon.port=25575\nlevel-seed=\ngamemode=survival\nenable-command-block=false\nenable-query=false\nenforce-secure-profile=true\nlevel-name=world\nmotd=A Minecraft Server\nquery.port=25565\npvp=true\ngenerate-structures=true\nmax-chained-neighbor-updates=1000000\ndifficulty=easy\nnetwork-compression-threshold=256\nmax-tick-time=60000\nrequire-resource-pack=false\nuse-native-transport=true\nmax-players=20\nonline-mode=true\nenable-status=true\nallow-flight=false\ninitial-disabled-packs=\nbroadcast-rcon-to-ops=true\nview-distance=10\nserver-ip=\nresource-pack-prompt=\nallow-nether=true\nserver-port=25565\nenable-rcon=false\nsync-chunk-writes=true\nop-permission-level=4\nprevent-proxy-connections=false\nhide-online-players=false\nresource-pack=\nentity-broadcast-range-percentage=100\nsimulation-distance=10\nrcon.password=\nplayer-idle-timeout=0\nforce-gamemode=false\nrate-limit=0\nhardcore=false\nwhite-list=false\nbroadcast-console-to-ops=true\nspawn-npcs=true\nspawn-animals=true\nlog-ips=true\nfunction-permission-level=2\ninitial-enabled-packs=vanilla\nlevel-type=minecraft\\:normal\ntext-filtering-config=\nspawn-monsters=true\nenforce-whitelist=false\nspawn-protection=16\nresource-pack-sha1=\nmax-world-size=29999984\nBedrock Edition.\nFile location.\nThis file is downloaded with bedrock_server.exe\nDefault contents.\nDefault as of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Dedicated%20Server%201.20.0.20\"&gt;1.20.0.20&lt;/a&gt;:\nserver-name=Dedicated Server\ngamemode=survival\nforce-gamemode=false\ndifficulty=easy\nallow-cheats=false\nmax-players=10\nonline-mode=true\nallow-list=false\nserver-port=19132\nserver-portv6=19133\nenable-lan-visibility=true\nview-distance=32\ntick-distance=4\nplayer-idle-timeout=30\nmax-threads=8\nlevel-name=Bedrock level\nlevel-seed=\ndefault-player-permission-level=member\ntexturepack-required=false\ncontent-log-file-enabled=false\ncompression-threshold=1\ncompression-algorithm=zlib\nserver-authoritative-movement=server-auth\nplayer-movement-score-threshold=20\nplayer-movement-action-direction-threshold=0.85\nplayer-movement-distance-threshold=0.3\nplayer-movement-duration-threshold-in-ms=500\ncorrect-player-movement=false\nserver-authoritative-block-breaking=false\nchat-restriction=None\ndisable-player-interaction=false\nclient-side-chunk-generation-enabled=true\nblock-network-ids-are-hashes=true\ndisable-persona=false\ndisable-custom-skins=false\nserver-build-radius-ratio=Disabled"}

The file can be backed up to save content which helps to protect constructions against &lt;a href=\"Griefing\"&gt;griefers&lt;/a&gt; or to use the file for map editing.\nGeneral information.\nThe file is compressed using to save space (as the files can end up being reasonably large due to everything, even &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; being considered a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;).\n\"(Note: in this example, a default server_level.dat is being used, with the size of 256\u00d7256\u00d764. Level files with bigger dimensions may differ in the amount of bytes.)\"\nThe server level.dat file is where the \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"Server\"&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; dumps the level information for permanent storage. As this file is primarily raw level data, it can be quite large: a regular 256\u00d7256\u00d764 sized level is 4 megabytes in size. The file is compressed using gzip, however. Most of the block values are 0 (empty space), so, therefore, the size is reduced considerably by the compression, usually down to a few hundred kilobytes.\nAfter un-gzipping the datafile (the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; may simply decompress the file itself using a tool, which can decompress gzipped files), sequentially the datafile consists of the number 656127880 as 32-bit integer (0x27 0x1B 0xB7 0x88 in HEX), followed by the number 2 as a byte (0x02 in HEX), then followed by serialized Level Java classfile instance. The level's block values (material type, such as stone) are stored inside of a byte array inside of this class.\nThe first 65536 sequential bytes of the array make up the top-most 256\u00d7256 \"sliver\" of the level, with the north-most row of bytes, from left to right, being at locations 0 ... 255, the row below that at, from left to right, locations 256 ... 511, and so on. The default maps are 64 \"slivers\" deep.\nFile format.\nWhen uncompressed, the format of the file is as follows:\nAccessing the array of bytes.\nOne generally has two options for accessing the byte array of blocks: \nThe &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; could deserialize the compressed .dat file directly back into an instance of a Level object inside of Java, thus having access to the instance of the Level object in exactly the same way the Minecraft Server does. This would allow the player to set the blocks, dimensions, spawn point and other aspects of the map directly by calling the methods on the instantiated Level object. Manual decompression is not needed before loading, because Java can compress and decompress gzipped files on the fly. To load the datafile back into an instance of the Level class, the player would need the class definition for the Level class. This is included with the minecraft-server.jar file. An example of this can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Development%20resources/Example%20Minecraft%20Classic%20Level%20Editing%20Class\"&gt;Development resources/Example Minecraft Classic Level Editing Class&lt;/a&gt;.\nOthers have read and modified the map's data by simply accessing the raw byte array in the datafile file. To do this, the player would decompress it, make changes to the bytes where the byte array is stored, and then compress it again. Since the player is editing it raw, the player must keep the first 344 (14E in HEX) bytes intact. The next 256\u00d7256\u00d764 bytes are where the byte array is stored. Additionally, it is also possible to alter the spawn location coordinates this way if the player knows where to look: there are 3 integer values starting at byte 284 and thus overwriting the next 12 bytes (3 integers) allow the player to change the spawn location."}

The site uses badges for \"Minecraft\" servers to earn and communicate with players and parents the additional safety features that they provide. The \"Minecraft\" Usage Guidelines (MUG) can be found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//aka.ms/MCUsageGuidelines\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganizing servers.\nIn \"Java Edition\", the servers appear on the list in a set order, which can be changed. To change the order the servers appear on the list, the player can hover over the server they like to move and use the arrows to move the server up or down on the list. Alternatively, the player can hold and use the arrow keys.\nIn Bedrock Edition, the servers are always in order."}

They are used to render not only blocks and entities when playing the game, but also menu and inventory screens.\nEach core shader is a single &lt;a href=\"%23Render%20program\"&gt;render program&lt;/a&gt; defined by a JSON file, in which vertex and fragment shader files are specified.\nCore shaders are stored in the &lt;samp&gt;assets/minecraft/shaders/core&lt;/samp&gt; directory of minecraft.jar.\nList of core shaders.\nA list of all core shaders can be found by expanding the header below, listing descriptions of what each shader is responsible for, with images highlighting each element in red:\nInclude shaders.\nInclude shaders should be invoked by other shader files; they are not standalone shader programs. \nInclude shaders contain commonly used helper functions. To import a glsl file in a shader, use codice_1 or codice_2. \"The imported file needs to end with an empty line, otherwise the shader does not load.\"\nInclude shaders are stored in the &lt;samp&gt;assets/minecraft/shaders/include&lt;/samp&gt; directory of minecraft.jar.\nPost-processing shaders.\nAs mentioned previously, post-processing shaders are used for special Spectator mode mob vision types, the Fabulous! graphics setting, and for rendering the outline associated with Glowing.\nPost-processing shaders use \"post\" files to define a &lt;a href=\"%23Render%20pipeline\"&gt;pipeline&lt;/a&gt; made up of applying a sequence of \"programs\". Each \"program\" is then defined by another JSON file, in which a single &lt;a href=\"%23Render%20program\"&gt;render program&lt;/a&gt; is defined.\n\"post\" files are stored in the &lt;samp&gt;assets/minecraft/shaders/post&lt;/samp&gt; directory of the jar file, while \"program\" files are stored in &lt;samp&gt;assets/minecraft/shaders/program&lt;/samp&gt;.\nOnly five post-processing shaders are currently used in the game:\nIn these two directories, there are also many unused shaders, which were used for \"Super Secret Settings\" before 1.9 (&lt;a href=\"15w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt;). See &lt;a href=\"Shaders/Before%201.9\"&gt;Shaders/Before 1.9&lt;/a&gt;.\nFile format.\nRender pipeline.\nHere's the process of how a post-processing shader is used in game: first, the shader initializes all of the render targets specified in the \"targets\" list with the proper width and height. After that, the shader goes through each render pass specified in the \"passes\" list from first in the list to last in the list. Each pass applies the program shader on the render target specified by \"intarget\" (with any extra data provided by other auxiliary render targets) and output the end result on the render target specified by \"outtarget\".\nTutorials and useful docs.\nHere are some guides with additional information on creating shaders:\nBedrock Edition.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.18.30\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.18.30&lt;/a&gt;, third party shader resource packs are no longer supported on all devices except Fire OS."}

The light gray, gray and black sheep each have a 5% chance of spawning, or a 15% chance collectively. Brown sheep have an uncommon 3% chance to spawn. Pink sheep have a rare chance of 0.164% of spawning naturally.\nIf a sheep &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; is placed via , the sheep model spinning inside appears with one of . Independently from the displayed color, all six variants are able to spawn, the usual chances apply. To guarantee that sheep always spawn with the desired color, additional NBT tags can be applied to the monster spawner, utilizing the codice_1 tag.\nNatural generation.\n, 4 sheep may spawn above grass blocks, at a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 9 or higher, even on snowy taigas.\n, 2 to 3 sheep spawn during the world generation on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s at the surface at a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 7 or higher with at least a 2 block space above, except in &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice%20spikes\"&gt;ice spikes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Badlands%23Wooded%20badlands\"&gt;wooded badlands&lt;/a&gt;. They later spawn individually on grassy biomes. 5% spawn as baby sheep.\nTwo sheep sometimes spawn in shepherd houses, butcher houses and animal pens in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDrops.\nAn adult sheep drops:\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Shears\"&gt;sheared&lt;/a&gt;, sheep give 1\u20133 wool and do not take any damage. This is not affected by &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped.\nKilling a baby sheep yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s nor &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nSheep wander aimlessly and individually or in small flocks of two to four. Sheep avoid cliffs and hazardous areas if it warrants &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Sheep emit hoarse bleats in mostly random patterns and especially when attacked. If harmed, sheep flee for a few seconds, but make no special attempt to avoid &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheep are nonchalant to players or other mobs, but follow a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; holding &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; within a six blocks radius.\nAdult sheep can't fit through a gap if the 90-degree intersection of two &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s is removed whereas the player and most other mobs can get through easily.\nSheep graze &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; (but not &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt;), making it disappear, and &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, changing them into &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; blocks. , they can also eat &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s. Baby sheep graze grass much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing. Sheep can eat grass through &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;blocks that are less than a full block thick&lt;/a&gt;, including extremities such as &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as from inside &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. A sheared sheep regrows its wool after grazing. Therefore, if no grass is available, a sheep cannot regrow its wool after being sheared. If an adult sheep has the opportunity, the chance of eating grass is every other game &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; ( for baby sheep). If is set to , grass blocks remain, but the sheep still regrow their wool.\nDyeing.\nSheep's wool can be dyed by pressing the key or the interact button while holding any &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;. Sheared sheep cannot be dyed until their wool grows back after eating a grass block. Dyeing changes the color of the sheep's wool permanently or until the sheep is dyed again. The new wool colors will be inherited by baby sheep.\nIf a sheep is dyed and then sheared, it retains its new dyed wool color after the wool regrows. , the wool patches that are seen on a sheared sheep always appear white regardless of their actual color. The wool texture on the sheep's face also always appear white regardless of their actual color.\nEaster eggs.\nAn &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; can also change a sheep's wool color if the evoker is unengaged in combat and is set to codice_2. Then it can change the wool color of any blue sheep within 16 blocks to red. It signals the spell by producing orange color particles () and making a \"wololo\" sound. This is a reference to the priest unit of the 1997 game \"Age of Empires\".\nIf a sheep is named codice_3, its wool cycles through all dye colors in a similar manner to &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt;. This is purely a visual effect. A sheep named jeb_ can still be dyed without changing the rainbow effect and any wool obtained from one of these sheep has the most recent color as if the sheep was unnamed.\nBreeding.\nSheep can be bred using wheat, after which they spawn a baby sheep. They cannot breed for five minutes after the baby sheep appears.\nIf the parents have compatible wool colors (meaning that the corresponding &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; items could be combined into a third dye color), the resulting baby sheep inherits a mix of their colors (e.g., blue sheep + white sheep = light blue baby sheep).\nIf the dye colors cannot normally be mixed, the baby sheep spawns with the same color as one of the parents, chosen randomly, regardless of whether one or both parents have been sheared.\nThe 20-minute growth of baby sheep can be slightly accelerated using wheat. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up. It can also accelerate its own growth by eating grass.\nSounds.\nSheep use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nSheep have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

On rarer occasions, they generate above sea level nearby the water, in &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20beach\"&gt;snowy beach&lt;/a&gt;es or inside an &lt;a href=\"iceberg\"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"underwater%20ruin\"&gt;underwater ruin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monument\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;.\nStructure.\nShipwrecks generate in one of three ways: upright, keeled sideways or upside-down. In many cases, they are missing their bow (front) or stern (rear), mast or multiple other blocks, giving them a damaged appearance; however, it is also possible, but rare, to find them completely intact. They consist solely of wooden materials, including &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"stripped%20log\"&gt;stripped log&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; (if the ship is upright), and up to 3 &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on rotation and intact sections of the ship. The bow is supposed to generate one chest (unless upside-down) while the stern should generate two, and the whole ship generates a maximum of three chests, regardless of the ship's rotation or condition. However, there are some instances in which chests that usually generate in a shipwreck section are missing. All variants of Overworld wood are used in the shipwreck's structure (except acacia and mangrove), but only two wood types are used per ship. Warped wood and crimson wood are not used in shipwrecks, as they are only found in the Nether. \nLoot.\nShipwrecks contain up to 3 loot &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, depending on the sections still intact. Supply chests generate in the bow of the ships, treasure chests generate in the upper section of the stern, and map chests in the lower section. In the case of certain shipwrecks, especially those that intersect other structures, the chests that would normally be present in the corresponding section may be absent, resulting in some shipwrecks holding no chests at all. Although chests don't usually generate for missing sections, map chests from shipwreck sterns may generate in upside-down bows even if the stern is missing. Furthermore, each shipwreck with at least 2 chests always contains its map chest."}

{"id": "74375", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=74375", "title": "Shulker", "text": "A shulker is a box-shaped &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;. It hides in its shell to protect itself and blend in with its surroundings. It attacks by shooting homing bullets at the player which inflict &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only source of &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used to craft &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es.\nSpawning.\nNatural generation.\nShulkers spawn during the generation of &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, which are located on the outer islands of the &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt;. They usually spawn on the walls of the city and on end ships. They do not despawn naturally, even in Peaceful difficulty.\nPost-generation.\nThere is a chance that a new shulker of the same color will spawn when a shulker is hit with a shulker bullet (including one of its own).\nThe following conditions need to be met:\nIf the attempt succeeds a new shulker spawns where the old shulker was before it teleported.\nDrops.\n, shulkers drop 0\u20131 &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt;s. The maximum can be increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, which is 0\u20134 shells with Looting III.\n, shulkers have a 50% chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt; when killed. This is increased by 6.25% per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 68.75% with Looting III.\nShulkers also drop when killed by a player or a tamed wolf.\nBehavior.\nThe shell of the mob looks similar to a &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;, blending in to its natural surroundings. Inside the shell of the mob is a small yellow head with two eyes. Shulkers are uncolored by default when using &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s, while white is the default when using or &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s. Spawning shulkers with other colors can be done using the command, as detailed &lt;a href=\"%23Data%20values\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.\nShulkers generally remain stationary, attached to an adjacent block with a full face. However, if the block the shulker occupies becomes something other than air or the shulker finds itself not adjacent to any full face, or the shell cannot fully open (due to solid blocks or entities such as boats or other shulkers), it attempts to teleport (5 attempts per tick) to an air block within a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cube centered on the shulker where the shulker can attach to a full face and open. If it finds no valid position to teleport onto it does not move.\nShulkers evaluate the collision box of &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; based on their current position, which can result in the shulker teleporting to a position only to find it invalid and teleport again.\nShulkers occasionally open their shell for 1\u20133 seconds. When a target comes within about 16 blocks, it opens fully and shoots guided projectiles that follow the player, called &lt;a href=\"Shulker%23Shulker%20bullet\"&gt;shulker bullets,&lt;/a&gt; moving only along the X, Y, or Z axes and leaving trails of white particles. The projectiles can be destroyed by attacking them or blocked with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. If the projectile hits an entity, it does of damage and inflicts the &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; for 10 seconds, this status effect has no effect underwater, or while riding a mob. The shulker continues firing every 1\u20135.5 seconds while the target remains in range. If the shulker's target dies with projectiles still in flight, they fall to the ground.\nShulkers can attack each other, in which case they shoot fully guided bullets at each other, but are unaffected by Levitation when hit. The normal teleportation habits apply during these battles, and is likely to result in the duplication of more shulkers.\nWhen its shell is closed, a shulker has armor points and deflects &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. When the shell opens, it loses this natural armor and takes damage as normal. When at less than half health, a shulker has a 25% chance of teleporting (as described above) after taking damage. When a shulker is attacked, other shulkers in the area target the attacker as well.\nShulkers don't take burning damage from lava or fire. They drown in water, but try to teleport away when water or lava flows into the block they occupy.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, shulkers exist within the world, but do not attack, like &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s ,&lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s .\nShulkers are treated differently than true blocks. For example, mobs are unable to pathfind around or jump over them, and falling on them from a height does not produce particles. Their &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; also does not destroy blocks such as &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;.\n, they apply Levitation II instead of I.\nShulkers spawned as part of a team using attack most hostile mobs without provocation. They never attack their teammates intentionally and do not retaliate even when being hit, however the shulkers will still target players without a team or in another team.\nShulker bullet.\nA shulker bullet is a guided projectile that is shot from shulkers, and they follow the targeted entity along the X, Y, or Z axis and leave trails of white particles. A shulker bullet that hits a mob or player deals damage and affects them with &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; for ten seconds.\nThe shulker's projectiles also have entity data that control its movement.\nThe bullet can be destroyed by hitting it with any item, shooting it with an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;, or blocking it with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. It explodes upon contact with a block. The explosion does not destroy any blocks and does not damage nearby mobs or players.\nColoring.\n, shulkers can be &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;d in a similar fashion to &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;. a dye on a shulker gives it the color of the dye.\n, the color of a shulker is changed through &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; using the codice_1 byte tag.\nTransportation.\nShulkers can be moved by &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s; pushing a boat/cart into a shulker causes it to board. A boat's sides block some of a shulkers projectiles.\nA shulker pushed through the exit portal gets transported to the world spawn point in the Overworld. Since shulkers teleport when not adjacent to a solid block, they must be pushed down the central pillar of the exit portal (or a manually placed block directly above the portal) with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nShulker bullet.\nShulker bullets use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nShulkers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nShulker bullets have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Shulker boxes drop themselves when mined. Unlike other containers, the contents of shulker boxes are stored within the dropped item, and not dropped separately. When instantly mined in Creative mode, shulker boxes drop as an item if there are items stored within, unless is set to \"false\".\nUsage.\nA shulker box has 27 inventory slots, the same as a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nShulker boxes are portable chests: they keep their items when broken, which can be retrieved when placed again. This is different from other containers, which drop their contained items as item entities when broken. A shulker box drops itself as an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; if pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s or destroyed by an &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most blocks with inventory, shulker boxes always drop themselves when destroyed by explosions. When a shulker box with items inside is being held or is in a container's inventory, the items are listed on the tooltip as properties.\nA shulker box's items can be fed or removed by a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nShulker boxes can be stored in all containers except for other shulker boxes and bundles.\nWhen placed on a wall or ceiling, shulker boxes face and open sideways or upside-down, respectively. Shulker boxes cannot be opened if a solid opaque block is on their top surface, similar to a chest. For example, if a shulker box is facing upside-down and a solid opaque block is below it, the shulker box cannot be opened. A shulker box can also be placed using &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLike a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, a shulker box requires a transparent area above to be opened, and it opens only if the hitbox of the top of the open shulker box does not intersect with another hitbox. This way, a shulker box can be opened with an upside-down slab or an upper trapdoor on top of it. It is also unique in that when opened, its hitbox expands to 1.5 blocks high/wide, physically pushing entities where it is facing.\nBy default, the GUI of a shulker box is labeled \"Shulker Box\", which can be changed by naming it in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; or by changing the codice_1 tag using the command.\nWhen a shulker box &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed, the contents of the shulker box are dropped as items.\nUndyeing.\nDyed shulker boxes can be undyed using a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, a dyed shulker box on a cauldron that has water in it. This causes the cauldron's water level to decrease by 1, and the shulker box loses its dye color.\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s become hostile toward players who open or mine shulker boxes.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA shulker box has a block entity associated with it that identifies its contents.\nItem data.\nShulker boxes, as items, use an NBT tag codice_2 to indicate the contents and details of the box when it is placed.\n\"The following NBT structure is provided to show how the codice_2 tag is organized, and is not comprehensive above the codice_4 tag. The full NBT for an item can be found &lt;a href=\"Entity%20format%23Items%20and%20XPOrbs\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

A hanging sign is a decorative block that also displays text, and can be placed underneath blocks or with a solid self-supporting bracket. The text of both types of signs can be customized with &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"glow%20ink%20sac\"&gt;glow ink sac&lt;/a&gt;s.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nSigns can be broken with any tool or without a tool, but an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; is fastest.\nA sign or a hanging sign also breaks and drops itself as an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; if the block the sign is attached to is moved, removed or destroyed. However, a wall hanging sign will stay here if the block the hanging sign is attached to is removed.\nIf a sign is broken while being edited, the player continues to edit the sign, although breaking the sign stops the editing operation.\nNatural generation.\nAn oak sign can be found in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basements. Spruce signs can be found in taiga &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; houses, as part of a chair.\nCrafting.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20player\"&gt;The player&lt;/a&gt; can place six stripped &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s at the bottom half of the crafting table and place two &lt;a href=\"chain\"&gt;chain&lt;/a&gt;s on the top-left and top-right slots to create hanging signs. This crafting recipe will create six hanging signs. Hanging signs can only be crafted with stripped logs or &lt;a href=\"stem\"&gt;stem&lt;/a&gt;s; non-stripped wood cannot be used to craft hanging signs.\nUsage.\nSigns can be used to display text; they can be used to label storage, display information to other players or note areas of interest. Signs are also not destroyed by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and therefore may be used to control the flow of these fluids.\nPlacement.\nSigns.\nSigns may be placed on the top or side of other &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s (including semi-solid and non-solid blocks such as &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoors&lt;/a&gt; and other signs). To place a sign, a sign &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; while pointing at the block the sign should be attached to, enter the desired text (or none), and click the \"Done\" button or press \"escape\" on a keyboard (or press \u00d7 , on an Xbox controller, on a PlayStation controller, or on a Nintendo Switch controller. Closing the virtual keyboard on a mobile device also exits the typing menu). To place a sign on a block that can be interacted with by the control (for example, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.), while placing the sign.\nSigns on the top of a block stand on a short post and face toward the player who placed it, in any of 16 different directions. Signs placed on the side of a block simply float there, even if the block doesn't make contact with the sign.\nEven if placed on a vertical surface, a sign may not co-exist in the same block of air as any other item, despite not necessarily visibly obstructing eachother.\nFor more information about the blocks signs can be placed on, see &lt;a href=\"Opacity/Placement\"&gt;Opacity/Placement&lt;/a&gt;.\nHanging signs.\nHanging signs can be placed in three different ways:\nText.\nPlacing a sign opens an editor interface resembling a magnified view of the sign. Up to four lines of text can then be entered using a keyboard (hardware or on-screen). The editor supports limited editing, including moving the cursor and inserting and deleting characters. , &lt;a href=\"formatting%20codes\"&gt;formatting codes&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to apply decorative effects such as color, bold, italic and underline to various bits of the text. Depending on the edition and platform in use, copy and paste operations may be supported and the editor may also support keyboard entry of Alt-codes for displaying Unicode characters.\nText can be added to the back side of a sign by interacting with the that side of the sign after placing it and editing the front.\nSigns can be waxed by a &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; on it. Once waxed, a sign cannot be unwaxed or edited.\nAfter placing and affixing text on a sign, a player can change the text color by a &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; on it. When colored with dye, the text color may differ from any color specified by formatting codes.\nA player can a &lt;a href=\"glow%20ink%20sac\"&gt;glow ink sac&lt;/a&gt; on a sign to make its text glow. The glowing text is not affected by lighting. The player can use a regular black &lt;a href=\"ink%20sac\"&gt;ink sac&lt;/a&gt; on the sign to remove the glowing effect.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, the combination + on Windows/Linux, or + on macOS, can be used to copy an already-placed sign, including its text (with decorations), into the player's inventory.\nA dyed sign facing east or west will have its text appear more saturated and bright than a sign facing north or south. However, it is actually the sign that is dimmer, because \"Minecraft\"'s lighting engine uses side lighting to make the world appear less flat, but the text on signs is not affected by this.\n, inappropriate words or phrases in a sign's text are displayed as asterisks.\n, signs can be created with &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Raw%20JSON%20Text\"&gt;JSON text&lt;/a&gt;, which allows complex formatting (colors, bold, italic, etc.), hover and click events, localized translation (for \"Minecraft\" technical terms, like \"Redstone Repeater\", otherwise translations must be provided in language files in resource packs), and the incorporation of scoreboard values into text. Use the command to create or alter JSON signs.\nSigns can post the success count of JSON text hover and click events to &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt; objectives.

The values that can be set range from 4 to 12 in increments of 2 (even numbers only).\nTick updates.\nSimulation distance determines the maximum chunk distance in which entities get updated, and blocks and fluids are ticked. This is not a Euclidean distance, but &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt; in Bedrock Edition.\nThese ticks include random ticking of crops, amethysts and such. The simulation distance is purely chunk based and has nothing to do with the player's position inside the chunk.\nPure redstone circuits continue to function infinitely far away, but break down where they interact with hoppers, pistons, observers, and anything else that needs tick updates to function.\nSpawning and despawning.\nSimulation distance restricts the maximum distance at which mobs spawn and despawn.\nThe minimum spawning distance is 24 blocks (Euclidean distance) from the player. The maximum spawning distance and despawning distances are determined by the simulation distance, which is a quasi-spherical shell having the following ranges relative to the player:\nWithin the simulation distance, there is a chance of the mob spawning algorithm attempting to run per chunk, per tick.\n&lt;a href=\"Realms\"&gt;Realms&lt;/a&gt; worlds use a simulation distance of 9 chunks and 4 chunks .\nRegardless of simulation distance, mobs with &lt;a href=\"persistence\"&gt;persistence&lt;/a&gt; do not despawn, and &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; always despawn when they are more than 40 blocks from the nearest player.\nMob cap.\nMobs in chunks outside a ticking area still count toward the per-mob population control caps as long as they were previously loaded within the simulation distance at some time.\nJava Edition.\nIn \"Java Edition\", the minimum value of simulation distance is 5. The maximum value is the same as for render distance: 32 for 64-bit Java installations with at least 1 gigabyte of memory, and 16 in all other cases. If render distance is set to a lower value than simulation distance, the lower value is used instead.\nSimulation distance defines a square region of chunks around the player where entities are ticked. Using distance of 6 for instance, entities may move normally within a 13\u00d713 chunk column around the player chunk. One more chunk out, within a one-chunk-thick square frame surrounding this region, redstone may run, fluid may flow, and crop may grow (subject to normal &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Chunk_tick\"&gt;chunk ticking rules&lt;/a&gt;). Beyond that nothing moves or changes. But these game aspects are also subject to &lt;a href=\"Chunk%23Chunk_loading\"&gt;chunk loading rules&lt;/a&gt;. See also &lt;a href=\"Chunk%23Ticking\"&gt;Chunk#Ticking&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe simulation distance setting is ideally less than render distance because updating all entities within the simulation distance is more taxing on performance than the equivalent level of render distance.\nEntity visibility.\nNot all entities within the loaded and visible chunks are displayed to the player. There are three criteria that hide entities from view. First, the server does not send any information about an entity to the client if the entity is beyond a certain distance from the player, controlled by \"entity-broadcast-range-percentage\" in the &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; file. Second, the client does not render entities depending on both \"Render distance\" and \"Entity distance\" &lt;a href=\"Options%23Video\"&gt;video settings&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, render distance (in chunks) multiplied by a magic number (about 8.5 for mobs, 2 for items) and scaled by the \"entity distance\" percentage gives the radius in blocks for a sphere around the player beyond which entities are hidden. For example, using render distance 10 and 100% entity distance, a skeleton disappears from view if the player stands more than 85 blocks directly above it. The magic number varies slightly for different types of mobs, such as being larger for spiders and ghasts, even though ghasts still frequently attack player from beyond visibility range. Finally, the client has a hard visibility limit of 128 blocks horizontally, defining another circular column. Entities are displayed only if they are inside the intersection of this sphere and two cylinders."}

In &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es structures, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nA skeleton &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; upon death: \nBehavior.\nSkeletons chase &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, baby &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s they see within 16 blocks, climbing &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s, navigating mazes and traversing other complex obstacles to get within their shooting range. \nWhen within 15 blocks of a target and with a clear line of sight, the skeleton starts shooting with &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, once every two seconds on easy and normal difficulties or once every second on hard difficulty. If the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again. Their detection range is reduced by 50% if a &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt; is worn by the player. This stacks with &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; effect. \nThe skeleton's accuracy is based on the world &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Skeletons have an of on Easy, on Normal and on Hard. This is compared to the player's of . To account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target.\nSkeletons have infinite &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows. Arrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground.\nSkeleton behavior varies between the game editions:\nIn most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton. When a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead. Skeletons flee from &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. A skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it.\nSkeletons sink in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and cannot &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt;, but do not &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Drowning\"&gt;drown&lt;/a&gt;. If a skeleton is inside of &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt; for 7 seconds, it converts into a &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;. A newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton. The converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton. Only skeletons can become strays; &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be converted. \nIf spawned with a weapon other than a bow, or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as , or ), a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton.\nA skeleton holding a &lt;a href=\"tipped%20arrow\"&gt;tipped arrow&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; dies from a skeleton's arrow, it drops one of any &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;s except for &lt;a href=\"Pigstep\"&gt;Pigstep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Otherside\"&gt;Otherside&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"5\"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Relic\"&gt;Relic&lt;/a&gt;.\nSunlight.\nSkeletons burn at dawn when the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; is 15 degrees or greater above the ground and when the moon can no longer be seen, unless the skeleton is:\nIf not wearing a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;, it seeks out shade during the day or enters water to protect itself. Unlike &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, which leave the shade to chase a player, skeletons do not exit the shaded area even while attacking.\nMob type.\nSkeletons are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs, causing them to be damaged by the &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt; status effect, healed by the &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Instant Damage&lt;/a&gt; status effect, and unaffected by the status effects &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;. Skeletons are ignored by the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; and are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nGeared skeletons.\nSome spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground. Unlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor. If a picked up item is &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;, a skeleton equips itself with the item. If the picked up item is a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon. In Bedrock Edition, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot.\nSkeletons spawn already-armed with &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, which may be &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;ed. The chances of that event are listed below from . If a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.\nIf a skeleton does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:\n, the armor pieces go from feet to head, and , they go from head to feet.\nThe chances of it being of a particular material are:\nThe armor is not damaged from most damage sources; it cannot \"wear out\" the way &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; armor does. &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;s (not &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight or has an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; or other falling block dropped on its hitbox.\nIf a skeleton has a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is given, it drops the bow, with the same chance as if killed with &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; I and starts using the sword. If a skeleton has a sword or bow in its hand, and one of a better type or with better enchantments is given, the skeleton drops the existing weapon, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I in favor of the better one. Any skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1\u20133 extra experience points per item.\nIf multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.\nOn , skeletons may spawn wearing a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;. They do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nSkeletons have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nHistory.\nHistorical sounds:"}

It sometimes spawns when &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes.\nSpawning.\nA \u201cskeleton trap horse\u201d is a neutral skeleton horse that has a chance of spawning in a &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strike during a naturally occurring &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt; (0.75\u20131.5% chance on Easy, 1.5\u20134% on Normal, and 2.25\u20136.75% on Hard, depending on &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;). \nThe skeleton trap horse is triggered when a player comes within 10 blocks of it, resulting in a second lightning strike. When struck, the skeleton trap horse transforms into a skeleton horseman: a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; riding a skeleton horse. It also spawns three additional skeleton horsemen in the vicinity.\nThe skeleton will be equipped with an enchanted iron helmet and an enchanted bow. both the horse and horseman have &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt; for 3 seconds after spawning. , both the horse and horseman are always immune to lightning.\nTrap skeleton horse can be spawned in \"Java Edition\" using the command .\n, both the lightning that spawns a trap horse, and the lightning that triggers the trap don't strike nearby entities or spawn fires. Lightning strikes caused by a &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; and lightning strikes on a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt; never spawn a skeleton trap horse. The trap horse despawns after 15 minutes if not triggered. \nDrops.\nUpon death, a skeleton horse drops:\nIf saddled, it drops a saddle.\nKilling a baby skeleton horse yields no items or experience. , killing a trap skeleton horse also yields no items or experience. \nUsage.\nSkeleton horses can be used as one of the fastest means of &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; in the game, though they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings. When ridden, they can also be used to climb hills and jump fences because the skeleton horses can jump up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of one (without jump boost).\nThey can be ridden in water in any depth, and do so faster than non-skeleton horses. Skeleton horses sink in the water and can be ridden along the ocean or river floor.\nSkeleton horses can be pulled using a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nSkeleton horses have the following slot available:\nSaddles can be placed on a tamed skeleton horse by holding it and then on the skeleton horse, or by accessing its inventory. A skeleton horse's inventory can be accessed by mounting the skeleton horse and using control, or by and then on the skeleton horse.\nBaby skeleton horses cannot be equipped.\nA skeleton horse does not have an inventory and cannot be equipped with a saddle or armor. Despite this, the default texture file, like those of normal horses, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;s, includes a chest.\nRiding.\n, skeleton horses can be controlled by the player without a saddle. However, , skeleton horses can be equipped with a saddle and then controlled. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; while on a skeleton horse.\nThe player can control a tamed (and saddled ) skeleton horse with standard directional controls, , and the mouse. The player dismounts using the control.\nA player controlled skeleton horse automatically runs up any one block high slope. The skeleton horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Skeleton horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\nPlayer controlled skeleton horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\". When the player rides them, the experience bar on &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; is replaced by jumping charging bar. A controlled skeleton horses can be made to and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Skeleton horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\nUnlike normal horses, a skeleton horse does not force the player to dismount when it is under &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;; rather, it can be ridden underwater without drowning. The player can still drown underwater without the proper potions or enchantments, even when mounted on the skeleton horse. When underwater, its running speed and jump remain the same although it has a slower rate of descent.\nBehavior.\nThe skeleton horse is an undead mob that is initially neutral, but become passive after their rider is killed. Skeleton horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Skeleton horses can breathe in water.\nUnlike other animal mobs, skeleton horses slowly regenerate health evident by their health bar while the player rides it. This is the same case for normal horses.\nSkeleton horses cannot be bred or fed.\nSkeleton horses, in common with other undead mobs, take damage when affected by a &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; of Healing and are healed by a Potion of Harming. They are also affected by the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nOther notes:\nStatistics.\nAll horses have three \"equine stats\" that vary from horse to horse: health, maximum movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\nSpawned values.\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\nHealth.\nA skeleton horse's health is always 15. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart. If the horse has lost one health point lower than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\nMovement speed.\nSkeleton horse's speed is always 0.2;\nthe player's normal walking speed is 0.1. The speed listed does not include any &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"Transportation%23Methods\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt;\" to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\nJump strength.\nJump strength ranges from 0.4 to 1.0, averaging 0.7.\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear blocks.\nThe jump strengths required to clear several block heights are:\nSounds.\nSkeleton horse sounds are the sounds of the regular horse but lower pitched and slowed with reverb.&lt;br&gt;\nSkeleton horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nSkeleton horses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

Skins can be easily made in blockbench \nProperties.\nSkins are divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (for example, the front head area, left leg area, etc.). There are a total of 3,264 pixels that can be customized, with 1,632 on each layer. Skins with slim arms have 3,136 pixels, with 1568 pixels on each layer. The second layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories (even a bigger head).\n, a skin allows only a solid color; transparency is not allowed on the skin file except on the second layer, which is transparent by default; playing offline, pixels can be left free resulting in \"holes\" in the skin. If a skin with transparent pixels on the first layer is uploaded, the transparent pixels render as black pixels in-game.\n, skins can have double the resolution of a normal skin. This means the skin template can be up to 128\u00d7128 instead of just 64\u00d764. The normal templates still apply, but players get 4\u00d7 the amount of pixels to work with, since both dimensions have been doubled. Transparency can be used, even on the first layer, though there needs to be at least one visible pixel, so a fully invisible skin can't be made. The transparency must also be 0% or 100% as translucent colors are not allowed in either layer.\nPixel size of the 2nd layer on body, arms and legs is 0.25 pixel bigger than the skin pixel (inner layer).\nFor head 2nd layer (Hat layer) it is 0.5 pixels bigger than the skin layer (inner layer).\nWorld textures.\nA skin can also refer to other textures in the game, such as block textures, item sprites, mob skins, etc. A list of these can be found &lt;a href=\"Resource%20pack\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is worth noting that a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; and its variants can use typical player skins (and vice-versa). &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; mobs can use typical player skins as well, but keep in mind that they have their skinny arms and legs. If a skeleton mob skin is used as a player's skin, their legs and arms do not appear skinny.\nIn order to use the player skin for zombies, the user must align it to the correct place on the to avoid a visual break in the texture.\nChanging or installing player skins.\nJava Edition.\nOnly players who have purchased \"Minecraft\" can change their character's skin. This is done on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//minecraft.net/profile\"&gt;profile page&lt;/a&gt; or in the \"Minecraft Launcher\" by uploading a valid texture that is 64\u00d764 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64\u00d732 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.\nSkins also have the option of having either 3 or 4 pixel wide arms, which can be changed on the profile page as well.\nThe and files in &lt;a href=\"client.jar\"&gt;client.jar&lt;/a&gt; can also be changed and replaced via a resource pack, but the effects are visible only to players using the resource pack, and affects all players with the default skin.\nOther versions of Steve and Alex in officially-released skin packs and other Minecraft media exist:\nBedrock Edition.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.11.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy &lt;a href=\"skin%20pack\"&gt;skin pack&lt;/a&gt;s. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented , but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.\nCharacter creator.\nThe character creator is a feature (and was until discontinuation) that lets &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s customize their skins with free and paid-for cosmetic items. It can be accessed by selecting the character profile button on the main menu. It can also be used to equip &lt;a href=\"cape\"&gt;cape&lt;/a&gt;s. Many clothing items cost &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Minecoins&lt;/a&gt; (Tokens on PlayStation 4), or can be earned by completing certain &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSkin packs.\nSkin Packs are available as downloadable content. They can be aquired:\nJava Edition Skin Packs.\nThe following skin packs were released on minecraft.net by Mojang Studios for certain events.\n\"There might be more Java Edition exclusive skin packs released by Mojang Studios not yet listed in this table.\"\nTemplates.\nMany players prefer their own unique skin. While many premade skins can be found online, many players prefer to create their own.\nA custom skin is a way to personalize the player model and can be done either by using a variety of community-made &lt;a href=\"Programs%20and%20editors/Skinning%20and%20texturing\"&gt;skin editors&lt;/a&gt;, or by editing the or file manually with an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net or similar image editors. The file can be downloaded &lt;a href=\"http%3A//assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/steve.png\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the file &lt;a href=\"http%3A//assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/alex.png\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. When editing the or file manually, be sure to keep the original image dimensions and make the background of the skin (the unused pixels) completely transparent. Otherwise, \"Minecraft\" may fail to recognize the skin as intended.\nAlternatively, some may find it easier to use a program, either downloadable or in-browser, which provides a live view of their character on a three-dimensional model as they are editing the skin. For example, programs may further assist players by providing them with a wide variety of pre-made selections (such as hats, boots, sweaters, etc.), to give the skin creator exactly what they want, even if the creator has little to no artistic skill.\nAfter making a custom skin, either by using a skin editor or by editing the file directly, one still needs to upload the file at the Skin section of the Profile page on &lt;a href=\"Minecraft.net\"&gt;Minecraft.net&lt;/a&gt; (found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//minecraft.net/profile/skin\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) before the skin is applied. Other players in multiplayer can also see this skin. Note that players cannot see the custom skin if they are not logged in or when playing offline.\nOfficial skin templates.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408894664461-Minecraft-Skins-for-Java-Edition\"&gt;Minecraft Help Center Article&lt;/a&gt;"}

Using &lt;a href=\"datapack\"&gt;datapack&lt;/a&gt;s, a player can generate a partial recreation of the original concept.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;, there was a &lt;a href=\"map%20type\"&gt;map type&lt;/a&gt; called \"Floating\". It generated floating islands full of terrain based on the &lt;a href=\"Theme\"&gt;World Theme&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sky Dimension was first announced when Notch tweeted a picture of the dimension. It was probably made to be like a \"heaven,\" because &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; was considered to be like a hell. The Sky Dimension was not completely confirmed until Notch released an update via Twitter stating: \"And because PC Gamer made such a big deal of the Sky Dimension, I guess I'll have to finish it. Consider it confirmed.\"\nIn a live webcast on the Swedish gaming site \"feber.se\" &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Sky Dimension would \"probably be a dream world\" and that when \"you go to bed there is a certain chance that you get dragged into the dream world instead. Then you will be able to do it on purpose later on.\"\nThe Sky Dimension was originally planned for the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Update\"&gt;Adventure Update&lt;/a&gt;, but Notch put it on hold until the Nether was more fun.\n\"It didn't work so well because of how light is calculated,\" &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; explained. \"The Sky Dimension originally had this top down light that the Overworld has, so you get like shadows in caves and such. But performance wise, it didn't work - it was extremely slow. So we removed the sun \u2013 now everything is evenly lit unless you've got a torch.\"\nAnd so the original concept of the Sky Dimension was later rebranded as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;,\" a dark place fittingly referred to as the \"end of the game,\" home to the &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and a total conversion of the original idea.\nNotch tweeted much later that a different \"Skylands\" dimension probably was still in the making. This version, completely separate from the End, was set to replace the original idea. However, &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; later stated that returning the Sky Dimension was not planned and therefore is unlikely to be done.\nFor almost seven years until the release of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28biome%29\"&gt;the End's biome&lt;/a&gt; nomenclature remained as the last vestige of the scrapped Sky Dimension idea. Until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;, the only biome present in the End at the time was called \"Sky\"; the &lt;a href=\"resource%20location\"&gt;resource location&lt;/a&gt; for the biome remained codice_1 until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13-pre5\"&gt;1.13-pre5&lt;/a&gt;. Even the new biomes added for the End in &lt;a href=\"18w06a\"&gt;18w06a&lt;/a&gt; initially used codice_2 resource locations during development, before being changed to refer to the End instead.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; 1.13 to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.17.1\"&gt;1.17.1&lt;/a&gt;, it was possible to partially recreate the Sky Dimension through the &lt;a href=\"Buffet\"&gt;Buffet&lt;/a&gt; world type. This was done by choosing the \"Floating Islands\" world generation option (world type after &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt;) and picking any Overworld biome (any type of Forest, Plains, Swamp, or Jungle) as the World Terrain option. This created a partial recreation of what the Sky dimension might have looked like. However, the \u201cFloating Islands\u201d world type was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.18\"&gt;1.18&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16.2&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to create a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt; that adds a &lt;a href=\"custom%20dimension\"&gt;custom dimension&lt;/a&gt; set to use the codice_3 &lt;a href=\"Custom%20world%20generation%23Noise%20settings\"&gt;noise settings&lt;/a&gt; or a custom set of noise settings that generates floating terrain. This is the current in-game way to recreate what the Sky Dimension could have looked like.\nMod-enabled version.\nCode for a prototype of the Sky Dimension exists in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, the only thing preventing it from being fully functional is the absence of a means of generating it and getting there. Using various &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to access this currently unfinished version of the Sky Dimension.\nThe Sky Dimension can be accessed by modifying wr.class in beta 1.6.6, xa.class in beta 1.7.3, and acz.class in beta 1.8.1.\nIn this version of the Sky Dimension, the buildup of the world blocks-wise is very much like the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, but it is always midday and it does not &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Snowfall\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; (though cloud cover does appear as if it were raining). Like in the Overworld, there are &lt;a href=\"oak%20trees\"&gt;oak trees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flowers\"&gt;flowers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lakes\"&gt;lakes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"caves\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;, and you can also find &lt;a href=\"pumpkins\"&gt;pumpkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushrooms\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Although uncommon, it is also possible to find &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, and more rarely &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;. The only mobs that spawn in the sky dimension are &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s; no other mobs (including hostile ones and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;) spawn, except for monsters spawned by spawners in dungeons. Snow generates on surfaces above a certain altitude, similarly to mountain biomes, however, there is no weather in the Sky Dimension, so this snow is not renewable. Below the islands of the Sky Dimension is nothing but the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and a layer of &lt;a href=\"clouds\"&gt;clouds&lt;/a&gt;.\nBugs.\nOriginally, the Sky Dimension was hidden within the region 0 (Overworld) code. However, starting in Beta 1.9 Pre-release 3, it was given its own region: Region 2, with Region 1 being the Nether. However, Sky Dimension chunks stopped spawning within its region, they would generate in the Overworld on Multiplayer servers. This is most likely due to an issue with map generation and saving causing Sky Dimension chunks to save over Overworld chunks rather than being made in their own, separate map files like the Nether does. If a world with Sky Dimension chunks is brought from &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"singleplayer\"&gt;singleplayer&lt;/a&gt;, the area of the chunks will \"always\" be &lt;a href=\"Biomes%23Plains\"&gt;Plains&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Biomes\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, even if snow generated naturally on the ground.\nGallery.\nThe first released screenshots of the Sky Dimension:\nThe sky dimension far lands:"}

Cut copper slabs require at least a stone pickaxe. Wooden slabs can be mined with anything, but an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; is quickest.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, many stone-type slabs have different &lt;a href=\"Breaking%23Blocks%20by%20hardness\"&gt;hardness&lt;/a&gt; values (and thus, breaking time) compared to their full-block counterparts.\nMost slabs drop themselves when broken. However, , petrified oak slabs drop normal oak slabs.\nDouble slabs drop 2 of their respective single slabs, even when mined with Silk Touch. , double slabs are completely unobtainable. , they can be obtained through inventory editing.\nStonecutting.\nPetrified oak slabs are the stone-type wooden slabs left from before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.3.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.3.1&lt;/a&gt;. They are now unobtainable in vanilla survival.\nUsage.\nPlacement.\nSlabs can occupy either the top half or the bottom half of a block, or both:\nSlabs cannot be oriented vertically.\nBehavior.\n a single slab (top or bottom) is transparent to light, while a double slab is opaque. The empty half of a slab block is also transparent to mobs, unlike other transparent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, which players can see through but mobs cannot.\nA bottom placed on top of a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; is transparent to items; the items fall through the bottom slab into the hopper. Without a hopper attached below, a bottom slab behaves as a solid surface.\nFalling block entities (like sand, gravel, and concrete powder) turn into their dropped form if they land on a bottom slab, as when they fall on a torch.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s see a slab as a full block when pathfinding. They can spawn on top slabs and double slabs, but not on bottom slabs. This can be used to prevent mob spawning in certain areas, such as &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20farm\"&gt;mob farms&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenerally, the top face of top slabs, the bottom face of bottom slabs, and all faces of double slabs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, blocks that require a solid surface for placement can be placed on these faces.\nDouble slabs are handled as a single block instead of two different slabs; as such, breaking one destroys the whole block and drop two slabs, as opposed to breaking only one slab within the block. \"Double slabs\" that are not aligned to the grid (i.e. a bottom slab on top of a top slab) are handled as separate blocks and are broken individually.\nRedstone dust placed on a top slab receives signals from redstone dust one block lower and adjacent, but cannot transmit signals down to that block.\n, mobs standing on bottom slabs with air or another bottom slab below fail to pathfind correctly. They often end up spinning around in a small circle when they try to move.\nDue to the way blast rays propagate from an &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;, bottom slabs provide extremely effective absorption to explosions directly on top of them. In some cases, only the slab is destroyed from a TNT explosion directly on top of it. Explosions from &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s are also weakened.\n&lt;a href=\"Sneaking\"&gt;Sneaking&lt;/a&gt; reduces the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s hitbox height to 1.65 blocks , and so does not allow the player to walk over a bottom slab with one block of &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; above it, which is 1.5 blocks of space. , however, a crouching player's hitbox is exactly 1.5 blocks, allowing the player to fit through such a gap. A player cannot walk from a block of &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; directly up to a bottom slab without jumping \u2013 this applies not just to soul sand, but to &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Heights\"&gt;any block&lt;/a&gt; of a block high or shorter, because the maximum step height of the player is 0.6 of a block. The player can walk off a bottom slab while sneaking, because the sneaking prevents falling only when the distance is higher than one half block.\nIf a single slab is placed in a water source block, the empty half of that slab's block is waterlogged. If a slab is placed in flowing water, a pocket of air is created in the unfilled half of the block. If the player's head is in this pocket, the player can breathe and see as clearly as from an air block. If a single slab is placed in between two water sources or waterlogged blocks, the slab becomes waterlogged.

They attack by jumping at their targets, come in three sizes and larger slimes can split into smaller ones on death.\nSpawning.\nSlimes spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; in specific \"slime chunks\" below &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;layer&lt;/a&gt; 40, regardless of &lt;a href=\"Light%23Light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt;s. They can also spawn in swamp biomes between layers 51 and 69 (inclusive) in light levels of 7 or less, with these layers tending to be near the surface. Slimes spawn regardless of weather conditions.\nOnly sizes 1, 2, and 4 (NBT codice_1 tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally. With use of , slimes can potentially range from size 1 to 127 (NBT codice_1 tag 0\u2013126).\nLike most other hostile mobs, slimes do not spawn within 24 blocks (spherical) of any player, despawn over time if no player is within 32 blocks, and despawn instantly if no player is within the despawn radius (128 blocks , 44 to 128 blocks depending on &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt;).\nA slime needs roughly a 3\u00d72.1x3 free space to spawn. The area in which the slime spawns must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions. When a slime attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large slime, and the size is determined later. Therefore, since large slimes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no slimes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas. Also, since large slimes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 3\u00d72.1x3 area, even as thin as a &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;, can prevent a slime of any size from spawning.\nSlime size is affected by &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.\nSlimes can spawn on some light-emitting blocks:\nSwamps.\nIn swamps and mangrove swamps, slimes may spawn between the heights of 51 and 69 (inclusive) when the provided light level is 7 or less. They spawn most often on a &lt;a href=\"Moon%23Phases\"&gt;full moon&lt;/a&gt;, and never on a new moon.\nMore precisely, the game checks two factors:\nIf these conditions are met and the altitude is acceptable, there is a 50% chance of spawning a slime.\nThe light level requirement for slime spawning in swamps is different from that of most hostile mobs, which only spawn at light level 0.\n\"Slime chunks\".\nSlimes spawn throughout the world (except &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biomes) below level Y=40 \"regardless\" of light level, but only in certain &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s; of all chunks. \nJava Edition.\n, these \"slime chunks\" are determined pseudo-randomly by combining their chunk coordinates with the &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;seed of the world&lt;/a&gt;:\nimport java.util.Random; \npublic class checkSlimechunk {\n public static boolean isSlimeChunk(long worldSeed, int xPosition, int zPosition) {\n Random rnd = new Random(worldSeed\n + (int) (xPosition * xPosition * 0x4c1906)\n + (int) (xPosition * 0x5ac0db)\n + (int) (zPosition * zPosition) * 0x4307a7L\n + (int) (zPosition * 0x5f24f) ^ 0x3ad8025fL);\n return rnd.nextInt(10) == 0; \n public static void main(String args[]) { \n long seed = 12345L; // the seed from /seed as a 64bit long literal\n int xPosition = 123;\n int zPosition = 456;\n System.out.println(isSlimeChunk(seed, xPosition, zPosition));\nThat is, using the chunk coordinates to help generate a seed, a random number between 0 and 9 inclusive is generated. If that number is 0, the chunk can spawn slimes. To convert world coordinates to chunk coordinates, divide by 16 and round down. Note that are 32-bit integers (&lt;samp&gt;int&lt;/samp&gt;s).\nAs per &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.20.5\"&gt;Java Edition 1.20.5&lt;/a&gt; snapshot 24W13A, 2 slimes can spawn whenever any entity affected by &lt;a href=\"Oozing\"&gt;Oozing&lt;/a&gt; is killed.\nBedrock Edition.\nThe slime chunk algorithm is different from . The algorithm doesn't depend on the world seed, thus the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in inhabit the same coordinates for every world.\nDrops.\nIf a slime's size is 1, it drops 0-2 &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s unless killed by a &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;. This can be increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 5 slimeballs. When killed by a frog, it always drops 1 slimeball.\nSlimes also drop experience points equal to their size: for large slimes, for medium slimes, or for small slimes. Because slimes split into 2-4 smaller slimes when they die, a player can earn a possible maximum of 28 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; points from killing one large slime and all the slimes that split from it.\nBehavior.\nSlimes move by hopping, which they do every 10 to 30 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s ( to seconds), and can swim in water and climb ladders and scaffolding. Unlike other mobs, slimes continue moving when no players are nearby. Their exact routine is as follows:\nThe slime searches for a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; (or, failing that, an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;) within 16 blocks (spherical) distance.\nUnlike most &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, slimes do not pathfind towards their target, always approaching their target in a straight line, without avoiding environmental hazards such as &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; or dangerous falls. This means they can easily get stuck in corners or behind walls, not knowing how to circumvent them. This behavior is shared by &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA slime's maximum health is equal to its size squared, and its dimensions are 0.51 &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; times its size in each dimension. When a slime attacks, it deals damage equal to its size, except for size 1 (smallest) slimes, which do no damage, and do not prevent &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt;. Because small slimes still have a hostile AI, they continuously attack the player.\nA slime's jump distance also depends on its size; a slime jumps a distance slightly farther than its length. When landing, a number (8 times the slime's size) of slime particles appear. Slimes will always, regardless of size, jump 1 block high.\nWhen a slime larger than 1 dies, it spawns 2-4 new slimes equivalent to its size divided by 2, rounding down. A slime that was named with a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; produces smaller slimes with the same name when it dies.\nSlimes continuously damage all players and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golems\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt; they collide with (although &lt;a href=\"damage%20immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt; reduces the actual damage to 1 attack every half second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack.\nSlimes in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; attempt to swim to the surface if possible. If forced to stay submerged, they eventually drown, splitting into smaller slimes that drown and finally drop slimeballs.\nSounds.\nSlimes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nSlimes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nVideo.\nNote: This video is from 2012. Since then, slime spawning in swamps has been added to the game."}

It has both sticky and bouncy properties making it useful in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt; to move both blocks and entities.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nSlime blocks can be broken instantly, regardless of held items, or when under the &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nUsage.\nLanding on a slime block does not cause fall damage regardless of whether the player is sneaking.\u200c\nSlime blocks are also slightly slippery, but less so than &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlime blocks cause movement on top of them to slow down.\nBouncing.\nA player or mob that falls onto the top of a slime block bounces to a height proportional to the falling velocity. The bounce height quickly deteriorates. For example, a fall of 255 blocks produces a bounce height of about 50 blocks, while a fall of 50 blocks results in a bounce height of 22 blocks. The maximum bounce height is 57.625 blocks. Entities hitting the side of a slime block do not bounce, unless the slime block is moving using a piston.\nA player holding the key performs a normal jump on contact with the slime block without taking fall damage. A player holding does not bounce at all and takes fall damage.\nPlacing &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;s on a slime block does not stop mobs from bouncing and not taking fall damage. Likewise, placing a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; on a slime block does not stop mobs from bouncing, but the pressure plate still activates. Half-blocks such as &lt;a href=\"Cake\"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s stop the bouncing effect.\nMost mobs bounce off slime blocks. Exceptions are &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;bees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Parrot\"&gt;parrots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;vexes&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; may get stuck on a block when a player tries to spawn it on top of a slime block in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nItems, &lt;a href=\"falling%20block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s do not bounce on slime blocks. &lt;a href=\"Particle\"&gt;Particle&lt;/a&gt;s, however, do bounce. Players can also get around the fact that falling blocks, minecarts, and boats don't bounce by having sticky pistons with slime blocks bounce them.\nPistons.\nWhen being pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, entities (except &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s) that are ahead are launched into the direction the block is pushed into. When pulled by a piston, no entities are launched.\nWhen a slime block is pushed or pulled by a piston, it attempts to move all adjacent blocks in the same direction. The types of blocks that can be moved are the same as those that can be \"pulled\" by a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;. Blocks that cannot be pulled by a sticky piston (i.e. all the blocks listed on the &lt;a href=\"Piston%23Limitations\"&gt;table on the pistons page&lt;/a&gt;) stay in place. The blocks that are moved may in turn push other blocks. For example, a slime block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which pushes additional ground blocks in the direction of motion just as if it were being pushed directly by a piston.\nBlocks such as &lt;a href=\"glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s are exceptions; they do not move when adjacent slime blocks are moved, even if they are normally pushable by a piston.\nWhen the adjacent block that is moved is also a slime block, that block attempts to move all its adjacent blocks. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled as a unit by a single piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube and attempts to move all blocks adjacent to the cube.\nA slime block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons ignores the immobile block. However, if an adjacent block \"could\" be moved but is prevented by the presence of an immobile block, the slime block is also prevented from moving. This includes slime blocks being pulled rather than pushed, in which case the piston retracts without pulling anything. &lt;a href=\"Liquid\"&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;s are an exception: they aren't moved, but neither do they stop a piston from pushing or pulling blocks into their space (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-75581\"&gt;usually destroying the liquid, and in a rare case displacing it through the piston&lt;/a&gt;).\nSlime blocks are not pulled by a non-sticky piston, nor are they moved if an adjacent (non-slime) block is moved by a piston.\nThe maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d73 of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled by a sticky piston as long as no other movable blocks are adjacent to it.\nA piston cannot move itself via a \"loop\" constructed of slime blocks, but &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Flying%20machines\"&gt;self-propelled contraptions&lt;/a&gt; can be created with multiple pistons."}

However, it can be crafted and can also be found in &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; chests. Suspicious stew can be given with &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; like , but , unless NBT data like that listed in the data values section is included, consuming it has no effect and still restores the same hunger points as a normal suspicious stew. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, giving the player a suspicious stew through commands causes the stew to choose an allowable status effect at random.\nHarvesting.\nSuspicious stew can be obtained by \"milking\" a brown &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; after using a small flower on it. When a small flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that small flower the next time it is milked with a bowl. Red mooshrooms do not produce suspicious stew. The brown mooshroom returns to producing &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt; until fed another small flower.\nCrafting.\nSuspicious stew is not listed in the recipe book. However, it can be quickly assembled by clicking the &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt; recipe and adding one small flower to it.\nMob loot.\nAfter being given a flower, a brown &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt; can be \"milked\" for suspicious stew by a &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; on it. The flower type determines the stew's effect using the same rule as a crafted stew. Milking a red mooshroom after feeding it a flower does not yield a suspicious stew specific to that flower.\nTrading.\n, expert-level farmer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s can offer either 1 or 2 suspicious stew trades, each stew for one &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\n, expert-level farmer villager offers to sell suspicious stew for one emerald as well.\nThe &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; interface does not indicate the type of suspicious stew being sold, but each trade entry consistently yields the same type of stew, so the player can remember or make a note of the types offered by a given villager, such as \"this villager's first stew gives &lt;a href=\"blindness\"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;, and their second entry gives saturation\".\nUsage.\nFood.\nTo eat suspicious stew, press and hold while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores hunger and 7.2 hunger &lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Mechanics\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt; and gives a few seconds of a &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; that varies depending on which flower was used to craft it. The effect is not displayed in the tooltip, texture, etc., meaning that the player cannot know in advance what the effect is without knowing which flower was used.\nThe &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; is emptied and returned to the player after the suspicious stew has been eaten, and can be re-used to craft more stews. Unlike most foods, suspicious stew can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is full.\nThe Saturation effect effectively makes those two stews a superfood: In those 6 or 7 ticks it can restore up to 6(7) hunger and 12(14) saturation points \"on top of\" their food value, for a total of at least hunger, and effectively maximizing saturation. This is the largest amount of hunger and saturation the player can get from a single food item. Regeneration can restore up to health, and Poison or Wither can inflict up to damage.\nData values.\nItem data.\n, suspicious stew uses the following NBT data:\nMetadata.\n, suspicious stew uses the following data values:"}

Swamps can be found in many temperature clusters with the exception of snowy regions. Swamps never directly border the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, with some other biomes generating between them instead. But their water bodies are often connected to the ocean.\nSwamps have elevations low enough to go below sea level throughout much of the area. A large portion of swamps are flooded, where patches of &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; are found on the lakebed. The shores of swamps may have marsh-like terrain, where the shores are very irregular, often without smooth transition, and with some small puddles generated. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; in swamps takes on a gray-green color.\n&lt;a href=\"Lily%20pad\"&gt;Lily pad&lt;/a&gt;s dot the surfaces of waters, which are found exclusively in swamp biomes. &lt;a href=\"Dead%20bush\"&gt;Dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es dot the surfaces of lands. Swamp biomes, alongside &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s, can generate &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, fairly rare structures found underground.\nUnlike other &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; biomes, swamps have varying tints for &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, etc. See &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Special%20plant%20tints\"&gt;Biome#Special plant tints&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnderwater &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; is thick here so that visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater.\n&lt;a href=\"Slime\"&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn in swamps at nighttime, exclusively between Y=50 and Y=70, making swamps the only places aboveground where slimes can be found.

While villagers have swamp-specific types, no &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; featuring exclusively these villagers can be generated.

The floor is mainly composed of mud blocks with occasional grass block or dirt &lt;a href=\"disk\"&gt;disk&lt;/a&gt;s. , unlike most of overworld biomes, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s do not generate here. The grass has the same color as the normal swamp but leaves and vines have a unique light green tint and the water is teal rather than gray. Warm frogs and tropical fish are the only passive animals that spawn in this biome. &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20hut\"&gt;Swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;s do not generate here.\nMangrove swamps are featuring very dense &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20tree\"&gt;mangrove tree&lt;/a&gt;s which vary a lot in height. &lt;a href=\"Seagrass\"&gt;Seagrass&lt;/a&gt; litters the bottom of flooded areas in both and .\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Swamp or in the Mangrove Swamp."}

There is a small platform outside of the hut that could be an entrance; however, it is several blocks above the ground, and there are no stairs that go up to the hut, although vines can generate from the front platform and down to the ground.

As result, the player can perform a sweep attack while they are sprinting diagonally but it is impossible to perform a sweep attack at the same time as a critical hit or while riding some &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;. All enemies within a 1 by 0.25 by 1 block area of any part of the attacked mob, whose feet are at most 3 blocks away from the player's feet, are affected.\nDamage.\nThe formula for sweep attack damage is: codice_1, rounded to the nearest integer. Here, the \"Attack_Damage\" is the sword's damage after applying &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt;. For example, an iron sword enchanted only with Sweeping Edge I deals codice_2 damage to each mob hit with a sweep attack. A diamond sword enchanted with Sharpness V and Sweeping Edge III deals codice_3 sweep damage. Any sword without Sweeping Edge deals codice_4 sweep damage. Extra damage from Smite and Bane of Arthropods is applied against undead mobs and arthropod mobs, respectively.\nHigher levels than Sweeping Edge III (obtainable via the use of &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; or third party editors) is processed following the formula above and the sweep damage caps beneath 100% of sword's attack damage.\nEnemies damaged through Sweeping Edge that are not directly hit by the sword are not affected by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if multiple enemies are damaged by sweeping edge, only the first enemy struck will be affected by Fire Aspect."}

Its first growth stage is a small bush without any berries. It becomes a grown plant in its second stage, and produces berries in its third and fourth growth stage. The bush needs to be in light level 9 or greater to grow. &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on it increases its growth stage by one, and at full maturity, ejects the sweet berry item.

A sword is made from one of six materials, in order of increasing quality and expense: wood, gold, stone, iron, diamond and netherite.\nObtaining.\nRepairing.\nUnit repair.\nA sword can be repaired in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; by adding units of the &lt;a href=\"tiers\"&gt;tiers&lt;/a&gt;' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the sword's maximum durability, rounded down.\nMob loot.\nSome &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; can spawn with a sword and have an 8.5% chance of dropping them upon death caused by player. This chance is increased by 1% per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, up to a maximum of 11.5% with Looting III. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s can drop iron swords, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s can drop golden swords, and &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s can drop stone swords. The dropped sword is usually badly damaged and may be enchanted. Stone swords dropped by wither skeletons are never enchanted.\nA &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt; wields an iron sword that normally has a 0% chance of dropping, because their main hand's codice_1 is 0. However, this chance increases by 1 percentage point per level of Looting. It is never damaged and may be enchanted.\n, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn from raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% chance on hard mode) of dropping a damaged iron sword. This sword has a 50% chance of being enchanted.\nTrading.\n, an apprentice-level weaponsmith villagers sells enchanted iron swords for at least 7-21 emeralds, and a master-level weaponsmith sells enchanted diamond swords for at least 13-27 emeralds.\n, a novice-level weaponsmith villager has a chance of selling an enchanted iron sword for at least 7-22 emeralds. A master-level weaponsmith offers to sell an enchanted diamond sword for at least 11\u201327 emeralds.\nThe enchantments of the swords offered by villagers are the same as the ones obtained from an &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt; at levels 5\u201319.\nUsage.\nAttacking.\nPressing while holding a sword inflicts damage on both mobs and other players. Upon damaging a mob or player, the sword's &lt;a href=\"Item%20Durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; decreases by 1.\nAttacking a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; with a sword stone tier or higher instantly destroys it , without decreasing the sword's durability. Otherwise, it requires 2 hits, with neither decreasing durability.\nSweeping.\nIf the attack recharge meter is 84.8% or above and the player is on the ground standing or moving slower than the &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; speed in a straight line, the sword performs a sweeping attack indicated by a gale &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; that reaches nearby enemies for and knocks them back; the amount of knockback is 80% that of the basal knockback and does not benefit from the &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. As result, the player can perform a sweep attack while they are sprinting diagonally but it is impossible to perform a sweep attack at the same time as a critical hit or while riding some &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;. All enemies within an 1 by 0.25 by 1 block area of any part of the attacked mob and whose feet are 3 or less blocks away from player's feet are affected. The &lt;a href=\"sweeping%20edge\"&gt;sweeping edge&lt;/a&gt; enchantment increases the damage dealt by 50% of the normal hit damage for level I, 67% for level II and 75% for level III.\nDamage.\nJava Edition.\nSwords have an attack speed of 1.6 and take 0.625 seconds to &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Attack%20cooldown\"&gt;recover&lt;/a&gt;. \nBedrock Edition.\n, swords have no attack cooldown or sweep attack, and deal the following damage:\nThe most amount of damage that a sword enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt; V can do is 11 and 15.25 , without critical hits.\nSword breaking times.\nA sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.\nIf a sword is enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, either using &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, cobwebs the sword destroys will drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string. This is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.\nThe following table shows the time it takes to break blocks on which swords have any effect. Colors indicate what gets dropped:\nSafety around constructions.\nIn Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, care must still be taken around &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s; these are entities, thus can be broken with swords in Creative.\nEnchantments.\nSwords can receive, gathered from mob drops/villager trades or be found in various loot chests (example: End City, Bastion Remnant)with the following &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s:\nGolden swords have the highest enchantability, yet the least durability\nFuel.\nWooden swords can be used as fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1 item per sword.\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s are attracted to golden swords, run toward any golden swords on the ground and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; slot.\nHistory.\nBlocking.\n \nPreviously, since the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Update\"&gt;Adventure Update&lt;/a&gt;, all types of swords could be used to parry to block some forms of damage. If the player is blocking with a sword when attacked, the sword deflects 50% of incoming damage from melee, non-magical projectiles like arrows, and explosions, along with minimizing airborne knockback. The sword is held in front of the player and its durability is not reduced by blocking. The player moves at a slower rate than &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; if blocking with a sword. Sword blocks could be engaged and disengaged instantly, with no delay between the input and damage mitigation nor cooldown between lowering a block and raising a new one.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Update\"&gt;Combat Update&lt;/a&gt;, the sword blocking functionality was replaced by blocking with &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s and to accommodate the &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt; system. Shields negate more damage and knockback than sword blocking from \"blockable\" attacks (they block 100% damage and knockback after &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.11\"&gt;Java Edition 1.11&lt;/a&gt;), but, unlike swords, they lose durability, have a 0.25 second startup period before damage can be mitigated and can be temporarily disabled by attacks with an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnockback.\nThe knockback dealt by swords used to be higher than while the players are using another melee &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, like an axe or with the hands. This feature was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt; and is also no longer used in \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReferences.\n "}

{"id": "40534", "revid": "52418088", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=40534", "title": "TNT", "text": "TNT is a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; that can be activated by a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;Redstone signal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, stray &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, flaming projectile or &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrimed TNT is a gravity-affected &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; that produces a damaging, block-destroying &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; after a few seconds.\nObtaining.\nTNT can be broken instantly with any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, or without a tool. Primed TNT cannot be broken as it is an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be removed with the command. \nNatural generation.\nNine TNT blocks occur naturally in each &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo TNT blocks flank a &lt;a href=\"trapped%20chest\"&gt;trapped chest&lt;/a&gt; in one secret &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; room.\nUsage.\nTNT blocks can be primed by:\nBehavior.\nOnce primed, TNT turns into an entity, which includes being affected by gravity. The new primed TNT is spawned at the center (+0.5,+0.5,+0.5) of where the TNT block was, like a cube with an edge length of 0.98. Its fuse lasts 40 &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Redstone%20tick\"&gt;redstone ticks&lt;/a&gt; (4 seconds/80 game ticks) if activated by &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, or a random number between 10 and 30 game ticks (0.5 to 1.5 seconds) if it is destroyed by another &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce spawned, primed TNT is given a vertical velocity of 0.2\u00a0blocks per tick, and a horizontal velocity of 0.02\u00a0blocks per tick in a random direction. Given these velocities, the TNT travels 0.166 blocks (or 6 block pixels) horizontally before it stops, given there is no block in the way. When the countdown timer expires, the TNT explodes. If in the air, TNT falls roughly 77 blocks before exploding once it is ignited. The explosion has an explosive force of 4. \nPrimed TNT's texture blinks, alternating every 0.5 seconds between the TNT block's texture, and a copy of it that has been brightened to near-white. The effect is dynamic and the brightened texture can't be found in the assets.\nPrimed TNT cannot be pushed by players or other mobs, but it moves when in flowing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. Primed TNT cannot mount &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen primed TNT detonates while in water or lava, it does not break any blocks. It does still damage players, mobs, and other entities. Primed TNT that detonates outside water can still damage submerged blocks.\nTo make TNT destroy blocks in the water, e.g. to enter an &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt; from the top, one can place sand or gravel on the TNT before it is primed. Priming the TNT causes the sand or gravel to fall one block, engulfing the TNT. Because the TNT is no longer immersed in water, it can destroy the surrounding blocks.\nPrimed TNT is not teleported when entering a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;; instead, it passes through portal blocks. Primed TNT teleports as expected when entering an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining its direction and speed. The fuse timer keeps counting down (unless the spawn chunks are unloaded, then it pauses until a player loads the chunks).\nIf the TNT is primed atop any sort of fence post that is two blocks high or larger, it falls through the fence block on which it was activated and stops on the next lower one. Its detonation damages only the fence block it was \"stuck\" in.\n primed TNT summoned by a &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; explodes immediately because the fuse time defaults to zero if not specified.\nRedstone component.\nFor &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; to activate TNT, it must either lead directly to the TNT, or power an adjacent block.\nSounds.\nUnique.\nPrimed TNT use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nTNT has entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity."}

The folders' names are listed below.\nOne exception is function tag. Functions are not registry entries, but function tags can be defined at .\nTags are not only used by players. \"Minecraft\" itself also uses tags. For example, vanilla block tags are used for various block behaviors, vanilla item tags are used for various item behaviors, vanilla &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt; files and vanilla &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; files, and vanilla entity type tags are used for various mob behaviors.

These can be cut into 16 Bit items each.\nTo be able to proceed from here the codice_1 vote must be approved. Bits can be used in a crafting table to craft Left Curly, Right Curly, Left Square, and Right Square. In appears like these are the only tag items that can be crafted from Bits.\nA &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; can be used to convert a \"Tag\" item into a \"Byte Tag.\" The amount of &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s added to the crafting recipe specifies the value of the Byte, as a . For example, a \"Tag\" and a full stack of sticks make a Byte with the value codice_2, while 255 sticks result in codice_3. Only one of the sticks is consumed. Two Bytes can be crafted into a \"Short Tag\" (equivalent to 16 bit), two Shorts into an \"Int Tag\" (equivalent to 32 bit), and two Ints into a \"Long Tag\" (equivalent to 64 bit). Many other combinations that form either 16, 32, or 64 bit are possible. For example, two Shorts and an Int make a Long. When combining values, their digits are stuck together in the given order, e.g. codice_4 and codice_5 make codice_6 (equivalent to 010016 in ). Undoing any of these crafting actions in e.g. a stonecutter is not possible.\n\"Float\" and \"Double Tags\" can be crafted by adding one or two &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s to any numeric tag. A \"String Tag\" is crafted with a \"Tag\" and a piece of &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Name\" and \"String Tags\" must be named in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; before they can be used. Unnamed Names and Strings always produce a \"Sssyntax Error\". None of the other tag items can be named.\nAll these items can be combined in a crafting table to form a short sequence of JSON code, as long as the resulting syntax is valid. For example: \nThe resulting Compound and List Tags can be used as values in other Compound and List Tags, as deeply nested as you want.\nUsage.\nTags appear to have no further functionality. They cannot be eaten or placed in the world, except in an item frame, as each other item can. However, Compound Tags with values like codice_11 will show the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; glint and actually act accordingly when used. This appears to work with many weapon and tool &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%23Summary%20of%20enchantments%20by%20item\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn theory, an extremely lucky codice_12 vote can change the crafting recipe for compound tags to output something else. When cheats are enabled you can test this with a command like codice_13. However, as long as this vote is approved no other compound tag can be crafted. Use codice_14 to undo all recipe replacements.\nIn combination with the codice_15 vote tag items can be converted into &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ingot\"&gt;gold ingots&lt;/a&gt;. These retain their NBT data. When the world is loaded in another version of the game tag items disappear, but gold ingots persist."}

The &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt; also includes &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"poppies\"&gt;poppies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt;es and takes an aqua hue. The &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; coloration has an unique dark-turquiose tone in .\nOnly spruces are natural to taigas, compared to oak and birch trees in regular &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to the structure of spruce trees, more tall than wide, the foliage is less dense, but still dense enough to possibly get &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s lost. \nTaigas are most commonly bordered by &lt;a href=\"old%20growth%20taiga\"&gt;old growth taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grove\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;s, and regular &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s, and often separated from &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;Rainfall&lt;/a&gt; changes to &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt; above layer Y=160\u00b18 within taigas due to the cold climate. \n&lt;a href=\"Outpost\"&gt;Outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"trail%20ruins\"&gt;trail ruins&lt;/a&gt; generate in taigas occasionally; villages are made of spruce wood appropriately and often contain pumpkin farms. Villages can also serve as a handy refuge and as a &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; post should one be found.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in taigas, though rabbits are not often seen due to wolves chasing after them and killing them. \nTaigas are one of the most preferred biomes to start out in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode. The abundance of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, grassy terrain and useful &lt;a href=\"passive%20mobs\"&gt;passive mobs&lt;/a&gt; make this biome easy for players. Taigas share the same dangers of forests, however; a player can get lost within the trees easily if they don't mark their trails and the foliage can lead to obstructed vision, especially at night. \nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a"}

Once tamed, these animals will follow the player unless told to sit. Tamed wolves will start fighting alongside their master. Tamed wolves and cats can be bred, and they stop hunting animals by themselves. Tamed parrots can ride on the player's shoulder and mimic nearby mob sounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Horses\"&gt;Horses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"donkeys\"&gt;donkeys&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mules\"&gt;mules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"llamas\"&gt;llamas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trader%20Llama\"&gt;trader llamas&lt;/a&gt; can be tamed by repeatedly mounting the animal until it stops bucking the player off. Feeding them &lt;a href=\"%23Special%20items\"&gt;their favorite foods&lt;/a&gt; makes taming them easier. Once tamed, these animals can be bred and given equipment. Tamed horses, donkeys and mules can be controlled while riding, but only if equipped with a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;. , skeleton horses do not need a saddle to be controlled while riding. &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20horses\"&gt;Skeleton horses&lt;/a&gt; can be tamed by the player if the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; rider is killed. &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20horses\"&gt;Zombie horses&lt;/a&gt; normally cannot be tamed, but they can be tamed using &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrusting.\nSome mobs can never be tamed per se, but the player can still gain their trust. Trusting mobs stop fleeing from players, and they do not despawn.\nAn &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;'s trust can be gained by tempting them with a &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20tropical%20fish\"&gt;bucket of tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;, while catching them in a bucket prevents them from despawning. A trusting axolotl will follow the player into battle and grant them buffs if they help the axolotl fight.\nA &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;'s trust actually can't be gained if the animal spawned naturally, but they can still be bred by the player. Fox kits bred this way will trust players. A trusting fox will defend the player against a number of mobs.\nAn &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;'s trust can be gained by feeding it raw cod or salmon. \nAn &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s trust can be gained by giving it any block or item. A trusting allay will search for and pick up items that match the one it is holding, then deliver them to the player or a recently triggered &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other trustable mobs, allays can be \"un-trusted\" by taking their item from them.\nSpecial items.\nThese are the foods and other items that are helpful in taming animals or otherwise gaining their trust."}

A target can be hit with any of the projectiles mentioned above.\nThe strength of the signal depends on how close the projectile is to the center of the block, from 1 to 15.\nThe target also provides a block update when hit, meaning that an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; can detect if the target has been hit and has produced a redstone signal.\nWhen used as part of a redstone circuit, a target has the unique property that, though being an &lt;a href=\"opacity\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block that is not a mechanism component, still can redirect adjacent &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; to point to itself.\nHistory.\n "}

One or more entities can be selected with a target selector variable, and targets can be filtered from the selection based on certain criteria using the target selector arguments.\nTarget selector variables.\nA target selector variable identifies the broad category of targets to select. There are five (six , eight ) variables:\nTarget selector arguments.\nAfter a target selector, optional arguments can be used to narrow down the set of targets to a group that also matches certain criteria. When used with codice_8 or codice_9, arguments narrow down the targets from the full list to a specific group. When used with codice_1 or codice_3, the nearest or random player is selected from the group. When used with codice_10, the player using the command is targeted only if they would be in the narrowed group.\nArgument-value pairs appear within square brackets after the target selector variable, separated by commas:\n, arguments and values are case-sensitive. Spaces are allowed around the brackets, equal signs, and commas, except between the target variable and the first bracket. Commas must be used to separate argument-value pairs.\nIf there are multiple argument-value pairs, they all must be satisfied to add a potential target to the group.

Any valid selector can be used in this command argument.\nA single-type selector is a selector that can only select one target, including: \nIf a command argument requires a single-type selector, but the entered argument is not in single-type, The command is unparseable."}

This is geometrically the most accurate calculation. However, the square root calculation is processor intensive, particularly on mobile devices that may have slow processors. Too many processor-intensive operations performed during a &lt;a href=\"Tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt; can introduce lag in the game.\nTaxicab distance.\nThe taxicab distance is a less accurate but faster calculation that can be done many times during a game tick. It eliminates the square root and squaring operations by simply calculating the absolute value (positive value) of the difference between each coordinate value:\nIn \"Minecraft\", the most obvious consequence of this calculation is that a taxicab \"circle\" drawn with a constant taxicab radius appears as a square whose vertices are in the directions of the axes (such as torch illumination), in which the taxicab radius equals the Euclidean radius only in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west), and the radius is shorter in all other directions. Similarly, in three dimensions, a taxicab \"sphere\" appears as an .\nChebyshev distance.\nChebyshev distance is rarely used in the game. It is the maximum absolute difference between two points in one of three axes:\nA \"circle\" drawn with a Chebyshev-distance radius would appear as a square, and a \"sphere\" would appear as a cube.\nComputationally, Chebyshev distance isn't any more efficient than taxicab distance, but it is useful for effects that need to happen in a square area or cuboid volume from a center coordinate.\nUsage in \"Minecraft\".\nTaxicab.\n\"Minecraft\" makes use of taxicab distance in various situations:\nEuclidean.\nSituations in which \"Minecraft\" calculates Euclidean distance:\nChebyshev.\nSituations in which \"Minecraft\" calculates Chebshyev distance:"}

On an &lt;a href=\"amplified\"&gt;amplified&lt;/a&gt; world, hills are extremely common in all biomes except &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMountain.\nMountains are high elevation terrain that has jagged peaks and higher land.\nCliff.\nCliffs are steep vertical slopes that can sometimes generate beside an ocean or a big lake. \nFjord.\nFjords happen when rivers cut through high-medium elevation terrain. Rivers are deeper here than usual.\nFloating island.\nFloating islands are structures that float in mid-air. Floating islands are normally just small chunks of floating &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; found near cliffs, but on rare occasions they can be large structures that even have springs and &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s on them. Floating islands are most frequently found in &lt;a href=\"windswept%20hills\"&gt;windswept hills&lt;/a&gt; biomes and their variants, as well &lt;a href=\"windswept%20savanna\"&gt;windswept savanna&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSurface.\nSurface layer.\nThe uppermost layers of the terrain are converted to a biome-dependent material: usually grass blocks and dirt, or sand in deserts and beaches. Podzol is found in giant tree taiga, mycelium in mushroom field biomes, and red sand is found in the badlands biome. Sandstone is generated under the sand.\nErosion.\nOccasionally, instead of being converted to dirt or sand, the top layer is stripped away, leaving an 'erosion' (aka. 'basin') of bare &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;. They occur more often in forests or plains and occasionally contain water. Commonly, minerals can be found in these, generally &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;. If generated in a Badlands biome, &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore\"&gt;gold ore&lt;/a&gt; can also be seen.\nStrip.\nStrips are long stretches of blocks in certain biomes that replace the typical surface materials in these biomes. They can occur in &lt;a href=\"stony%20shore\"&gt;stony shore&lt;/a&gt; biomes as strips of &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"stony%20peaks\"&gt;stony peaks&lt;/a&gt; biomes as strips of &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"frozen%20peaks\"&gt;frozen peaks&lt;/a&gt; biomes as strips of &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in &lt;a href=\"grove\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt; biomes as strips of &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoodoo.\nHoodoos are tall spike-like structures found in badlands, consisting of six colors of terracotta. While this structure is found exclusively in &lt;a href=\"eroded%20badlands\"&gt;eroded badlands&lt;/a&gt;, all badlands biomes actually have this structure, but set to false except for eroded badlands and can occasionally pass altitude layer 100.\nIceberg.\nAn iceberg is a large terrain feature composed of &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; and snow block. There is also a feature known as an iceberg, see &lt;a href=\"Iceberg%20%28feature%29\"&gt;Iceberg (feature)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIcebergs generate in &lt;a href=\"frozen%20ocean\"&gt;frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"deep%20frozen%20ocean\"&gt;deep frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt;s. They consist of &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt;, and can be topped with &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;. Icebergs generate in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from small islands to giant mountain-like icebergs. They can also generate with cave-like holes in them, which sometimes pass through to the other side of the iceberg.\nThere are often &lt;a href=\"Iceberg%20%28feature%29%23Blue%20ice%20feature\"&gt;blue ice feature&lt;/a&gt;s attached to them.\nThe Nether.\nLava sea.\nLava seas are found at and below &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;level 31&lt;/a&gt; in the Nether. They make a large portion of the Nether and are extremely common. They can stretch for hundreds of blocks in any direction, and are usually bordered by &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, or occasionally &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Block\"&gt;magma blocks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Strider\"&gt;Strider&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn in lava seas.\nUnlike with &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; oceans, lava seas are not handled as a biome.\nNether erosions.\nIn the Nether, erosions generate the same size and shape as they do in the Overworld. Unlike their Overworld counterparts, however, Nether erosions replace the ground with &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; instead of stone. Nether erosions can also expose ores, mainly &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz%20ore\"&gt;nether quartz ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotably, erosions generate independent of the y-coordinate; if a erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang.\nThe End.\nCentral island.\nThe center of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt;, floating in the void. At a distance of 1000 blocks away, an endless expanse of more islands begins, away from the main island. These consist of large islands, about the size of the main island, and smaller ones, which are usually thin and small.\nOuter island.\nThe outer end islands are found 1000 blocks away from the central island. They vary in size from large islands to smaller \"mini islands\". Generated structures such as &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"end%20ships\"&gt;end ships&lt;/a&gt; spawn here, along with &lt;a href=\"chorus%20plant\"&gt;chorus plant&lt;/a&gt;s and erosions. The player can be taken to the end islands through the &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;.\nObsidian platform.\nThe obsidian platform is a square of obsidian that generates when an entity enters &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnd erosions.\nErosions generate in the End as they would in the Overworld and the Nether, with the exception being that they never expose any ores. End erosions may generate on both the central island and outer islands, and &lt;a href=\"chorus%20plant\"&gt;chorus plant&lt;/a&gt;s can occasionally take root in the erosions."}

Soul soil can be used to produce blue fire and can be used for decoration, since it looks much smoother than soul sand. Soul soil can also allow you to run faster with Soul Speed, however unlike soul sand it will not produce upwards bubble columns and not use to grow nether wart, and that makes it ideal for producing speed tunnels. Soul soil otherwise can only be obtained via mining in soul sand valleys, however that biome is dangerous and uncommon.\nConcept.\nFirst of all, you will need an unlimited supply of soul sand, which can be obtained via piglin bartering, and wood (which can be obtained from tree farms). Use the soul sand and wood to craft soul campfires, and break those campfires without Silk Touch to get soul soil. Then you can repeat the process with more soul sand and wood.\nWhile sounding fairly simple for manual farming, it is considerably hard to automate because of crafting it, placing it and breaking it. Crafting it and placing it already relies on player interaction, and in Bedrock Edition they are not stackable, so that makes it more annoying to automate. Breaking it will rely on TNT duplication or a wither chamber if you play on Java Edition, and on Bedrock you will need to break it yourself."}
{"id": "3243", "revid": "47038272", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3243", "title": "Tutorials/Sound directory", "text": "This tutorial will help you locate and extract the sound directory, where the &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; for are stored.\nSound directory (after 1.7.2).\nThe sound file for versions after 1.7.2 is located in the indexes directory:\n1.8 macOS: codice_1\n1.11 macOS: codice_2\nThe sound files in version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;1.7.2&lt;/a&gt; (specifically &lt;a href=\"13w42a\"&gt;13w42a&lt;/a&gt;) and above are scattered and hashed into different folders, which are located in:\nLocating specific sound files.\nFind the folder \"indexes\", which is found under the same \"assets\" folder as \"objects\", where the sound files are indexed and logged in the &lt;a href=\"sounds.json\"&gt;sounds.json&lt;/a&gt; file. Select the version you want and open the sounds.json file with a program that supports it, such as Notepad. Programs such as Notepad++ are recommended to help make the file more readable. Once opened, you may find something that looks like this:\nFrom this, we can determine that codice_6 is hashed (or labeled) as codice_7. Perform a search in the directory \"objects\" under \"assets\" and you should find a file with the same exact string; this is the file \"menu1.ogg\", one of the pieces of music that plays on the menu screen. The first two letters of the file name (\"c1\") will match the folder that the file is in as well; knowing this can help locate specific files faster.\nAfter locating the file, you can test it to make sure it is the right one by playing it with a media player that is able to play .ogg sound files. If the media player you have cannot play the file, try renaming it with \".ogg\" at the end. If this fails too, then it either means the media player you use does not have a proper .ogg extension to play the sound, or the file you found is not a sound file.\n\"Note:\" If you accidentally edit or remove the file from the original directory, the launcher will automatically re-download it again the next time you launch the game. (You must be connected to the Internet when you launch the game. If not, then the sound directory will not be reset and could potentially lead to errors.)\nExtracting \"Minecraft\" sounds using Node.js.\nThis is probably the simplest way to extract the sound files with original effections.\nvar fs = require('fs-extra')\nvar objects = require('./indexes/1.19.json').objects\nfor (var filePath in objects) {\n if (!/\\/(?:sounds)\\//.test(filePath)) continue\n if (!/\\/(?:ambient|block|damage|dig|enchant|entity|event|fire|fireworks|item|liquid|minecart|mob|music|note|portal|random|records|step|title|ui)\\//.test(filePath)) continue\n var copyPath = filePath.replace('minecraft/', './')\n var hash = objects[filePath].hash\n var objectPath = './objects/' + hash.substring(0, 2) + '/' + hash\n console.log(objectPath, '-&gt;', copyPath)\n fs.copySync(objectPath, copyPath)\n@echo off\nnpm install fs-extra -y&amp;node extract-music.js&amp;pause\nMake sure the file extensions are and and not when you rename it! In other words, remove your old file extension. You may be warned that changing a file name extension could make the file unusable. However, this actually indicates that you have renamed it correctly. It will work if you keep it .txt as example, but it's probably nicer to have it for what it is for.\nIf you are using Microsoft Windows and can't see file extensions, for Windows 10, you can turn them on by going to the \"View\" menu of the file explorer and checking the check box for file name extensions. For Windows beneath Windows 10, you can uncheck \"hide extensions\" in folder settings.\nExtracting \"Minecraft\" sounds though changing file type.\nThis method may be by far the most simple and requires no third-party application, but may require admin permission on your computer to pull off.

{"id": "1927", "revid": "44196195", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1927", "title": "Tutorials/Spawn jail", "text": "A &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; jail is a player-created structure that can be built on &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"servers\"&gt;servers&lt;/a&gt; that traps newly spawned &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s. It can be used as a security check for new arrivals, or as a server lock for when there are no operators online.\nDescription.\nIn recent versions of the game, the &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; in multiplayer servers spans a large region of space (possibly 17x17) and so building spawn jails is more difficult. It can still be done by determining the spawn area and building a floor and walls out of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use /gamerule spawnRadius 0 to get around this!\nRarely, servers create a closed box that has no windows or gaps so they cannot see outside. Sometimes they spawn in a dark room with mobs.\nFunction.\nNew arrivals spawn inside the box and cannot escape until released by an &lt;a href=\"operator\"&gt;operator&lt;/a&gt;. If there are no operators or administrators inside the room, the spawn jail effectively closes the server, meaning no one can enter when the room is not managed. This is an anti-&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; measure: each new arrival feels scrutinized, may be followed once allowed out, and knows that the room is policed, purportedly making them less likely to grief. The viewing window can yield whether or not the player is a premium owner of \"Minecraft\"\u2013a demographic who are not expected to be griefers due to their monetary commitment to the game.\nOther variants.\nSometimes, a spawn jail is more of a \"spawn maze\" where a maze built of bedrock starts at the spawn point and acts as an intelligence test for new arrivals; they must find the end of the maze in order to access the room properly. Maze generators can be found on the internet.\nSome servers may have an entire section fenced off by &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. This is so the admins can let players on the server when no admins are online. It may also provide more selective server entrance policies, only letting those with good building talent or a premium membership in.\nProblems.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;, if spawn jails are larger than one square block, then it is possible to break out of it. This does not work in later versions of \"Minecraft\". Simply by pressing , moving aside, then placing a block at the place you pressed enter, will get you out of the spawn jail (by pressing to re&lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;). Fortunately, most servers ban people who build in spawn jails. Using cheats can also allow you to break out of a spawn jail, where this is also frowned upon.\nThis problem can be fixed by creating a net of 1x1x2 rooms that the players move up into when they try to escape. Since a room like this would have no viewing window it would leave people who try to escape stuck and would need to rejoin.\nIf there is a room with &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; as a ceiling, it would also be better to put the spawn jail at the top. When a player respawns and there is a block on top of the spawning point, that player will be transported over the top of the map, trapping him, and will have to rejoin. Unfortunately, if the player places the block at the spawn block, anyone else who joins will be stuck. Also, note that this method would only work with cave maps or closed underwater maps. The jail buildings with &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt; are optional."}

{"id": "103839", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=103839", "title": "Tutorials/Speedrun", "text": "A speedrun is a play-through of a video game performed with the intention of completing it as fast as possible. Speedruns may cover a whole game or a selected part, such as completing all achievements/advancements, or killing a certain boss. Players attempt speedruns mainly to challenge themselves and to entertain and compete with others. For experienced \"Minecraft\" players, speedruns add a new challenge and sometimes ignore or subvert established game principles, such as never digging straight down.\nWhile most games have an end or definite goal, \"Minecraft\" is an open-ended game and has no specific goal or end. However, entering the exit portal is a common goal for \"Minecraft\" speedruns. Other goals may include killing both major bosses or earning some or all of the advancements/achievements.\nTypes.\nIn addition to the goal of the speedrun, the rules can vary as well. Some of the most common types of speedruns are as follows:\nThere are also other types of speedruns. There are co-op speedruns, which is where multiple players work together to kill the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, All advancements/achievements speedruns, where the goal is to complete every single achievement or advancement, and category extensions (catexts), which are where the player tries to complete a different goal, usually obtaining an item or getting an advancement. Some category extensions are All Bosses, Obtain All Swords, Arbalistic, and How Did We Get Here?\nThe goal of the majority of this article is to provide guidance for glitchless speedruns on random seeds with the goal of killing the ender dragon. This is also referred to as Any% RSG.\nGeneral tips.\nJust as golf can be described as a nice walk spoiled by a little white ball, a glitchless speedrun can be a fun challenge spoiled by a little green pearl. Obtaining ender pearls is almost always going to be the most time-consuming part of any speedrun. Therefore, the priority should always be to kill endermen, and it's never too early to get your first ender pearl. After getting a weapon, listen for endermen in any caves you explore. Especially after entering the nether, look around for endermen as you search for the fortress. Ender pearls are considerably easier to obtain in the new 1.16 Nether Update, since Piglin trading has a chance of dropping many at a time. As such, it is also important to craft gold armor and mine any gold you find in the nether. It can be easier to hunt endermen in the nether because there are fewer other mobs to fight, there are frequently a lot of easy places to fight without being hit (such as standing in a 2 block high space), and they can be abundantly found within warped forests. Leaving the nether with your\nblaze rods and ender pearls help you start traveling in the direction of a stronghold right away.\nFinding a village early in your speedrun provides a fast source of food from the hay bales scattered around, after version 1.14, or the crops, in earlier versions. If you don't see a village right away, increase your render distance and head for higher ground to look around. Villages can also provide easy access to wood and cobblestone, a crafting table, beds for killing the ender dragon quickly, and loot if it has a blacksmith building. For your first few attempts at a speedrun, you may want to keep trying random worlds until you find a well-stocked village, or look up seeds with a village near the spawn area.\nIf you have plenty of iron ingots, you can craft shears and use them to cut leaves, which can be a fast way to get blocks for pillaring up or otherwise moving around.\nGenerally, you'll need a flint and steel to enter the nether. However, once you have a flint and steel you can also set mobs on fire before you kill them. This is a fast way to get cooked meat without waiting for a furnace.\nWhile it's commonly called the number one unwritten rule of \"Minecraft\", many players consider it normal to dig straight down during a speedrun, especially early in the run. This can save a lot of time, and you don't die if you are playing set seed and dig somewhere you know is hazard-free. This same idea holds true for other risky decisions. Most speedrunners consider taking risks such as entering the nether with no armor acceptable if it saves a large amount of time. If you die during the speedrun, you can just create a new world and start again. \nThink about the items you need and gather these along the way as many resources can suddenly become rare when you need them. For instance, you need gravel for flint, lava and water to make a nether portal, wool and wood for beds, and snowballs or arrows if you plan to use them to destroy the end crystals. Grab these items or make a note of their location as they can be hard to find when you need them.\nIf you need to travel in the overworld before making your nether portal, travel east or west to increase your X coordinate. Starting further east or west in the nether can make it faster to find a nether fortress.\nEspecially when looking for important things, such as water and lava to make a nether portal, blazes or other nether fortress mobs or silverfish to find the end portal, turn your volume up and turn on subtitles. This helps you know when you are close and give you a hint on their direction.\nPress F3 on your keyboard to turn on the debug screen and always know exactly where you are. When playing set seed, this also makes it easier to find any specific block or generated structure you found before. More advanced speedrunning tips also rely on the debug screen. \n2 or 3 golden apples can be of great help when fighting the dragon. When chopping down oak/dark oak trees, look for apples and keep an eye out for some gold ores when mining or looting. It's also possible to find golden apples or enchanted golden apples as loot. However, advanced speedrunners are able to kill the ender dragon with nearly no supplies. So, this might be considered a waste of time to some. \nTNT can be a quick way to destroy the cage around the end crystal and the end crystal itself at the same time. Place water on the ground, pillar up to the cage, place the TNT on it, activate it and drop down into the water. TNT can also be used to gather blocks quickly, including things like wood, hay bales, and gold blocks.\nProgression.\nYour time goal affects your choices and your style of play: if your goal is to complete the game in less than 30 minutes you don't have time to gather not strictly necessary resources such as armor, diamonds, etc.\nOne of your first decisions may be whether or not to mine. The fastest speedruns use lava on or near the surface, a bucket and water to build a nether portal, but this means you must travel through the nether and kill several blazes with minimal equipment. You may want to gather some basic items, then dig down to the lava level or below to find more iron, diamonds, gold, etc. Mining definitely increases your time, but it can also increase your survivability, up to and at the ender dragon. Anecdotal evidence shows that finding a nether fortress isn't affected by the Y level of the overworld portal.\nYour first task is to get a full set of stone tools (the sword is optional and the hoe is useful only in 1.16). Get 4 logs from the nearest tree and craft a wooden pickaxe, then get enough cobblestone to craft the stone tools you need.\nIf you start near a village, hay bales are the best source of food (if you're playing a version after 1.14) as you can craft bread with them. In earlier versions you need cooked meat; if there are chickens, pigs, cows, or sheep in the area, kill some of those, but if you didn't light them on fire first, you may want to wait to cook the meat until you enter the nether or while fighting blazes.\nIf you're playing a version after 1.14 you might want to kill the iron golem to get some iron (4 ingots are needed to build a nether portal).\nGet all the beds as they are useful to kill the ender dragon.\nIf you haven't spotted any lava and you don't plan to mine, you may want to gather other materials, make food, get flint or complete other necessary tasks while waiting for sunset. Once it starts to get dark, lava pools are much easier to spot from a height. Don't forget a blacksmith building has two lava source blocks if you happen to come across a smaller lava pool.\nMake sure you have enough food and materials, then create a nether portal. Even if you have a diamond pickaxe, with some practice you can make a nether portal using a bucket, water and lava more quickly than mining 10 obsidian. Dig out a frame for the nether portal, if necessary, or pillar up 5-6 blocks and place your water source using the bucket. Now scoop up lava and place it next to the water to make obsidian. Keep adding lava until you have the 10 obsidian blocks in place to make the portal. If your lava makes cobblestone next to it instead of turning to obsidian, move the water source block until it's flowing next to the lava.\nAfter you enter the nether you may want to set up a furnace to cook or smelt anything you didn't have time to before. Remember that if you leave a furnace in the overworld it stops smelting shortly after you enter the nether and resumes when you return.\nTake note of the coordinates of your portal in case you get lost.\nMake sure you thoroughly understand how nether fortresses are generated and search accordingly. You are more likely to find a fortress quickly if you head east or west until X 200/-200 and then search north or south. Listen and keep an eye out for blazes and wither skeletons. Magma cubes also spawn at a higher rate in a fortress, so if you see one it might indicate a fortress nearby. Turn up your render distance, if possible, to see further. Remember to watch and listen for endermen and kill any that you find. Dig a quick tunnel 2 blocks high and 2 blocks back, look at the enderman and kill it from just inside the tunnel. If you must travel far to find the fortress, use torches or overworld blocks, such as cobblestone, dirt, or leaves to mark your path back to the portal.\nOnce you find a nether fortress, you may want to search the interior first. The potential loot may help you survive the blazes and later parts of the game. A saddle is especially valuable later when you hunt endermen in the overworld. However, ultimately you want to find a blaze spawner. Ideally, you want a blaze spawner surrounded by netherrack so that you don't have to worry about blazes flying up or ghasts shooting at you. If the blaze spawner is out in the open, you may want build a quick roof and walls to keep the blazes in and protect yourself from other mobs. Building a 2 block high pillar near the spawner can also help to block some blaze's fireball attacks while you kill the others. You usually want to leave with 8 blaze rods, more if you plan on making a brewing stand. If so, don't forget to get nether warts before you leave the fortress. While gathering blaze rods, you may want to keep them in your hotbar so you can see how many you have.\nFinish exploring the fortress to get any additional loot, if desired, and head back to your portal. Get any items from the furnace and portal back to the overworld.\nYour next two priorities are finding the stronghold and gathering ender pearls. If you have already managed to get an ender pearl, convert your blaze rod to blaze powder and make an eye of ender. Use the eye of ender to get the general direction of the end portal and start heading in the direction, unless you are in a good area for hunting endermen and it's night. Ideally, use a triangulation calculator to minimize the number of pearls needed to find the stronghold. Write down your X and Z coordinates and the direction you are facing when looking at the eye of ender in the air (f). Two eyes of ender thrown from about 500 blocks apart in a radius around the stronghold provides an accurate location.\nRemember that a saddle is valuable! The fastest way to hunt endermen is riding a horse in the desert or savannah. Endermen don't spawn in the rain and therefore the lack of rain in the desert and savannah biomes is helpful. These biomes are also fairly flat, making it easier to spot them. You can quickly ride far enough to reset the spawn, meaning you have many more chances for endermen to spawn, riding in a large circle around the biome.\nMost speedruns in the 1.9-1.15 category are played in 1.14 to exploit the fact that villagers restock immediately. Ideally you should use the 9 TNT blocks hidden in desert temples to blow up the houses in a savanna village to get about 6 stacks of wood. Then you should craft the wood into sticks and trade them with fletchers, using the emeralds you get from trading with villagers to level up a cleric villager, which has a chance to trade ender pearls.\nOnce you reach the area of the stronghold, you can start digging, unless it's night and the surrounding area is good for hunting endermen. If not, dig a pit for your horse and head underground. You might want to dig straight down, or dig stairs since you likely want to return to the surface. Turn up your volume and turn on subtitles to help find silverfish, which spawn inside the end portal room. Strongholds can be vast, so keep track of your progress. Open wooden doors are a sign you have already been there, but use your pickaxe to remove iron doors, or else mine down the wall next to it. Use torches or other blocks to mark areas you have explored. Once you find the end portal, place any eyes of ender you already have and figure out how many more you need. Many players bring an extra ender pearl to teleport off the platform in the end, if necessary.\nA valuable item is an enchanted book with the looting enchantment. These can be found in a few places, including libraries in a stronghold. If you find one and you have enough iron to make an anvil, this significantly increases the number of ender pearls you can gather.\nOnce you have found the end portal, return to the surface the way you came or by digging a new set of stairs. Keep hunting endermen until you have enough ender pearls. During the day you can hunt for more loot in the stronghold or the overworld, gather additional resources, such as snowballs, flint to make arrows, food and golden apples.\nWhen you have enough ender pearls to make eyes of ender and complete the end portal frame, get ready to fight the ender dragon. You'll likely need good food, a water bucket, projectiles for the end crystals, blocks for pillaring up and a good weapon or several beds. Removing the end crystals is frequently more dangerous than killing the dragon. Once they are gone, killing the dragon isn't too difficult. Also, if you aren't using beds, remember that a stone axe deals more damage than netherite and diamond swords. (Netherite swords work too, but are rarer due to the fact you need ancient debris, and ancient debris is quite rare, especially when you need 4 of them. You'll also need a diamond sword too, as well as a diamond pickaxe to mine it.) Wait until the ender dragon is perched on the exit end portal and jumping to get critical hits. Critical hits can kill the ender dragon in 3-4 perches.\nAfter the ender dragon is dead, jump through the exit portal and check your time. How did you do?\nResetting.\nResetting for good seeds in 2020 used to be a massive chore, as you had to manually quit a world, click \"Singleplayer\", click \"Create new world\", change the difficulty to easy, and click \"Create world\". Today, we have developed tools to allow us to instantly reset seeds that we don't like. This is achieved by using a hotkey and a script, so that we can change the difficulty to easy and create a new world extremely quickly.\nTo do this, you need some mods for this. You will need Atum and FastReset (both are Fabric mods and it and all other allowed mods for speedrunning can be found in the official Minecraft Java Speedrunning Discord, or Javacord). You will also need the AutoHotKey program, so that the script works for instant resets.\nThe downloads for all the methods of resetting can be found on Google or Javacord.\nSingle Instance.\nThis is the easiest way to start speedrunning. It basically involves running only one instance, and it is easy because it requires the least amount of setup (besides mod downloads). It's therefore much easier to use than multi instance. If you are using Atum (which you should be to get the fast reset to work), you can reset quickly. If you see a world you don't like, you can click on the Save and Quit to Title button in the options menu (which won't save and quit to title but instead will start generating a new world), you can use the Atum hotkey to reset the world (default: F6), or you can use an external script to reset the world. Once you feel like ending your session, press ESC, then go to Options, then click on the button in the bottom left that says Stop Resets and Quit. This will send you to the title screen.\nMulti Instance.\nMulti instancing somewhat reduces the need to sit through loading screens and allows you to switch between multiple instances at once. It improves your reset efficiency a lot. When you are finished with a world, you can press a hotkey to reset your current instance and switch to the next one.\nThe Wall.\nThe Wall is a version a multi instancing which is much more efficient. It will take 6+ instances and will display all of the instances to you at the same time, and it will allow you to reset a world without ever having to enter the instance. It also allows you to reset as many instances (even all) as you like and allows you to lock some instances so you can save them while playing others. The number of instances you can use for the wall depends on your hardware.\nInstance Moving.\nInstance moving is a version of the Wall and the highest level of resetting where you run 9+ instances, resetting them in small groups in a focus grid (most do 4-6 in a group). Instance moving identifies which worlds are done loading (or which one have the most progress) and puts them on your focus grid. It's only marginally faster than generic wall and it's only helpful for top runners or runners using 12 or 15+ instances as it focuses on instances you can play and ignores the ones you can't/\nAdvanced progression strategies.\nPre 1.9.\nTower strategy.\nThis strategy is used to gather ender pearls quickly. It is based on the fact that mobs despawn if no player is within 128 blocks and that the player, upon death, is teleported to their spawn point.\nFirst, find a flat area in a desert, then gather some sand, at least 2 and a half stack of leaves, ladders, a chest, a lava bucket, a bed and 12 wooden slab. Then build this structure, sleep in the bed to set your spawn point but leave it immediately.\nNow drop off the tower, stop your fall with the ladders you placed and place all your items in the chest. At last, kill yourself with the lava you placed.\nOnce you respawn, drop off the tower again and look for endermen, if no one is in sight kill yourself, if you can see one look at it and enter your structure to avoid being hit by the mobs, then take your sword from the chest and kill any enderman you looked at, then place the sword in the chest and kill yourself again. Repeat the process and get all the pearls the endermen dropped.\nTrading strategy.\nThis is the other main but underused meta in pre-1.9 RSG speedrunning. It revolves around the concept that before 1.9, players could obtain eyes of ender from cleric villagers, which meant they did not have to kill endermen or blazes during the run, or even go to the Nether. This trade has since been patched by the developers of Minecraft, but it is still possible to roll back versions and play this strategy.\nThe main benefit of this strategy is that, unlike the tower strategy, this strategy is not pace locked, meaning that runs can go on extremely fast paces that are not possible on the tower strategy. However, it is an extremely luck-dependent strategy; so many things have to go right for a run to succeed.\nEliotex is the person who implemented this strategy into Any% RSG from Peaceful%, so check out his channel.\nA good spawn for trading runs involves finding a village and a desert temple, preferably both close by. Loot the desert temple (its gold and rotten flesh, which is useful later, and if it doesn't, reset), then check the village. If it has a blacksmith, use the resources in it to your advantage. If it doesn't, find a nearby cave or ravine to mine and smelt iron in. You need three iron for a bucket, one iron for a flint and steel, two iron for shears, and up to three more iron for an axe. You need some form of high tier axe, so if you don't have diamonds or enough spare gold, you can use these iron ingots for your axe. You can gather more iron gear, such as a pickaxe or a sword, although they are not necessary.\nLocate a librarian and a cleric, and trap both of them in a trading space (if you don't have either of these or are missing one, reset) . Trade any bookshelves you find in the village to the librarian, and trade your gold and rotten flesh one-by-one to the cleric for a 100% chance of unlocking the eye of ender trade.\nClerics sell an eye for 7-11 emeralds, 7 being perfect luck and 11 being extremely bad luck. Most runners watch for eye trades that require 7-9 emeralds and reset the run if the villager offers more than 9 emeralds. Librarians sell an emerald for 8-10 books.\nThe village and the temple will offer just enough resources to unlock the eye of ender trade and buy a singular eye. Buy only one eye, as you will get the rest of the eyes later.\nUsing the one eye you have obtained from trading, start triangulating the position of the stronghold (a stronghold calculator called ContariaCalc can help with this). Once you have done so, dig down into the portal room and insert the one eye you have gotten into the portal. Now look for the library rooms in the stronghold; they are big, rectangular rooms that contain bookshelves and string. Once you have found them, start mining the bookshelves. This is where the axe(s) come in handy; you must mine a lot of bookshelves for the trading phase of the run. To deduce the amount of bookshelves you need to break to get all the books, recall the amount of eyes you need to fill the portal, multiply that by the number of emeralds you need for one eye, multiply the result of that by the number of books needed per emerald, then divide all of this by three (bookshelves drop three books upon breaking). This can be represented by the equation \"peb\"/3, where:\nOnce you have all the books, head back to the portal room to build a nether portal from the lava. Once you have done so, you can perform a method called instant-travel (invented by Eliotex), which lets you travel instantly back to the village and cover a large amount of distance at once. Ignite a piece of TNT as you enter the portal, wait a second in the Nether, then go back into the portal. With any luck, the portal should take you near the village. Don't wait too long to light the TNT, as once you enter the Nether, everything in the Overworld will be unloaded after a few seconds. This means that the TNT may not explode in time and going through the portal will take you back to the stronghold (and kill you from the TNT).\nNow, begin the process of preparing for the end fight. Trade all the books with the librarian for emeralds, and trade all the emeralds with the cleric for eyes of ender. If you happen to have spare emeralds, trade them with other villagers in the village for useful items. For example, a bow from a fletcher is useful for blowing up crystals in the end fight. (Refer to this chart to know what items are useful and what aren't: https://web.archive.org/web/20220904231334/https://i.imgur.com/BVB8Eby.png.) During the periods in which you are not trading with villagers, shear sheep for wool for beds (it's wisest to have at least 6-7 beds for the dragon fight); kill chicken for feathers, mine wood for sticks, mine gravel for flint, and use the feathers, sticks, and flint to make arrows; craft a bow; and kill animals for food by lighting them on fire with a flint and steel and then killing them.\nNow, it is time to head back to the stronghold. Head back to the nether portal near the village, then ignite a TNT as you walk into the portal. Again, don't wait too long to ignite the TNT or it won't explode and the strategy won't work. Then, wait a second in the Nether, and head back into the portal. With any luck, you should end up in or near the stronghold, and possibly even in the portal room where you made your first nether portal. Place the eyes of ender into the frame and hop into the End.\nEnd fights in 1.7.10/1.8.9 are completely different to End fights in 1.15.2/1.16.1. For starters, the fountain that is in the center of the island in later versions does not appear in earlier versions; they only appear when the Ender Dragon is defeated, and spawns when and where the Ender Dragon dies. Also, the dragon's attack routine is very different and does not include perching (as there is no middle fountain), which makes one-cycling under normal circumstances impossible. Instead, runners use beds to blow up the dragon when it dives. There is also the strategy of using crystals to kill the dragon; however, this strategy is extremely risky in non-peaceful runs, and peaceful runs are a different category to pre-1.9 any% RSG, so peaceful mode is not allowed. Here is a tutorial on how to do pre-1.9 End fights.\nYou spawn either in an endstone cage or in the middle of the Void. The dragon charges at you upon entering the End. The endstone cage is dangerous because you often have no way to tell if the dragon is attacking you, but the Void is even more so because the dragon can knock you off the platform, instantly killing your run. If you are in an endstone cage, wait for the dragon to charge, then dig up. If you are above the Void and you see the dragon charging at you, shoot at it with your bow and arrows to make it go away. Then bridge or pearl for the island.\nEven if you are running the same seed every time, the End is always different per world. Every End (even on a set seed) has a randomized amount of crystal pillars that are a random height and width. They are always a randomized distance from the center of the island and are always randomly positioned in the island at a random distance from two other pillars. Given the randomness of pre-1.9 Ends, it can sometimes be impossible to shoot all the crystals. Try your best to shoot all the crystals; if you can't, that just means that the dragon takes more time between attacks.\nWait for the dragon to charge at you. To make it more often to do so, shoot at the crystals it locks on to, and shoot the dragon directly. If it dives toward you at a steep angle, shoot at it or hit it to make it go away. If it comes at a good angle, place a block and a bed in front of you (the block reduces most of the damage you take from the bed) and right click the bed as the dragon's head comes above it. (Make sure to stand behind a block or stand in front of the bed at eye level when exploding it. Minecraft renders most explosion damage at feet level, meaning if you are standing near or on the bed, you will die or lose a lot of your health). If timed perfectly, the bed deals a massive amount of damage to the dragon, clearing a quarter to close to a third of its health bar at best. Keep doing this until the dragon is dead or you don't have beds (in which case shoot the dragon and hit it when it dives or use crystals if you know how). When you kill the dragon, locate the position of the fountain, then jump into it.\nCongratulations! You speedran Minecraft with one of the most RNG-dependent strategies to exist in Minecraft speedrunning history!\n1.9-1.12.\n1.9-1.12 speedruns are similar to tower runs done in 1.7, but are still extremely different. The tower in 1.9-1.12 speedruns are different that the one in 1.7, and this is because of the difficult enderman AI in 1.8+. 1.9-1.12 runs are much longer than pre 1.9 runs for this reason. If you want to study 1.9-1.12 tower splits, you can do so by searching up runs on YouTube, as the new tower isn't easy to explain. Other than the tower, 1.7 runs and 1.9-1.12 runs are extremely similar.\n1.13-1.15.\nClassic strategies.\nThis is the 1.14 strategy for obtaining enough pearls to locate and fill in the end portal. It utilizes a phenomenon in this version that lets you trade infinitely with villagers. It is risky because there's about a 30% chance for the villager not offering the pearl trade. However, if you are going for a record pace, it is extremely fast, faster than killing endermen, and is worth the risk. It is also the most common strategy among speedrunners. Use 1.14.4 for this, as other versions have bugs that can easily ruin your run.\nFirst, you'll want to get into the habit of resetting for a good world. A good world for this strategy would include:\nA desert (even better if you can find a desert pyramid nearby)\nOne of these: a savannah/frozen plains village, dark oak forest, or a jungle.\nAny village, including the same savannah village.\nIf you find all 3, you have a great world! First, locate and enter the desert temple. Break the pressure plate so you don't set off the TNT, and then carefully mine and gather all 9 TNT. The chests often have good loot. Next, go into the nether and obtain enough blaze rods. You can also save time by mining a lot of gravel at the start, then mine it by the spawner when there aren't any blazes nearby. Get one more than you usually would. This is so you can make a brewing stand. Finally, exit the portal and head to the savannah village, dark oak forest, or jungle. Empty or remove enough items in your inventory (about 7-12 slots, depending on what you have), and then use the TNT to blow up the trees or village. If you are in a village, head to the houses with the most wood. Blow them up by placing a block in the center of the house, placing the TNT on top of it, and then blowing it up with a button so that the villagers don't connect the destruction to you and consequently offer worse trades. Gather the logs, stripped logs, and planks, and throw out anything from the houses you don't need. It is a good idea also to collect beds from the village, as beds decrease the time the end fight takes by an extreme amount.\nIf you use a dark oak forest or jungle, place the TNT closer to the top of the trees. The top area generally is more crowded with logs, letting more logs be blown up instead of dirt and grass. Collect at least 6 stacks of logs, which is about 24 stacks of planks, or 48 stacks of sticks. Once you have enough, head to the village, and then, if you are not on the second day yet, sleep in a bed. Find an unemployed (brown coat with no decorations) villager. Craft a fletching table, with 4 wood and 2 flints, and place it by that villager. When he becomes a fletcher, see if he has the sticks trade (32 sticks -&gt; 1 emerald). If he does not, break the table, wait for it to become unemployed, and then place it again. Do this until he offers the stick to emerald trade.\nWhen he does, empty some more slots in your inventory. If you do it right, this process is quick, so you do not have to worry about your items despawning. Turn a few logs into planks, then craft them into sticks. Trade with the villager quickly by holding the shift key, and spamming the spacebar and left-click. Do this over the slot where the villager sells the emeralds. This quickly trades your sticks for wood. Once you run out, craft more sticks and repeat. You probably have a few emeralds to spare. The best choices are arrows and bows \u2014 while you can make do without either, having at least half a stack of arrows and one bow is great. This helps to attack the dragon and shoot at the end crystals.\nNext, find another unemployed villager. Craft a brewing stand with the extra blaze rod you got, and place it next to him. This turns him into a cleric, and must level him up by trading with him until he reaches the pearl trade. Be careful doing this, as you don't have enough emeralds to just blindly trade. First, buy 20 redstone from him (buy it 10 times). You don't need these, so discard them. Wait for pink particles to appear around him, then open his interface again. Next, buy 12 lapis lazuli. You don't need these either, so discard them. Wait for pink particles, then trade with him again. Buy 10 glowstone, and hope RNG is on your side. The villager has a 2/3, or about 67%, chance of unlocking their pearl trade at this point. Scroll down the trades. If he unlocked the bottles and scute trades, then you must do the entire process again. If you are going for WR pace, the run is dead, and you must restart. However, he most likely offers pearls. It is best to buy at least 10, and smartest to buy at least 12 because there is a good chance the eyes of ender can break on the way to the stronghold, and also, there is a high chance for the portal to be missing some pearls.\nWhen you get to the end, always be sure to have at least 7 beds in your hotbar. Wait for the dragon to perch in the middle, and then place a block in front of its head, and behind it, place a bed. Blow up the beds (and possibly wait for the dragon to re-perch) and then stand in the end portal. If the dragon is flying around, shoot at it, or the end crystal it is using to heal itself. If it takes too long, you may want to (painfully) reset.\nIf you completed this process correctly, the TNT process should take about 3-5 minutes, and the trading process should take 2-4 minutes. Overall, this is an excellent choice for 1.14.4, because it should take about 5-9 minutes total.\nInsomniac strategy.\nThis strategy is the most optimal way to play 1.15. Before you start the run, you want an island spawn with a shipwreck and an ocean monument nearby. First, you must break 3 logs with your fist. After breaking the logs, you need to craft the 3 logs into 12 wooden planks. Then, make a crafting table and 8 sticks. You should now have 4 wooden planks, which you use to make a wooden axe. After making the axe, break 3-9 more logs, and craft them into 12-36 planks. Use 5 of the planks to make a boat, and use 6 more to make 3 doors.\nAfter you have finished crafting, go to a shipwreck to get iron. You need at least 11-14 iron and 2 emeralds. If you don't get those resources from the shipwreck, you must reset. After getting the resources, place down one of your doors for air, along with your crafting table. You can now craft an iron pickaxe, an iron axe, and an iron shovel with 7 of the iron. Next, craft 1-2 buckets with 3-6 iron. You should now have at least one iron left. If you have enough iron, you should craft a bit of iron armor, or a shield. Now, go to the ocean floor, place a door there, and mine some gravel for 3 flint. After you get the flint, craft a flint and steel. Break and collect your doors now if you haven't. Now, look for an ocean monument. When you see the monument, set your render distance to 2 chunks. That way, it's less likely for an elder guardian to inflict Mining Fatigue. Go to the back of the monument (the part of the monument with the small arches). Once you have gotten to the back of the monument, you use your doors to look for the area of the monument with the gold blocks. Once you have located it, break the gold blocks.\nAfter getting the gold blocks, look for a village. Once you have found one, place down your crafting table and craft 2 fletching tables for trading. You also need to craft your gold blocks into 72 gold ingots. Use 60 of them for trading, and use the other 12 gold ingots from the monument to craft 4 golden axes. Now locate a forest and break 128 logs. Craft all of them into planks, and then craft them into 16 stacks of sticks. After reentering the village, you place down the fletching tables to turn 2 of the villagers into fletchers. If they do not sell you sticks, break the fletching table and then replace it. When the fletchers sell you sticks, trade 8 stacks of sticks to each fletcher, as the fletchers' stick trades can be used only 16 times per restock. Now, you should have at least 34 emeralds. You must now find a cleric. After finding the cleric, trade 10 of the 34 emeralds for redstone. Then, trade 24 of the gold to the cleric to level it up to Journeyman. The gold trade can be used only 12 times per restock. After the cleric restocks, trade the other 36 gold to it. The reason why you need to trade only 2 gold per emerald for the first restock and 3 per emerald for the second is because when a villager restocks, its price discounts go away. Now, the cleric should be Expert level. Trade your remaining emeralds to the cleric for ender pearls. There is only a 2/3 chance that the cleric sells ender pearls. If it doesn't, you must reset. Your IGT, or in game time, should be at around 6-8 minutes.\nNow leave the village and locate an ocean ravine with magma in it. You then need to locate an upside-down L formation with the magma. To make the portal, you first need to break the bottom right block in the upside-down L. If the block below the magma turns into obsidian, place a door on it. If the block below doesn't turn into obsidian, reset. Now, place a block above the top left block of the upside-down L. Place 1 door to one side of the L and a block to the other side. You now need to break the top right block. Grab lava from inside the ravine, and make it into a nether portal shape. After finishing the nether portal, enter it. You should now grab some lava with your second bucket (if you have one). Now use the pie chart (Shift+F3) to locate a fortress. After you enter the fortress, look for a blaze spawner. Grab 6 blaze rods by killing blazes. After you finish grabbing the rods, re-enter the overworld through your previous portal. The rest of the run is similar to a 1.16 run.\n1.16+.\nBartering strategy.\nThis strategy was shown to be extremely efficient, however it is heavily RNG dependent. This is practically the only way to get a good speedrun in the 1.16 update because villagers barely reset their trades in 1.15+. With extreme luck you can get enough blaze rods and enough pearls within a few minutes. One runner, Korbanoes, got enough pearls from just 5 gold, and set an extremely hard to beat record of 14 minutes and 56.8 seconds.\nFirst, you want to obtain enough gold. If you found some in a shipwreck, desert temple, or other structure, you're on the right track. You don't need any gold from the overworld, however. Gold ore is found in the nether in 1.16, and you can also find gold ingots in nether fortresses and bastion remnants. All you have to do is find an adult piglin, and interact with gold in your hand or drop gold in front of it. If you are going for WR, you should drop a bunch of gold by the piglin, then kill blazes while it barters. Also, you should give it single digits of gold bars if you are going for pearls, unless you already have a lot. Trying to mine lots of gold consumes too much time. If you aren't going for WR, it is best to kill enough blazes, then barter. This is heavily based on RNG, so the amount of gold you need could range anywhere from 2 ingots to over a stack, or even more! It is best to mine gold as it barters and check on it periodically. You don't want to spend all your time mining half a stack of gold if he ends up giving you enough pearls in just a few gold. Don't just stand and wait either, because it goes both ways- you don't want to just stand there looking at the piglin, because then if he ends up taking a while to give you pearls, you could've saved time by mining some while he bartered.\nFinally, even though this works in all versions, do this in 1.16.1. In other 1.16 versions, the loot tables are different, and it take almost forever to get gold.\nThis method isn't hard to mess up, and if you get lucky, you'll be in and out of the nether within 3-6 minutes with all of the items you'll need to get to the stronghold. Try to get beds on the way there, which shortens your end fight.\nHypermodern strategy.\nWhile the bartering strategy is simple and easy to understand, the hypermodern strategy overcomplicates every aspect of the run. However, it is necessary to learn because it is now the meta of 1.16+ speedruns; almost every speedrun has a costal spawn with either a shipwreck, ruined portal, or buried treasure. Runner k4yfour has a good video on hypermodern runs: https://youtu.be/gAHMJfsrHe4.\nThe hypermodern strategy relies on an ocean with a shipwreck and a magma ravine, preferably having both close by and near each other.\nLoot the chests in the wreck. One chest should have carrots and other foods, which sets you up for the option to make golden carrots later in the run. Another chest should have the seven iron you need to complete the run, plus a few other valuables. If it doesn't, the third chest contains a buried treasure map, and it should have the rest of the iron and decent food. Next, turn on hitboxes (F3 + B) to spot faraway kelp (this can indicate a magma ravine). Once you have found a magma ravine, create a ravine portal and enter the Nether that way (you can search up tutorials on ravine portals on YouTube).\nTheTalkingMime has invented another strategy for hypermodern runs called \"mapless buried treasure\". The strategy relies on using a pie chart to show the (possible) location of a buried treasure without a map (hence the name). It is a complicated strategy in the way it works, but if done and understood properly, it can be extremely fast and efficient. To learn how to do this, watch his video: https://youtu.be/mes_PPlOJao.\nThe Nether is probably the hardest part of the run to get used to if you practice classic bartering strategies and warped forest strategies excessively, but it goes extremely fast if you can do it properly. There are also advanced techniques to finding structures (such as E-ray and pie-ray), which you can search the tutorials for on YouTube.\nFirst, find a bastion. Bastions have a lot of piglins (depending on the type of bastion) and a lot of gold. There are four types of bastions: treasure bastions, bridge bastions, housing bastions, and stables bastions. This is important to know because knowing what type of bastion you have can help you plan your route accordingly. Couriway has a great video on bastions: https://youtu.be/5QIMHxpfUkg.\nIn a bastion, you generally want to aim for: at least 16 ender pearls (for the end portal and travelling), 21 obsidian (for blind travel and travelling in the Nether and for the one cycle), at least 48 string (to make beds), fire resistance potions (for the blaze fight), and crying obsidian and glowstone (to make respawn anchors if you don't get enough string). If you don't have enough of these items after bartering all of your gold, find chests and loot them. Once you have all the needed items, leave the bastion. The bastion process is quick; while the average player can do it in at most three minutes, skilled runners can do it under even two minutes.\nWhen you find a fortress, drink/splash your fire resistance, then pearl to the spawner. Once you have finished your blaze fight, head to the Overworld by building a portal. You can now do educated travel; throw an eye of ender, take note of its angle, run 17.5 blocks perpendicular of that angle, throw another eye, take note of your angle, then note the angle difference. 1000 divided by the difference of these two angles gives you a rough estimate of where your stronghold is. This process can be quicker with the Ninjabrain Bot, as it tells you the exact position of the stronghold using trigonometry. (You can find all of these tutorials on YouTube.) Now, travel your distance divided by eight in the Nether (travelling in the Nether is eight times more efficient), although if you don't have enough obsidian you can still travel by Overworld if the distance to clear is less than 600 blocks. With a little luck, you may end up in, on, or near the stronghold. If not, do some more triangulation.\nThe end of the run is nothing different; find the portal room, fill it, hop in, and one cycle the ender dragon.\nWarped forest strategy.\nThis strategy is not recommended stand-alone if you are going for a world record or are bad at PvE. This ties in with the Looting strategy, however, it is not required to have Looting for this. It can be helpful if you want to get more pearls while the piglin barters.\nFirst, look for a warped forest. It is easy to spot, with giant aquamarine trees and unnatural green foliage. When you arrive, look for and kill endermen, until you have the desired amount of pearls. If you are bad at PvE, you can pillar 2-3 blocks and then look at them to anger them, and if you are being chased by one and are low on health, you can try and jump up into a Twisting Vine to escape it. You can also tower up three blocks, as the enderman cannot reach that high, even if they are three blocks tall. A common strategy for killing Enderman is to trap one in a boat before killing it. This can be achieved either by placing a boat next to an enderman and having it run into the boat or by placing the boat one block higher than the surrounding area and anger them with the boat in between you and the enderman. \nThis can take anywhere from under 3 to over 5-6 minutes, depending on spawn luck, pearl drops, skill at PvE, and whether or not you have looting on your weapons.\nMonument strategy.\nThis strategy is useful for optimal sub 20, sub 17, and sub 15 times. However, it is not a reliable strategy for world record pace, especially taking into consideration that a really good seed is needed for the run.\nThis strategy guarantees a bastion's worth of gold in the first five minutes of the run, which is useful for the run. The monument allows an easy steal of eight gold blocks, which is hopefully enough for the ender pearls, string, and obsidian. After the nether entry, the rest of the run is pretty much a normal hypermodern run.\nYou need an ocean magma ravine, a shipwreck, and a monument. First, loot the shipwreck, and hope for seven iron for all the equipment, and up to 5 more for an axe, a shovel, and a shield. Then, you need to frontload wood (mine the wood at the shipwreck) and craft the equipment.\nUpon approaching the ocean monument, go to your video settings and set your render distance down to two chunks. This stop the elder guardians from loading in (elder guardians inflict Mining Fatigue III, which makes it harder to mine). If you don't want to lower your render distance, you can try and bring a bucket of milk or a cow with you. Head to the part of the monument with arches, and mine into each one until you enter the gold room (a big room with guardians and a cube in the middle). Mine into the cube and gather your eight gold blocks, then head out of the monument. Locate the magma ravine and create a ravine portal at the bottom.\nThe monument strategy completely eliminates the need for a bastion later in the run, but monuments are even rarer than bastions, which is why they are not reliable for world record pace, so it is better to stick with bastions instead."}

{"id": "35497", "revid": "54458489", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=35497", "title": "Tutorials/Squid farming", "text": "Collecting &lt;a href=\"ink%20sac\"&gt;ink sac&lt;/a&gt;s can prove quite time-consuming. To save time, a &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; farm could be made to automatically gather ink sacs for your collection later on. There are two main ways to do it. The first is to dig a tunnel underneath the ocean; the second is to make a man-made lake, or find a shallow pre-existing lake.\nSpawning mechanics.\nSquid will &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Spawn%20conditions\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; in 1 or more blocks of water, no matter whether it's a water source or flowing water. Squid can also spawn in bubble columns, (Bedrock Only) so an upwards column may be used for collection. Note that downwards columns do not pull the squids, making them considerably less useful for squid farming. The level of light is not important. However, they will only spawn if their spawning block (the solid block underneath the water) is between Y (vertical) level 50 and 62, inclusive.\nSince 1.13.1, they now only spawn in river and ocean biomes.\nTo have a better spawn rate in your farm you have to eliminate water blocks between 50 and 62 layers in a 128 block radius around the player and at least 24 blocks from the spawning area of the farm.\nThere is a separate mob cap for water mobs (this doesn't include guardians), but the mob cap is shared among all players on a multiplayer server. Thus on a multiplayer server, if any player is near an ocean, it will effectively block output from your squid farm. As with other farms, it is important to kill the squid quickly to allow more to spawn.\nKilling mechanisms.\nSquid can be killed by asphyxiation if they get out of water. They can also be killed by fall damage or by entering lava. &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s are hostile toward squid and will use lasers to kill them, however catching a &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; is hard even with boats.\nFarm designs.\nArtificial automatic squid farm design.\nThis design produces around 11,000 &lt;a href=\"Ink%20Sac\"&gt;Ink Sac&lt;/a&gt;s per hour using &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s to optimize spawn rates and hopper minecarts for collection. As of 1.18, squid now need a height of 3 blocks to spawn and so the height of 2 blocks between glass layers in the video of this design means no squid will spawn in the farm.\nThis design takes more time to be built but can achieve a very high ink rate. First of all you should clear as much water as possible out of the river or ocean biome within the render distance of the player. You have to build a chamber between layers 46 and 62, and fill it with water so squid will spawn. To make water push the squid to the bottom you have to place water sources only in the top layer, and also place solid column blocks, as water will only push if it has an adjacent solid block. Underneath the spawning chamber will be a layer of signs that can be traversed by squid but not water. Squid crossing the sign layer will land on a hopper platform, where squid will die either by fall damage or suffocation, and will gather all the resulting ink and send it to chests.\nOne in survival mode, Minecraft 1.8.4, yielding about 4.2 stacks of ink per hour:\nThe easy method:\nAnother easy design worth mentioning that works both on glowing and normal squid is this: \nFirst, find a river biome so squid can spawn.\nThen, you can start your construction. Build (Or dig) an empty rectangular box (11*2*11 measured from inside) and replace the central block with a hopper connecting to your chest. Then, you place 4 water bucket at the bottom corners of the box so that squid can spawn in it (and the water stream can move the drops to you hopper.) Then, put a axolotl in your box with a bucket(You can use a guardian instead, just make sure to name it so it doesn't despawn.) Tada! A supercalifragilisticexpialidociously easy and simple fully automated squid farm.\nIt's not very fast, but it's small. You can have multiple units of them working at the same time to speed them up. \nIf you want to build one for glowing squid, the idea is the same. build your box below y level 30, and make sure there is no light in it so glowing squid can spawn.\nNatural squid farm design.\nThis design is easy to build, as it uses the environment to build the farm, although the ink rate is very poor. You have to build a layer of signs below a lake or ocean, and dig a hole underneath, so squid will get through it and either die by suffocation or fall damage depending on how deep you dig the hole. The following video shows a natural squid farm built for Minecraft 1.4.7:\nAllay assisted design\nThis, Bedrock Edition only, design takes advantage of the &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt; which will gather the floating ink sacs of &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; that die to &lt;a href=\"Axolotl\"&gt;axolotls&lt;/a&gt;. The same design can also be used to farm &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt; if built below y level 30."}

{"id": "80689", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=80689", "title": "Tutorials/Storage minecarts", "text": "This tutorial covers basic minecart systems involving &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Chest\"&gt;Minecart with Chest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;Minecart with Hopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfinite storage.\nThrough the use of minecart cramming, infinite storage is possible. If you build one using the schematic on the right, don't forget to put a rail on top of the lower hopper so you can place as many hopper minecarts as you like on it to expand storage capacity. For the minecarts not to spill, it is important to place blocks to both ends of the rail. Be careful to only put items of a single type in the upper chest, you will only be able to access items flowing out of the minecarts into the lower box. As they only flow one by one, different items will only flow out after all of the \"same\" items are out.\nThis system has a basic capacity of 118 stacks plus 27 stacks per chest minecart added, so it is very useful for storing items you have plenty of, like stone, or for mob farms to store drops like bone or mob armor.\nItem loader.\nAn Item loader is a system which stops a &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Chest\"&gt;Minecart with Chest&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;Minecart with Hopper&lt;/a&gt; to feed them with items, and when it's done it restarts the minecarts.\nDesign A is probably the simplest. When the hopper has at least one item, it deactivates the &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; so a storage cart coming from the right will be stopped under the hopper. After feeding the cart with all the items in the hopper, the powered rail gets reactivated so the cart starts going right. A possible downside of this design is that the powered rail is always active as long as the hopper is empty so if a cart comes to the empty loader it immediately bounces off in the opposite direction. This might lead to the inefficiency of the system if there is a great distance between the loader and the unloader.\nDesign A' is a variant of design A to make it flat.\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" 28 March 2013\nDesign B is a combination of a hopper and a &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23Falling%20edge%20detector\"&gt;falling edge detector&lt;/a&gt;. It activates the powered rail for 4 redstone ticks only at the moment when the hopper becomes empty, so a cart will stop there until you put some items into the hopper and all of those items are transferred to the cart.\n\"For all the designs that are shown above, minecart with chest will be stuck at these loaders when the cart has no space to receive items from loaders.\"\nDesign C has the advantage that minecarts with chest will not get stuck as long as they are empty while entering the loader. This design has two operational modes: when the loader doesn't have a cart, a small chest that serves as a \"buffer\" will accumulate items from the large chest above. And when it has a cart, items in the buffer will be transferred to the cart and nothing more. It has a &lt;a href=\"Memory%20circuit%23T%20Flip-Flop\"&gt;T Flip-Flop&lt;/a&gt; that switches between two modes, connected to a detector rail.\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" 5 May 2013\nDesign D will detect if a &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Chest\"&gt;Minecart with Chest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;Minecart with Hopper&lt;/a&gt; is full, before sending it back to where it came from. It will only return a full cart. The minecart is stopped by an unpowered, inclined &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Hopper\"&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt; above. The minecart will rest on both the &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Detector%20Rail\"&gt;Detector Rail&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Comparator\"&gt;Comparator&lt;/a&gt; checking if your minecart is full. This design works on the principle that a minecart can pass an activated &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt; when going uphill, but cannot pass it going downhill. When the minecart is full, the &lt;a href=\"Comparator\"&gt;Comparator&lt;/a&gt; is triggered, sending a signal to retract and extend the &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt; just long enough to allow the full minecart to pass. Set up your rail so the minecart is not going too fast, or it will overshoot the &lt;a href=\"Detector%20Rail\"&gt;Detector Rail&lt;/a&gt; and not return to your unloader.\nTo achieve the angled &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; facing into a &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block\"&gt;Solid block&lt;/a&gt;, first, add a temporary &lt;a href=\"Rail\"&gt;Rail&lt;/a&gt; (any rail type will work) on top of the block you want your &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; to angle toward, then break that temporary rail and place a &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block\"&gt;Solid block&lt;/a&gt; in its place.\nDesign E is \"stable\" in the sense that the &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Chest\"&gt;Minecart with Chest&lt;/a&gt; will keep running between the golden blocks while loading. The &lt;a href=\"Detector%20Rail\"&gt;Detector Rail&lt;/a&gt; between the golden blocks can detect how full the &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Chest\"&gt;Minecart with Chest&lt;/a&gt; is. Once it's full, the \"door of gold\" will open. All &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; shown here are powered from the side.\nDesign F mitigates the situation where there are too many items and the chest and hopper become full.&lt;br&gt;\nSee &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/redstone-creations/2277761-simple-automatic-minecart-loading-station-overflow\"&gt;Simple Automatic Minecart Loading Station - Overflow Protected&lt;/a&gt;\nItem unloader.\nAn Item unloader is a system that stops a &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Chest\"&gt;Minecart with Chest&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;Minecart with Hopper&lt;/a&gt; to take items out of them, and when it's done it restarts the minecarts.\nDesign A is probably the simplest. As soon as the hopper receives at least one item from a cart that arrived above, it deactivates the &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; so the storage cart that came from the left will be stopped on top of the hopper. After taking all the items in the cart, the powered rail gets reactivated so the cart starts going left. A possible downside of this design is that the powered rail is always active as long as the hopper is empty so if a cart approaches the unloader too fast, there is a non-negligible chance that the cart bounces off before getting braked by the deactivated powered rail. (This will also happen a lot if you use a second hopper below the one doing the unloading.)\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" 28 March 2013\nDesign A' is a \"tileable\" variant of design A.\nDesign B is a variant of design A: It has a detector rail that temporarily deactivates the powered rail to prevent carts from bouncing off.\nDesign C is a \"tileable\" unloader. Larger than design A, but it can hold minecarts with a closed fence gate to prevent them from bouncing off. This design requires that the minecart enters the unloader fast enough to get up onto the detector rail, otherwise it will get stuck on the unpowered powered rail. A single active powered rail two blocks before the powered rail over the hopper is enough to guarantee correct entry.\n\"For all designs shown above, minecart with chest will be stuck at these unloaders when they have no space to receive items from carts.\"\nInstant Unloader (1.19+).\nThis 1-wide tileable design unloads the minecart by breaking it, collecting it in a hopper, and re-placing it. The minecart has to be moving fast enough to beat the observer signal to the dropper, and needs to be stopped far enough right that it drops onto the mud block and then snaps onto the lower rail but still far enough left that lava cauldron breaks it and the minecart item is partially above the hopper to be collected and re-placed. All the items inside, meanwhile, are spawned in the center of the block with the rails where they may be further collected or transported (e.g. by waterlogging the rails and letting the water stream move them out). The slab above prevents the items from bouncing up unexpectedly. The dispenser re-places the cart on the slope where it rolls back out onto the tracks.\nAny of the normal rails may be replaced with more powered rails. To tile it you may want to do so for easier placement, as normal rails would tend to connect into curves. Make sure the lower rail faces into the cauldron rather than running sideways next to it.\nThe cart may be paused to reduce noise and lag by powering the note block. It will be held in the dropper until the node block is depowered."}

Sugar cane can also be used with a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt;, however, &lt;a href=\"melon%20farm\"&gt;melon farm&lt;/a&gt;s are probably more suited for this. The large amount of sugar cane obtainable from some of these farms can make it much easier to get &lt;a href=\"Firework%20Rocket\"&gt;firework rockets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMechanics.\nSugar cane can only be planted on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;. The block must be directly adjacent to &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and not merely above or diagonal as with &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt;. If a plant's water source is removed, it breaks when it is next updated. , the sugar cane is updated with its water, so it breaks immediately.\nEvery 16 &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Random%20tick\"&gt;random ticks&lt;/a&gt;, sugar cane grows 1 block in height, similar to how &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; grow. On average, sugar cane grows 1 block every 18 minutes. Sugar cane's growth rate is unaffected by the absence of light.\nSugar cane can naturally grow up to 3 blocks in height. This limit can be bypassed by placing additional plants on top of an existing one but it does not grow naturally any further.\nSugar cane, like &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, grows only if the &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; they are on is loaded into memory, so you should not venture too far from the field if you want it to grow. The growth range is based on &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt;.\nManual farm designs.\nThe first step in building a sugar cane farm is choosing a design. When starting out, simply placing sugar cane on a river bank should be sufficient. However, this quickly becomes impractical when implemented on a large scale. Sugar cane farms must balance between compactness, ease of harvest, and difficulty to build.\nA double rowed design, while not the most efficient of designs as it has only 2 canes per water, is relatively easy to build and harvest. It is also a good choice for some of the semi-automatic designs below. With this design, it is recommended to use flowing water rather than water sources. Not only is it easier to build it flowing, but when harvesting, any items that fall into the water flow into a central location.\nA more efficient grid pattern design can also be used. This design has 4 sugar canes per water source, so it is highly compact. Placing &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;s or something similar on top of all water blocks makes the ground smooth and easy for the player to walk on without falling. &lt;a href=\"Light%23Blocks\"&gt;Light blocks&lt;/a&gt; can be used under or above the water to prevent &lt;a href=\"mob%20spawning\"&gt;mob spawning&lt;/a&gt;. Slabs or &lt;a href=\"Trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoors&lt;/a&gt; can be placed as waterlogged blocks in the upper half of the water sources instead of lily pads without interfering with their ability to sustain plant growth.\nWhen harvesting, walk slowly and sweep side to side breaking all but the bottom block of each sugar cane. Then, pick up any missed &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and continue. Watch out for creepers camouflagued among the plants.\nSemi automatic farm designs.\n, when sugar cane's water source is removed, it immediately breaks. Using this principle, it is easy to create semi-automatic farms that harvest the sugar cane. These designs should still work , however, it takes a bit more time for the sugar cane to break. Some other designs here are classified as semi-automatic due to their lack of ability to pick up the sugar cane. These can often be easily converted into automatic designs as seen in the next section.\nWater canal design.\nBuild the double rowed design as shown in the manual farms list. Then, place &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s containing &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;s to control the water flow. Removing the water streams with the dispensers should cause the sugar cane to break so &lt;a href=\"the%20player\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; can pick them up and replant.\nPiston harvester.\nThis design uses &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s to harvest the sugar cane. If the sugar cane is only two blocks tall, it can all be pushed into a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; stream. However, if it grows any taller, the top blocks may fall down to the &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"the%20player\"&gt;the player&lt;/a&gt; can pick it up. This design is often used as the basis for fully automatic farms, however, it must be modified to push the top blocks as well or some of the sugar cane may be lost.\nBone meal design.\n, &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used to instantly grow &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; to maximum height. This mechanic can be used to create automatic sugar cane farms.\nIn the shown design, the &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; can be filled with bone meal to constantly grow the sugar cane. Since bone meal is not used up on fully grown sugar cane, none is wasted. The player can then stand and constantly break the middle block of sugar cane to quickly farm large quantities.\nIt is not difficult to connect this with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; to make it more automatic. However, since pistons cannot push and retract as quickly as the observer clock, it may be desirable to use a different &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;redstone clock&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, a single &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; may not be able to keep up with the large amount of sugar cane, so multiple hoppers or a slower clock should be used. Ideally, a 4 gametick delay clock should be used instead of an observer clock. Even more ideal is a 2 gametick alternating dispenser bonemeal system with a ravager in a minecart to break the top 2 sugarcane blocks.\nFully automatic designs.\nFully automatic designs automatically harvest and collect &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, usually relying on some sort of &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;redstone clock&lt;/a&gt; or growth detection. These designs are often expensive to build and more lag prone than other designs. However, the large amount of sugar cane they produce can pay off.\nThe easiest way is to pillar up 3 blocks, and the second block is a piston,the third an observer. Plant the sugarcane and collect it using a hopper system or any other means.\nThere are four main types of automatic sugar cane farms: Stationary, flying, sim-tick, and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Zero-ticking\"&gt;zero-tick&lt;/a&gt;. Stationary designs, while simpler for platforms without &lt;a href=\"quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity&lt;/a&gt;, are generally more resource and space intensive as compared to flying designs. Flying designs usually require &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s however which may be difficult to obtain for some players. Sim-tick designs move the player so the plant is out of simulation distance, then uses a sticky piston that is within simulation distance to remove and then replace the block beneath it, and when you move back so the plant is within simulation distance, the plant has grown. Zero-tick designs remove and replace a requirement for the plant within the same game tick, also forcing a growth update. These designs usually use pistons or sand manipulation. Zero-tick sugar cane farms are faster , with some getting at or above 2,000 sugarcane per hour per plant.\nStationary design.\nBy using a &lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt;, the semi-automatic piston design is shown above can be made fully automatic. To make it more lossless, it is recommended to add another layer of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s above the original one. , these designs can be an alternative to flying machines that are difficult to create and use for this purpose.\nOther variations are also possible, such as this diagonal design which uses a &lt;a href=\"Clock%20circuit%23Multi-item%20hopper%20clock\"&gt;hopper clock&lt;/a&gt; rather than a daylight sensor.\nRather than use a clock, some designs use &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s to harvest the &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it grows. Designs such as these may inefficiently use space compared to the clock method. Since simple designs cause all of the pistons to activate anytime sugar cane grows, they are often less lag efficient too. Repeaters can be used to create a simple alternating pattern to singly fire the pistons. Creating your farm with two rows of sugarcane and two rows of pistons facing each other solves the problem of the central sugarcane being pushed, while the top sugarcane drops straight down. A double row of hoppers or a hopper cart system can feed a timed dropper to load the sugarcane into a water sorting/transportation system.\nWhen constructing, the sugar cane goes on the &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s run where the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; is shown. The hopper minecart can be replaced with a line of hoppers if the sugar cane is planted on &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarms can be designed to cost less resources early game by replacing the hopper minecart and rails with a water stream and a singular hopper. These designs are also significantly quieter since they remove the minecart traveling underneath. These designs can also be more server-friendly than traditional hopper minecart designs as some servers choose to disallow minecarts to reduce lag. The downside of these designs is that occasionally items can land on the sand and not be picked up, meaning they are not lossless.\nIt is possible to speed up the process of sugar cane by removing the water source and replacing it in the same game tick, this process is called zero-ticking. Although this does not work in Java Edition as of 1.16 it does work in Bedrock.\nFlying design.\nThe use of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Flying%20machines\"&gt;flying machines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hopper%20minecart\"&gt;hopper minecart&lt;/a&gt;s can be combined to create some of the most efficient farms. Flying machine designs generally use only a few pistons and don't create lag except when harvesting. This is usually the preferred type of design when creating a large farm. The main disadvantage to farms such as these is that they can break if unloaded while running. Due to this, it can be risky to have these run without supervision.\nThis video has some useful information regarding flying sugar cane farming. It contains a practically lossless flying machine design similar to the one above. The lossless design works by covering the water with leaves and using the flying machine to ensure &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s pushed to places they can be picked up.\nSome flying farms focus on just individual rows of sugar cane, instead of larger fields. Designs like these typically cost fewer slime blocks to build, and are usually the cheapest option for mass farming.\nThis farm uses a four directional flying machine which works out cheaper than most designs, especially for larger farms. It even can reduce the lag caused by entites as it drops less entities into the world."}

For example, if there is a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom with a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; on top, the Zombie will move the mount itself and pursue a villager instead of you (only if it notices the villager first, like all zombies). Mobs on the bottom have small resistance, they can move slowly towards their own intentions (attacking a player) but the second the passenger moves the mount will be forced to move to that location.\nIn a nutshell, the passenger will behave regularly if they are mounted on a mob, but they will have a speed boost (equivalent to the players walking speed, or the passenger speed if the Passenger's speed is faster than the players' speed). For example, if there is a wolf mounted on a cow, and you punch the wolf, the wolf will ride the cow towards you and inflict damage, and it will also make nearby wolves (even wolf jockeys) hostile. If a skeleton mounts a mob, it can strafe (as skeletons do when attacking). The only exception are endermen. They will teleport away (with the passenger), if a projectile is shot through them. However, if the enderman is the passenger, it will not teleport away but it cannot be damaged by projectiles.\n-If a passenger is teleported by the player it will dismount the passenger and leave the mount at the previous location. For example, if you teleport all skeletons to your location, it will take all the skeletons off the spiders and teleport them to your location.\n-Passengers can be infinitely stacked as of 1.12, if you stack the Passengers tag correctly.\nMount Behavior.\nJava Edition.\nThe mount, or the mob being ridden has little control since 1.12. (Before this update, the mount had complete control, the exception being chicken jockeys). They will have \"resistance\", however, where they will slowly (about 1/4th of their normal walking speed) try to do whatever they are intending (attacking a player, chasing a villager). However, the passenger will always have dominance over the mount and can move it at its will. Mounts will always give the passenger a speed boost, equivalent of the player's walking speed, faster if the mount is naturally faster than the player (such as a hostile enderman).\nHowever, if there are multiple mobs of the same genre this rule can cancel out. Let say there are 3 zombies stacked on top of each other and a cow on the very top. Well, if there are 5 zombies that's 5 x 0.25% of the speed, which means the zombies can go as fast as they want, but the cow still has dominance over movement and can easily move a different direction, but the second the cow stops moving the zombies will resume their intentions.\nIf the mount is a passive mob it cannot inflict its own damage, the passenger has to inflict its own damage. If there is a skeleton riding a cow the Skeleton can attack, not the cow. The only case is where the Mount is hostile, such as a spider, if can attack as well and leap (this is the only exception where a Mount can jump on its own), making it deadly for the player. A neutral mob, such as a polar bear can attack on its own if the polar bear itself is provoked.\nIt is always easier to defeat a jockey if you attack the mount before the passenger. Knockback will have no effect whatsoever on the passenger. However, setting the mount on fire will also set the passenger on fire. If a mount is a hostile mob (such as an skeleton), it can still shoot arrows at the player if the passenger is facing the player, as mount can turn on its own, but it takes a while due to its very small \"resistance\".\nMaking a vex a mount does not take away its ability to fly through solid blocks. This can be useful if you mount a zombie on a vex, making it have the ability to fly into houses and attack players or villagers (the zombie is still in control of the vex).\nAlways remember that no matter what, the passenger has complete control over movement of the mount. If you summon a cow riding a zombie the zombie can try to slowly move towards the player and attack him but the second the cow moves the Jockey will move wherever the cow desires with no resistance. The only exception to this rule would be flying mobs. Bats, ghasts and blazes cannot fly if they are passengers, but they can move the mount at higher speeds. If you place a ghast onto a spider, the ghast will strafe or move forwards (as it does when it's attacking).\nThe only mobs that can move freely even with a passenger are the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s. Passengers have no control over these mounts whatsoever (except horses - see below).\n-If a mob is summoned onto a horse, that mob will have control over the horse until it bucks them off - just like a player. It will never be \"tamed\" by the mob, and will only stay on for a limited time.\n-If a mount is teleported by the player, the passenger will stay on, even if it was not the specified mob. For example, if you teleport all spiders to your location, it will also teleport spiders with passengers (spider jockeys).\nAs of 1.12, skeletons summoned through 'passenger' or 'mount' will not have a bow. You have to either equip them with a weapon (or item) or summon a skeleton with one pre-equipped.\nBedrock Edition.\nWhen not engaged in combat, some mobs can move freely without passenger controls, but when passenger try to chasing player or mobs, the rider (passenger) will take control. These mobs are:\nOther mobs not listed above behave the same way as mount behavior in Java Edition.\nExamples.\nA flying &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, you can make the &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; invisible with &lt;a href=\"Status%20effect\"&gt;/effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nA teleporting &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; wearing a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20helmet\"&gt;diamond helmet&lt;/a&gt; riding a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;. The zombie can also control the pig's movement.\nA &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20jockey\"&gt;skeleton jockey&lt;/a&gt; wearing full &lt;a href=\"diamond%20armor\"&gt;diamond armor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jump%20Boost\"&gt;Jump Boost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nA similar skeleton riding a &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"illusioner\"&gt;illusioner&lt;/a&gt; riding an &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; riding a &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; which has a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20axe\"&gt;diamond axe&lt;/a&gt;."}

Although using a normal superflat world is fine, the best preset is Overworld, because it creates water and lava holes and tall grass. This guide does not work for &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 1 - Materials.\nGetting materials is fairly easy. Whenever starting a world, it is recommended that you start with a &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt; to assist you in obtaining the materials necessary to thrive in the world, especially for players who decide not to select the Overworld preset. If decided to use the default preset, just follow step 2.\nStep 2 - Pillage a village.\nAs soon as you have spawned in the world, (make sure generate structures option is on) immediately look for a village. If you do find a village, run towards it as fast as you can. If you don't find a village, run straight in any direction until you see one. When you do arrive at a village, check all house chests for useful items. Although there can be a multitude of items found inside the chest, there are 6 buildings containing chests:\nAbandoned villages.\nThere is a small chance that a village may be an abandoned village, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Curing%20a%20zombie%20villager\"&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for more information about what to do in this situation.\nWith all other things aside, take:\nAll of these items are useful in superflat survival. Take some &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es from the farms, and mine some &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s from the houses. As soon as you have a few logs, make a single wooden pickaxe and mine some cobblestone and use it to create a stone pickaxe. Collect a stack of cobblestone and use it to create some stone tools (2+ axes, 1+ pickaxes, 3+ shovels and 2+ swords) however, you don't need to craft any sword or pickaxes if you find some in a blacksmith chest, as they are made out of iron. With these tools, continue to harvest some materials from the village. The materials you should harvest are:\nNote: Don't break \nAlternatively, you can use three iron to make a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;, take two &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; from the well meeting point, animal pens, farms, stables, fisher cottages, or from small house with farm to make an infinite spring, and take one &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; from the weaponsmith and use the water and lava to make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone generator&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeave &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s alone at this point, as you would probably not be able to defeat them yet. Check to see if &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s have reasonable trades, especially the armorer, toolsmith, and weaponsmith villager.\nAlso, be on the lookout for &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s because when they spawn in a Superflat, they generate at the surface (above ground). If the village doesn't spawn horses and you see any nearby, immediately corral them into animal pen, stable, butcher shop, or shepherd house. Search the village weaponsmith chest or tannery chest for a saddle. Tame a horse and saddle it to enable a very effective mode of transportation. Optional: in a weaponsmith chest you can find &lt;a href=\"horse%20armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt; for your horse.\nWheat.\n&lt;a href=\"Wheat\"&gt;Wheat&lt;/a&gt; can be one of your most valuable resources in &lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt;s. Apart from providing a stable food supply when made into &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, it can be used for &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, and most importantly &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;. Wheat is the best resource to trade with farmer villagers, as it is completely renewable, easy to acquire, and only 20 are needed to trade for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;, however not every farmer villager is able to trade for wheat. If the farmer village is not able to trade wheat for emeralds, break the composter until the trades are right, note that nearby unemployed villagers can also claim the composter. Through trading, you can acquire virtually anything you need. Wheat, therefore, makes items you trade with villagers renewable.\nStep 3 - Making your choice.\nAt this point, there are 2 paths you can take. You can choose to continue moving from village to village to amass valuable resources, or you can settle down in one place to farm. The advantage of being nomadic is that you can continue to acquire valuable, non-renewable resources throughout the game, but if you choose to be sedentary, you can have a much easier time building and farming, at the cost of limited rarer resources.\nNomadic.\nWhen being nomadic in Superflat, you focus on nonrenewable, valuable resources that can be found in village chests and pillaged from the village. Early in the game, you can get far more diamonds, obsidian, and possibly gold than you would in a normal world. However, basic necessities such as wood, cobblestone, and iron can be hard to acquire in large amounts without settling down.\nDismantle the village as much as possible. Take all &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, and other useful resources. Take all wheat to trade, and don't bother replanting, because you are nomadic, never return to that village. Kill the village's iron golem by towering up 3 blocks so that you cannot be hit. Once you have dismantled the village, take shelter in a house for the night, and in the morning take everything with you and repeat the first step: wander until you find another village. It may be a good idea to keep moving in one direction so that you don't end up at villages you have previously visited. In the cartographer's chest, you may find some maps and compass which can be useful. Live like normal nomadic survival, except using resources from the villages you encounter.\nWhen you have pillaged enough &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, create an &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Enchantments\"&gt;Enchantments&lt;/a&gt; are quite easy to get because of the abundance of &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s. Fight &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s whenever you see them for their &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Make a diamond sword if possible, or else an iron one. Your next step is to defeat the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhenever you find a big village with an iron golem, kill it if you can. Because there are no ores in a superflat world, this is the most effective way to obtain iron, the other finding it in chests and killing zombies, which drop it rarely. Dropping sand on the golem can sometimes kill it, but this is slow and tedious. If you have enough arrows, sniping them can be an effective tactic. Never &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; fight a golem without &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, as it deals heavy damage and can kill you in two hits. Whatever method you choose, get enough iron for a full suit of armor and all &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;. Enchant everything at least level one, and your armor, &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; higher. Alternatively, you can surround it in blocks or trap it in a pit and drop sand on it to kill it without risking death. This is an easy way to kill them, even in the early game.\nDefending your nomadic village.\nZombies can still do sieges as long as there's a way to get in. For protection purposes, surround the village with a 2 block high wall (to prevent skeletons attacking you and the iron golems), houses should not use wooden doors, as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s break them on Hard mode. An iron/piston door with a lever or button is sufficient, but a pressure plate should not be used as mobs can activate them and get inside of the village.\nNow you're ready for the next step: &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nSedentary.\nIf you chose to be sedentary, you focus on &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resource\"&gt;renewable resource&lt;/a&gt;s. You also can focus more on trading, as you have the potential to produce large amounts of &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; in a farm. Buy some melon seeds from &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s as soon as possible and set up a melon farm, as melons provide one of the most useful food sources in the game and &lt;a href=\"glistering%20melon\"&gt;glistering melon&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt; potions. Apart from &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, there are six major renewable resources that can be farmed in &lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; worlds. These are &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, wood, cobblestone, and &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;. Make tools from these as you acquire them. However, keep in mind that just because you have a resource doesn't mean that you have it renewably. Mining wood and cobblestone from the village eventually runs out, as do chests of iron. To continually acquire them while staying in your village, you must acquire them from iron golems (build a pillar at least 3 blocks high to avoid getting hurt), saplings, a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone generator&lt;/a&gt;, and iron golems, respectively.\nWood.\nChoose a home from the village, and put a chest, bed, and crafting table in it. Avoid dismantling the houses too much for materials, as zombies can easily get inside and kill villagers. Feel free, however, to dismantle the corners of the house and unnecessary ceiling pieces. Also, the wood surrounding the farms can get you a lot of wood as well.\nAfter finding shelter, your most important goal should be finding a &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;. They occur in the chests in the houses, if you didn't find one so you may have to look in several chests to find one. There is also another way to get saplings. You can buy from a wandering trader, who can sell you more types of saplings than oak. \nWrite down the coordinates of your home, and continue out in a direction until you find a village. Take everything in its chests, return, and repeat until you have a sapling.\nPlant the saplings near your home and wait (or use bones for &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, as saplings quickly grow into trees). As the tree decays if you take all the wood, chances are it'll drop more than one sapling (and an apple) \u2014 making wood plentiful. Then set up a home in the village.\nPut fences around farms, to keep the &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s from trampling it, or make a farm inside of your house. Make a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; you have gathered, so you can smelt &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"Coal%23Charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; up the village; you don't want monsters everywhere. Place some torches near your tree farm so that they grow faster (or use bonemeal for a quicker process).\nNow that you have a renewable source of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, your next step is &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;.\nCobblestone.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; that you have found in chests and got from killing &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, make a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have enough, go searching more chests for more, or if all else fails, kill more zombies until you have at least three &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. Go to a village and take &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; from the well and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; from the smithy to make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone generator&lt;/a&gt;. Now you have a renewable source of &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; \"and\" &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. Dig for &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and smelt &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a href=\"Coal%23Charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and you'll have everything you need. Your next step is getting renewable &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nIron.\nNow it's time to move out of the village. Make yourself a home that is a short distance from the village to keep it safe from the occasional &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;, and it is advised to have a small doorway so that in the event of a large group of slimes getting inside the outer gate, so they cannot get inside the actual building. Build an outer moat 3 blocks wide to capture slimes and other mobs. A dry moat works, as you can kill the mobs in it. Be sure to make it large enough for big slimes. Make sure to include a variety of farms in your house, such as (&lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s) to make the need for a risky venture to a village unheeded.\nYou can also work on an iron golem farm, using one of several methods. Make it big enough to spawn several at a time for a more effective trap. At first, it may seem like a good idea to just kill them, but this is dangerous and time-consuming, so in the long run, it is better to make a trap to kill them. There are a variety of ways to do this; see the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; page for more detail. Once this is completed, you can sit back for a while until you have enough iron for a full suit of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and all &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore you can move on to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;, you need at least ten &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't have this, go exploring more nearby or not-so-nearby villages for it. Press F3 and write down your coordinates, or make a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt; by trading for one or with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. If possible, get 4 extra obsidian and at least 2 &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s so you can make an &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;. You can save diamonds by buying your diamond sword and other tools from a blacksmith villager. Surround your enchantment table with &lt;a href=\"Bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; from the libraries, and with &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; gathered from &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s or mobs at night, it is possible to reach very high level &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;. However, you need &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, which you can get from cleric villagers. Use this to your advantage.\nOther.\nAnother way to find wood is by dismantling &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, specifically the watchtower and the logs (only if structure generates a pile of &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;dark oak logs&lt;/a&gt;). However, this way is dangerous for the early game, due that the outposts are heavily guarded by &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s who are armed with &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s, and also can respawn indefinitely around the structure, even when the structure is completely destroyed. On the other hand, pillager outposts also contain a chest with valuable loot and a massive amount of wood in the structure. When finding pillager outposts, look out to see if there are any trapped iron golems in cages. Free them, and these golems help fight against pillagers, if you're lucky enough to get iron from the chest, heal the iron golems periodically to keep them alive, otherwise, you'll need 36 iron ingots and a carved pumpkin (which is inaccessible). If you find a tent, utilize it for cover from arrows shot by pillagers. Also, never kill &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;outpost captain&lt;/a&gt;s (unless you want a challenge), but let them get killed by iron golems or from &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s shot by other pillagers and you won't get bad omen. \nKilling the outpost captain causes the &lt;a href=\"bad%20omen\"&gt;bad omen&lt;/a&gt; effect, which gets raised by the number of captains you kill. Pillager outposts usually spawn 1-3 pillager captains. During bad omen, if you enter a village, a raid occurs. A &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; is an event where &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s come to a village to kill villagers and the player(s). So if you don't want a raid, you can drink milk to remove bad omen or stay outside the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; for 100 minutes.\nStep 4 - The Nether.\nBefore venturing to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you have a diamond sword, a full suit of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; (preferably iron or diamond), and of course, at least 10 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. If you have 10 obsidian, you need 4 other blocks to use as placeholders, because you can't place blocks on the corners or edges of other blocks. It's also a good idea to make an &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;, as enchantments greatly help the player in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo light the portal, you can place wood planks in front of the portal, and place lava nearby (but not in the portal), since blocks inside the frame obstruct the area for the portal blocks themselves. The lava sets the wood planks on fire, and spreads inside the frame, activating it.\nBuild the portal in your house if playing sedentary. Contrary to popular belief, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s do not spawn near a portal, so you are safe from them. &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20piglins\"&gt;Zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt; may be nearby, but they do not attack you unless provoked. &lt;a href=\"Piglins\"&gt;Piglins&lt;/a&gt; are hostile unless you are wearing at least 1 piece of gold armor.\nIf you are being nomadic, portals pose more of a problem for you. The good news is, you have several options. If you have enough obsidian, you could make new portals as you move, to have continual access to the nether. Building the portal from the Nether saves you a lot of walking (as each block there is 8 blocks in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;). Also, that way you always know where your portal is. To save obsidian, you can mine it from the corners of the portals that spawn, or go mine the whole portal and go back through to regenerate it. This creates renewable obsidian that you can use for more portals. Your other option is to gather lava from &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and turn it into &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; where you are building your portal. However, this technique cannot be used in the Nether, as &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; evaporates, making obsidian impossible to create.\nIn the Nether, you can find many useful resources, but some have fewer uses than they do in non-superflat because other crafting ingredients are not available. &lt;a href=\"Nether%20wart\"&gt;Nether wart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ghast%20tear\"&gt;ghast tear&lt;/a&gt;s are not completely useless because of the trading system, which is the only way to get glass for potions beside killing &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es which are almost as rare as endermen, as there is no sand unless you bought it from a wandering trader. Buy enough to make several bottles, but splash potions are wasteful as it is rather costly. For this reason, &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; is only useful for &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20rod\"&gt;Blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s can be moderately useful to make a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;, for fueling it, &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;s. Glowstone is useful for decoration, potions, and &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;s by trading for &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; can be crafted with traded &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; to make a &lt;a href=\"clock\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt;, and you can still use it because its highly enchantable &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf playing nomadic, you should have more than enough gold found from the chests. If sedentary, however, you may want to make a &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; farm to obtain your gold. Zombified piglins are immune to lava, water cannot be placed, and &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; cannot be acquired unless you bought it from a wandering trader, so the best form of death is fall damage. If the piglins are almost dead and you deal the final hit, you get &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; as well as a chance for a rare mob drop or two, out of a gold ingot, sword, or their worn armor. Build the trap out of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; to protect it from &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, and make sure that it is protected from wild zombified piglins.\nIf you're really low on &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, kill some &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s because they drop coal and bones, but watch out for &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s because they also spawn in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed by finding a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, they will generate in the sky so you'll need blocks.\nVideo tutorials.\nAfter this video, you should be prepared to live in a village, so that you don't have to go search for resources in other villages.\nThis video helps you defending your village against zombie raids and more.\nThis video is a complete survival guide for super flat minecraft 1.18.2+\nExtreme challenge.\nThe Extreme Challenge is the superflat survival challenge without enabling the generated structures option. This is the identical situation to survival in a Flat world in Bedrock Edition. It's still possible to survive with this condition.\nThis extreme challenge is the \"only\" available choice for flat survival , because no structures generate in the flat world type in this edition. If you play on Bedrock Edition, just create a world, because the game forces the player to spawn in &lt;a href=\"creative%20mode\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt;. Activate cheats, and remember to only use commands once, just for changing your gamemode to survival, otherwise, it won't be an extreme challenge.\nIf you play on , just create a world with survival mode, generated structures off, and \"Classic Flat\" preset.\nMake sure to enable the \"Bonus Chest\". Your &lt;a href=\"bonus%20chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt; should have a minimum of 2 apples, and either a sapling or 4 planks (or 1 log) to make a crafting table. Without the bonus chest, it is impossible to obtain emeralds and future saplings.\nIt is possible to create a village by accomplishing a difficult sequence of goals:"}
{"id": "38251", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=38251", "title": "Tutorials/Survival in an infinite desert", "text": "This is a tutorial on survival in an infinite desert, whether that's a &lt;a href=\"Buffet\"&gt;Buffet&lt;/a&gt; world customized with the &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; as the only &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; world customized with the Desert Preset, or a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Biomes\"&gt;Large Biomes&lt;/a&gt; world, where you just happened to spawn in the middle of a large desert.\nThe challenge of the desert.\nThe Desert biome is one of the most difficult biomes for a player to survive and prosper in, owing to an extreme scarcity of essential resources in the natural environment. Typically no trees are available to make planks for even wooden tools or a crafting table. Without even basic wooden tools there is no obvious way to obtain cobblestone, and so there is no way to enter even the \"stone age\". Without a crafting table, crafting is extremely limited. Even basic survival becomes a real challenge in a desert, and different approaches are required in order to make actual progress.\nIf you spawn in a desert biome in a normal game, you probably just need to get somewhere else, fast - check out the Survival section, build a starting shelter, collect materials for travel shelters, and start exploring your way out of the desert, to somewhere more hospitable. This whole Tutorial only really applies if you intend to remain in the Desert biome indefinitely.\nIf you wish, you can make sure that the bonus chest is on so you get wood and other items.\nCreating a desert world.\nCreation: superflat vs buffet.\nIn Java Edition, to create an infinite, endless desert to survive in, simply create a new world, change the world type to Superflat, select \"Customize\", select \"Presets\", and choose the preset \u201cDesert\u201d, then Done. Then, create and start the world.\nIn Java Edition, there is an additional option called Buffet, which can generate a world more like the desert in normal Minecraft games, in which you can more easily mine for &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s instead of having to raid &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s for minerals or dig down to near bedrock.\nGo to Create a new world, change the world type instead to Buffet, then select \"Customize\", and change the Biome to \u201cDesert\u201d and the Generation type to \"Surface\". Then click Done and Create, and start the world.\nBuffet vs superflat comparison.\nThere are some fairly significant differences between the \"Superflat\" desert preset, and the \"Buffet\" desert. The Superflat desert has a limited range of resources (block types, mob types, etc.). The Buffet option allows you to disable Structures such as Villages (for extra challenge).\nThe Buffet desert has a greater variety of terrain features, including water lakes, and potentially rivers, that don't appear in the Superflat Preset Desert.\nCreation: Bedrock Edition.\nIn Bedrock Edition, you can select any of the world types (Infinite, Flat, or Old) and use &lt;a href=\"seed%20templates\"&gt;seed templates&lt;/a&gt; to pick a seed called \"Desert Village\".\nEdition and version differences.\nBedrock Edition.\nIn Bedrock Edition, the desert village preset seed is centered on a plains region, albeit surrounded by river, then the desert. Outside of the starting Plains region, this world is mostly desert, cut across by river biomes, eventually, become the ocean.\nAs such it offers an easier challenge because of the availability of trees at the start point, and because of the frequently encountered river biomes. \nThere is a discontinued preset seed, Vast Desert Oasis, seed 961601796, but this suffers from the same issue of having trees near the start point.\nIn summary, Bedrock Edition is not ideally suited for a hard \"Desert Survival Challenge\". However, the information in this article is still useful for a player who finds themselves in a desert biome or wishes to play this survival challenge by refraining from using the trees or other Plains Biome resources at the start point. Perhaps. Roleplay that you have been \"cast out\" from the Plains area, empty-handed.\nLegacy Console Editions.\nIn (non-Bedrock) legacy console editions, there is no Customized or Buffet world type, but a Superflat world can be customized as an endless Desert Biome. By adjusting the layers it can also have most of the underground structure of a normal Minecraft world. It should be possible to replicate the underground structure of the Superflat Desert Preset of Java Edition.\nExtra challenging options.\nFor (greatly) added challenge, turn off generation of all structures in the world creation customized settings. Another excellent challenge, not quite so difficult, is to turn off generation of just &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s, but leave the generation of &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s. These structures are much harder to exploit than villages and temples.\nSurvival.\nSurvival options.\nNormally if you spawn in a desert, you would try to find a more hospitable biome as soon as possible. If you have set yourself the challenge of desert only survival, that's not an option. \nIn a desert only game, the easiest route to making progress is to find a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;. These structures have resources that are incredibly precious because they cannot be obtained anywhere else in the desert biome (you can also obtain resources from &lt;a href=\"dungeons\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s, but dungeons are hard to reach and are not guaranteed to have the items you most need, and strongholds are far from an easy option, being an end-game related structure).\nIf you can't find a village or temple, mineshaft, or outpost, or if it takes a long time to find one, you need to take other approaches to survive while you explore.\nImmediate survival.\nVery few of the normal survival resources are available in the desert, particularly before you have found a village or temple. A different approach is needed for initial survival.\nDuring your first day, collect &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; (if you see any - there is none in a Superflat Desert), some &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, maybe &lt;a href=\"sticks\"&gt;sticks&lt;/a&gt;, and most importantly &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;. You get sticks by breaking &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es with your hands. This is the only source of wood in the open desert, but unfortunately, you can only obtain sticks, not wood &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;. This also suffers from the problem that this is non-renewable. Cacti are useful as defensive structures and defensive 'weapons'. Sand is your general building material. Dirt is the rarer, specialized building material, critical to building a roof or covered opening (e.g. a doorway). If you can't find dirt or are in a Superflat desert where dirt does not spawn, you need to craft a lot of sand into &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; right away in order to build a secure shelter.\nShelter.\nFirst, build a shelter mostly of sand blocks. Sand is the most abundant material. Dirt is more scarce, but you need either dirt or sandstone for your roof (since sand obeys gravity). First, identify a source of dirt blocks (except on Superflat). Then, pick a low sandhill in an otherwise flat area, flatten the sand off the hill by removing it and use those sand blocks to build your shelter house. You may want to leave a few 1x1 empty block spaces high in the walls as \"windows\" since it can be a long time before you are able to make glass or light sources. Make sure any windows are at least 2 blocks above the outside ground level, otherwise husk and zombie &lt;a href=\"Zombie%23Baby%20zombies\"&gt;babies&lt;/a&gt; can enter through them. When you add the dirt or sandstone roof you may want to add a \"skylight\", though there is a risk of a mob coming through the hole (if you allow a path for mobs to walk on to your roof). Keep an area of the house that is not visible from any window, so you can hide there from the ranged attacks of &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, and from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; line of sight to avoid &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s. Because you have none of the normal &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, any hostile mob is a real threat to you.\nInstead of blocking the doorway with a door (you don't have any way to make those) or a sand pillar, block it with a &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;. Either a 2-high cactus, or a 1-high cactus on top of a sand block. This allows you to see out, and also damages any mob coming up to your door. Make sure you have at least a 3 x 3 clear floor area in the house so that you can stay out of the activation range of creepers (or at least, one creeper). Maybe on your first night just make a 1x1 hole in the roof (too small for &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s to come through) and no 'windows' so you don't have to worry about creepers or ranged attacks. There is the possibility that an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; could fall through the 1x1 hole, but if one does, just don't look at it until it goes away.\n(Tunneling out of a trap is rarely an option in the desert because the sand collapses. For the same reason, it's problematic (but not impossible) to build lower levels under your house for storage, workspace, greater safety, or mining. See &lt;a href=\"%23Mining\"&gt;#Mining&lt;/a&gt; below for more information) \nIf you can't find any dirt, you are in danger and in difficulty. Unlike in normal biomes, you can't just dig a hole and cover yourself to survive the first night (in pitch darkness). If you have time, craft some &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;. If not, (in a Buffet world only) you could tunnel a short way into a &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; cliff face (very slow, with your bare hands) to make a small cave, and then block the entrance with sand and/or cactus. Or find a naturally roofed cave, and block first the inside and then the outside of the cave with sand/cacti. Or dig a 1x1 wide or 1x2 wide hole (no wider) down into the sand and surround the hole with 4 cacti in a cross shape, diagonally adjacent to each other, as tall as possible. That makes a survival shelter that should get you through the night. In the morning, make finding dirt your top priority, and failing that, craft sandstone - more than you need immediately since you can't re-use it, it is destroyed when you break the block. In a Superflat desert, you must make sandstone; none of these alternatives (apart from the \"cactus coffin\") are available. \nIn theory, a small house with 5x5 walls needs 32-34 sand for the walls, plus 25 dirt or sandstone for the roof. In practice, you can get away with less. You could use 10 blocks in a 3 x 3 pattern above the floor space (not above the walls), plus 1 block on the wall to anchor that 3 x 3 to the wall = 10 blocks. You could clip the 4 corners (but not the middle) off the 3 x 3 block and reduce it to 6 blocks, but if you go down the minimum blocks and are using sandstone, don't make a mistake! It takes a long time to break sandstone with your hands, and breaking it doesn't drop a sandstone block, the block just gets destroyed.\nDesert shelter construction plans.\nDetailed construction plans for a 5\u00d75 \"Day 1\" desert house are here: &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Desert%20shelter\"&gt;Tutorials/Desert shelter&lt;/a&gt;\nDefenses.\nOn your first or second day build a defensive system around your house. Dig two-block-deep trenches (or two-block high sand walls) in a square or ring around your house, at least 3 blocks away from your house walls. So for a 5x5 walled house, dig an 11x11 or 13x13 square ditch. \nIf you dig rather than build, you can collect most of the sand you need for a sandstone-roofed house. On the other hand, the fastest way to create a defensive barrier is to dig a one block deep trench in the sand, and use the sand collected to build a one block high wall on the inside edge (house side) of the trench, creating a 2 block high vertical obstacle that only spiders and flying or teleporting mobs can cross.\nThe 3 block margin around the edge is to stop creepers blowing up your house if they explode at your perimeter line. Put a bridge across this trench (or a \"doorway\" in the wall) only one block wide and block it at night, or whenever you are away from your house, with at least one cactus on the inward side. Make sure there are no loose blocks down in your trenches (or up against your walls); ensure that the barrier is fully two deep / two high everywhere (except at your cactus-protected bridge or doorway). Otherwise, mobs can cross any gap in the ditch or wall where it is only one block deep or one block high. Mobs may fall into the ditch, in which case you can easily (though slowly) kill them with your fist.\nBear in mind this ditch system does not (yet) stop spiders, so don't wander out at night and be careful coming out in the morning (particularly for creepers). Adding some cacti in the zone between the ditch and the house can stop spiders or at least harm them and alert you if they are there. If you have time, put a few cacti on your roof for the same reason. \nIf you place a cactus on top of a single block of sand, it's safe for you: you can walk or run into this 'potted' cactus without being hurt because the sand block is slightly wider than the cactus. The only way to hurt yourself is by jumping or falling onto it. This also means this type of cactus hurts only spiders (when they climb up on it), not other mobs. For any cactus you are likely to have to move around near to, the 'potted' cactus-on-sand method is best. For outer defenses that you don't normally go near, you can put the cactus straight on the ground so it is more likely to do damage. \nOn the next day (or sooner if you can work fast), add a second, outer trench ring, so that if the first trench ring is destroyed by a creeper you are not holed up inside your house and vulnerable to a second creeper destroying the house. Losing your house walls may mean a quick death because you cannot defend against the zombies and &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlso, add a wall of cacti (either later as an addition, or as an alternative to the ditch system). You can't place cacti next to each other and you can only place them on sand, but if you make a ring of zigzag (diagonally adjacent) cacti around your house, this forms a solid wall. As a bonus, mobs can be tempted into running into the cacti, taking damage, though this is a slow way to kill them. It helps if you are also hitting them at the same time. With the zigzag arrangement, if you get diagonally on from a mob, it can attempt to path through the (too small) gap between the cactus, and repeatedly hit the thorns until it dies. The cactus destroys any loot drop though so it's better to finish mobs off with your fist if possible. Also if the mob suicides against a cactus you don't get experience. The cactus wall also does not stop spiders, though it damages them slightly as they cross over it.\nAs the cacti grow higher, they do more damage to spiders that climb over them, making the spiders easier to kill by the time they reach you, and alerting you of their approach by making hurt sounds.\nStrengthening your shelter.\nSand is a weak material and subject to gravity which means it fares pretty badly if a creeper manages to somehow get through. Reinforcing the core of your main house should be a priority, after immediate survival, if you need to remain in the area. You need to continue to improve your spawn base, more so than in a normal game, because resetting your spawn point is likely to be difficult and take some time. Until such time as you have the ability to reset your spawn point to a 'safer' place than your spawn-area house, you should keep strengthening that house.\nIf dirt is readily available then it's possibly not worth the effort of crafting &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; when you first build your house because this process takes at least 4 times longer (plus crafting time) and sandstone's blast resistance is only slightly higher than sand. However, later on, start replacing the innermost walls (and floor and ceiling) of your house with sandstone, or at least, the walls and ceiling of an inner 'sanctuary' room.\nAlso, because you don't have normal tools, if you place sandstone incorrectly or change your mind, it's time-consuming to remove, making any placement errors or redesign a real hassle and any part of your house that is not made of sand, you can't place a cactus on, which can weaken your defensive options (you could, however, have a lower level of sandstone with sand on the top surface to allow you to place cactus).\nIf remaining in the deep desert long-term, if you have a crafting table and a bucket for water available, building your house from &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; could be a far superior option to sandstone.\nTemporary or travel shelters.\nIf you are exploring long-distance and not able to return to your original shelter, or have searched in all directions for one day's (return trip) travel from your original shelter, create new shelters along similar lines. Sand, dirt and cacti are your best building materials, particularly for quick portable shelters when traveling, because they are easy for you to destroy (move back into your inventory) without serious tools.\nFirst a 5\u00d75 (exterior) sand block house, 3 blocks high (solid roof at the 3rd level). Cactus for a door. Then, a 2-deep ditch at least 3 clear blocks distant from the walls. Then, a zigzag cactus ring and then an outer ditch. Or you can make a simple portable shelter with:\nOptional:\nYou can either disassemble this shelter with you in the morning and take it with you, or you can leave it in place to start to create chains of 'waystation' shelters. If you leave it in place, be sure to build a tall pillar with cactus on top near it or on top of it, as a navigational marker.\nIf you don't have dirt and are using sandstone, since you can't re-use the sandstone, carry multiple lots with you (or craft it each day), and leave each shelter in place. Leaving the shelters in place anyway is a good idea, as it allows you to safely make your return journey to your spawn base, in stages. Watch out for baby zombies.\nVillages as shelters.\nWhile it is tempting to take shelter in a village as soon as you find one, this may not be advisable. Your presence in a village during darkness attracts hostile mobs. Your presence overnight in a large village (10 beds or 20 villagers) draws large scale hostile mob attacks. Even if you survive the attacks, the villagers may not. You cannot afford to endanger the villagers, as they are an invaluable survival resource to you (because of their farming and trading abilities). You need to create a shelter of your own, a safe distance from the village (64 blocks from the village edge), and make careful preparations for the defense of the village before ever spending the night at that village. See more information below under defending villages.\nCombat.\nIn a desert survival situation, you generally want to avoid combat unless absolutely necessary, because you are weak compared to a normal game in almost all relevant ways: weapons, armor, equipment, and ability to recover after death. Even when you do acquire weapons, they are likely to have limited ammunition (arrows) or limited durability.\nYour combat style needs to be cautious, defensive, and based on misleading your opponents. The most lethal attack you possess is to maneuver a mob into a fatal fall. The next strongest attack is to smother opponents in the sand - but this requires excellent timing, or you can breach your own defensive barriers. Walls of cacti are less lethal but can be used to channel mobs to a point where you can slowly kill them, doing additional damage as they touch the cacti. Cacti are especially useful against spiders, which are otherwise difficult to keep at bay. A dense roof of cacti (on sand 'pots') is one of the few ways of killing &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s. \nA shallow trench, 2 blocks deep, around your house can trap mobs, which you can then kill \"by hand\". But beware of creepers in the trap. These you must kill quickly. Raise a wall two blocks high, behind the creeper, on the outside of your boundary trench, not the inside, and suffocate the creeper with sand blocks so it doesn't explode. Be careful not to accidentally build the creeper a step up out of your trench on your side.\nA deeper trench is a killing trap. Lure hostile mobs towards you to get them to fall into it. Chase passive mobs away from you, into the trench. For weak mobs a trench with steps at each end is fine, so you can go in and out to collect loot. But for dangerous mobs who might survive, leave the ends sheer drops, and build stairs down after all mobs are dead.\nCreate one small gap in your perimeter that you can partly open up to cause mobs to attempt to reach you. This is a choke point, where you can slowly kill them. Construct it with cacti so the mobs take additional damage.\nMore complex designs - 3D choke points - allow you to kill spiders.\nAlways consider &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt; babies and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; babies when designing a defensive killing choke point. These smaller, faster mobs can cross obstacles that other mobs can't.\nAlways have a secure fall-back refuge area you can retreat to if something goes wrong with your killing ground.\nFood.\nThe gory details.\nThankfully, \"Minecraft\" does not consider the need of human beings for water (perhaps all the cactus takes care of hydration). However, from Day 3, if you have not yet found a village, or earlier if you have been injured (from falling or fighting mobs) you need food. In the naked desert there are few options, as most passive mobs, such as &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, cannot spawn except at villages. While &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; can grow in the desert (if there is water), &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; is not edible in Minecraft. You can make &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; with sugar, but this requires many other ingredients that are difficult or impossible to acquire in the desert. \nSo, in a desert, outside of a village, the only living food sources are &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, and you probably have to eat them raw, which is not nutritious. A &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; becomes a valuable tool for cooking, making meat-based foods more effective.\nFirst of all, let's look at the food you can obtain without finding a village farm.\nRabbits.\n&lt;a href=\"Rabbit\"&gt;Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s can sometimes be difficult to catch. Early in a Desert survival game, you'll only be able to hit them with your bare hands, but if you are persistent you can eventually kill them. If you are lucky enough to be near water, chase them into water. They lose their speed advantage in water and you catch them more easily. Of course, the loot drops into the water so be prepared to swim after them. Also, don't get lost chasing rabbits and lose your way back to your shelter. That can be fatal.\nIn addition to rabbits dropping &lt;a href=\"raw%20rabbit\"&gt;raw rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, they also drop &lt;a href=\"rabbit%20hide\"&gt;rabbit hide&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to make &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;. However, leather is not much use without a full-sized &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf you are lucky enough to have any grass blocks or buy &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Trader\"&gt;Wandering Trader&lt;/a&gt;, you may be able to get &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s. With flowers, you can attract and breed rabbits. This then turns them into a renewable food source. Otherwise, you may have to keep wandering around the desert to find more rabbits after you have killed off all the rabbits in an area. If there are no flowers nearby, kill &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s for their &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s, because you can craft &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; and use that to fertilize grass blocks to grow additional flowers. As long as skeletons keep coming, you can create a permanently sustainable food supply this way. Alternatively, if you are able to mine &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, you can craft bone meal from those, but that is difficult without at least stone tools (bone meal can be obtained from various ways in villages, but villages can solve your food problems in easier ways).\nSo your renewable sustainable food chain (without a village farm) looks like this:\nskeletons or fossils --&gt; bone --&gt; craft bone meal --&gt; spread on grass blocks --&gt; new flowers --&gt; breed new rabbits --&gt; rabbit meat (probably raw, see below)\nWhen breeding &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, note that they are stupid and often kill themselves in falls (in fact, they follow flowers to their deaths, if you just want to slaughter them without having to chase them). Keeping them alive for farming can be challenging. They need at least a 3 high wall (or a 3 deep trench) to keep them from jumping out. Make sure your bunny enclosure doesn't give them the opportunity to fall. However, be careful roofing over your bunny enclosure, you don't want it to spawn monsters. If you can find water, an enclosure with water near the edges might keep them from suicide. The ideal enclosure is probably a three deep trench or pit (so they can't jump out), flooded with water (so they don't die falling in), only one block deep (so they don't drown). Or alternatively, a natural lake surrounded by a wall that lets the rabbits in but not out.\nRabbits are also present in Superflat Desert Preset worlds, but seem much less common.\nSalmon.\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to find a river, you might be able to tap into a new food source. Until then you must rely on rabbits or village food. Besides fishing, salmon can be acquired in buffet worlds through river biomes. They are easier to catch than rabbits and can easily be trapped in sections of rivers. Expanding river areas can allow increased salmon spawns. They\u2019re less nutritious than rabbit but more likely spawn in groups. They also drop bonemeal, for farming seeds or flowers. However &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt; can be a real threat if they carry tridents. Besides the threat of drowned, building your home in the middle of a natural lake or river biome would be safe. It would allow you to access food easily from the water. And at night , the water would protect against creeper explosions, and if two blocks deep zombies, husks, and skeletons.\nSeeds.\nIf you have any grass blocks, and more dirt, use the dirt to 'grow' more grass blocks, use bone meal to grow tall grass, harvest lots of tall grass and eventually you might get some wheat &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;. Seeds can also be obtained from Wandering Traders or from village farms. However, make sure to remember that you can only grow the seeds in a village farm that has already been turned into farmland, because you can't make a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; so you can't convert dirt to farmland. And unless you get a crafting table, also from a village, you can't even turn &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;. Without a village, probably the best use for seeds is to save them until you have managed to obtain two chickens from the incredibly rare husk &lt;a href=\"chicken%20jockey\"&gt;chicken jockey&lt;/a&gt;s. You could then use the seeds to attract and breed the chickens.\nMushrooms.\nIf you can obtain even one mushroom and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mushroom%20farming\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; it carefully, you can slowly create a renewable crop. You can do this much more quickly if you use bone meal to create &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushrooms\"&gt;huge mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. And if you obtain &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; from a wandering trader, you can even farm above ground, in sunlight.\nHowever unless you are able to obtain a &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt;, you cannot craft anything edible from the mushrooms, and their main usefulness is probably as a renewable source of fuel, not food.\nMob drops?\nRarely a &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; drops a &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;. This is beneficial if the player is about to starve; however, it is not useful long-term. You still lack a hoe with which to make farmland. The potato or carrot is good for only one meal, probably raw, but it's probably best to save it, in case you obtain a hoe or find farmland. However, hoes require material for the blade, such as wood planks, cobblestone, or iron, all of which are hard to acquire in a desert. Farmland can be found in villages, but these already have ample crops. A carrot might be more useful for enticing rabbits into a pen.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider%20eyes\"&gt;Spider eyes&lt;/a&gt; can be eaten, but the net effects are usually worse than not eating them. The poison does more damage than the food value is worth. They are only worth eating if you are already badly injured down to around half a heart (so the poison damage has little or no effect). Still, since you are unlikely ever to be brewing potions, you may as well stockpile spider eyes for the most desperate of food emergencies.\nZombie cannibalism.\nThe only other short term option for food is to kill &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"husks\"&gt;husks&lt;/a&gt; that come to your house at night and eat the &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the risk of poisoning, only eat this flesh when you are safe inside your house. If you create any solid barrier you can stand safely behind the barrier and slowly kill a zombie by hitting it with your fist. Before the rotten flesh despawns, quickly remove your barrier (for example, &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;), dart out to collect the flesh, dart back in your house and replace the barrier.\nThe slightly good news is that, because your combat ability is weak, you're better off fighting only during daytime when there are fewer &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s around. Therefore, you would probably be eating rotten flesh from husks rather than zombies. In addition, you might also find some more rotten flesh from regular zombies that burned to death in the daylight.\nNo structures?\nIn a desert world without any structures (villages for farmland and crafting tables, or other structures just for planks), your sustainable food chain is ultimately based on eating the undead (either directly, or via the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt; to flower-growing to rabbit-breeding chain, see above). Alternatively, you can just keep moving, like a nomad, and feed on the non-renewable rabbits.\nIn this situation, it's advisable to reserve the raw rabbit for eating during combat and use the (probably more plentiful) rotten flesh whenever you are somewhere secure, e.g. your base.\nCooking?\nDue to the problems obtaining &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, you are unlikely to have a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; with which to cook your food. However, even if you do obtain a furnace (e.g. from a village or by blasting cobblestone with a creeper explosion), you still probably won't want to cook your food. Unless you are farming mushrooms, the reason being that wooden fuel is much too precious and limited in supply in the desert biome to waste it on cooking food. (See Fuel below).\nVillage farms.\nFood becomes much easier when you locate a village with a farm. At that point, you can finally move beyond bare subsistence and survival. Given that you still can't afford the fuel to cook your food, the best food item to farm yourself may be &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s. On the other hand, if there is a crafting table in the village you can craft wheat into bread, or if there is a Novice Farmer you can trade 20 &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; for 6 &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; - nearly as effective as making your own. \nAlways replant after harvesting. Be careful not to destroy farmland. Because it is difficult to obtain a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;, you are unable to create or recreate farmland. Without farmland, you can't grow crops. Every block of farmland is precious. Be sure to use, or create, paths (or water) adjacent to every farmland block, so you never have to step on farmland. Every time you step on farmland you risk irreversibly destroying it. Farmland is not only useful for food for yourself. It is essential for keeping villagers happy and encouraging them to breed. This is critical because you need as many villagers as possible, of as many types as possible, in order to progress by &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;. \nChests in village houses can supply bread to eat, wheat for various purposes, and other useful items. Village houses contain &lt;a href=\"beds\"&gt;beds&lt;/a&gt; so that you can reset your spawn point and pass the night in safety - probably moving the bed out of the village first.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt;, desert village farm can also grow melon stem, which can be useful for melons as food, as villagers are unable to harvest and replant melons, but melon stem can grow infinitely. Cats and even farm animals also spawn in desert villages. Farm animals in village pens usually only spawn in pairs, so be sure to always breed more animals than you slaughter.\nFishing.\nAs sticks can be collected from dead bushes and string is dropped by spiders, you could use a village crafting table to craft a &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20Rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;, giving you a sustainable food source (using water from wells or river biomes and repairing or replacing rods with anvils/grindstones/crafting tables). However, this is likely unnecessary as village farms provide better food anyway.\nFuel.\nEven if you get a furnace, the supply of fuel for the furnace is extremely limited. You only have dead bushes, whether collected whole or broken into sticks, and these are non-renewable in a desert biome. Once you have broken or collected all the dead bushes in an area, you get no more fuel. And it takes a lot of sticks to power a furnace even for a short time. So you should conserve all your sticks for the most critical operations, bearing in mind you also need sticks to craft tools and weapons if you ever manage to obtain cobblestone or iron (sometimes gained from mob drops). While it may be tempting to trade sticks to a &lt;a href=\"fletcher\"&gt;fletcher&lt;/a&gt; villager for &lt;a href=\"emeralds\"&gt;emeralds&lt;/a&gt;, consider carefully whether this is your best course of action.\nUsing precious fuel for cooked food is a luxury you almost certainly can't afford. Because of the shortage of fuel (if you lack a pickaxe to mine coal or a campfire to cook food) arguably one of the most important iron items to craft is a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;. That has the highest claim on any iron you find (with the exception of an iron pickaxe). With a bucket, you can switch to using lava as fuel. Lava is highly abundant in the desert biome, far more so than wood. With a Lava Bucket, cooked food and smelting become viable.\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to stumble across a pillager outpost, proceed with caution, mining in from underneath or fighting your way inside. From the outpost you can acquire wood blocks from the side of the structure. If crafted with sticks from bushes and precious coal, a campfire can be used indefinitely to cook meat and potatoes.\nA small amount of wood for fuel can be obtained by breaking the furniture inside village houses. It's not advisable to burn doors, but the functions of &lt;a href=\"fences\"&gt;fences&lt;/a&gt; (which the furniture drops when it breaks, along with oak &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plates\"&gt;pressure plates&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;jungle button&lt;/a&gt;) can be replaced by other much more plentiful blocks (sand walls for example, or sandstone walls with sandstone slabs for \"windows\"). The pressure plates might be worth hanging on to in case you want to automate some doors or traps. The highest priority on fuel is definitely to smelt iron ore. Be careful to exactly calculate the burning time of each precious wooden item, and feed the next type of item into the furnace as soon as the fuel slot is empty.\nA strong recommendation would be to not use any wood for fuel until you have smelted enough iron for a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have a bucket, obtain &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and use that for fuel, conserving any wood and sticks.\nIn a scenario with no villages or other structures, your only initial fuel consists of dead bushes and their sticks, making it even more important to conserve fuel until you have a bucket for lava.\nWeapons and tools.\nYour starting weapon in the desert is your fist, or if you prefer, a stick or a chunk of &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;. These all do the same amount of damage and are a slow way to kill any mob. In this way you can kill single mobs, mobs that are stuck behind a defensive obstacle you have created, or maybe a wounded one that breaks through. Almost any mob at full strength can easily kill you, and multiple mobs in the open are likely to kill you because you have weak weapons and no armor.\nNo wooden weapons can be crafted without &lt;a href=\"plank\"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt;s, apart from a bow (&lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s from dead bushes and string from spider kills), but even a bow requires a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, which requires planks. A &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; usually provides a crafting table, but not planks. With a crafting table, however, you can bypass wooden tools and weapons and go directly to stone tools and weapons, if you can get &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; by other means, such as a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; (without a wooden pick which is the normal way). Alternatively, you can craft an &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; if you obtain 3 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingots\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; drops. Statistically, this would require killing about 120 zombies.\nYour best chance to get weapons are from a village &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; or from &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; drops. Your first real weapon if have not found a village with a crafting table is likely to be a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; dropped by a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Pillager\"&gt;Pillager&lt;/a&gt;, or less likely an &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;iron shovel&lt;/a&gt; or iron &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you find a village with a crafting table, you can quickly craft a bow. You can collect &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, but there is almost no chance of crafting arrows, due to the lack of &lt;a href=\"chickens\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"feathers\"&gt;feathers&lt;/a&gt;. Buying them from village fletchers is possible but expensive. This means the bow must be used sparingly, for tight situations, emergencies, or high-value targets.\nIn a village with weaponsmith or toolsmith, there is the possibility of weapons in the blacksmith's chest; as even an iron shovel is a huge improvement as a weapon. In addition, you have the option to trade with villagers for weapons. For example, you can trade &lt;a href=\"paper\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s and then emeralds for weapons or armor or tools, next section. Trading with &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s is an excellent way to escape the limitations of the &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nIt's a similar story with tools. It is difficult to make any 'technological' progress without some kind of pickaxe, or any 'agricultural' progress without some kind of &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;.\nLight.\nThe desert is slightly forgiving in that it has higher ambient light levels at night. Nonetheless, monsters still spawn. Obtaining light sources in the desert is challenging. The basic light source is a torch, but these require coal or charcoal. Charcoal requires wood blocks, which are totally absent from the desert. Coal ore does exist, but mining it requires a pickaxe, which requires wood planks, which are again absent from the desert. The best long-term sustainable light source is probably lava, but if you do not have the capability to make a bucket, the only way to use lava is to move your base to a lava source and perhaps slightly extend the effect of the lava by digging shallow trenches for it to spread from the source. If you have a bucket you can make \"lava lamps\" from stone-lined holes.\nEven in villages, there are only a small supply of torches and &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickles\"&gt;sea pickles&lt;/a&gt;, and no means of creating extra ones. You must redistribute the small number of light sources optimally to prevent monster spawning and construct your defensive perimeter to be no bigger than the area you can protect from spawning (in a village because you have a crafting table, you can also craft sandstone slabs to inhibit spawning).\nIf you do somehow obtain a pickaxe, light becomes much less of a problem because you can mine coal, and make torches from coal and sticks (from dead bushes) even with your basic 2\u00d72 crafting grid. With a pickaxe and a 3x3 crafting table you are home free, because you can mine cobblestone, make stone tools, make a furnace, and then (if you can find fuel, see above), progress to iron tools and beyond.\nBeds, sleep, and spawn points.\nThe lack of planks and crafting tables prevents you from crafting a bed. As a result, you cannot reset your spawn point and you cannot sleep.\nAs you can't set your spawn point, build a strong defensive base at or near your spawn point. If your main base is not at your spawn point, build a smaller survival shelter exactly centered on your spawn point, but with walls far enough away from the spawn point that you respawn inside the walls, not outside. Ideally, create a safe tunnel or enclosed passageway to your main base.\nThis is why at the start of a new game, before you even move, you should dig down one block to mark your exact spawn point, then add another marking to make it clear it's the spawn point (a 5 X 5 ditch, for example). It's also a good idea, at the start of the game, to dig a directional arrow in the ground pointing to the rising sun. And, early on, create a tall pillar by pillar-jumping, so you can find your way back to your spawn-point and base if you get lost (as often happens when fleeing or fighting mobs).\nLack of sleep brings &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s every night. The best way to deal with these is to build a roof garden on your house with 'potted' cacti (cacti on a one-high sand block). Once the cacti are two blocks high the phantoms attack relentlessly and die against the cacti without harming you. However, you must offer yourself as bait so that they crash into the cacti. The phantoms can then kill themselves before the sun rises, and you can go about your daytime activities in peace.\nOnce you find a village, sleep, then break some of the beds and carry them with you. Leave at least one bed (the one you slept in) in case you are killed and respawn there, and for when you are visiting that village.\nStorage.\nUnless you find a village or other structure containing chests, barrels, or other storage, you have no form of persistent storage and no way to create any (because there are no planks). Your personal inventory is your only persistent storage. Your personal inventory is actually quite limited. There are some considerations that arise from this: \nOnly break blocks that you definitely need. Don't clutter your inventory with anything except what you can actually use. Don't be a hoarder!\nRemember, any time you break a block, the item is now on a timer to despawn. Either now, or later if you are forced to drop it. So break blocks only when you need them, or when you are going to leave the area behind. An unbroken block does not despawn and remains there forever until you need it.\nIf you find any chests, break them and bring them to your main base. The chest may be more valuable than the items in it. Keep at least one chest in each location though - don't remove all chests from a village, for example.\nMining.\nDigging, tunneling and mining in the desert are challenging because the sand collapses. It is problematic (but not impossible) to build lower levels under your house for storage, workspace, greater safety, or mining. Mining and tunneling, in general, are made difficult by the scarcity of roofing material and the gravity effects on sand. Further limiting factors are usually the lack of tools, time, and light. Tunnel ceilings need to be built from above, before digging a tunnel through the sand. Otherwise, it becomes a ditch, and/or you suffocate in it. Similarly, mines tend to be strip mines or open cast mines rather than underground mines.\nFor large scale mining probably the best approach is to mark out a large square and cut steps down the side of the square in a continuous spiral. For example, a 16\u00d716 square allows you to dig down about 60 layers without needing roofing materials or light sources. (You might want to check your altitude with F3 before starting a mining project). Without tools, progress is slow, and you can potentially waste ore as well. Arguably, there is not much point starting a mine (except a sand mine) unless you have first obtained a pickaxe.\nIt's probably a good idea to build some survival shelters at the top of the staircase and at intervals along with it, in case you get caught by nightfall or by something blocking your path back to your house.\nAn alternative approach is to make your spiral steps go down half the way around, then come back up again. This has the advantage of giving you at least one escape route. It allows you to lure a creeper down one entrance, to try to get it to explode at the bottom, and still escape through the other exit. It might be an idea to block the exit with sand blocks to make sure you don't have another mob blocking your way when you try to escape.\nCreepers cannot only help you mine stone or cobblestone; they can also (in Superflat, for example) help you mine down to those useful layers first. If you are good at persuading creepers to explode, without harming you too badly, you can use a series of creeper explosions to dig down. This could save you a lot of time and effort. The other really good thing about creeper explosions is that they cause some of the affected blocks to drop as items. This probably the only way to achieve those drops without some kind of pick.\nIf you mine (Creeper or otherwise) down to a solid (non-gravity affected) block layer, and if you have a pickaxe and any source of light (&lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;), you can then mine in the normal way.\nCobblestone mining strategies for superflat desert.\nYour primary objective for mining in the endless desert is to obtain &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and so 'Enter the Stone Age'. The Sand Age, Stick Age, and Cactus Age are decidedly less famous - and for good reason. In a Superflat desert, with no tools, you face digging through 8 layers of sand (about 48 blocks worth before you're roofed over by sandstone) and then through about 52 layers of sandstone, by hand. That is no mean feat. The intent is to expose &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and then persuade a willing &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; to blast it into cobblestone. Then, there's the whole problem of getting a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, but that's another story. Here are some strategies for the \"Big Dig\" - in all cases, first use F3 to check your altitude, and check the world settings, so you know how far you have to dig.\nSingle staircase.\nTwice as fast as the above method, but riskier. As above except:\nShaft.\nThree times as fast as the single staircase, but possibly more dangerous and requires more patience.\nDigging straight down is normally a terrible idea, but in a Superflat world it's (probably?) safe. As long as you don't forget your sand stack!\nHowever, the need to dig the 24 block long passage for spawning more or less completely negates the advantage of the shaft over the single staircase method.\nYou can also use the Shaft method to dig illumination shafts into your staircase once it starts disappearing a long way under the sandstone. However, don't do this until you are deep enough that the fall is certain to kill any mobs that fall down the shaft. Also, don't forget your big sand stack, just in case you make a mistake and fail to connect with your staircase, meaning you can't walk out, you must pillar-jump out.\nExplosive digging assistance.\nAs noted above, while tediously digging down through the sandstone, you can persuade creepers to help you by exploding. As a bonus, they convert the destroyed sandstone to collectible items (useful for building your bottom shelter perhaps). However, it's debatable whether this is worthwhile, as it increases the risk of being killed by a creeper for not much gain. The creeper destroys a wide area outside your 1 block wide staircase (or shaft), so the useful work is only probably 3-4 extra blocks. You must also rebuild or reshape your staircase, so overall possibly not worth it unless you are extremely confident with safely triggering creepers.\nRivers, grass, and flowers.\nIf you are using Buffet world generation rather than superflat world generation, a &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; biome may appear along internal borders between two Desert biomes [needs testing in 1.14]. If this has a low bank, it may allow &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn (as the grass is still in the \u201cRiver\u201d biome). The grass blocks can be 'grown' by adding adjacent dirt blocks, and the growth of flowers and tall grass can be boosted with bone meal. \nRarely there may be a wide enough space here for an &lt;a href=\"oak%20tree\"&gt;oak tree&lt;/a&gt; to spawn. In that case, be sure to create a tree farm from any &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s you collect from it. As trees are almost essential for normal &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;, this would be useful. Once you have trees, almost all of the special difficulties of the desert biome go away (apart from Husks).\nThere is also the possibility of &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; and, less commonly, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; spawning. In combination with seeds for breeding chickens, from grass, this means it's theoretically possible that a river biome can create sustainable food in the form of &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt;. Pumpkin can also be bought from wandering traders, and sold to farmers for &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s. Saplings can also be bought, providing an alternative to the river method above. However, because it is rare to find emeralds, make sure you think twice.\nFinding a village or other structure.\nIn practical terms, the best way to make progress in a Desert survival situation is to find a Village. Other structures, such as desert wells, pillager outposts, desert temples, mineshafts and strongholds, are either less useful (wells) or much more challenging (all the others).\nAfter creating your infinite desert, once you have secured a survival shelter, explore the immediate area around - being careful of course not to lose the way back to your shelter. As with any Minecraft game, it helps to build a high pillar near your spawn point and/or initial shelter, so you can find your way back to it. Climb the nearby high peaks in the morning, and scan the horizon at midday. If you see a &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, build a temporary shelter at the point you spotted it and go to the village or temple the next day. Make sure you return to your shelter before dusk and that you are not in or near the village at night. Otherwise, the village may suffer irreplaceable damage to mob attacks caused by your presence.\nIf you don't find anything, get back to your main base and explore in a different direction. If you have explored in all directions one day's travel from your main base, you must start using small shelters as way-stations to increase your search radius.\nExploiting a village.\nThe most important items you can retrieve from a village are the &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and tools - most importantly an iron &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; if you are lucky - from the weaponsmith or toolsmith chest. You can also find &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; in these chests, or even use &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s (also found in village temple chests) to make tools - most likely a gold pickaxe that you would use only to obtain enough &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; to make a stone &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. \nIron, diamonds, and emeralds can be taken from villages and temples (for tools and trading). Dirt can be taken from villagers' farms - but best only do this if you have a hoe. Ores do spawn in deserts (even in the Superflat Desert preset, but in that case only on the bottom 3 layers, or next to lava ponds). However, without a pickaxe, you are not only unable to collect ore, but also unable to build a furnace to smelt any ores (or cook any food). The furnaces in a village blacksmith are therefore extremely useful.\nActually, the best possible item you could find in a village would be some kind of &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;. Oak saplings can be found in weaponsmith chests sometimes. If you find a sapling, start a sapling farm. Make sure you are never so greedy for wood that you forget to farm leaves for more saplings than you cut down. Once you find a sapling (or actual tree), most of your problems are basically over. You have renewable wood. Wood means tools, weapons, fuel, charcoal, light sources. Wood means pickaxes, which means cobblestone, which means stone tools then iron tools then diamond tools. With one sapling or tree, you are back to playing a normal game of Minecraft - just in the desert.\nExploiting a desert temple.\nDesert temples (unlike village temples) are guarded by hostile mobs. You need to be confident in evading, trapping, or killing mobs (or a combination of these) in an offensive style, before tackling a desert temple. \nRemoving the resources from the lower part of the temple may require building a spiral staircase down, around the inner walls, probably using sandstone blocks. The easiest way, however, is to dig straight down one wall near a corner, then pillar-jump back up after you have looted basement. Do not step in the center until you have mined the central pressure plate, lest you die in the explosion.\nExploiting desert wells.\nBecause you don't need to drink in \"Minecraft\", wells are of little use until you can craft a Bucket.\nExploiting other structures.\nOther structures (apart from wells) are more challenging than a temple from a mob point of view and are best left until you are in a much stronger position.\nUsing locate commands.\nIf commands are enabled, you can use commands if you couldn't find any: and , although you are playing on Survival mode, as otherwise there really isn't much point in a 'desert survival' challenge, in which case cheats are not enabled. However, if you are really stuck, you could copy your game world, recreate it as Creative, and use the commands above or just fly around to locate the nearest village.\nWeapons, tools, and armor.\nTools.\nAs has been covered above, obtaining a Pickaxe is perhaps your highest priority. Obtaining a hoe is also valuable. See the preceding discussions on this.\nWeapon crafting.\nAs noted above you are unable to craft a weapon until you can either find wood planks for a crafting table or more likely locate one at a village. You then need to find cobblestone or, more likely, Ingots or even Diamonds to create weapons. Bear in mind that creating your first pickaxe is hugely more important than creating any weapon or any other tool. Creating a Bucket for Lava is almost as important as a Pickaxe, and arguably even a Hoe is a higher priority than any weapon.\nWeapons and tools from mobs.\nHusks, zombies and skeletons sometimes wear armor and sometimes enchanted, which have a chance to dropped. You can get bows and arrows or even enchanted bow from skeletons, iron swords and iron shovels from husks or zombies or illagers. Of course, iron hoes or iron pickaxes would be much more useful. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt; drops may provide you with a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; but neither they nor any other mob in an illager raid provides any useful tools in \"Java Edition\". Illagers may also drop iron weapons, including\u2014in Bedrock Edition (only)\u2014possibly an iron pickaxe from a pillager. &lt;a href=\"Witches\"&gt;Witches&lt;/a&gt; may drop potions which could be useful in combat. Various mobs may drop Emeralds which can be traded for tools, weapons or armor with the correct type and level of the villager.\nDefending a village.\nThe immediate problem when you have found your first village is that you are probably still weakly equipped, and the from the first night you stay in the village you risk drawing normal mob attacks on the villagers or (for a large village) causing a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20siege\"&gt;zombie siege&lt;/a&gt; on the village. So what you need to do is build a shelter near the village, but outside of its radius (at least 33 blocks), and go into the village only during the day. You might want to just collect food (remember to replant it) and the crafting table, and any tools, and leave. \nUnlike a normal game, it is extremely important to keep all the villagers alive, because, for many resources in the game, even basic ones, trading with villagers is your only way to obtain those resources in the desert biome.\nIf you want to stay in the village\u2014which has many advantages\u2014you need to secure the village and the villagers before you make your home there. Go in during the day each day to build up defenses, being sure to leave before dusk and get a good distance away. \nTo secure the village, again you can use two-block-deep trenches or two-block-high sand walls, or a one-deep ditch next to a one-high wall\u2014the fastest method if you are digging in sand. Check out the village and figure out the smallest trench/wall system that covers all the occupied houses in the village. Check for sandstone and cobblestone and plan to hug these regions of hard stone, not cross them with a ditch\u2014breaking rock takes too long by hand. Even if you have a precious pickaxe, it's too valuable to waste on this kind of activity. \nIgnore the unoccupied houses and farms at first. Leave them outside your walls or trenches initially. Later, you can include these into your defensive system. \nFind every house with a bed and mark it (e.g. with sand and a cactus on top) - villagers live in it, so it's a priority for protection. Find the houses without beds - unoccupied houses. Take any torches or other light sources from inside or outside of the unoccupied houses and block (fill) the doorway with one or two sand blocks so no villager or mob can enter. Redistribute all the light sources in the village evenly so that the occupied houses at least are lit, and preferably the areas inside your wall/trench system are also lit. If you don't have enough torches, move the beds (and some doors) from some of the houses and add them to one central house. This should move the villagers to that central house, keeping them closer together and easier to protect. Alternatively, move all beds, light sources, and doors to the largest most central building to concentrate the villagers in one protected and easy-to-defend place. \nThen when all your defensive preparations are ready, do a last double-check of your perimeter and make sure there are no gaps a hostile mob can sneak through (except spiders probably, but they are the easiest to deal with). Then prepare to spend your first night in the village. Track all the villagers. When they are indoors, block them in by putting two blocks of sand in front of the door. Make sure you move a job block (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Village%20mechanics\"&gt;Tutorials/Village mechanics&lt;/a&gt;) inside the house (if you have traded with the villagers already, you may want to try to keep them with their job, so as not to reset any leveling). Also, put two blocks on either side of the door to stop mobs from attacking on the diagonal. Also, put an inner wall of sand 2 high inside the building to keep villagers going next to the walls and being attacked by mobs \"through\" the walls. \nThis should keep them safe until morning. However, villagers are stupid; they go outside while hostile mobs are still alive. Desert villagers also seem completely oblivious to the fact that Husks roam freely in the daytime. Because of this stupidity you probably need to keep all the villagers imprisoned for their own protection in one main building. Make yourself a little room in the building so you can go in there to trade with them without them all escaping. It really is for their own good!\nDoing it the hard way - no villages, temples, or structures.\nThis is for \"Java Edition\" only.\nIf you challenge yourself by not allowing the generation of villages or temples etc. - or if you just can't find any - your situation becomes difficult indeed. You can obtain shelter, safety and food using the techniques described above, but you can't obtain any tools and your crafting is extremely limited. You have no easy way to access &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; items, and more importantly, no way at all to create a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; (no source of &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;). With only a &lt;a href=\"2%C3%972%20grid\"&gt;two by two crafting grid&lt;/a&gt;, even if you had cobblestone, or other tooling material (planks or ingots), you are unable to craft any type of weapons or tools. Not even stone or wooden tools. Without tools and with only limited crafting, progression beyond basic survival is not possible. You must disable villages and temples, but you must enable all other structures.\nYour first day.\nOn your first day, break dead bushes for sticks, and gather dirt and cactus. Gather sand. Use the dirt you got to make your shelter and use cactus for basic defense. Kill as many rabbits as possible for rabbits meat. You must eat them raw at this time.\nYour first night.\nOn your first night, you have to fight monsters with your bare hands. Kill as many zombies for iron ingots and rotten flesh. If you get carrots or potatoes, don't eat them because you can farm them later. Use creepers to blow up skeletons to get bones and arrows. Kill a few witches for glowstone dust. If you can, get some armor from zombies and get an iron shovel or sword for a basic weapon. Note that you might not be able to do all these on your first night. Still, try to get these goals over a few nights. Phantoms appear after 3 nights, which are difficult to fight. When they swoop down, quickly hit them and wait for them to come back down. Repeat until the phantom is dead.\nGetting wood and stone.\nAs long as you enabled generated structures that are not villages and temples, it is possible to get wood and stone.\nTo get stone, you need to use creepers to blow up the stone. If you are lucky enough to get a golden pickaxe from a ruined portal, you can use it to gather as much stone as possible until the pickaxe breaks.\nWood is more difficult to get. You need to find a pillager outpost or a mineshaft to get logs and planks (only planks in mineshafts). Be careful of cave spiders and pillagers, and make sure you have some armor, at least leather or better.\nOnce you get a crafting table, you can make stone tools. You should also make a bed. You can get wool from string from killed spiders or cave spiders. If you have an iron ingot, make a shield. If you have more, make a water bucket. Once you have those things, you can go mining (only in buffet, not in superflat). Try to get iron and gold, as well as diamonds if you are lucky. Once you get more iron, make these in order:\n- Shield (if you don't have one)\n- Bucket\n- Iron Pickaxe\n- Iron Sword\n- Iron Armor\nIf you find a lava pool, you can use it to make a nether portal or mine obsidian with a diamond pickaxe. Access to the nether makes it possible to beat the game if strongholds are enabled, because you can get blaze rods and ender pearls.\nThe Nether.\nIf you are on version &lt;a href=\"1.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt; or later on &lt;a href=\"Java%20edition\"&gt;Java edition&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20edition\"&gt;Bedrock edition&lt;/a&gt;, then you can create a nether portal using a water bucket and a lava bucket, and light it with a plank to get to the Nether (this works in all versions with the Nether). But use 1.16, because if you find a &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt;, you can find crimson or warped fungus, which can be used for wood. If you also manage to find a &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt; biome, you can use the black stone for a cobblestone source. On all versions with the nether, you can use the &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es to get &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rods\"&gt;blaze rods&lt;/a&gt; (be careful when doing this, as you can easily die of fire.) to make some &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt;s with blaze rods and &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s (found by killing &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; in warped forests, or rarely in the over world. Next, escape the Nether and use your eyes of ender to find a stronghold and (carefully) beat the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Next you can see the tutorials:\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20a%20Nether%20fortress\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating a Nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20a%20bastion%20remnant\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating a bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20the%20ender%20dragon\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;\nGetting villagers.\nGetting villagers has many advantages, including getting emeralds for overworld wood, diamond armor and tools, sugarcane, and many other renewable items as well. You need to get two zombie villagers. Each mob spawned has a 1/515 chance to be a zombie villager. You need two splash potions of weakness and two golden apples. \nSplash Potion of Weakness.\nYou need a brewing stand and at least 1 blaze powder, which you should have gotten from blaze. The other ingredients are more difficult. To get the water bottles, you need to get it from bartering with piglins. The spider eye can be obtained from killing spiders. To get the brown mushroom, find it underground or in the nether. You have to get the sugar from killing witches.\nGolden Apples.\nYou cannot craft the golden apple because you cannot get apples. However, you can find it in dungeons, mineshafts, bastions, ruined portals and strongholds.\nCreating a village.\nVillages are places where you can trade with villagers to obtain more resources, such as food, tools, armor, etc. Surprisingly, it is still possible for the player to create villages, even when game-generated village structures are disabled.\nOnce you got the potions and golden apples, find two zombie villagers at night and cure them by throwing the potion at them and feeding the golden apple. Quickly block the zombie villager so it doesn't die before converting into a villager. \nOnce you get two villagers, start by placing them in minecarts to keep them safe and build a building around them. Then, give them professions. Your first villager should be a fletcher with the stick to emerald trade. You can make a fletching table using 2 flint from gravel and 4 planks (nether wood works) Use the nether wood you gathered to make sticks and sell them to the fletcher. Your next villager should be a farmer with the bread trade and a carrot or potato trade. If you got a carrot or potato from a zombie, you can farm it and sell the excess crops. You can also buy bread for food and villager breeding. One emerald is 6 bread, which is enough to get 1 villager. Make more beds from wood planks and wool (from string). After you get more villagers, you can start to employ them. Each profession has its own trades and benefits.\nWandering traders.\nUsing the emeralds from the villager trading, you can buy useful resources from the wandering trader. The best things are flowers, dyes, sugar cane, red sand, kelp, coral blocks, saplings, plants, podzol (for renewable dirt), slimeball, packed and blue ice, etc. Do not buy a nautilus shell because there is no heart of the sea to make a conduit.\nZombifying and curing.\nYou can cure villagers multiple times if you want, to get the cheapest trades. This table shows the number of cures required to make all trades 1 emerald or 1 item.\nOther things you can do.\nFarms.\nThanks to the wandering trader, villagers, the nether and end, there are many farms that can be created. Tree farms for overworld wood are possible, as long as you have some dirt. All crops are also farmable, including chorus fruit. You can build bartering farms, hoglin farms, fortress farms and gold farms in the nether, and enderman farms in the end. Lava is also renewable from dripstone and dripstone blocks. All flowers and dyes are renewable from wandering traders. Overworld mob farms are also possible. Chickens can spawn as a chicken jockey in the nether, allowing for chicken farms. However, grass blocks are unobtainable, making flower farms useless although flowers are renewable. Sweet berries are unobtainable. Turtle eggs are also unobtainable. Mobs that require specific biomes cannot be spawned, such as turtles, strays, guardians, overworld animals, and drowned. Things like scutes, prismarine, raw beef, steak, and tridents are unobtainable. Villagers allow for renewable diamond armor, enchanted books, bells, and many other things. Raids can produce totems of undying and hero of the village can produce clay blocks, making terracotta renewable. The wither can be killed for nether stars and beacons.\nStructures other than villages.\nMineshafts.\nOne possibility for obtaining planks in a desert biome with Structures would be to find a natural cave or &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt; and then dig down (which would be quite slow without basic mining tools) and attempt to find an &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt; which is a treasure trove of oak planks (but home to deadly &lt;a href=\"cave%20spiders\"&gt;cave spiders&lt;/a&gt;).\nDungeons.\nDungeon chests contain useful items including ingots, seeds, and buckets. However, all of these things can probably be obtained more easily from a Village (directly or, in the case of a bucket, indirectly via iron ingots).\nThere are unfortunately no wooden planks or wooden logs available in a dungeon.\nPillager outposts.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;1.14&lt;/a&gt; there is another way to find a wood source without obtaining saplings or trees, which is via &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Pillager outposts generated above ground consist of a huge amount of dark oak logs and the watchtower floor is made of birch planks. However, trying to tear down all the planks is a difficult challenge as the player with early equipment (or none) can easily be killed by the &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s guarding the outpost. If the pillager outpost generates with a trapped iron golem, you can free the golem. While the golem fights with the pillagers, you can collect wood. If you are lucky to find a single outpost with two or more trapped golems, you have more time to collect wood as more iron golems can survive longer in the outpost before killed by pillagers (due to the fact that pillagers spawn infinitely in and around the outposts).\nAn alternative tactic is to trap the illagers rather than kill them. This might (needs testing) prevent further Illager spawns, and thus would allow you to collect the wood without being attacked.\nPossibly helpful mods.\nHypothetical mods.\nThe following mods, either individually or in combination, would reduce or eliminate the frustration level of endless desert survival:\nAddons.\nFor Bedrock Edition, one can modify using behavior pack to edit codice_1 in biome folder. Then edit the world_generation_rules.\nDefault code:\n \"minecraft:world_generation_rules\": {\n \"hills_transformation\": \"desert_hills\",\n \"mutate_transformation\": \"desert_mutated\",\n \"generate_for_climates\": [\n [ \"warm\", 3 ]\n },\nTo make an endless desert, change it like this: \n \"minecraft:world_generation_rules\": { \n \"hills_transformation\": \"desert_hills\",\n \"mutate_transformation\": \"desert_mutated\",\n \"generate_for_climates\": [\n [\"medium\", 99999999],\n [\"warm\", 99999999],\n [\"cold\", 99999999],\n [\"frozen\", 99999999],\n [\"lukewarm\", 99999999]\n }, \nThis generates a world with almost endless desert biomes. However, the player usually spawns on little islands (far away from world center), if this happens just teleport to the coordinates 0,0 and start survival in an endless desert. Make sure you teleport higher than Y 60, as this could result in you suffocating.\nModifying Bedrock level.dat world file.\nBy modifying the level.dat file, you can get an infinite desert. You have to:\nIf you don't know the worlds directory:\nRaiding techniques for desert temples.\nIf you have a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, just dig down two blocks away from the blue terracotta on the floor in any direction. If not,\nSummary.\nIf you can't find a village,"}

When data packs are disabled, gameplay in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode becomes much more difficult.\nIntroduction.\nWith the advent of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"data%20packs\"&gt;data packs&lt;/a&gt; have been added to the game and can be enabled and disabled. Many of the vanilla game mechanics, such as &lt;a href=\"advancements\"&gt;advancements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mob%20drops\"&gt;mob drops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chest%20loot\"&gt;chest loot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;vanilla crafting system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, and similar gameplay mechanics, are now stored in a default data pack called vanilla. Disabling the vanilla data pack, without adding any custom data packs, cause all that to disappear, which considerably adds to the difficulty of the game. It causes the conventional tech tree of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; to more advanced technology is no longer operant, and searching through &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"generated%20structure\"&gt;generated structure&lt;/a&gt;s is of no use, as the chests have nothing in them. Also, killing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s are useless as well, as they no longer drop anything. As a result, even basic survival becomes a challenge in such a world, and very different approaches are required in order to make actual progress.\nDisabling data packs.\nTo disable the vanilla data pack, you need to have access to &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;. Upon initial entry into the world, type to the chat.\nSurvival.\nThis tutorial assumes you are playing on &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13.2&lt;/a&gt;, or a snapshot between &lt;a href=\"17w48a\"&gt;17w48a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13.2-pre2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13.2-pre2&lt;/a&gt;. This tutorial is no longer valid for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt; and future updates, as starting in snapshot &lt;a href=\"18w43a\"&gt;18w43a&lt;/a&gt;, block and item drops are now included in data packs, which means that no drops come from breaking crops when data packs are disabled, making it impossible to trade with the farmer villager. \nFinding a Farmer Villager.\nWhen you first spawn in the world, the first thing you need to do is to find a farmer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;. This is important, because although one may survive on only &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s from chopping down &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dark%20oak\"&gt;dark oak&lt;/a&gt; trees, the only way to make progress up the tech tree is through trading with villagers - this is because there is absolutely no crafting whatsoever in this world. The farmer villager is necessary, because it is the only way to gain &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s from this world at start, as its initial trades include a trade of &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, or &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s for emeralds. All other trades are either trades that require you to trade in emeralds, which you do not have initially, or it requires you to trade in an item you cannot get as crafting and mob drops are unavailable, or for the cleric villager and shepherd villager, you simply do not have the tools yet to get the item. \nFinding a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; is a hard task to do, as &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s within a typical world are usually hundreds of blocks apart from each other, and many villages have not even a single farmer villager. Find a desert, savanna, or plains &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; and look for villages here, as these are the only biomes that spawn villages. When you come upon a village, if the village has a &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; or multiple, harvest all the crops in the farm of the village, as even though there may not be a farmer villager in the village, it is still important to gather as much crops such that when you do finally encounter said farmer villager you can finally trade your crops for &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s. The crops also provide an alternative source of food for you instead of the apples derived from cutting down trees. However, do not destroy the &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, as you would have no way of restoring the farmland once destroyed, because of the fact that it is impossible to acquire a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; with data packs disabled.\nProtecting Villagers.\nThe villagers' worst enemy is you. For a large &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, your presence can bring a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20siege\"&gt;zombie siege&lt;/a&gt;. Even in a smaller village, your presence brings mobs, and these rapidly kill off the villagers. So for your own interests, as well as theirs, you must be sure to be a long way out of the village before nightfall, and not come back until the sun is well up. You need a shelter at least 33 blocks from the village center. Unless you are sure where that is, give a good safety margin and stay 50 blocks or more from the village. This applies to all villages, even ones without a farmer - you may well be back to trade in this village after you have done your initial trades with a Farmer. A deserted village or &lt;a href=\"zombie%20village\"&gt;zombie village&lt;/a&gt; is no use to you. \nIf you must stay in a village overnight, it takes several days to prepare the village to survive your presence. Move all the &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt;s, (and enough &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es) to the largest building, to move the villagers into it. Then surround this main building with an extra layer of dirt or sand all along the outside walls and doors, since mobs can attack villagers who are standing next to walls or doors. Finally, block the doors once the villagers are all inside, so they can't get out. If they can get out, they will find a way to get killed. Create some kind of \"airlock\" so you can get inside the main building to trade with the villagers, without risking them escaping. \nThat's the first defensive measure. Once that is done you can build 2-high walls or 2-deep trenches at the limit of light range (7+) to prevent any spawned &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s from entering the inner part of the village. Once that is done, if you are staying a long time, consider &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;-proofing these defenses (with overhangs). At that point, you might be able to consider letting the villagers out of the main building, but don't underestimate their creativity in getting killed. Make sure there is no &lt;a href=\"gate\"&gt;gate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; leading outside the village 'compound'. Leave some kind of block obstacle for exit/entrance to the village that only you can remove. Make it a couple of blocks, in case an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; removes the critical block.\nTrading with Villagers.\nOnce you have found a farmer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, your survival has now been made much easier. You now have the ability to get &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing you to progress further into the game. However, you may need to farm some more, as you need a lot of emeralds for the various trades you need to make. Once you think you have enough emeralds, it is now time to find other villagers, most importantly the armorer, the toolsmith, the weaponsmith, and the fletcher. The world outside of villages and your temporary houses on your search for villages is still a very dangerous place, and it may be wise to get some protection and means of defense against mobs such as &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. \nBy trading with villagers, you can get some important tools and weapons without having to craft. The armorer provides the necessary &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; for protection, with various enchantments as well, the weaponsmith provides handheld close-range weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, and the fletcher provides &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Meanwhile, the toolsmith provides a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, useful for breaking and gathering more blocks. You can also get items from the shepherd, the librarian, and the leatherworker villagers if you wish to. If you find that a particular type of villager is not available at the village where you found your farmer villager, you need to go to other villages that you have either visited previously or new villages in order to find the villager you wish to trade with.\nIt was possible before &lt;a href=\"18w06a\"&gt;18w06a&lt;/a&gt; to trade with a cleric for &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, but now it is no longer possible, as &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; recipes have been added to the vanilla data pack, instead of being hardcoded into the game, which causes all furnace recipes to be disabled when the vanilla data pack is disabled. As a result, gold ingots are now impossible to get. &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;Rotten Flesh&lt;/a&gt; is impossible to get because mob drops are disabled without the vanilla data pack. Hence, all trading with clerics is now impossible. \nEntering the Nether.\nIn order to enter the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;, you must find or create at least ten &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; blocks, to make the portal. Obsidian blocks are usually found in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; flows above a still block of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, usually falling from a source block down to either an underground pool of lava or the natural layer of lava on the y-coordinate 11 and below in &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s. If you find none, you may attempt to lead &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to the lava by digging a tunnel from a lake, a river, the ocean, or a single water source block to a lava pool or the natural layer of lava, as you have no method of directly transporting source blocks for &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s are unobtainable. \nOnce you have created and mined the necessary obsidian for the &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;, it is now time to open the portal. Although it is impossible to acquire a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; in this world, a nether portal can be activated by any flame, including one spread from neighboring lit blocks and lava. Thus, build your portal by a lava source block, and wait until the random ticks allow the lava fire to spread to the portal and light it. Now you can enter the Nether. When going to the Nether, make sure you have the necessary &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, tools, weapons, and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these supplies can be acquired by trading with a villager."}

Once you have wood, you will need to make farms as quickly as possible. You first need to make sure you have the following items:\nAfter you have the basic survival supplies, the first thing you need to do is create a 'safe zone' (i.e., somewhere lava cannot set things on fire). As &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; is an important resource in the game, create a cobblestone farm. See the following steps:\nYou may notice that sometimes when you mine the cobblestone, the cobblestone item goes into the lava and burns up. If you have sufficient iron, place &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s underneath where the cobblestone generates, all leading into a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, so the mined cobblestone ends up in the chest. You could also use &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s to automatically push cobblestone away from the lava, letting you mine it without having to worry about any of it burning.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Tree%20farming\"&gt;tree farm&lt;/a&gt; should also be set up so as to gain maximum yield harvest, so place your saplings around 3 - 5 blocks apart, with the exact distance between saplings depending on what tree you're planting. You now have a rather steady source of &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; for repairs and &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s or other needful things. Now, if you're on any other difficulty except for peaceful mode, you will need to have a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Crop%20farming\"&gt;crop farm&lt;/a&gt;. If this is a wheat farm the best way to go about doing this is to make an &lt;a href=\"Water%23Infinite%20water%20source\"&gt;infinite water supply&lt;/a&gt;.\nA wheat farm should be set up as large as you care to take it so as to have max yield. If it is a melon or pumpkin farm, the following should be used:\nAnother great way to obtain infinite supplies such as food, wool, leather, and other passive mob drops is to create a Mob Farm. First, create a penned in area with fences and fence gates. Then, lure two of each species you want into the pen using their preferred food item (such as carrots for pigs, wheat for sheep and cows, seeds for chickens, etc.). Once you have two of each mob you want, you can breed them at any time you want- provided the parents have a five-minute cooldown period. You can slaughter the mobs at any time, just bear a couple of things in mind. First, to kill any passive &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt; in one hit, use at least a stone &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and jump before attacking to critical hit. Second, remember to keep at least two of each animal so you can use them for breeding and supplies infinitely. \nOnce you have these basic farms, you should be able to live in a single place indefinitely.\nIron golem farm.\nFor additional common resources, such as iron, an iron golem farm can be built. However, this needs villagers.\nWithout any villages around (such as Skyblock), a good strategy to get villagers is to get a &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt; from the Nether. You then craft a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt; and brew a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt; of Weakness. Then, capture a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; and make sure it can't escape or get harmed by another zombie, but that you can still reach it. (In Skyblock, glass bottles can be gathered by killing &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es that spawn occasionally). First, throw the splash potion of Weakness at the zombie villager. Then, you only need to feed it a golden apple and wait.\nDo this again to another villager because at least two villagers are required for gossiping, then craft and place a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smithing%20table\"&gt;smithing table&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; to let the villagers adopt the professions of weaponsmith, toolsmith, or armorer. Trade with them till they reach apprentice or journeyman level, after which you can buy a bell. You need to trade several times and allow villagers to resupply at their &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block when their trades get locked. They can unlock their trades twice per day. If you don't have emeralds, you can trade coal. Once you buy a bell, place it near beds so villagers will recognize it as gathering site. Now you have all the supplies needed for an iron golem farm.\nIf you have a village nearby, you can build an iron golem farm directly in a village, eliminating the need to transport villagers. For a tutorial on how to make an iron golem farm, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Iron golem farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn SkyBlock.\nIf you're in a SkyBlock world, gathering resources is a bit different, due to limited space and resources. The biggest things are to never craft items or blocks unnecessarily, make farms for any renewable resource before using up that resource, and being careful, since a careless player could easily fall into the void in SkyBlock. There are some items and blocks that need to be acquired differently than normal Survival, however.\nFor making potions, you will need glass bottles. This may seem to be a problem however, as glass bottles require glass or sand. Neither are feasibly renewable pre-village and may not spawn at all in a SkyBlock world. What you will have to do is get &lt;a href=\"witches\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; to spawn and drop a glass bottle, or fish up a water bottle. Keep in mind that witches are rarer than other mobs. The only way to acquire &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; in SkyBlock is to kill &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglins\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt;, find a river biome and farm &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, or smelt gold equipment. &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s, however, can spawn anywhere and sell most items or blocks needed for skyblock. But, their trades can be useless as a player needs &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s for them and most of the prices are somewhat expensive just for a single &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the hardest parts of SkyBlock is finding a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;. This is because SkyBlock only consists of a few blocks, which is not enough room for a nether fortress. However, mobs that only spawn in nether fortresses will spawn where a nether fortress would be if it were a normal map. One way to do this is to keep building platforms outwards, until nether fortress mobs start spawning. Note that this may take a very long time, as nether fortresses are often very far away from each other. Another way how to find a place where nether fortress mobs should spawn is to find seed of your skyblock world using /seed and then create a normal world, using the seed. Then enter the nether portal, find nether fortress, memorize the coordinates of it and then build a platform at the skyblock world exactly on these coordinates."}

Automatic farms allow the player to get a large amount of sweet berries without needing to harvest them manually.\nMaterials.\nTo build an automatic sweet berry farm, you must have the following materials:\nBuilding.\nFirst you need to build a rail system that makes a minecart move in an infinite loop using powered rails. Rails should also be placed on a flat square surface and make sure to place rails on the top of every block on the surface.

As of 1.8, it is also possible to build a TNT cannon that works with pistons and slime blocks.\nNaming standards.\nThere are 2 types of cannon names: The \"common name\" gives a picture of what the cannon can do and how easy it is to build. The \"technical name\" gives the specifics of the cannon, like how much delay the redstone repeaters have.\nCommon names.\nThe common name of a TNT cannon is a short numerical description followed by the cannon's nickname. It is useful for comparison of two cannons and gives the reader an idea of what the cannon can do at a glance. \nThe common name of a cannon consists of five parts: the damage value (DV), the ergonomic value (EV), the TNT amount (TA), the maximum range (MR), and the nickname. They appear in this order:\n&lt;DV&gt;.&lt;EV&gt;:&lt;TA&gt;.&lt;MR&gt; &lt;Nickname&gt;\nExample: 40.86:8.104 Basic.\nDamage values show how \"good\" a cannon is, the higher the value, the better it is. It is calculated as the average of three values: accuracy, power and speed.\nThe accuracy value is calculated from the accuracy input, which is the average of the distances from the explosions generated from the shots to the average of their positions. \nIn the image to the right, the accuracy input is the average of the lengths of the blue lines. The red dot is the average of the positions of the explosions, and an endpoint of each of the blue lines, the others being the explosions. The accuracy value equation is codice_1, where \"A\" is the accuracy input.\nThe power value is the number of TNT in the shot times ten.\nThe speed input is the distance between the front of the cannon to the average position of the centers of the explosions. The speed value equation is S/5, where \"S\" is the speed input.\nThe damage value is calculated using this equation: codice_2.\nErgonomic value tells how hard a cannon is to build, higher values signifying easier build. It is the average of the construction, redstone, and TNT values.\nThe construction input is an estimate of the number of blocks in the cannon, excluding fire, water, air, and TNT. The construction value is codice_3, assuming \"B\" is the construction input. \nThe redstone value is ten minus an estimate from one to ten of the complexity of the redstone, times ten; codice_4, where \"R\" is the estimate.\nThe TNT value is codice_5, and \"T\" is the number of TNT needed to operate the cannon at maximum capacity. \nThe whole equation to calculate the EV is codice_6.\nTNT amount, maximum range, and nickname are pretty self-explanatory, but to clarify, the TA is the same as the TNT value of the EV, and the MR is the distance from the front of the cannon to the farthest explosion.\nThe nickname is whatever you name it, assuming it's not profane, and nobody else has already named a similar cannon.\nThis is how the 40.86:8.104 Basic cannon was named.\n Damage value = (((45 - )*2) + (*10) + (/5)) / 3 = 40\n Ergonomic value = ((1000 - )/10 + ((10 - )*10) + ((50 - )*2)) / 3 = 86\nTechnical names.\nA cannon's technical name should give its readers a complete picture of its function, use, and method of operation. While it is impossible to anticipate every innovation in TNT cannon technologies, most cannons will benefit from using these standards in their technical names.\nThe featured TNT cannon above would be named \"114.0R4.4M2\".\nBuilding materials.\nSurvival mode.\nAs discussed in basic concepts, there are many parts of a TNT cannon.\nCreative mode.\nIn creative mode, there is no reason to build a TNT cannon for warfare, but is the optimal mode for testing and developing cannons.\nFactions.\nIn factions raiding with TNT cannons is the most common way of getting into a base. There are two main methods. The first (on servers where enabled) is to airburst. This only works on obsidian with water outside. The cannon shot must have a delay so the explosion reaches the obsidian but the primed TNT must not be in the water. These cannons will not work on other walls. The other method is with hybrid cannons which are explained below. The basic hybrid is one of the most commonly used raiding cannons.\nLimitations, and ways to possibly get around them.\nThe five big, main limits to TNT cannon engineering, ordered by importance, are:\nCannon sizes and special features.\nThe default definition of cannon size is how many TNT are in the shot or how far it fires. If you are talking about compact cannons, you might be talking about literally the size of the cannon (e.g. how much space it takes up) or if you are talking about cannons meant for mass destruction, you might be talking about the size of the shot. But usually, people mean charge mass.\nA small cannon, such as a 112.0MM3 cannon, only has a very small range, and is meant for stopping large amounts of rushing players or mobs.\nA medium cannon, such as the 116.0R4.6M2 is meant for setting up as a first line sieger, to be set up and aimed at a target such as supplies or a wall while one has arrow cover, or to be set up as an anti-archer cannon.\nA large cannon, such as the 119.0R4.10M3 is for attacking from a distance, a borderline long range mortar, an anti-cannon defense, a second line sieger, and many other uses.\nA sniper cannon, such as the 119.3R4.10M6 is for a tent line sieger, setting up to shell opponents camp when they can't even see the cannon shelling them, and other out-of-sight range tasks such as that.\nAnd of course, mass demo cannons, such as the 187.0MM6 spread-shot, which is used to completely mutilate any defenses whatsoever.\nPlayers also like to add features to their cannons including:\nCharge condensing.\nTNT-based condensing.\nBecause the force from an explosion is weaker the further away from its source, TNT placed more than 7 blocks from the projectile have little to no effect. To remedy this problem a condenser charge may be used.\nA condenser charge works by exploding slightly before the main charge, with the intention to push other primed TNTs towards the projectile. Since the main charge is closer to the projectile, it will be launched with more force.\nPiston-based condensing.\nUsing pistons to push the main charge closer to the shot also does the same thing as a condenser charge, more complicated to build but more controllable. To work, the main charge must be primed, turning the solid TNT blocks into entities. Once they are entities, a series of pistons can push and concentrated all charges into a single block space behind the shot. In this system, you get far more efficient power from a given size of charge.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzpGWNJf_QsA%26amp%3Bt%3D3m24s\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nCare must be taken so that the pistons do not displace the water blocks protecting the cannon from TNT damage. To do this, one usually has to apply water a block above the area where the pistons would go into. It is also advised that the pistons should \"retract\" back into normal position before the main charge explodes, or your cannon might be destroyed. When the pistons extend, they create air spaces in the water no matter what, hence compromising the water's protection.\nGuide blocks.\nWhen a TNT charge is primed, it will usually shift slightly to one side, which can reduce the accuracy of otherwise well-designed cannons. A simple solution exists: add guide blocks so that there is a wall on either side of the TNT when it is primed. This will prevent the TNT from shifting left or right, resulting in a straighter shot, with less diagonal variance. If your design does not allow for this, you could just make the guide blocks one block higher, instead of being on either side of the TNT. This works because TNT will jump up, then go sideways in midair. Note that in most basic cannons, guide blocks should be transparent if the TNT cannon automatically primes the shot-otherwise, the redstone that ignites the charge will power the block next to the shot, and igniting the shot as well. If this explanation is unclear, look at this diagram:\nIn dry cannons, a guide block is almost a necessity because dry cannons tend to be inaccurate. However, dry cannon's guides are for directing the shot to be shot accurately, not to be primed accurately. However, guides can also decrease range if they are too long.\nShot mounting blocks.\nThe shot mounting block for a cannon should be chosen according to how fast, far, and high you want the cannon to fire. Of course, these variables depend greatly on the position and amount of the charge and the timing of the shot, but the mounting block also can make a difference. For example, with a cannon with a charge of 5 and a delay of R4.3, the shot will take a mortar trajectory with a ladder more than with a fence post and pressure plate.\nA few things:\nA rewrite for most of these mounting blocks is coming soon.\nCannon tutorials.\nDispenser-based cannons.\nNote: the example cannon needs modifications to work in Bedrock Edition because dispensers still make TNT hop ending up with the first TNT destroying the machine. This can be fixed by putting that dispenser on a separate water flow that goes into the same block, also allowing for long range cannons.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Update\"&gt;Redstone Update&lt;/a&gt;, redstone &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s dispense ignited &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; instead of dropping it. This feature can be used to make better automatic TNT cannons. \nThe cannon to the right uses dispensers to release TNT into the water. When you press the button, first the long row of dispensers will fire. After a 33-tick delay made the &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s, leftmost dispenser will dispense the last moment before the TNT detonates, giving the shot a longer range. Note that the leftmost dispenser is higher than the other dispensers, and that the water should be flowing towards the front of the cannon. Dispensers dispense TNT without the characteristic \"hop\" of ignited TNT, which helps ensure the TNT will land in a much shorter radius than a conventional TNT cannon.\nOne of the smallest TNT cannons is this design by Mumbo Jumbo:\nYou can easily modify it to have another dispenser under the water facing up, and you can use a fence post with a pressure plate on top instead of a slab.\n\"Pros:\" The time taken to reload TNT is at its absolute minimum. All a player has to do is to make sure the next shot is placed \"after\" the first shot is fired to make sure you don't destroy your cannon. This cannon requires little skill at all to fire; the hardest part will be placing the cannon a proper distance away to make sure you don't over/under-shoot. Such precision makes this cannon good for castle defense. Furthermore, through use of comparators, it is possible to make an easily aim-able dispenser-based cannon, and dispenser-based cannons do not blow themselves up if hit with another TNT cannon.\n\"Cons:\" Dispensers and TNT are expensive. This type of cannon can never be quite as hardy as manual cannons, since dispensers can be blown up with TNT. Furthermore, if the cannon is left loaded and unattended, it is trivial to steal the TNT from its magazine. (This is also true of conventional auto-cannons.) Dispenser-based cannons with a one-block-wide water pool have also been known to blow themselves up, particularly if left firing automatically and unattended.\nAn automatic cannon can easily be made with this design. Substitute the button for redstone and hook the redstone up to a clock. Be careful not to set the clock under 4 seconds, the same time as it would take the TNT to explode. If the TNT is reloaded too quickly, the timing can cause the shot to detonate before the propellant does, destroying the entire cannon.\nReloading cannons.\nTraditional.\nReloading cannons are one of the most complex designs for beginners. However, as long as close attention is paid, for a first time build, it can be created in about 15\u201320 minutes depending on the size. Reloading cannons became obsolete when dispensers were added (except in the console editions).\nThe Good: Reloading TNT cannons can be customized just as easily as any other cannon (using fences, iron bars, glass panes, etc.). They can be shot several times with only a few seconds' interval in opposition to having to reload it several times like you'd have to do with a standard TNT cannon. Using the simple design, this TNT cannon can have up to 12 rounds in the magazine. If playing a fortress war server, this cannon can fire repeated shots which will demolish the enemies' buildings before they have time to stuff their ammunition into their puny and inferior weapons.\nThe Bad: Unfortunately, cannons of this variety are bulky and often unattractive. They require sand or gravel which are nonrenewable resources in survival mode. Added to that, it is tedious to reload the cannons whenever the magazines run out of ammo, however occasional that may be. With standard TNT cannons, if the 1-round magazine is destroyed, it is usually easily replaceable. This is not the case with the reloading kind, as the entire magazine will explode, destroying the weapon and all the redstone wiring with it\u2014often killing you in the process. This type of cannon has also become redundant with the recent updates allowing automatic cannons utilizing dispensers to reload the tnt, which is easier and more compact to make.\nDispenser reloading.\nIn order to avoid having to manually place TNT into every dispenser of a cannon, some more modern cannons have been designed to use a minecart or hopper system in order to distribute a large stack of TNT from one location such as a chest into all of a cannon's dispensers. There are issues to using such systems, primarily that nearby minecarts may break if the cannon's charge is too powerful, and the necessary redstone circuitry and hopper designs may be deemed too large or complex to be practical.\nThe Chaosrider design for the 112.0R1.2R4.1M6 Reloading WOLF uses minecarts and hoppers in a compact and semi-efficient manner:\nShort-middle range cannons.\nCannon.\nYou will need: 14 building blocks, 4 &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, 4 &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, 6 &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s, 1 bucket of water, 1 &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; and at least 4 &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuper Quick Raid Cannon.\n\"Pros: Very simple\"\n\"Cons: No water means terrain damage. Can damage you a lot. Requires a bow\"\nThis cannon only requires a flame bow, 2 arrows, and 8 TNT (though you'll want to use either water or good armor).

It is very efficient and shoots you very high in the air.\nDownwards TNT Cannon.\nThis cannon has very few uses, but can be used instead of a gravity fed TNT dropper.\n3x9 Pressure Plate.\n\"Pros: easy to build, understand, and use\"\n\"Cons: any mob can accidentally use\"\nThis cannon requires water, redstone, any block, TNT, and pressure plates. Make a 9x3 rectangle, break the middle of a 3 on one side, and put 2 more blocks on both sides of the hole, straight up on the blocks. Pour water into the other side, and place TNT everywhere but source, and between the highest blocks. Make stairs down one side of the high areas, place redstone on the stairs, one block away, then add a pressure plate. Place redstone along the frame until you get to the high points. Put three redstone past the far corner by the stairs, and place another pressure plate. Step on that, wait a count of 3 or 4 secs, then go step on the other plate. The high TNT will fly out up to about 50-60 blocks. \nNote: The water source neutralizes the lower TNT to prevent destruction.\nOne-button defensively ranged cannon.\nRepeater used as delay.\nIt is a simple cannon that has an automatic delay. Used mostly for guinea pigging other, larger, prototypical cannons or as wall mounted defense against ground- based troops or artillery.\n114.0R4.4MB2 - The naming system for it can be found above.\nMinecart used as delay.\nOnce you activate the switch, first it activates the charge wiring, then sends a minecart around the cannon that triggers a detector rail, which primes the shot. Saves redstone, but takes a lot of iron (However, if you get rails from abandoned mineshafts this design can even save you resources!).\nDispenser used as delay.\nOnce you activate the switch, first it activates the charge wiring, then shoots an item out of a dispenser that will slowly fall down through a pressure plate on a fence and burn. Saves redstone, and requires no repeaters for those survival cannon engineers, Over all, it's cheaper than the design above and normal automatic delay cannons with repeaters used as a delay.\nHuman (or other entity) launching cannon.\nOnce this cannon is set up, then it can be used in order to launch &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; onto other objects or areas of the map. It can be a little difficult however to get the entity inside the cannon,if it's something other than a human. (this can be done by putting the entity in a minecart and using rails to get it in)\nEnder cannon.\nThis type of cannon is easily constructed, very powerful (practically infinite) yet flexible with its charge and hilarious to watch unfold. The only downsides are that it requires an active ender portal and you will need to be in creative to survive maximum charge. \nIt operates on the principle that the fuse timer on primed TNT is reset to 0 when it passes through an end portal. This means that a potentially infinite amount of TNT can be used as a charge, simply by condensing it into 8 blocks of space. \"Minecraft\" will not detonate them until you are in the end, thus making the computer itself the limiting function.\nVertical launcher.\nThis cannon, often called vertical launcher, other times called \"Fireworks cannon\" can be used to launch TNT blocks vertically, so that they can explode whilst midair.\nLong range cannons.\nFor long range cannons it is best to use a cannon with multiple rows of TNT for the charge, and depending on the elevation of your cannon, playing around with mounting blocks helps.\nIf you add multiple shot TNT to your cannon, and play around with where you place the TNT in your cannon, then you can effectively destroy anything in the cannons path.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20190710100333/https%3A//giant.gfycat.com/BelovedAntiqueBernesemountaindog.webm\"&gt;3X3 TNT Minecart Cannon.&lt;/a&gt;\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/7w4qsr/3x3_tnt_cannon_with_adjustable_range/dtxfx1b/\nAnvil \"Baseball\" cannon 1280M3ANVIL\nCheaper Cannon that uses Eight Charge Pieces of TNT to launch 1 to 2 anvils up to 75 blocks on Ground Level and Further at a Higher Elevation Is Built by simply Wiring up Eight Dispensers to a Single Lever without a Delay and a Water Stream moving towards the two Anvils that are Hand loaded over an Upward Water Column that, If done Right, will cause the Anvils to Jump up and Down, the Cannon casing should contain a Slab preventing the TNT from Reaching the Water Column and a Basic Surrounding case. To fire Pull the Lever once when Both anvils are Staying low on the Water Column, By the time the TNT fires the one anvil will be leaping High, and if it is at the Apex of it's Leap, Will be Launched High into the Atmosphere and out of Sight. The Cannon gets the Baseball name due to the Similarities between it and Trying to hit a Ball floating on a Jet of Air with a bat. Currently Working on Adapting it to Launch TNT.\nYou can also try TNT missiles. They go infinitely long until they hit a block in their path. So as long as you load the chunk they fly in, you can launch a missile from any distance and hit a target if you aim correctly. Here is a classic minecraft missile: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-HA--BKuOs\nExploit cannons.\nTicking chunk cannons.\nIn vanilla minecraft, chunks are sorted by level propagation(See &lt;a href=\"Chunk\"&gt;\"Chunk\"&lt;/a&gt;). In ticking chunks with level propagation of 32, or \"lazy loaded chunks\", tnt entities won't be loaded. Thus, tnt entities in lazy loaded chunk won't be ticked until players leaves his current chunk. We can stack tnt in lazy loaded chunk and it won't explode or move, which will help us to make super long distance tnt cannons with FTL speed.\nA sample video(Not english): &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.bilibili.com/video/BV1iW4y1U7hY%3Fspm_id_from%3D333.337.search-card.all.click\"&gt;TheSailor's 300k entity cannon with speed of 8924m/s&lt;/a&gt;\nAnother sample video(Not english): &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Cb4y1U7xK%3Fspm_id_from%3D333.337.search-card.all.click\"&gt;xxld0's ticking chunk end pearl cannon with speed of 510M(yeah 510 million)m/s&lt;/a&gt;\nIt is also possible to use this exploit to control tnt directions more percisely.\nVideo:&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Kk4y1z7Wb%3Fspm_id_from%3D333.337.search-card.all.click\"&gt;ps017 's infinite tnt cannon&lt;/a&gt;\nBow bomb cannons.\nThe damage of arrows are calculated by the speed of arrow(See &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;\"arrow\"&lt;/a&gt; page). Arrows can also be acclerated by tnt explosions, which gives them a boost in damage. If tnt are correctly placed, arrows can be acclerated into any speed. An arrow with speed higher than 800m/s is able to deal\n200 damage in one shot.\nExample video: &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/Mfqaok4ngk0\"&gt;Fallen_breath's drangon killer cannon&lt;/a&gt;\nAutomatic cannons.\nSelect fire, select range TNT cannon tutorial.\nThis is a very complex design that is capable of selecting 7 ranges. It is also capable of firing in semi-auto, full-auto and 3-round burst like the H&amp;K MP5 submachine gun.\nRailCannon Design.\nA simple design using a bug with TNT minecarts, using multiple minecarts to simultaneously explode causing projectiles to be launched into the air. This cannon uses less TNT than traditional methods previous of 1.5 and launches projectiles much further.\nL0:\nL1:\nDispenser-based.\nL0:\nSolid base, 3X9, normally buried one layer down\nL1:\nL2:\nL3:\nLauncher Pads.\nA launchpad is similar in design to a &lt;a href=\"TNT%20cannon\"&gt;TNT cannon&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of launching horizontally, it launches vertically either straight up or at an angle, depending on the design. There are many ways to create them, but some methods are more efficient than others. For instance, a simple design would be the cross pattern, as shown below.\nThis is what it would look like from above:\nTo load it, place TNT on the flowing water blocks.\nThe above design can easily be expanded in size and improved, but it is one of the easiest designs to build. Another simple design, yet much more powerful, is here:\nAnother powerful design, using dispensers to place the TNT is built as following:\nThe dark blocks on the last two on the right represent dispensers, facing the center. If you want this to be reusable, place a water source between them.\nA pressure plate delay is enough for each dispenser to shoot twice.\nAn interactive version is here: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//mordritch.com/mc_rss/3648\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nAerial TNT Dropper.\nAs of Minecraft 1.5, &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s now dispense ignited TNT. Thus, downward-facing dispensers can rain TNT on anything under it. \n\"Pros: This is a great way to bomb enemy bases without retaliation. TNT cannons cannot fire straight up, or risk blowing themselves up. It can easily blow its way to bedrock. In bases with water over them, sand can be dropped from above.\"\n\"Cons: This cannon is useless in factions servers which have block protection over bases, as this requires this to be directly above the base. It is extremely resource-heavy, as so much TNT is used. \nThis has less range than a downward facing TNT cannon.\"\nThis trap is very simple: Go up high, build a platform, place dispensers downwards, set a clock, and watch as your enemy's base is obliterated. Simply block-pillar up to a good height. Do not build too high, as the TNT would explode in midair, uselessly. Build the platform directly over the target. Place dispensers and fill them with TNT. Set a &lt;a href=\"Clock%20circuit\"&gt;Clock circuit&lt;/a&gt; to trigger the dispensers, but be careful! Setting the speed too fast will have the waves of TNT literally launch upwards and destroy your cannon. You can mine the dispensers later. As to the problem of getting back down, you could use water, but &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;Ender Pearl&lt;/a&gt;s could come in handy.\nAnti-water defense cannon.\nIt fuses sand and TNT together to blow up blocks covered with water. Water is the enemy of TNT cannons, and this one works around it. \nAim-able T gun.\nThis cannon is shaped like a T; the way it works is that it drops the shot in vertically on top of a mounting blocks between 2 smaller troughs that can be filled with TNT to change the shot's horizontal launch angle. You can adjust the range by not filling the main trough all the way. Great for putting in a castle to destroy enemy artillery!\nArrow cannon.\nAn arrow cannon technically does the same job as a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; just with greater range and area-of-effect. The general way to make these is to have a piston extended over where the mounting block on a normal cannon would be. This would be hooked to a repeater string exactly nine repeaters long, then inverted to keep the piston extended. The rest is simply the charge trough, wired up like a normal cannon. Then use a bow to deposit arrows on the piston head, load the charge trough, and press the button. What happens is: right before the TNT explodes, the piston retracts making the arrows fall. Then the TNT goes off, launching the arrows long distances. This cannon is commonly used in generally mid-range scenarios where damage to blocks is unwanted.\nHere's another design:\nThe cannon displayed uses a delay to break the sand on the upper-front and accelerate the arrows. Below the first image is a top view.\nSand cannon.\nSand cannons are a variation of the TNT cannon that is harmless. The concept is the same, but uses sand as a projectile. Also, the sand must be falling as the TNT in the cannon explodes, shooting the sand, otherwise, nothing happens. It is possible to pile the sand up to make a \"sand shotgun cannon\", which can fire multiple sand blocks at different distances. Note that the sand cannon generally only fires in one direction and is not destructive. It can be used for pelting sand at people's plots in creative multiplayer plots servers, and in turn, making moderators mad. Sand cannons are also commonly used by griefers on multiplayer servers. While the victim is doing renovations on their claimed land, griefers may build a sand cannon as quick as possible as to not being caught, and fire several blocks of sand to the top of the victim's house while they are doing construction in hopes that they will break a block on their roof and have sand fall on top of them.\nSand falls at a different speed than TNT does. As a result, it isn't possible to make a TNT-sand variable cannon that uses sand to determine where the cannon will launch its TNT to. However, it will fire the sand at the same horizontal angle if using an aimable cannon.\nTo build a sand cannon, use a piston to push the sand off in front of the TNT charge, or a sticky piston attached to an inverter to remove a block holding the sand up.\nNOTE: &lt;a href=\"Sand\"&gt;Sand&lt;/a&gt; is not the only thing that can be used. Anything that falls can be used, and this includes:\nNote that anvils and dragon eggs will not be pushed by pistons, so only the second method described above for building will work for said blocks.\nDry cannons.\nA dry cannon uses TNT to launch TNT (or even the user on &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; mode). Dry cannons are simple, easy to build and effective but require lots of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; or other blast-resistant materials.\nThe main difference between a dry cannon and other designs is the lack of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and the use of a wadding block.\nHorizontal cannon.\nMake a long tube of obsidian (works best with 3x3x6 or 3x3x7) with a hollow middle. Then, put two blocks of obsidian on the top. Hollow it out. Fill with TNT, and put an non-blast resistant block in the last space on the front. Cover the top with redstone, and place a button on the back. Optionally, make a platform to stand on when you trigger it. You should also make it a little ways off the ground. See diagram below, in which the orange stands for the wadding (shown in cutaway side view):\nIt will launch several blocks of TNT at your target, however it is expensive and does not have a very long range, but with a big cannon, you can shred a large amount of land with each shot. Occasionally the redstone will be blasted off if you have a large cannon, so it is good to keep some redstone on hand. Good for the defense of a village (blast mobs with a row of cannons when they come too close!). Best for creative mode due to the large amount of TNT needed for each shot.\nTNT catapults.\nSlime blocks, introduced in 1.8, can bounce entities to certain heights. They can also push other blocks with them when pushed by pistons. These machines make use of this concept to make TNT catapults.\n\"Pros\"\n\"Cons\"\nMorzeysminecraft's Design.\nhttp://www.planetminecraft.com/project/the-missile-silo-facility-360-degree-tnt-cannon-aimable-and-awesome/\nTNT lifter.\nA TNT cannon might shoot TNTs far away, but not high up. this design uses an ordinary cannon, but uses slime blocks to launch it higher."}

This is where the aim TNT will be. Then, place water 2 blocks to the sides from your main \"barrel\". You can prevent it from pouring everywhere by placing blocks (e.g. slabs as in the schematics) around these troughs. But one block \"must\" be an opaque block, as it will hold redstone to power a piece of aim TNT. Also, the water must flow towards the main trench.\nPlace a button on the back of your cannon, connect it to the main TNT charge (here, powered from the left side) \"and\" all the aim TNT. The piece on the other side will be slightly tricky: you need another line of redstone to power it. Don't place it on the other side of trench, as it will be used later. Instead, place redstone on the ground. In-line with the mounting block, place a solid block, a piece of redstone on top of it, and on the solid block next to where the aim TNT will be.\nOn another side of barrel, place repeaters until you'll be 2 blocks away from a piece of redstone that will power the other aim TNT. These repeaters must all be on 4 ticks. Place a block in the front of the last repeater, place redstone on the top of it, and a row of blocks on the back of it until it will be horizontally inline with the water source. Place redstone on top of the row's ends (first and last blocks in the row), place an opaque block over the front redstone on the row and place repeaters facing towards the rearmost redstone dust on the row. These repeaters must also be on 4 tick delay. Place a block to the side of the latter (the block must be over the main trench) and place blocks until you'll be 2 blocks horizontally away from the mounting block. \"The last block must be a solid block.\" Then, place a piston facing towards the front of your cannon. It will push the shell. Where the shell will be, add 2 blocks on the sides. One of them must be a power-emitting block. Place redstone all over the new row of blocks, placing repeaters if needed (for delay).\nThis cannon is not the easiest to build, but it is worth it.\n&lt;noinclude&gt;"}

{"id": "10303", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10303", "title": "Tutorials/Telegraph", "text": "A telegraph in \"Minecraft\" works identically to a real device, sending a series of redstone pulses over long distances to be decoded and interpreted by a receiving party. There are multiple designs, from the simple flashing &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;, to massive machines capable of reviewing, deleting, and editing messages before sending them to their destination. This tutorial will explain how to operate these devices, and how to create your own.\nHow they work.\nAll telegraphs, no matter how basic or complex they are, require four things: a sending device, an inverter, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; wire, and a receiving device. The sender will just about always be in the form of a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;. Anything else, such as a button or pressure plate, cannot be easily used to create a message, as they will remain activated for at least 0.9 seconds. A lever, on the other hand, can be shut off as soon as the player wants to, allowing for the quick pulses needed for telegraph languages such as . After the sender comes the inverter, a simple logic gate that inverts its input to create the output. For instance, if the input wire is powered, the output wire will be off. These are almost always used in telegraphs because &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es (a common type of receiver) create their own power. This means that without an inverter, the torch will turn off when a pulse is sent. Although this is only an issue of appearance, it may lead to confusion during interpretation of the message, which is tricky enough by itself. Then comes the all-important wire, which allows you to send your message as far as you want (although the longer the wire, the more likely it is that something goes wrong). The wire consists of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20wire\"&gt;redstone wire&lt;/a&gt;, and, depending on its length, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s placed on every fifteenth block. This will stretch out for as long as needed, until it reaches its destination; the receiver. Receivers can be anything from a redstone torch that blinks when a single pulse is received to a room filled with redstone repeaters, displaying the entire message before the player.\nTelegraph components.\nSending devices.\nA sending device is the mechanism used to transmit a series of pulses to the receiver, whether it creates those pulses or simply allows a looping message to enter the telegraph line. It can be one of three objects; a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;.\nLever.\nLevers are by far the most common of all sending devices, and are the most practical choice in nearly every scenario. They can create as long or as short a pulse as the sending party wishes, and are the most accurate representations of real life telegraph keys.\nButton.\nThe only situation that a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; could be used is in a one-way telegraph system for distress signals to other players in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;. However, the receiver would not remain activated due to buttons automatically returning to the 'off' position after only 0.9 seconds.\nIt is also a small target to aim for, especially when a player is in the kind of situation that a distress signal seems like a good idea. So when it comes to telegraphs, use of buttons should probably be avoided entirely.\nPressure plate.\nAlthough they are similar to buttons in their general impracticality, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; could potentially utilize the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;'s unique ability to be activated by &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Multiple pressure plates could be positioned at different points of a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;, all of which could be connected to the one-way distress telegraph mentioned earlier. If any mob (only harmful mobs would spawn in a deep cave) stepped on one, it would trigger the distress signal, and players elsewhere would be alerted and be able to take action.\nReceivers.\nThe receiver is the means of displaying a message sent from another telegraph room. They can be either &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRedstone torch.\nThe &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; is a primitive, but compact receiver, displaying each pulse as it arrives from the sender. It does not record, loop or display the entire message, and it cannot be interpreted easily without a solid understanding of the language being transmitted. It is most common in the one-way and classic telegraph systems, where simplicity and instantaneous viewing are most valuable. In addition, they are the only type of receiver that can be wall-mounted. \nRedstone lamp.\nThe addition of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;s makes display a lot simpler by eliminating the need for an inverter.\nRedstone repeater.\nRedstone repeaters, in their simplest form, can be used like the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; receiver. However, they cannot be sent pulses as quickly or be mounted on walls, making them much more useful when placed in lines of two or more. This allows the receiving party to view a larger portion of the message as it is received, or, if the line is long enough, the entire message. The speed at which each pulse is displayed and lost can be adjusted by right-clicking each redstone repeater. This will increase or decrease the delay on each repeater before it passes on the signal. Such a system can be looped, so that the message is repeated to the receiving party indefinitely (note that looping a received message requires an erasing device and a message no longer than the receiver can display at one time).\nIn addition to being able to loop, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s have the advantage of being able to be \"locked\" to a state. Thus, if a message is sent in a pre-configured pulse, it's possible to have a pulse preceding the message to lock the message in place in the repeaters, removing the need for a loop, and adding the possibility of a \"timed eraser\" if executed correctly. To lock a repeater in its current state, a repeater must power the side of it, then locking the current state.\nPistons.\n&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;s can be used in multiple bit receivers so that they look like dots and dashes.\nNote block.\nWhen coupled with an inverted rapid pulser, &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s can be used for an auditory means of displaying messages (the inverted pulser is required in order to tell dots and dashes apart).\nMessage displays.\nMessage displays are basically receivers are able to be viewed by the sender. Using these, one can view their message before it is sent to its destination. Either &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s can be used, usually corresponding to the type of receiver in the other telegraph room. When using a series of connected redstone repeaters, one can upgrade the display with a loop and eraser system.\nDisplay loops and erasing devices.\nA display loop is a useful addition to both receivers and message displays. It connects the end of a redstone repeater display to its beginning, showing the message again and again until the eraser is activated. Erasing devices are an absolute necessity when creating a display loop. They end the looping message, and allow a new one to be shown before the two messages overlap pulses. A full loop and eraser system requires a customized NOR gate, through which the message is transferred and looped.\nErasers.\nAn erasing device, though it can be as simple as an exposed, destroyable piece of the loop, is generally a lever wired to the custom NOR gate. Although they do take extra space, receiver loops should be built so that the input is on the opposite side of the NOR gate, so that no wires should have to cross paths. Also, remember, you can always use multiple levels of wire to avoid other parts of the telegraph.\nNOR gate.\nA &lt;a href=\"NOR%20gate\"&gt;NOR gate&lt;/a&gt; can be used in holding loops until you wish to send, delete or edit the message. You have to pull both &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s back in order to activate it. Having both levers forward or one forward and one backwards will not activate the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of telegraphs.\nOne-way telegraph.\nAs indicated by the name, messages created in a one-way telegraph may only be sent in one direction, greatly limiting its capabilities. The schematic shown demonstrates a short configuration, complete with the required sender (1), inverter (2), wiring (3) and receiver (4). However, it is the only kind of telegraph with any real practicality in single player. If one were to have the sender in a mine, and the receiver in their house, they could effectively use it like a post-it stamp, leaving a message in their house to remind them, for example, that there was diamond in that mine. Expanding on this idea, they could have a series of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es in their home indicating which of their &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;s had &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; or some other valuable element. Whenever another mine was discovered to have this element, they could simply flip a switch, and the mine's corresponding torch would activate in the house. An example of this is shown on the left. Another use would be as a simple distress signal in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, as it is always an issue of having to simultaneously type your call for help and run away from whatever is troubling you.\nClassic telegraph.\nThe most basic system, the classic telegraph is quite easy to build, but not so easy to use. It consists of one lever, one inverter, and one &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; for each direction of communication. The schematic of a simple two-way telegraph is shown on the right. 1 and 2 are small control rooms, and A and B are inverters. Note that the area in between the two inverters can be elongated, with appropriately spaced &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s. The classic telegraph allows for a speedy construction and a space as small as 1x2x2 for each control room. In addition, due to its limited size and capability, it requires little to no knowledge of logic gates or circuitry, making it ideal for beginners or when you're low on redstone. The downside is that while you may be new to \"Minecraft\", you have to be remarkably fluent in whatever language you decide to send the telegram in. This goes for the receiving party as well. In fact, they must begin reading the message the instant you begin sending it, or risk losing its meaning entirely. This quickly becomes problematic, especially when the server is lagging. Despite this, players use it anyway, often because they enjoy the great similarity it holds to real telegraphs. So while the classic telegraph is compact, simple, and highly realistic, it may be worthwhile to look into a more advanced system.\nMulti-directional telegraph.\nAlthough the classification spans most telegraph types, the multi-directional telegraph is quite unique in its general design, and can be challenging to configure. This is mainly due to the amount of wiring required, and, in turn, the amount of space needed. For instance, a three direction telegraph requires a minimum of six separate lengths of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20wire\"&gt;wire&lt;/a&gt;, and that's just to create a classic one-torch receiver system, with no additional capabilities. While this is less of a problem over short distances, acquiring the massive quantities of &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; needed for such a project can be problematic, and it is good practice to make a rough estimate of how much you'll need before beginning its construction.\nSimple multi-directional Morse telegraph.\nThis is a really simple Morse code receiver and sender. The &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt; aligned near the &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; shows what the sending is, and the lamp in the wall on layer 1 is the receiver. The &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s are to show which telegraph room is receiving the message. Build a mirror of the structure to complete a multi-directional Morse telegraph sender and receiver room. The &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; on the floor is the sender and the line on the &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; is the receiver.\nMulti-directional.\n&lt;br&gt;\nAlternative designs.\nFrequency matching.\nThis device allows you to transmit different signals without any modification to the transmission line (it can remain a combination of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20wire\"&gt;redstone wire&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s). In this system, different frequencies represent different signals.\nTo build this circuit, you should build a transmitter \u2014 a simple oscillator \u2014 and attach it to the transmission line with a repeater. At the other end of the line, build another oscillator with the same delay. Configure the output of the transmission line in order to match the oscillators (they should turn on and off exactly at the same time, this is very important). \nThen, connect the receiver oscillator and the output of the transmission line to a comparator in subtraction mode. If the received waveform is different from the receiver oscillator waveform, the comparator will generate a blinking signal at its output.\nYou can connect the transmission line to different receivers with different frequencies, and don't forget to match the timing. \nThe receiver circuit might get bulky, but this system allows you to spend much less redstone on the transmission line, if you have the transmitter and the receiver far away from each other.\nAnalog telegraph.\nAnalog telegraph uses up to 16 states of a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20wire\"&gt;redstone wire&lt;/a&gt;, instead of just two. Animation on the left is pretty self-explanatory: connect the repeaters as shown. The distance between the matching repeaters should be exactly 15. \nBugs.\nIf the telegraph goes outside the loaded chunks, it will not work, as &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s (needed to maintain signal) will not update (tested in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.18.1\"&gt;1.18.1&lt;/a&gt;), however this is the most important use for the telegraph, as no visual signals can be given. This can be fixed to setting custom &lt;a href=\"ticking%20area\"&gt;ticking area&lt;/a&gt;s."}

This does not apply above the Nether Roof.\nSurvival.\nDefault.\nThere is no way to get to the void in &lt;a href=\"the%20Overworld\"&gt;the Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; (except a bug), as the &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; includes a layer with no holes (except an error or opening a LAN server with cheats enabled). However, if a generated structure generates very low in the world, especially an &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; with a basement, it can override bedrock. However, this is extremely rare and it will probably not generate in your world unless you use a seed with one. A much easier way to get to the Void is through &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;:\nYou can also get on the top of the Nether due to a bug which can be performed (you will need at least 2 ender pearls or more):\nVoid base.\nIf you want to set up a base in the void, make a 3x3 hole in the bedrock and put a block in the middle. Then quickly spawn a chicken on it, break the block, replace it with a fence and tie the chicken to that fence. Then place a block above the fence and put more fences on all four faces of the block. Then break the block on the first fence and put slabs on the top halves of the corners of the 3x3 hole. Lastly, place boats on the slabs and row them in between the fences, break the slabs (preferably with hitboxes shown) and let the boats fall. Repeat this process for a larger base. For storage use llamas or donkeys with chests, or minecarts with chests. For food, use mooshrooms, as milking them with bowls give you mushroom soup. Remember to name mobs or they despawn.\nLinks to tutorial videos: \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IMnX42GArwA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oyeywSdbhE&amp;ab_channel=Carvs"}

{"id": "9689", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9689", "title": "Tutorials/The second day", "text": "This guide is intended for those who have read the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Beginner%27s%20guide\"&gt;beginner's guide&lt;/a&gt; first, and survived their first day and night.\nA brief picture of a second-day house is shown on the right.\nIntroduction.\nIf you read the beginner's guide and followed it, you should have at least a crude shelter, stone tools, and some cooked meat and other food. This second-day tutorial builds upon that to guide you in setting up a better base.\nWhen you venture outside after surviving your first night, be on the lookout for hostile mobs from the previous night. Hunting for them happens after you get weapons, some armor, and proper food supply.\nAs you move around:\nReviewing &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"First Day\" guide briefly discussed &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, but by your second day this hunger becomes more urgent, requiring you to obtain &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;.\nBesides the visible hunger bar, you also have an invisible hunger bar, called \"&lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Mechanics\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;\". When the game starts, the hunger bar is full, but you have only 5 saturation points. Like your health bar and hunger bar, this maxes out at 20 points (each \"shank\" of the visible bar represents two points), although it is never higher than your hunger level. Whenever you do &lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Exhuastion%20level%20increase\"&gt;something that would make you hungry&lt;/a&gt;, the saturation gets used up first, which provides extra time before you get hungry again. Most foods provide saturation as well as filling the visible bar, and the \"better\" foods provide more saturation per hunger point restored. The general rule is that, apart from the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Apple\"&gt;golden foods&lt;/a&gt;, and s are the best, followed by other cooked meats (or fish), , and vegetables. Cooked foods are always better than their uncooked counterparts.\nThe biggest drain on hunger is healing damage, but for quite some time (until you get s and s), this is the \"only\" way to heal damage! In \"Java Edition\" you heal faster when your hunger bar is full and have some extra saturation, and if your hunger bar is below , you cannot heal at all. Each point of damage healed costs the equivalent of hunger, or of a shank.\nA few other activities also cause hunger, though at a slower rate:\nNote that if you are staying at full health, and not fighting, sprinting and/or jumping, or mining blocks, then you use almost no food. Thus, if your character has a secure place to stay, you can just stay put to conserve food while waiting out the night, a storm, or crop/animal growth. Walking around at normal speed uses no hunger. So if you are injured and/or hungry, it's best to wait out the night quietly in your home (perhaps doing some crafting or smelting) until daylight, when it is safe to go out and find some food. Sleeping works too unless you're actually starving, in which case you can't sleep at all since you'll be taking damage.\nIf your hunger bar is completely empty, you begin to starve, and take damage until you are down to half health in easy &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, or a single hit point in normal difficulty. You \"shouldn't\" be on hard difficulty for this first game, but if you are, you can actually starve to death. Well before this point (under 3.5 shanks or 7 hunger), you can no longer sprint.\nTherefore, if you are low on health or critically low on food, getting food is a priority:\nWriting your to-do list.\nFor the second day, your main objective is to get the lay of the land, locate resources, and plan out further construction. Look for at least the following things. Don't worry if you can't find all of them, right now you're just spotting the resources that are near your home:\nAnimals.\nIn order of priority, note the locations of these animals (see their respective pages for full details). If you have plenty of wood and/or stone, you can even throw up some corrals ahead of time for \"whatever you bring back first\".\nResources and mining.\nThe foundation of everything is mining (though farming is pretty important too). By now, you should have mined at least enough stone to make your basic stone tools, and you hopefully have some wood left over. You need more of both materials: Wood for various utility items, stone for more durable construction. Over the next few days, you'll be mining a variety of ores as well, but for now, concentrate on the basic materials:\nBasic Materials.\nAs you explore your world, you are likely to pick up some dirt blocks. These are not good for building structures, but they are quick to place and remove, so you can use them for temporary staircases, pillars, and such. More importantly, you can use them to modify the landscape, making it easier to get around near your home. If you've had a creeper explode nearby, you can also use your collected dirt to fill in the hole (immediately after the explosion, there may be dirt and perhaps stone items left in the crater. Pick those up, but don't expect to get enough to fill in the crater). Note that mining grass blocks (that is, full blocks with a green top, not \"tall grass\" plants) drop dirt \u2014 don't worry about the difference for now. If you place the dirt next to grass blocks, the grass eventually spreads to the dirt, cleaning up the \"scars\" of your work.\nSand and gravel have special uses: Sand is used for making glass, which is useful for windows and even transparent walls. However, note that glass is fragile \u2014 a creeper blast destroys any glass in the blast range. Glass also cannot be recovered once placed (without the appropriate enchanted tools); if mined or blown up, it does not drop anything. Gravel is used to produce &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt;, which is a key material needed to craft arrows. As a bonus, these can be crafted together with dye to form concrete powder, so any cactus or flowers you've picked up may come in handy. \nBoth sand and gravel, unlike most blocks, are affected by gravity: If either block is placed without something directly beneath it, or if whatever's beneath it goes away for any reason, it falls to the ground below. If it falls on you such that your head is buried, you take suffocation damage until you get free or mine your way out. They can also suffocate mobs, which can be useful for traps.\nYou may see shelves of \"floating\" sand or gravel, which the game generated without support (that is, a player couldn't have placed them like that). Be careful around these, as they are natural traps: Mining them or placing any block next to them sets off a chain reaction that can bring down the whole shelf. Sand shelves appear in deserts, while gravel shelves (or ceilings) can appear underground. When seen from underneath, sand and gravel shelves drop \"falling dust\" particles. Always be careful not to mine or place any blocks touching them.\nBeneath sand, you often find &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;. You can build with this and craft it into various forms, but remember that it is much more fragile than \"real\" stone.\nYou can build with wood, and converting the logs to planks quadruples the number of blocks you have to work with. However, wood has two liabilities: First, it is flammable, and lava or lightning can start a fire that can destroy much of your house. Secondly, it has low blast resistance, so if a creeper explodes near a wooden house, it can demolish a good deal of work and perhaps damage the inside of the house as well. \nWood is plentiful in forests. If trees are scarce around you, you may want to plant some replacement &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s: You may have noticed when you chopped down trees, that as the leaves decay, some of them drop saplings, which you hopefully picked up. You can plant them on any dirt or grass block where there's room for the tree to grow. Once you plant them, don't hang around waiting, just go do other things and come back later when the trees have grown (it can take up to a day or more). Once you have spare torches, you can put one of those a couple or few blocks away from your saplings, as this helps them continue growing overnight. \nAs you've seen, mining gray (\"plain\") stone, drops a mottled block called &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. This differs from stone only in appearance and what you can craft with it. Stone is so plentiful, that you may find yourself making chests just to store your accumulated cobblestone. However, don't throw it away, as stone is a key building material. Stone is not flammable, and has high blast resistance: If a creeper explodes right next to your \"stone\" wall, it may break a few blocks, but not much more than that. For your early houses, you should be making most of the walls out of stone.\nOnce you have coal/charcoal to spare, you might want to use your furnace to smelt some cobblestone back into gray stone. With this, you can fill holes in underground caves without leaving unsightly patches of cobblestone. You can also make various decorative blocks such as &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you build more attractive houses and other structures. Any variation of stone bricks are just as strong as gray stone or cobblestone.\nYou may also find pockets of other \"rocks\": &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;. These are fine building blocks and are as strong as gray stone, but are less flexible: They can also be crafted into various more decorative blocks, but can't always substitute for gray stone in recipes.\nThis is a major resource, with two main uses: it is used to make torches, (your major source of light), and to smelt or cook items in your furnace. Smelting items not only let you cook your meat for better nutrition, but is also necessary for making use of iron (see below). A stack (64 lumps) of coal is a fairly large amount for the beginning, but over time you need a lot of it. Fortunately, it is common: It is found everywhere underground, and even some on the surface. \"Coal is the only ore you can mine with a wooden pickaxe.\" Coal is not \"strictly\" necessary since you can make &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; from wood, but it is common, and you have plenty of other things to do with wood. Also, five types of villagers offer emeralds in trade for coal, but they don't accept charcoal.\nIron is probably the most important and versatile resource you can find underground, and it seems there is never enough of it. You can use it to craft good quality &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and a variety of other things. For your second day (or whenever you venture underground), your initial goal is to get at least 33 pieces of iron ore (see below for what to craft with that), and more iron is always needed and useful. Once you have some of the ore, use a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; to smelt it into &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, that you can then craft into other items. Remember that to mine the ore, \"a stone pickaxe is required.\"\nCave exploration.\nCave exploration is pretty straightforward: you &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; up your way with torches, mine up ores as you see them (check ores and minerals) and kill enemies as you encounter them (see \"&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Combat\"&gt;Tutorials/Combat&lt;/a&gt;\" for details). There are also some important techniques that might not be obvious to a new player, such as using &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;falls to descend into shafts, and/or swim back up from them. There are also many options for &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Navigation\"&gt;marking your trail and not getting lost&lt;/a&gt;. Also, note that sneaking (on PCs, the key by default) prevents you from falling over the edge of a block, which is useful if you are caving near a long drop, especially a drop into lava. Sometimes such caves end immediately, but often they continue into big cave systems. If they seem to end right away sometimes there is often a continuation about 2-8 blocks farther back and below the cave's end; mining in these directions (8 blocks back and down, exploring somewhat to the sides) may reveal a continuation. Digging away gravel or dirt can also expose cave extensions, but you may go through a few shovels that way. When exploring caves and mining underground, make sure to thoroughly light up the caves and tunnels as you go. If you don't do this, monsters can spawn in the darkness, even in places where you've already been through (meaning, they can come up behind you, or block your exit!).\nIf there are few nearby caves, or they seem too dangerous, you can explore more advanced &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining\"&gt;mining techniques&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, if mining, never ever dig a single-block shaft straight down -- you are likely to fall into a deep monster-infested cave, if not into lava! You can, however, dig a mineshaft in a pattern, such that you always have a safe block to stand on as you mine a different block. Such patterns can range from a simple 2x1 pattern (standing in the middle so one of the blocks always supports you), to a 2x2 or larger staircase into the depths. A simple diagonal staircase works too. Just keep a careful eye out in case you break through into the top of a cave or lava pool. If you do dig a vertical mineshaft, bring a lot of ladders to get back up!\nAs you explore caves. you may run into &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s. Don't get near these until you have at least full iron armor, sword, plus bow and arrows. Once you are properly equipped, these present a challenge, but also contain treasure chests with rare and valuable items.\nOther ores and minerals.\nYou're unlikely to find these on your second day, but it's worth knowing a little about the more advanced &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; are more specialized ores, found only in deeper parts of the caves. &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; is the top-tier crafting material found in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; is used to &lt;a href=\"Trading\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s. Lapis and copper can be mined with a stone pickaxe, but the remaining ores all need an iron pickaxe. Some key uses:\nCrafting.\nRepairing tools.\nTo fix a tool, put two damaged tools of the same type and material in a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; or your crafting grid. This combines the two old items into a new item that is either unused, or has slightly more remaining uses than both the old items together. This applies to any tool that has durability, including swords and bows. Later you'll have enchanted tools and/or weapons, but don't use this method for those, you'll need an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; to preserve the enchantments.\nIron equipment.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most important resources in \"Minecraft\". Your first half-stack or so provides enough equipment to take on the world, but you need ongoing supplies to replace worn-out equipment. Get used to collecting, smelting, and stockpiling it, because you need to replace equipment, and the more you advance in the game, the more uses you'll have for iron.\nOptimal iron usage depends on the local environment, but the first things you should make have this approximate order:\nBeds again.\nIf you haven't already made a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, you should get some &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; to make one! This lets you set your spawn point someplace safe (and stocked with spare equipment), and also lets you skip past dangerous nights and storms. If you have can craft &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; (for just two iron ingots), you don't need to kill sheep, and you might get the wool you need from a single sheep.\nOnce you get a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;, use it to locate the world spawn point, and build a shelter there (assuming your home isn't already in sight). Once you've done that, you can carry a spare bed with you as you explore, and skip nights and storms by sleeping in it and breaking it in the morning to carry along. This leaves you without a spawn point, but if you do &lt;a href=\"die\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;, you still have a shelter nearby when you &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;. Stock the shelter with spare equipment, and place a bed too, in case you respawn at night or during a storm. Then you can just go to sleep and fetch your items by daylight, if your items are less than 5 minutes away (they despawn after 5 minutes).\nIf your bed is \"missing or obstructed\" when you actually try to respawn, you'll lose your spawn point and go back to the default respawning behavior (random within 20 blocks of the world spawn point). This continues until you actually sleep in a bed again. If there is no place to stand (solid block, not glass, fences, slabs, etc.) when you try to respawn, your bed is considered \"obstructed\".\nWhen trying to sleep, make sure it's either night-time or &lt;a href=\"Weather\"&gt;storming&lt;/a&gt; (not just rain), and there are no monsters around you. If there is a problem, you should get a status message explaining what's wrong. You can't sleep if you are currently starving, poisoned or on fire. If trying to sleep at sundown, you may need to wait a few seconds for night to officially begin, and try again.\nSlabs and stairs.\nYou can craft most kinds of stone, or any wooden planks, into &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladders&lt;/a&gt;. Slabs are half-height blocks that can be placed in either the top or bottom half of a block space. A floor made of \"bottom\" slabs can help prevent monster spawns, as mobs can't spawn on bottom slabs, and individual bottom slabs can be used as an easy step up to the next level of blocks. A ceiling made of top slabs can give you a little extra headroom, and double as the floor for a level above.\nStairs, naturally, can let you move up and down an incline \"without\" jumping, which is much more convenient, and for an often used path, it can save a lot of food.\nMonsters.\nAs you build up your equipment, you'll be able to fight the basic monsters more easily, and start to take on the more dangerous ones as well. A quick (and incomplete) list of the usual Overworld monsters:\nNext Day.\nThere's a tutorial of sorts for &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/The%20third%20day\"&gt;The third day&lt;/a&gt;, but at this point, you've progressed past the beginning of your game and can choose what to do next. Some ideas:"}
{"id": "12346", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12346", "title": "Tutorials/The third day", "text": "Once the player have survived the first and second days of \"Minecraft\" survival, gathered some basic resources, and made a shelter, it's time to start making farms and gathering more resources. This tutorial will give you some tips of what you can do on the third day of playing Minecraft.\nNote that this guide assumes that the player is playing in &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; mode and on normal &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. If playing in a separate mode or difficulty, things may be slightly or significantly different than this guide.\nGeneral.\nBy the third day, the player should have a basic shelter and basic resources, though you probably don't have enough resources to last for a long time just yet. Now it's time to gather more resources and/or improve the house. If you're adventurous, you can also go find &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s to fight monsters and/or find &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s, which will both be very useful for various reasons. If you don't feel safe encountering caves and similar structures just yet, the player can just explore in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and look for &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s, as they contain various &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;. Try to make a few various farms, and use some &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: Since \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" is a very open and often personal game, each player should decide what to do for themselves. Many gameplay methods exist at this point of your adventure, so you can try doing different things and look for your favorite activity.\nTips to the full \"Minecraft\" experience.\nIf you are still looking for a common path to follow, start crafting more materials. Use the &lt;a href=\"advancements\"&gt;advancements&lt;/a&gt; list or the list below as goals to help you progress, ensuring that you also take breaks to enjoy the sandbox!\nThese are the basic activities that you can do on your third day. Remember, don't do too much because you have very limited resources. Also, make sure to always stay close to your shelter.\nGathering Resources.\nResources are very important in \"Minecraft\". Resources include not just the blocks that make up the world, but also mob drops and farmable crops. These let you build shelters and make food, tools, armor, and much more. Because of this, it's important to make sure that you \"never\" run out of resources. For materials that are rare and non-renewable, use them very sparingly, only when you absolutely need them. It's recommended to use common or renewable materials whenever possible. However, note that renewable materials are usually only renewable when a farm of that material is made, so don't use up all of any type of material in one area before you've made a farm of that material.\nPreparation Before Exploring.\nIt is highly recommended to bring the following items before exploring:\nSearching for Landmarks.\nTo avoid wasting valuable daylight time, search for certain landmarks, blocks, and formations. Some of the features in the world you may want to look for and mark are the following:\nAnother way you can locate biomes and generated structures is using &lt;a href=\"http%3A//chunkbase.com\"&gt;ChunkBase&lt;/a&gt;. Go to seed map and type in your seed. In the features, deselect, then select biome, spawn point, and anything else you want to locate. Click on the structure icon (villager, witch, rail, eye of ender) to find the coordinates of that structure. Go there and loot the structure.\nBees.\nIf you see a bee nest, don't break it or the bees will get mad at you. Instead, put a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; under it. Wait for dripping honey particles, and shear the hive for 3 honeycombs. Craft a beehive and place it near your base, with a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; beneath. Have flowers nearby. Go back to the bee nest and use a flower or lead to get at least 2 bees. Breed them for more. Don't forget to make more hives for the bees to live in. Now you can get &lt;a href=\"Honey%20Bottle\"&gt;honey bottles&lt;/a&gt;, which can remove poison. (Useful for mineshaft and ocean exploration, and witches). Bees can also pollinate crops, so have the hives near the farm. You may also produce bee nests while growing oak or birch trees, if a flower is nearby.\nExpansions to the Shelter.\nOn your first night, players must have a shelter before the sun goes down, otherwise build strong tools in time to combat the enemies relentlessly hunting the player down, or get to a place where the enemies cannot reach the player. Although, no matter what precaution is taken, there is always some strange possibility that a creeper could get inside any shelter and blow everything up. This could open a few opportunities to expand.\nImproving your Shelter's Safety.\nAlthough building your shelter out of dirt and wood may seem convenient, easy, and simple, it is not safe, so is certainly not advisable. As you mine, you will collect both cobblestone, and other stone blocks (&lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;). All of these are much stronger than dirt or wood -- once you have enough completely rebuild any above-ground parts of your shelter. You may want to craft the \"other stone\" blocks into their polished or carved versions, for looks; once you have plenty of fuel, you can also smelt cobblestone back into gray stone and make &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;. This is mostly to improve resistance to creepers. Adding glass windows to the home will allow you to look outside of the shelter and identify dangers, especially creepers, so you are not surprised by enemies. If you are in Hard difficulty, zombies can break down doors, in other difficulties they will still bang on the doors but cannot break them. You can also surround your house with a fence, using fence gates so you can get in and out. Placing torches every 7-10 blocks along the fence, and around your house, will prevent enemies from spawning inside your perimeter. As you continue playing, you can expand your perimeter and light up more territory.\nOverworld (the world you spawn in) hostile mobs do not climb ladders so you can use height to your advantage. Also remember to avoid looking at endermen (which means placing your cross hairs on it). This will cause the enderman to turn hostile for a short while.\nConsider building a safe room, which is a simple room underground with a bed, a chest full of food, a bow and arrows (and/or a sword, if you have no bow or arrows), and a door opening. This is so that you can sleep through the night, minimize monsters, bring your health back up, and kill off the monsters keeping you in.\nExpanding Your Shelter.\nThe first thing to do is check the time of day. If you're planning on lots of work, make sure it's morning. A good idea is to renovate. This is because unless your base is underground, hostile mobs may spawn and attack you. Expanding requires you to expose yourself to the outside.\nChoose a good technique for your extension. A good idea for your early days in Minecraft is cobblestone. \"Stone\" blocks (cobblestone, stone, granite, etc.) have higher blast resistance than dirt/planks, and cobblestone is the easiest to get in large quantities. It'll be hard for a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; to do serious damage to a cobblestone shelter, but for a planks/dirt shelter, a large part or all may be blown up. Any form of shelter should be as strong as possible.\nAn alternative would be to dig your base deeper, possibly collecting ores you may come across along the way.\nMany players also choose to start a mine from inside their shelter (that is, start the initial shaft or stair from a convenient indoor spot). This will allow you to mine through the night without danger of mobs coming in. (If it's a stairway, you'll want a fence gate at the entrance.)\nConclusion.\nAfter choosing your next course of action, progress to the more advanced &lt;a href=\"tutorials\"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;."}

Millions of users have at some point been too inefficient or died unnecessarily. Therefore, a collected list of things the player should not do or forget has been compiled below in order to make the game experience as enjoyable as possible. However, making mistakes is an important step to learn the way of things in \"Minecraft\", so don't feel bad if you follow these suggestions and still make a mistake. In a way, this tutorial acts as a collection of frequent \"Minecraft\" mistakes. \nRegardless of the advice given here, players are free to ignore any advice and play the game in their own way.\nPossible death.\nThe following things not to do in \"Minecraft\" could possibly result in the death of the player.\nBy the player.\nBringing important/hard-to-replace items to other dimensions.\nDue to the inherent hazards of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;, especially to newer/inexperienced players, it is advised to not bring important items and possessions to other dimensions. The dangerous mobs, structures, and biomes make it very difficult to retrieve items lost in the two non-overworld dimensions, as they can be burned by &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt;, end up behind a hoard of mobs very difficult to defeat, or fall into a place where they can't be recovered from. \nBecause of these factors, you should bring lower-tier &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Weapon\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; if you are not properly experienced to not risk losing more important &lt;a href=\"Items\"&gt;Items&lt;/a&gt;.\nHunger and Food.\nEspecially during the first days of a new world, the player should avoid wasting their &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bars. If a player's hunger bar drops too low, they will not be able to &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;naturally regenerate health&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sprinting\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; (making it difficult to run from dangerous situations). If a player's hunger bar runs out, they will also quickly lose a good portion of their health to &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;starvation&lt;/a&gt;: Down to health in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt;, health in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt;, and health in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome movement, such as &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jumping\"&gt;jumping&lt;/a&gt;, drain hunger and &lt;a href=\"hunger%23mechanics\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt; much quicker than walking, and are much less efficient per block traveled. &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to move around quickly without using up any of the player's hunger bar or saturation. The biggest drain on hunger and saturation is natural regeneration of health, so the player can also conserve hunger and food by avoiding taking damage.\nSome food sources can give players the &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28effect%29\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; status effects. If the player needs to eat &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt; (which are likely to cause the hunger status effect), they should eat multiple pieces at the same time, so they get more hunger/saturation from the food than they lose through the status effect. The player should avoiding eating &lt;a href=\"Pufferfish%20%28item%29\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Eye\"&gt;spider eyes&lt;/a&gt; because they cause the poison effect, which would take more hunger/saturation to heal from than these food sources can return. They should also be careful with &lt;a href=\"Suspicious%20Stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;s they found or traded with villagers for, because some suspicious stews can give a poison effect. For any of these food options, the player can drink &lt;a href=\"Milk%20Bucket\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; to override the status effect, which may make them a more viable food source.\nHorse Armor.\nIf the player owns a horse, finding &lt;a href=\"Horse%20Armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt; for it is advised, because ranged mobs could easily end up killing it while the player either advances or retreats on horseback.\nGetting lost.\nAfter the first few days of work, the player should have some basic facilities for survival (e.g. farms, a shelter, and a mine). Many players are tempted at this point to venture farther from their base to look for resources and explore.\nHowever, the player should always keep in mind the location of their base. Even a brief moment of activity in an unfamiliar place, especially areas with no landmarks, can confuse a player's sense of direction and result in losing the way home. Without knowing where the base is, the player is in danger of losing valuable time and may have to start over most of the game. It is also much easier to die trying to get back, either from starvation or attacks by hostile mobs.\nHere are some orientation tips:\nForgetting essentials.\nWhen planning to venture far away from their main base, a player should carry wood, a crafting table, building blocks, a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, plenty of food, a weapon like a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, some quality &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;, a long-ranged weapon such as a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;, and (if using a bow) plenty of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s unless the bow is enchanted with the &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Make sure to bring &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s to set a new respawn point and sleep when it gets dark. When the player gets a large distance away from the last bed slept in, then it is likely time to use another one. Don't break the bed after sleeping in it, or else the you respawn at the world spawn upon death instead of at the bed's location. If you are going to mine, make sure to bring at least a stack of torches. Even if you aren't mining, torches can also be helpful to mark your way and prevent getting lost.\nUsing spawn-setting items in the wrong dimensions.\nBeds in the Nether or the End explode upon attempting to use them. &lt;a href=\"Respawn%20Anchor\"&gt;Respawn anchors&lt;/a&gt; safely create spawn points in the Nether, but when fully charged explode upon use in other dimensions. There is no way to set a spawn point in The End.\nYou can be teleported to the End Dimension by placing your bed under the End Portal in a stronghold, however this will cause you to be trapped within the End permanently in Single Player.\nBed obstruction.\nNormally, when the player sleeps, they wake up next to their &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; if the space around it is not taken. It is important to leave a clear area around and above their bed. If there is not free space next to and/or above the player's bed, they may wake up inside a block and begin to &lt;a href=\"suffocate\"&gt;suffocate&lt;/a&gt;. If this happens, remove the block quickly to avoid death by suffocation. If the player is killed, they cannot respawn at their bed; instead, they spawn instead at the world spawn, which can be far away from where the player was trying to sleep, along with a message saying, \"You have no home bed or respawn anchor, or it was obstructed\", or \"Your home bed was missing or obstructed\".\nAlso, avoid placing transparent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; around their bed as the player cannot spawn on a transparent block after waking up.\nCarrying dangerous or non-essential items in the hotbar.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; is a dangerous resource. The player should not keep lava in their hotbar unless they are about to use it. Death can result from accidental of a lava bucket, as well as damage any builds in the immediate area. Apart from lava, having items in the hotbar which are either not essentials (like weapons or food) or in use consumes valuable space. Unless the player is going to throw them or has nowhere else in their inventory for the items to go, leaving these items there just clutters up the hotbar, setting the player up to waste time later.\nNot bringing a water bucket.\nDuring adventures, have a bucket of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on the hotbar at all times if not in the Nether. In the case of an emergency, it can do the following:\nWithout a bucket of water, all these situations are made much more dangerous. \nFalling.\nHeights are dangerous, and jumping off a structure, especially without knowing how tall it is, can result in death. A risky method would be to place a water bucket just before the player lands; this is colloquially called water bucketing. It is much safer to descend mountains or cliffs by climbing down normally or even swimming down water. However, this strategy does not work in the Nether since water evaporates there, which can catch newer players by surprise. Make sure to be especially careful on &lt;a href=\"Amplified\"&gt;Amplified&lt;/a&gt; worlds, which are vertical, as even &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; armor with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; may not reduce enough damage to survive enormous falls. Death at the bottom may make it impossible to reach the items scattered everywhere. Riding off of a cliff in a &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt; can also negate fall damage, although due to a bug in Java Edition, there are a few specific heights where this fails.\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"Hay%20Bale\"&gt;Hay bales&lt;/a&gt; can be used in any dimension to reduce 80% of a player's fall &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; when they fall. This makes it a good substitute for &lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;Water Buckets&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; since Water Buckets can't be effectively used there.\nArrows.\nIf an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; is shot directly upward, it may fall back down to hit the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the player should not charge at a target immediately after firing an arrow at them, especially if the player is wearing &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, as they may collide with the arrow. Death from this method is highly unlikely unless done intentionally.\nFire.\nWhile not as dangerous as &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, fire is still quite hazardous due to its item-destroying abilities. In addition, it spreads every few seconds and can travel across &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s. Luckily, it can be toggled in the world settings. Fire is especially dangerous in &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes because the trees are larger (so burn longer) and closer together, and if too many trees burn up at the same time it can heavily affect the game performance. If trying to clear the forest, it is advised to be careful with the fire and have a quick means of escape such as &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; or a Fire Resistance potion. Once the random tick speed gets high enough, fire may burn so fast that it does not render, so the player may end up on fire without seeing anything.\nIf the player wishes to create a fireplace in a building (for decoration, lighting, or disposing of unwanted items), make sure that the area under and surrounding the fire, as well as the four blocks above it, are made of non-flammable material, or use campfires to make it in a compact wood-themed building.\nRiptide-enchanted tridents.\nA &lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; is both a weapon and a means of quick air travel. If the player carelessly launches themselves into the air with Riptide, they can put themselves at risk of serious fall damage and death. The player should be careful not to launch themselves into dangerous situations. Using &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; is recommended to prevent accidental death. While it is raining, the player can essentially use Riptide to fly through the air. However, due to its fairly long charge-up time, the player may accidentally fall a long distance if they do not use the trident fast enough, or if it suddenly stops raining.\nWhen digging or mining.\nMining vertically (straight down or up).\nMining both straight up or down are definitely some of the riskiest things a player can do, because both can carry to dangerous and most likely lethal situations. \nFor example, if the player is mining straight down by mining the block they are standing on, there's a high chance of:\nSafer ways to dig downward include:\nShould the player insist on digging narrow shafts downward, they should try to listen for water, lava or mob sounds (this can be aided by turning on &lt;a href=\"subtitles\"&gt;subtitles&lt;/a&gt;). This can alert the player to the presence of a cavern, lava, or mobs.\nAlmost as dangerous as mining the block the player is standing on is mining the block right above the player's head. Dangers of mining straight up include: \nA possible way to make mining upward safer would be for the player to place a torch at their feet and keep a block in their &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;hotbar&lt;/a&gt; that they can switch to easily. The torch breaks any gravel or sand that falls onto it and if liquid comes out of the hole, they can quickly place a block to stop the flow of the liquid. These precautions are not perfect as there still is the possibility of mining into a cave with mobs or the player not reacting fast enough to a lava flow (especially in the Nether where Lava flows as quickly as water). As with digging straight down, the player should be wary of noises (mobs, water, lava, etc.) or &lt;a href=\"Particles\"&gt;particle effects&lt;/a&gt; (specifically, water/lava dripping from a block) which may signify the presence of lava, water, hostile mobs or a cave.\nDesert Temples.\nThe player should never dig straight down in the center (the blue &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt; block) of a &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so results in the player falling directly onto a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; and triggering a concealed &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; trap, which explodes. This can kill the player, destroy their items, and destroy the chests and their contents. There are safer alternatives to get down and back up:\nOnce at the bottom, the player can safely mine the pressure plate, harvest the TNT, and loot the chests.\nCareless underwater digging.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, blocks take five times as long to break while the player is underwater. Therefore, there is a high risk of drowning while digging underwater, especially if the player is not close to the surface. Digging an air pocket under the ocean floor or placing &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt; can produce a place where the player can slowly recover their air supply. Placing a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; on the ocean floor also creates an air pocket where the player can stand. It takes time to recover the breath meter so players should come prepared.\nShould the player need to dig underwater for long periods of time, a helmet enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Affinity\"&gt;Aqua Affinity&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; potion can be used. A &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; can also be built if the player expects to be underwater even longer. The player should be careful near &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s, as the &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s inflict &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; III, drastically reducing mining speed.\nFinally, players may want to have light underwater. Torches cannot be placed underwater, so it is better for the player to come with full-block light sources such as &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lantern\"&gt;lanterns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, or even a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Lamp\"&gt;Redstone Lamp&lt;/a&gt; beside a &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Redstone\"&gt;Block of Redstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nTNT.\n&lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; explosions are deadly. Whenever possible, the player should use &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; wiring and &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Repeater\"&gt;repeaters&lt;/a&gt; to delay the explosion and/or remotely detonate the TNT. Should the player happen to have a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with the &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, they can also remotely detonate the TNT by shooting it. If necessary, the player should find cover to protect themselves from the explosion. If &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; must be used, run away as quickly as possible.\nTNT also affects the nearby environment. If there are multiple blocks of it, the first explosion launches the others in random directions due to them being entities when primed. This means that even placing it a reasonable distance away may still mean your base is partially blown up.\nAdditionally, large TNT explosions can result in severe lag, and possibly freezing and crashing.\nIt is recommended to wear &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; while using TNT, especially armor enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"feather%20falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; reduces the fall damage if you are blasted into the air. It is also recommended to use a totem of undying in the offhand and water bucket in case of a fall from high altitudes.\nNot bringing blocks for mining.\nThere are many risks linked to deep mining operations. Bringing a good supply of common blocks (e.g. &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) provides material to overcome potential hazards such as &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pools, large cliffs, or mobs. It is also essential to have &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; on hand for crafting. Underground, wood generates only in mineshafts, which are rare.\nLava beneath ores.\nSometimes &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt; may be the only block between the player and death. The player should mine away all blocks around diamond ore found while mining. Care should be taken to completely remove or replace any &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; around the diamond ore so the player is not in danger while extracting the &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s. The same principle can be applied to any rare resource the player would not want to risk losing. More common materials such as &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; should be gathered above ground, where it is safe, and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; should be collected from the Nether, surface lava pools or an infinite lava generator as it is easier to use a bucket on source blocks in these places. The player should also remember to relight up areas after block light from any removed &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; is gone.\nThe Void.\nAssuming the player has found a way to get past the bottom &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; layer of the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or has an active portal to the &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt;, they have access to the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. However, jumping into the void results in death. Once the player falls below Y=-64 or Y=-128, they rapidly suffer from void damage, for which there is no immunity even in Peaceful difficulty or Creative mode. Each half-second below Y=-64 or Y=-128 the player loses health. To survive the void, the player would need Regeneration VIII or higher, which is inaccessible in survival. In addition, Totems of Undying cannot protect the player from death if they fall into the void. If the player dies in the void, they lose all of their items unless codice_1 is set to true. Therefore, do not even think about jumping into the void under any circumstances. It\u2019s one of the worst things you can do in the game. \nIf you accidentally fall into the void, forcibly quit the game IMMEDIATELY, using or ending task via Task Manager (unless you are playing on a server). Minecraft auto-saves once every 45 seconds, so unless you get unlucky, you find yourself right back where you started from. Triggering a crash on Java Edition by holding down for 10 seconds would not work, as the manually triggered debug crash will save your game before closing.\nHowever, if you are in the End and run out of equipment while fighting the Ender Dragon, or you don\u2019t know your way back to the end portal, then you could jump into the void to get back to the overworld. Before you do this, though, you should put all of the items including armors in a &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Chest\"&gt;Ender Chest&lt;/a&gt; so that you can access them in the overworld. Note that this makes you lose your &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; without the ability to recover it unless codice_1 is set to true. It should be noted that the void can then be used to the player's advantage as a means to kill enemies.\nGravity-affected blocks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; enchantment can cause problems if the player carelessly mines. If the player drills around in sand or gravel while moving forward, the player may get trapped in the blocks and suffocate the player for a short time. The player should keep their distance with all gravity affected blocks while mining. Block glitches as described most often occurs on laggy servers or single-player worlds played on slower computers, so players are less likely to come across such issues while playing on fast computers or servers.\nThe player should note that death is extremely rare from this kind of scenario; a close call is far more likely. Another note worth taking is to be careful near desert ravines, as there are sometimes overhangs of sand with no sandstone beneath them. These blocks fall as soon as they are updated by a player placing or breaking a block next to the sand. This can result in the sand falling away and dropping the player down large heights. Be careful when building in the desert if you think there might be a ravine nearby.\nGetting lost underground.\nOne way the player can stay oriented in &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s is to place &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es on the walls on only a specific relative side (right or left). This makes it so the player can follow the torches back by keeping them on the opposite side of the cave that they originally place them (caves are known to split so the player knows which path leads to the surface). Another way to stay oriented is to place blocks as markers in intersecting cave areas. Players can easily get lost in a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt; as they have complicated, but repetitive structures. If a player gets lost underground they should mine back up to the surface in a safe manner.\nMineshafts.\n&lt;a href=\"Mineshaft\"&gt;Mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s are some of the most dangerous places in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\". Have these points in mind:\nMobs.\nLooking at endermen.\nIf the player's crosshair touches any part of the upper body of an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; while within 64 blocks of it, it becomes aggressive toward the player. Endermen deal higher damage than most other Overworld mobs, and their teleportation abilities make them unpredictable. If the player provokes an enderman and is unprepared to continue to engage it, the player can use water to keep the enderman at bay. As of 1.14, the player can stand on a platform of &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;; endermen are rendered immobile (even while provoked) on scaffolding, a similar function to &lt;a href=\"cobwebs\"&gt;cobwebs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player wants to hunt endermen without fear of provoking them prematurely, a player can wear a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; instead of a helmet to prevent endermen from becoming hostile when looking at them. While this is an effective way to approach an enderman safely, the pumpkin also makes it more difficult to see other monsters and fight them, unless using &lt;a href=\"Third%20person%20view\"&gt;third person&lt;/a&gt; camera view, though this too has its disadvantages if one is not accustomed to it. Another way to use a pumpkin as a helmet is to press ( on Macs and other Laptops). However, this view hides the player's hand and &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;hotbar&lt;/a&gt;. If the player's &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; is of high quality, such as enchanted iron, diamond or netherite armor, a normal helmet may be used instead of a pumpkin as the boost in defensive armor may allow the player to fight more efficiently.\nIf the player does not have a carved pumpkin or high-quality armor with which to fight an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;, a simple strategy is to build a small roof two blocks high, and take refuge under it while fighting the enderman. The player can enter a space that is two blocks high, but an enderman cannot, as they are three blocks tall. Hiding under the roof and striking any enderman with a sword is an easy way to dispatch the mob without taking damage, although most other mobs can still hurt the player. Alternatively, constructing a pillar four blocks high and attacking from the top of it produces roughly the same result, as an enderman cannot attack the player from that height. In all cases, the player should still be cautious of other wandering mobs, especially skeletons which can shoot players off of pillars.\nIf the player does end up provoking the enderman they can jump in a source of water nearby if there is one. If the player does not have a water source they can place a bucket of water in front of them. If all else fails then they should get their back up against a wall and punch the enderman from there.\nFacehugging creepers.\nThe player should stay away from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s as they can deal large amounts of damage from their explosion. The danger of a creeper to an individual player depends on the game's difficulty setting and how prepared defensively the player is. If the player hears the hissing sound of a creeper (which sounds similar to primed &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;) they should immediately back away. If a creeper surprises the player, the player's first goal should be to gain distance from the creeper. Any bit helps, as the player moves faster than a creeper even at walking speed. \nWhen fighting a creeper, the player should maintain distance. The best option with this strategy is to use a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, as this allows the player to kill creepers from beyond their explosion range. A creeper must get close to the player before exploding, enough so that the player can build a 5 block high pillar by jumping and placing a block underneath their feet to allow the player to safely shoot a creeper wandering around the base of the pillar without fear of the creeper exploding.\nWhile fighting a creeper using &lt;a href=\"Combat\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; attacks, the player can use a &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprint attack&lt;/a&gt; by hitting the creeper while sprinting. This attack hits the creeper farther away than hitting it normally. Usually, this distance is enough to keep the creeper far enough that it doesn't explode, but if it hits a block while being knocked back by the player's attacks, the creeper may not be knocked back far enough. This or missing an attack on a creeper could leave the creeper close enough to explode. Using weapons with &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Punch\"&gt;Punch&lt;/a&gt; may help keep a creeper away from the player. &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;s are effective against creepers.\nWhen all else fails, the player could at least get the creeper to explode as far away from themselves as possible. Ironically, this is the easiest to do on the \"&lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Hard&lt;/a&gt;\" difficulty setting, since creepers are less likely to cancel detonation from further distances in harder settings than easier ones. It is even possible in some situations to persuade a creeper to explode without causing any damage to the player at all. Their explosion causes damage to the environment unless the creeper is partially in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or lava. Thus, ideally, the player may want to move the creeper into the water before it explodes to decrease damage to the environment.\nIf the player hears a creeper's hiss behind them, they should not attempt to turn around and knock it away as it is completely/nearly impossible to kill a creeper at that point quickly enough to prevent the explosion. Sprinting away to attempt surviving the blast should be the player's highest priority, unless they have a shield, which can block the damage from the creeper explosion, in which case they should turn around and use it. \nIn the worst case, if a player finds themselves without a shield or any way to flee away and a creeper begins hissing nearby, the player should try to place a solid block between them and the exploding creeper, right in front of the player's legs. If done correctly, this greatly reduces the explosion damage, although this tactic requires perfect timing and huge precision. Another way to survive is to immediately jump into a nearby hole, or to any space at least 1 block below the creeper to protect their low hitbox and reduce damage.\nHard difficulty for beginners.\nTrying Minecraft in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;Hard difficulty&lt;/a&gt; may sound fun for beginners, but new players may not have enough experience to do well in hard difficulty. In hard difficulty, mobs deal more damage, players can starve to death if they run out of food, certain mobs gain additional abilities, and some status effects last longer.\nFirst-night exploration.\nNormally, the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Your%20first%20ten%20minutes\"&gt;first nights&lt;/a&gt; are used to gather more resources, because the player is not well-equipped yet. The player should stay away from anything that can kill them during the beginning of the game, as the player does not have much in the way of resources such as &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, or weapons. For some experienced players, this is not a problem, as it provides them a challenge that they are experienced enough to handle. Some mobs are more difficult than others and the player should be extra careful about them (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Combat\"&gt;Tutorials/Combat&lt;/a&gt;). Players playing on &lt;a href=\"Peaceful%20mode\"&gt;Peaceful mode&lt;/a&gt; do not have this problem. If the player plans on spending nights outside, certain &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; are safer than others such as &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s as the player can see monsters coming from a distance. An area with lots of barriers can be dangerous because the player can easily be surprised by a hidden mob hiding behind a barrier, or be cornered by mobs. Shields should be used when exploring, as they can help you get out of situations where there are too many mobs to kill.\nForgetting melee weapons when caving.\nA good melee weapon, such as a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, is a player's best friend when in dangerous situations. One of the worst places to forget a melee weapon is in a cave. In underground places, players come across mobs in tight spaces, making ranged attacks difficult. It is important for the player to be able to kill mobs which are near the player.\nShort walls.\nA wall is an excellent means of defending a certain area, either as a way to keep monsters out or for players to shoot enemies from afar without posing any danger to themselves. However, if a wall is designed incorrectly, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s can easily scale the wall and make the wall far less effective. Spiders treat all vertical surfaces as &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s, allowing them to climb any wall with ease. However, they cannot pass through a block that is directly above them, so building an overhang on the outer side of a wall prevents spiders from climbing any further. The player should be careful to make walls tall enough because spiders can jump over walls shorter than three blocks tall. Note that enemy players can ride &lt;a href=\"horses\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt; to jump up to 5 or 6 blocks tall, or wear &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; to fly over walls completely.\nGaps in shelters.\nThe purpose of a shelter is to protect the player from the outside world. Leaving any sort of opening in that shelter defeats the purpose of having one, as monsters can walk right in and attack the player. The player should make sure that their house or fort is secure from all monster attacks, and only has entrances that can be defended easily. If the player wishes to see what is going on outside of their shelter while standing within, windows made out of &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s are always better than just punching a hole in the wall as an uncovered hole allows &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt; arrows to strike the player from outside of the house, and allow mobs to path find to the player. \nIf a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; sees a player next to such a hole, they can explode from the other side of the wall. The player can also use a collection of partially transparent blocks as windows such as wooden gates, stairs, slabs, or trapdoors as hostile mobs cannot see through them. If the players must have a hole and not a window, for instance, an arrow slit, a block such as stairs can be used. Two upside-down stairs facing toward each other in the wall leaves a space almost impossible to shoot through, making it safe from skeletons. A trapdoor also works great for this purpose, as the trapdoor can be flipped closed when the hole is not in use.\nCreepers and sugar canes.\nIt is difficult to identify a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; hidden within &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the player may recognize the threat, the creeper may already be about to explode. If the player desires a sugar cane farm near their house, make sure it is completely safe with the correct precautions to prevent mobs from spawning or wandering into the area. Sugar cane does have its uses, such as the fact that a player can hide from mobs within the middle of a 2-block tall sugar cane. This may help the player avoid dangerous mobs, but it is not a perfect method.\nIron golems.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s can be a reliable source of iron, but getting this iron the wrong way may lead to major trouble. They only drop 3-5 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s when they are killed while making it requires 4 iron blocks (36 pieces of iron). Attacking &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; iron golems is not a good idea either, as this causes them to become hostile toward the player. They are significantly stronger than the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; in both health and damage, to the point of being able to kill a player in one hit. In addition, killing a village's iron golem lowers the player's popularity with a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; by 5 points, note that this is for Bedrock Edition only (on Java the popularity is unaffected). If the player's popularity with the village drops to -15, iron golems become indefinitely hostile toward the player, until the player's village popularity is restored to a higher amount, as well as causing villagers to significantly increase their prices. However, if you do not want to trade, you can get on a 3-block tall tower and hit the iron golem from above. Make sure that there is no block for the iron golem to climb onto next to your pillar.\nThis does not mean players cannot harvest iron from iron golems, but it is safer and more efficient to construct an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt;, where the iron golems (technically) are naturally spawned and are not killed directly by the player. It is just that the player must provide conditions for the \"natural\" spawning of iron golems.\nBad wither spawning places.\n&lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;s can easily destroy any structure, except those made of indestructible blocks. If the player is planning to fight the wither, they should move far away from important land and buildings, such as their house and farms. Withers make huge explosions when spawned and shoot out wither skulls that explode, all of which cause destruction to the environment. In addition, the wither attacks any players as well as the majority of all mobs in the game, including villagers, animals, and even many hostile mobs. The player cannot stop the wither from dealing damage to the world. The wither still takes a large number of hits to be defeated even with the most powerful weapons and enchantments in the game and potions of strength. If a wither is summoned near the player's buildings, the buildings are destroyed. Even worse, if the player dies while fighting the wither and the wither destroys the bed they slept in, they respawn at the world spawn point, making it difficult for the player to return to base.\nIf the player spawns the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, the wither could destroy the floor, opening up holes to lava or large caverns and thereby increasing the chances of the player falling into &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or a pit, as well as the ceiling which could result in lava pouring down from above and possibly onto the player. If the player knows the placement of the &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wither%20skull\"&gt;wither skull&lt;/a&gt;s, they may try using the top &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; layer in the Nether to help trap the wither during the fight. (This is not that hard, but has disastrous consequences if done incorrectly.) Additionally, if the player defeats the wither near a lava ocean or lake, the nether Star may drop into the lava and be destroyed, leaving the player with no reward for the effort.\nIf the wither is spawned in the End, it could create holes in the end stone, increasing the chances of the player falling into the void. If the player spawns the wither during a fight with the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the player has to deal with two bosses. The player may attempt to have the wither kill the Ender Dragon or distract endermen, but for most players, killing the Ender Dragon is easier without the wither being there as the wither often is more of a hassle to the player than the Ender Dragon. So, if the player is planning on fighting the wither in the End, they should do so after the Ender Dragon is defeated. In this case, battling the wither could make things easier for the player. Since there are a lot of endermen in the End, the wither focuses more on attacking the endermen than on attacking the player. Additionally, the endermen retaliate against the wither, thereby assisting the player in the fight. However, the player should be careful about spawning it near an end city because the wither flies up the end city to destroy the mobs there, which means the player likely must climb up the end city to reach the wither. Also, the player should make sure not to land the last hit on the wither near the edge of an island so that the nether star doesn\u2019t fall into the void.\nFor most players, &lt;a href=\"the%20Overworld\"&gt;the Overworld&lt;/a&gt; is the most ideal dimension for summoning the wither. However, the player should still think carefully about where to fight it. It is usually easier to fight the wither in caves than it is to fight it above ground since the ceilings in the caves prevent it from flying high, making it easier to fight. The most effective strategy to fighting the Wither is to create a long 1 by 2 hallway and a small 3 by 3 room to one side of it. The player should then summon the wither in the 3 by 3 room and then immediately back off into the hallway before it explodes. The player can then shoot the wither safely from the hallway because the wither cannot fit in the hallway and therefore cannot reach the player. Once the wither reaches half health, the player can then run forward and finish it off with a sword. A player using this tactic could defeat the wither easily even with iron armor, a little bit of food, and a few healing and strength potions.\nWooden doors on Hard difficulty.\nOn Hard difficulty, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s can break down wooden doors and attack the player while they are within their base. There are multiple ways to protect a wooden door from zombies in hard difficulty such as placing a block front of the door anytime they are not using it, using an alternative door (&lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s, iron doors, trapdoors, etc.), or placing a slab at the top of the front of the door. Another way to block zombies from doors is to place the door sideways, so when the door is open it closes off the doorway. The zombie's A.I. treats it as open and prevents the zombie from attempting to break it (instead of trying to walk through it). &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Traps\"&gt;Tutorials/Traps&lt;/a&gt; has more ways to protect the player's door from zombies along with other threats such as players.\nKnockback and skeletons.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; knocks it away and gives it more time to attack the player, making it harder to kill the skeleton. There are exceptions, such as when the skeleton could be knocked back into a position which kills it or removes from where it can harm the player, such as over a cliff. They would likely die from the fall, and if the water broke their fall then they would not be capable of attacking the player (if the cliff was high enough). Also, a player with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; could protect themselves against its &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; if the player was using a sword enchanted with Knockback.\nThis is also true when attacking a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; that is using a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; (a ranged weapon).\nBeing unprepared for boss fights.\nIf the player finds an &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal\"&gt;End Portal&lt;/a&gt;, has the &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and skulls required to make the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, or finds an &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;, and the player decides to defeat these bosses, that player must bring enough equipment as well as the right equipment. These are some suggested items for boss fights:\nSilverfish.\nOnce the player attacks a &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; (usually in &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;strongholds&lt;/a&gt;), it awakens all other silverfish in the vicinity, meaning the player has many silverfish to deal with. If the player uses a weapon that can kill it in one hit, or if deals damage through indirect means (for example by lighting a fire with flint and steel), the silverfish does not call reinforcements. A diamond sword, or an axe that is stone or better, can kill a silverfish in one hit. Note that the sweeping effect from a sword could damage nearby silverfish without killing.\nSnow golems and beds.\nBecause of the fact that snow layers count as a block, any snow layers next to the bed a player slept in may result in the player waking up standing on their bed, and chancing waking up inside a block if the player's ceiling is only 2 blocks above, which may result in suffocation damage to the player. The player may also not respawn at their bed if they die, because it is obstructed. To avoid this, keep &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Golem\"&gt;Snow Golem&lt;/a&gt;s away from player beds. Also, if the player must sleep in a snowy biome, the player should remove any nearby snow blocks.\nNot bringing the right equipment for ocean monuments.\n&lt;a href=\"Ocean%20monument\"&gt;Ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s are dangerous to an unprepared player. &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in them, which do 4.5 hearts of damage on hard, and 3 &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, which inflict Mining Fatigue III to the player, which makes breaking blocks nearly impossible, even when an inflicted player uses a netherite pickaxe with efficiency. The proper equipment for some players is:\nOptional useful equipment includes:\nWoodland mansions.\nWhile they contain plenty of chest loot and are absolutely massive, the &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;woodland mansions&lt;/a&gt; also contain &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, which are hostile versions of &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s. Two kinds are found: &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s. Both are extremely dangerous to fight. These structures are designed for the end-game, so make sure to bring the best gear. \nWitch-fighting while unprepared.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es are dangerous. They throw negative &lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion\"&gt;splash potions&lt;/a&gt; at the player such as poison, instant harming, weakness, and slowness. Witches have hearts - more than the player. Players should never go unprepared when fighting a witch, because no matter how strong the player's armor is, it does not protect the player from the &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;. Also, witches drink positive potions such as &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt;. Lava, flint and steel and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; weapons are ineffective against witches because they can drink a potion of Fire Resistance to negate these effects. Witches are also impossible to drown since they drink potions of water breathing. Splash potions are also not useful against witches due to the fact that they are 85% resistant to splash potions, which is almost equivalent to not taking any damage from them at all. It is suggested the player use a bow to kill a witch, as the bow has a much further range than the witch's potions. Using good armor enchanted with Protection is a great help as well. If the player chooses to engage a witch in melee combat, then the player should kill the witch quickly as witches cannot throw potions at varying speeds, &lt;a href=\"Milk\"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; is also great as it removes poison, a dangerous negative status effect that can drop the player down to heart, allowing the Witch to easily finish the player off with a harming splash potion.\nAttacking villagers.\nA player's popularity in a village determines the prices that villagers offer when trading. The lower the player's popularity, the higher the price. Attacking (or even accidentally hitting) a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; causes the player to lose 1 popularity (see &lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;). Killing one results in a loss of 2 popularity, which is not worth anything to the player as villagers drop nothing. Attacking a baby villager results in the player losing 3 popularity and killing a baby villager results in the player losing 5 popularity. In bedrock edition, if the player kills the village's &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;, the player loses 10 popularity.\nIn Bedrock Edition, the reputation system works differently. Just attacking a villager provokes the iron golem. Getting out of range helps because iron golems have a short memory. Dying also pacifies the iron golem. In Bedrock Edition, prices do not depend on reputation; they depend on the villager's demand for certain items.\nIf the player's popularity is -15 or lower, any naturally spawned iron golems attack the player without being provoked. Also, the village popularity does not reset when the player gets killed and the only way the player can get their popularity back up is to trade with villagers. So the player should only attack villagers or iron golems in special circumstances. If a villager or iron golem must be killed for some reason, the player should contrive to use natural damage such as &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, or dispensed &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Iron golems do drop iron ingots upon death. The player can also build an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt; specifically to collect &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. Remember, villagers are the player's friends, not their foes!\nSpending the night near villages without sleeping.\nIn Java Edition, if the player is in a village at midnight, there is a 10% chance that a &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20siege\"&gt;Zombie siege&lt;/a&gt; could begin. Dozens of zombies spawn regardless of how well-lit or walled-off the village is. A few good sieges can easily wipe out the player's local village, and it is extremely tedious to try to repopulate it with zombie villagers. Staying out of the village boundary is sufficient to prevent zombie sieges from occurring, but it is still advised to stay farther away from the village, in order to prevent random zombie spawns.\nAttacking wolves.\nRemember that &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; can also be allied with the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. If the player attacks them, all the wolves around get angry also, and when wolves are angry, they cannot be tamed, similar to &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglins\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt;. Also, wolves do not despawn on Peaceful mode, but they damage the player and do not damage the player and the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Edition\"&gt;Console edition&lt;/a&gt; on Peaceful mode. Also, wolves do not drop anything, so there is almost no use in killing wolves; it is much better of an idea to tame them instead.\nIf you cannot find a bone, leash the wolf and bring it back to your base and feed it some bones.\nPolar bears with cubs.\n&lt;a href=\"Polar%20bear\"&gt;Polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s are neutral mobs, but they can deal up to damage per hit on Hard mode, and are also incredibly easy to provoke. An adult polar bear which is with a polar bear cub attacks the player without being provoked.\nNot throwing potions far enough.\nIf the player does not throw a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt; with a negative effect far enough, they become affected by the potion. The player may then be adversely affected. Therefore, the player should make sure that if they are throwing a splash potion at an enemy, they should throw it far so that they do not get affected by their own potion.\nCreepers in water.\n&lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s submerged in water cannot destroy blocks and structures by exploding, but the slowing effects of the water make it especially tricky to kill them effectively. Unless the player wants to make it explode to get rid of it quickly without affecting the terrain, the player should use a trident or bow instead of a melee weapon to kill a creeper submerged in water. Ideally, the trident should have Loyalty to allow the player to throw the trident without having to swim to retrieve it.\nNot carrying carved pumpkins to the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt; fight.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; severely impairs the player's vision, it may not be a good idea to wear it and fight the dragon head-on, even if it prevents endermen from attacking the player. However, if the player uses a &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;, third-person view, or removes the GUI to remove the impaired view of the &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;, the player can see the entire screen, and &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; cannot become provoked by the player looking at them. If the player would rather use a diamond helmet and they are confident they can keep their crosshair away from the endermen, using a diamond or netherite helmet might be a better idea.\nOn a Peaceful level of difficulty, this is not necessary.\nNot watching their step.\nIf the player does not watch for hazards at their feet while moving, they might fall off into a ravine, lava lake, or a patch of mobs, or instead, fall off a mountain. Keep an eye on the ground while moving (Even if it is pressing F5 twice to change the camera view).\nStanding next to blocks while mining.\nThis is not quite so obvious, but if the player mines the blocks directly in front of them while being close to the block, several negative things could happen. The player could walk into a ravine, walk straight into a monster spawner, or even worse, have lava flow onto them. The player should use ambiance noise to their advantage. If the player hears mobs, lava, or water, they should proceed with caution. Subtitles may be used to highlight such sounds if the player cannot turn the game volume up high. One possible mining technique to fix this may be mining two blocks forward at eye level, then digging out for feet. Do this twice and almost all chances of lava or water flowing in can be noticed before they harm you.\nHardcore mode for beginners.\nHardcore mode should not be played by beginners. Once the player dies in &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, the world becomes unplayable in survival. Players in Hardcore mode need to be extra careful to keep dangers away from them, such as by lighting up dark areas or preparing equipment for fights against mobs. The player should avoid dangerous situations, such as mining, if they do not have the proper tools. A player must be able to fight mobs properly. If the player really wants to dig, they may want to stay safe and build a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Quarry\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt;. It should be remembered in Hardcore mode that there is absolutely no point in safe-keeping important &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s from dangerous places because the player &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;s on Spectator mode if they die and cannot collect their items. Players should not try Hardcore mode until they are familiar with the game mechanics by playing a few games on lower difficulties first.\nStaying outside during thunderstorms.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;Thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s are a particularly dangerous form of &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;, as the sky darkens enough for monsters to spawn, even during the daytime. An unprepared player with few supplies can be killed quite easily if a thunderstorm begins and monsters start to spawn. While thunderstorms do not occur often, it is always a good idea for the player to make sure that they have enough supplies and weapons to survive should one happen. Additionally, a &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; with extensive vegetation, such as a forest or jungle, is at additional risk during a thunderstorm, as a bolt of &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; could set trees ablaze and destroy large areas of forest. These bolts are also nearly lethal to the player if they are hit by one, so standing outside during a thunderstorm is always a risky prospect. And, if that was not bad enough, lightning bolts can transform pigs into &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, villagers into witches, and creepers into &lt;a href=\"charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creeper&lt;/a&gt;s. It also has a chance to spawn &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20horse\"&gt;skeleton traps&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, thunderstorms are a dangerous situation. Note the player can sleep in a bed during a thunderstorm.\nMissing too much sleep.\nIf the player goes at least 3 nights without entering a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s have chances to spawn high above the player. The more nights the player goes without sleep, the higher the chance for phantoms to spawn in greater numbers. To avoid phantoms, the player doesn't actually have to sleep through the night; they just have to enter a bed for any amount of time. However, if the player wants to obtain &lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Membrane\"&gt;Phantom Membrane&lt;/a&gt;s to repair an &lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt; or brew &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; potions, it is necessary to avoid sleep. If the player is seeking Phantom Membranes, they should be advanced enough to be able to fight off Phantoms efficiently. Another much easier way to obtain phantom membranes is by taming a cat. Put the cat in a minecart or boat, with a hopper and chest underneath. Make sure the cat is standing in the minecart/boat. This way, the cat gives you a gift every morning, which is put through a hopper into a chest. There is a chance to get phantom membranes from this.\nConcerning the Nether.\nMessing up in the Nether.\nThe vast space inside &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, along with its environment, comes with many more risks and hazards than one would expect from the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. The player should come well-prepared with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; (preferably enchanted), at least two stacks of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, (or one arrow if the player has Infinity), enchanted iron/diamond &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, especially those with Fire protection, and an iron or diamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; (preferably enchanted with Sharpness). However, unless the player is on Hardcore, they should leave their more valuable equipment such as diamond items at home: an inventory-incinerating death in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; is far more likely in &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; than it is in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. The player should only bring along one or more iron pickaxes and an iron shovel (unless they plan to farm &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; to plant &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; in the Overworld) as tools, and torches, at least a stack of food, flint and steel for relighting the player's &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; if something happens to it, and two to three stacks of cobblestone. If the player does not want to risk losing anything else, then they should not bring anything else. If the player is not playing on Hardcore mode, and wants to preview the Nether, they may want to equip some cheap weapons just in case the nether portal spawns in a lava ocean.\nCareless mining of netherrack.\nNote: This is true of any &lt;a href=\"diamond%20pickaxe\"&gt;diamond pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; or netherite pickaxe with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; II or higher, any &lt;a href=\"iron%20pickaxe\"&gt;iron pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; of Efficiency III or higher and any type golden pickaxe.\nThe player should avoid bringing highly enchanted pickaxes with them. The &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; enchantment is useful for breaking blocks quickly, but using it in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; when mining &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; may lead to death. Netherrack is a soft block and high efficiency is not needed, because you don't want to mine netherrack so fast by holding the mine button that you drill out large quantities of netherrack quite quickly and dig yourself into lava pools or rivers. Also, netherrack has limited use and could end up wasting durability of the player's Efficiency pickaxe.\nHowever, if the player has &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; to survive surprise &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and/or falling into a lake or river, and wants a ton of &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, then they could dig a tunnel without much worry with an Efficiency enchanted pickaxe. A player without active fire resistance must make any nether tunnels at least two blocks wide with one side of the floor a block higher than the other, so that if the player does hit surprise lava, it is channeled to the lower side. The player should always stand on the high side of this type of tunnel.\nNot bringing fire resistance in the Nether.\nThis advice is more relevant for more risky ventures in the Nether, where the player is likely to catch on fire. Fire resistance can be obtained from several different sources before the player has access to potion brewing:\nThe most reliable way to obtain fire resistance is by brewing the correct potion. To brew any potion at all, the player must have access to blaze rods, which can be turned into blaze powder to fuel a brewing stand, so they must have fought blazes inside a Nether fortress first. From there, the main ingredients required for fire resistance are Nether wart, which can be found growing in Nether fortresses and housing unit bastions, and magma cream, which can be obtained from bastion treasure chests, killing larger magma cubes, or crafting with slimeballs and blaze powder (see below):\nRiding mobs in the Nether (except Striders).\n&lt;a href=\"Horses\"&gt;Horses&lt;/a&gt; are useful in the hilly &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, or flat plains, but &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; is no horse paradise. There are many cliffs' horses can fall off of (especially in the &lt;a href=\"Basalt%20Deltas\"&gt;Basalt Deltas&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s to shoot the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; into a sea of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, magma blocks and soul sand, and the place is one big cave. Players do not usually take a horse when they go mining because it is dangerous, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; should be thought of the same. If the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must use a horse or donkey in the Nether they should take several precautions:\nAlternatively, if the player is making a transport system in the Nether, they can create a pathway exclusively for the horse to effectively create a \"&lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; subway\" that travels extremely fast with the combined speed of the horse and the distance reducing effect of the Nether. This is less convenient for the player while traveling through the nether, but it does take much less setup than a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; system which is less tedious and less dangerous to use, but harder to build.\nMake sure the animal used can be easily controlled.\nForgetting to bring flint and steel in the Nether.\nEven if the player secures their &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;, there is always the possibility for a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; to de-light it (not destroy it, as obsidian is only destroyed by a player or the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;). If this happens, the player cannot return to the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; easily, which is why the player needs their &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; to re-light the portal. If not, the player would need to do one of the following activities, many of which are dangerous:\nIf the player is trapped in the Nether, they can also kill themselves to respawn in the Overworld (provided they don't have a &lt;a href=\"Respawn%20Anchor\"&gt;Respawn Anchor&lt;/a&gt; with too many charges left). It is advised that players place their items in a chest if possible first. The player can return to the Nether (hopefully with a flint and steel this time) to retrieve their items. The player loses experience by doing this.\nNot checking your warped fungus on a stick often.\nIt is possible to ride a &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt; in the nether. You need a &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;warped fungus on a stick&lt;/a&gt; to do so. However, if the stick runs out of durability midway in the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, then the stick turns into a normal &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;, and the strider stops move where you want it to go and instead returns to its normal AI behavior, leaving you stuck in the middle of the lava ocean. You cannot dismount into the lava either without dying. So, it is a good idea to check your stick often.\nIf you do get stuck, you may use an ender pearl or a fire resistance potion to escape. Alternatively, you can bring a spare warped fungus on a stick. However, don't shift-click it into your hotbar, as pressing shift causes you to dismount.\nBreaking into a bastion without precautions.\nGold armor is useful for avoiding piglin attacks, but if the player is to bring 1 piece of gold armor to raid a bastion, this results in a trade-off: less defenses depending on the armor piece in exchange for keeping piglins from attacking on sight. Of course, this trade-off also exists if the player wears gold armor around piglins normally, but the benefits are less likely to last long in a bastion. Piglin brutes are always hostile and deal high damage, and attacking one of these provokes all nearby piglins and brutes, no matter the tier of armor the player wears. In addition, hoglins, magma cube spawners, holes in the floor leading to deep drops, and lava at the bottom layers provide additional hazards depending on the type of bastion. It is advisable to wear a golden helmet or boots inside a bastion, which slightly reduce their protection (but may reduce more depending on the enchantments on the player's regular armor), which the player may trade out for a stronger piece if they think they may meet a piglin brute, but they must be careful doing so around normal piglins. It is recommended to wear boots with a high level of Feather Falling or placing a hay bale below the player's feet to reduce damage from falling through a hole in the floor, or placing a slime block (but this may bounce the player into another hazard) or bringing potions of slow falling to eliminate fall damage. A potion of fire resistance can help if the player finds themselves near the lava layers. A flint and steel is also recommended because piglins, piglin brutes and hoglins are not immune to fire. TNT can kill brutes in an emergency. For extracting items from chests, a hopper placed underneath pulls them out without attracting the piglins, but gilded blackstone often generates under bastion chests and angers piglins when broken. Pistons are recommended to pull it out before placing a hopper in its place.\nBeing unprepared while traveling through the End.\nThe End, with its barren wasteland, easy access to the item-destroying &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and deadly mobs, is extremely dangerous, and even more so if you bring the wrong equipment or run out mid-travel. &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; are formidable enemies that can catch an unsuspecting player unawares if looked at accidentally, and especially if tunneling between islands, and can easily fling you into the Void. This would be catastrophic, considering that if you are in the End at all, you would be in your best armor. Always bring food, because the only source of food in this dimension is the somewhat hard-to-collect &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt; (although you can build farms there by bringing supplies from the Overworld), and you need food to heal sustainably, as well as sprinting and not starving. Bring plenty of materials - which endermen should not be able to pick up - to make bridges between islands, staircases and pillars to get to higher ground and avoid being hit by angry endermen and extra tools if you need them. As well as that, it would make returning much easier if you place a &lt;a href=\"lodestone\"&gt;lodestone&lt;/a&gt; on the main End island, or the &lt;a href=\"End%20gateway\"&gt;End gateway&lt;/a&gt; you came out of, so that you can align a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt; to it and always be able to get back home. A pair of ender chests, one in the player's base and one in their inventory, can allow access to the items inside across dimensions, but a pickaxe with Silk Touch is required to pick it back up. Elytra and fireworks, if the player has them, are extremely useful for air travel between islands, unless the durability is low and the player has no means of repairing it.\nWasted resources.\nThese things not to do probably do not result in death if the player does decide to do them, but still wastes resources, sometimes valuable ones, unnecessarily.\nInvolving tools and items.\nUsing iron to mine stone.\nIf a player is mining, they should bring at least a few stone pickaxes with them, or the materials to make them and a crafting table. Mining stone with an iron pick is fast but consumes a lot of durability, and it is quite possible for the pick to break before diamonds (or any other precious mineral) is found. Note that this is not much of a problem when at lower y-levels, as it is likely to encounter more iron before your pickaxe breaks. If you have an iron farm or can get iron pickaxes from villager trading, feel free to ignore this, and use your iron pickaxes to mine stone.\nMining cake.\nA cake does not drop, even when mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe, meaning placing it is final.\nLogs for fuel.\nA &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; smelts the same amount of items as a &lt;a href=\"plank\"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt; (1.5 smelting operations). The player can craft 4 planks from 1 log, and then use the planks as fuel to get 6 smelting operations from one log.\n, a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20slab\"&gt;wooden slab&lt;/a&gt; burns the same amount as a log, and one can craft 3 logs into 12 planks and then into 24 slabs, giving 36 smelting operations in total, equivalent to 12 operations from one log.\n&lt;a href=\"Charcoal\"&gt;Charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, which the player gets from smelting 1 log, smelts 8 items. Smelt logs to make a long lasting and efficient fuel source. One log split into planks (Java Edition) or slabs (Bedrock) can make enough fuel to smelt several more logs into charcoal, each of which provides 8 operations.\nCrafting rabbit stew.\n&lt;a href=\"Rabbit%20stew\"&gt;Rabbit stew&lt;/a&gt; restores 10 hunger, making it seem like a great food source, as it restores more hunger than any other food that can be eaten all at once. However, the 3 edible ingredients (the &lt;a href=\"cooked%20rabbit\"&gt;cooked rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"baked%20potato\"&gt;baked potato&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;) combined restore more than 10 hunger. The carrot restores 3 hunger + the cooked rabbit meat restores 5 hunger + and the baked potato restores 5 hunger. 3 + 5 + 5 = 13 hunger. Therefore, crafting rabbit stew results in a net loss of 3 hunger, not counting the &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; used to craft it. Rabbits are also hard to catch, which wastes the resources on the stew. Plus, rabbit stew does not stack, so it unnecessarily consumes the player's inventory. This does not mean the player should never eat rabbit stew - it restores a lot of hunger, can be obtained from butcher villagers, and conserves up to 3 inventory slots as opposed to keeping separate ingredients.\nDrinking base potions.\nThese base &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s (awkward, mundane, thick potions) have no effects on the player. The player instead consumes &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; and other potion ingredients, which are all valuable for brewing useful potions. Therefore, if they happen to have made them, the player should avoid drinking awkward, mundane, and thick potions altogether. Drinking the latter two, however, empties bottles for reuse.\nBrewing mundane or thick potions.\nIn addition to having no effect on the player, mundane and thick potions cannot be brewed into anything. All useful potions, with the exception of Weakness, stem from the Awkward potion.\nSaving space in inventory and chests.\nBy conserving materials in their original forms, the player can save several slots of inventory and chest space. The player may also need to recollect the original item if they need more of it later. There are exceptions, such as how a player can \"compress\" 9 ingots into a single block and change the block straight back into 9 ingots. Note that nether wart blocks, packed ice, blue ice, partly or fully oxidized (before oxidation is removed) or cut copper blocks, and blocks of amethyst cannot be crafted back into their respective components.\nAccidentally crafting a lot of items.\nIf playing on a PC, holding Shift while crafting items crafts as many of that particular item as possible. If the player does this accidentally, they can end up wasting a lot of resources unnecessarily. For example, if the player has a lot of &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; to craft a full set of diamond armor and they accidentally craft 10 diamond boots, the player would have wasted a large number of diamonds on armor they don't need.\nMining with the wrong tool.\nIf the player does not have a high enough level &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; for the block they are mining, no item is dropped when the block is destroyed. A good indication of if the player is mining with the correct pickaxe is by the amount of time it takes for the block to be destroyed. If the player has been mining a block other than obsidian and ender chests for a long time, then the block likely drops no resources when destroyed and the player just loses the item they tried to mine. The player can just memorize which pickaxe is at least needed for each block over time.\nWasting valuable equipment on low-value jobs.\nDiamond and netherite items last long enough that they are as likely to be lost to an unlucky death as they are to wear out, so the player must ask themselves when and where they are willing to risk their more valuable tools. The player should never craft iron (unless they have an iron farm), gold, diamond, or netherite hoes (unless you want to show off or get the &lt;a href=\"Advancement%23Serious%20Dedication\"&gt;Serious Dedication advancement&lt;/a&gt;, or want to make a massive crop farm), as the only gain is durability and faster mining for certain blocks (&lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart%20block\"&gt;nether wart block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warped%20wart%20block\"&gt;warped wart block&lt;/a&gt;s, etc. (All hoes till land instantly). In fact, golden tools have just over half the durability of a wooden tool.\nOf course, if a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; weaponsmith, toolsmith or armorer sells diamond tools, that makes diamond tools much less costly as the player can trade &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resource\"&gt;renewable resource&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, and then those for iron and diamond tools.\nThe player should also remember that time is another valuable resource in Minecraft. Someone could easily hollow out a 10\u00d710\u00d710 area with wooden picks and wooden shovels, but it could be a waste of time when one has netherite tools to use on the same project. Using iron and stone tools to mine in order to conserve netherite takes away the point of gathering the diamonds, gold, and ancient debris in the first place, and most people do not want to spend their entire Minecraft experience digging with weak tools when they can finish digging quickly with powerful tools. If the player has a shorter time restriction for playing \"Minecraft,\" it may be more beneficial for the player to use up netherite to save time. However, if the player does not have many diamonds or much ancient debris, do not waste them on unnecessary tools, such as shovels and &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; enchantment can make the use of high-end tools a much better proposition, especially when paired with Unbreaking and/or Fortune. A Mending pickaxe that is used to mine ores that give experience never breaks because the experience from the orbs repair it instantly. In this case, the durability from netherite also allows it to mine other stuff and it can always be taken to an experience farm for more repairing. A netherite sword with Mending can last forever when killing monsters, making the high damage from netherite a much better investment. With the current villager job rules, it's possible to change the job of your villagers to one of your choice, and reset them until they have a desired trade, making it a lot easier to get the Mending enchantment.\nTools as melee weapons.\nThe player should always carry a good melee weapon with them. Many tools cause less &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to mobs than a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, are slower, and lose durability quickly when used for combat.\nAn &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; deals high damage and can also chop wood faster. Many axes deal the same amount of damage, meaning any axe, even below diamond, can deal at least as much damage as a diamond sword, and if enchanted, possibly even a netherite sword; however, axes are more expensive and have much slower attack speeds than swords, so the player may find them less useful if they often miss their melee attacks. Axes have another use in the ability to disable shields temporarily for any fights the player ends up in against another player. \"[&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; only]\" On Bedrock Edition axes only do 1 less damage than their sword counterparts, making them a good backup weapon if your sword is lost or broken.\"\"\nShovels deal 1.5 HP less damage and pickaxes deal 2 HP less damage than swords. Hoes were useless until &lt;a href=\"1.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt; where they now do 1 damage less than the sword of the same tier, previously having done the same damage as fists.\nFor more details on what weapon causes what amount of the damage, see \"&lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;\".\nUsing gold for armor and weapons.\nEven though &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;en tools do work faster than netherite (excluding blocks that golden tools cannot mine such as &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and most &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s), and are much easier to enchant than diamond or iron, or even netherite, they have poor durability. Instead, the player should use gold to &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt;, or craft &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s for a high-saturation and fast-healing food, &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s for high-saturation food or night-vision potions, &lt;a href=\"Glistering%20Melon%20Slice\"&gt;glistering melon slice&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s of healing, or &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe exception to this is if the player has a gold farm. If they do, then gold becomes an easily renewable resource. Zombified piglins drop gold ingots and nuggets upon death, making gold renewable. Gold is also better than leather armor in all cases, so if the player does not have enough iron to make a full set of armor, gold is good for their armor. However, the player is likely to get more iron than gold, unless they find a badlands biome, where gold can be found near the surface. Another exception is a golden helmet or boots if you plan to spend large amounts of time near piglins.\nHere are some examples of how weak golden tools are: \nUsing tools on leaves, grass, vines, and flowers.\nUsing a tool on &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; is a bad idea, because it drains the uses the player's tool has. If the player were to use a tool on all of the leaves on a tree, not even an iron tool would last long. It is just as fast for the player to use their fists or any non-tool items on leaves as it uses a tool other than a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; on a leaf block or grass. The player should use shears on leaves or grass if they want to collect leaf blocks as an item. A player cutting through a lot of leaves or cobwebs may choose to make a few disposable stone swords to use as machetes. If the player is on version 1.16+, a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; should be used instead, as most hoes can insta-mine the leaves. It is a great idea to enchant this hoe with Fortune, as that increases the drop rate of sticks and saplings, as well as apples from oak trees. This is an especially good idea when trying to obtain jungle saplings, as their drop rate is much lower.\nUsing axes for beds.\nBreaking a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; takes just as long as breaking with one's hand. It also consumes the durability of the axe. Either way, a bed can be broken quickly with a fist, just as with another tool.\nUsing pickaxes with rare enchantments.\nThe player should not use a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; to mine stone as this yields no extra stone and wastes the enchanted pickaxe's durability. A good idea is to bring an iron pickaxe to mine stone, andesite, or diorite because these are not affected by Fortune.\nThere are two exceptions to this:\nDisposing of low-durability items.\nNo player wants to use tools that are about to break, so many players just throw low-durability tools out, even if they are valuable. An item with low durability can still be used. The player can also use old tools to repair them. Low-durability items could be kept in a chest in case the player dies and loses their stuff. Any scrap tools or armor made of iron or gold can be chucked in the furnace to obtain a nugget and old wooden tools and weapons can instead be used as furnace fuel.\nThe downside of using objects with low durability is that they may break while being used, forcing the player to craft new tools or carry extra tools. This is a problem, especially for weapons and armor. The player could instead store low-durability items while new items are being used so the pieces of equipment can be combined later.\nFortunately, the Mending enchantment enables one to repair any item they are holding in their main hand, offhand, and any currently worn armor using &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; from any source, even if some may not consider experience for 2 durability a good trade. (Note: All of the said items need an individual Mending enchantment in order for this to work.)\nDisposing of less valuable items.\nMost players do not want their &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s and inventory clogged up with less valuable items such as &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;. However, players should consider before throwing away items of any value, even almost seemingly useless items, as the items may come in handy later in the game. \nFor instance, rotten flesh is not only an efficient food for &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, but it also makes a great emergency food for players. Also, if the player wants &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, they can use rotten flesh to trade with villagers for emeralds (clerics). Another example item is cobblestone. It can be used to create great emergency tools, smelted for experience points on demand, be crafted into many different things, or used as a useful, everyday building block. &lt;a href=\"Seed\"&gt;Seed&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to make bone meal in composters, or can be fed to chickens to breed them \u2013 providing a healthy source of experience points in the process. \nThe player should always think about what they are throwing away before they do. No matter what, chests are cheap to craft.\nWasting experience.\nAs the player's &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; level rises past a certain point, the experience orbs the player collects count less toward the next level each time they level up. In other words, each level takes more and more experience to fill up. Since the player can never enchant anything at a level higher than 30, they should make sure to enchant as soon as possible as otherwise, the player wastes much of the experience that they gained after that point. Even worse, if the player dies, they lose the majority of their experience permanently. For example, when the player first defeats the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, they receive 12,000 experience points, which is enough to bring their experience level from zero up to level 68. This is a high amount of experience, but a large portion of this experience is wasted because so much of it is used to achieve higher experience levels.\nTo aid in efficiently using experience levels, the player should create means to have easy access to books and tools for enchanting. The player also needs bookshelves to gain access to high-level enchantments, something which is necessary to allow the player to not be forced to either spread low level enchants across cheap gear, put low level enchants on diamond armor and tools, or waste experience from going far past level 30 and possibly dying. \n&lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt; is the best candidate for enchantment in most circumstances, so if the player has enough diamonds, it is always good to enchant diamond armor and tools first. Level 30 enchantments are usually the best since they usually output the highest levels of enchantments. Enchanting pickaxes early on can greatly help the player, as they could get the Fortune enchantment on their pickaxe which would increase their diamond output when they mine. If the player has run out of diamonds to make into gear and enchant and they do not want to waste their experience, a good candidate is a bow or a fishing rod. Since these items do not have tiers, the player is still making sure that they make the most out of their experience points. And then when they do get enough diamonds, they can use those. Netherite and gold-tier items, and iron tools, have a higher &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20mechanics\"&gt;enchantability&lt;/a&gt; than diamond, though.\nLastly, if the player has an efficient mob grinder or villager trading hall with appropriate farms, there is no need to worry about efficiency of using experience points because the player gains plenty of experience points and can enchant all of the tools and armor needed, with enough patience. If the player uses these items well, their in-game activities become easier and efficient, so the player should make sure to make the most out of experience points.\nOverloading enchantments.\nTry not to over-enchant tools and weapons, as over-enchanting them increases the risk of not being able to repair them. This is because the &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; has a limit of 39 levels for a task, so even if the player has enough levels, the anvil still declares the repair work \"too expensive\" if the task costs more than the anvil's limit. The player can avoid increasing anvil costs by not renaming items early on, or combining other items and &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20books\"&gt;enchanted books&lt;/a&gt; with the item. The player can circumvent issues with high anvil costs by enchanting tools with the Mending enchantment, removing the need to repair these tools using an anvil. If a player does not have access to mending books, they could also enchant items with Unbreaking to increase the time between needing to repair items in an anvil.\nThrowing away tools.\nThe player should try to avoid throwing away tools that they think they do not need anymore, as they might need these extra tools as backups, in case any of their tools break. For example, if the player brought only one &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; with them and it broke, the player would have to stop mining and may need to return to their base/home and get the supplies they need.\nThe exception to this is wooden tools. Wooden tools are slow, they break easily, and the player usually still has a few from their first day lying around. It is not a bad idea to get rid of those; however, the player could put them in an item frame as a trophy to remember they survived their first day or they can use those as fuels to smelt ores and cook food (pretty much conserving coals, for later use).\nAlso, stone tools are also slow, can only mine &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, and are usually only good for mining in bulk (or establishing a strip mining field).\nSame goes for &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;en tools. They mine quickly and are easily enchanted, despite the extremely low durability, so if the player finds these as loot (or crafts them with an otherwise valuable resource), they may serve as work tools for mundane tasks such as mining stone, while the prized ones are saved until repaired, enchanted with Mending, upgraded (in the case of diamond), or replaced with higher-end ones.\nCollecting excess items.\n&lt;a href=\"Shears\"&gt;Shears&lt;/a&gt; are made for collecting plants like &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, but the player should avoid collecting too many, as the extra items consume too many inventory slots. The player should instead collect a number of items slightly above the amount they need for their projects instead of collecting large amounts of items for no reason. It should also be remembered that shears lose durability from breaking blocks, so if the player collected several stacks of leaves and did not know what to do with them, the player would have just wasted two &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s which could have been used for something else.\nCluttered inventories.\nThe player has a limited amount of space in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, so they should keep from carrying items they do not need everywhere and can collect more of the items they do need without much hassle. Often, a player who believes there is enough inventory space may find many more important items and have no room for them.\nThe player should consider organizing their inventory for quick access and perhaps a professional feel to help themselves keep track of what is necessary and what is not. Organizing also helps cut down on the time it takes to find items the player needs or just collected. If the player needs to, they can increase the items they have on hand by using &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s, which retain their inventory when picked up. \nIn addition to this, the player is recommended to not store items that have no use other than being crafted into something (e.g. &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s) or being expended (e.g. &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s) in their hotbar, clogging it with unusable items. During travel, the &lt;a href=\"bundle\"&gt;bundle&lt;/a&gt; can be used to store stray items like flowers, seeds or other items that you have in ones or twos but still fill an inventory slot.\nDisposing of tropical fish items.\n&lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Fish%20%28item%29\"&gt;Tropical fish&lt;/a&gt; are pretty much useless apart from restoring one hunger point. Despite this, the player may want to keep some as an emergency food source or for giving to cats and ocelots, and to tempt and breed &lt;a href=\"axolotls\"&gt;axolotls&lt;/a&gt;. It is best to save any tropical fish you have.\nUsing hay bales, melon blocks, dried kelp blocks, or cakes as compost.\nWhen they are in its smaller components, they give you more bone meal. Even though the high level of compost is tempting, it doesn't get you anywhere further. For example, using 100 kelp blocks as compost only yields 7.143 bone meal while if crafted into 900 kelp you get 38.571 bone meal, which is more than 5 times as much.\nMaking your base out of the wrong material.\nWherever you are, make sure your base cannot be destroyed by endermen (particularly in the warped forest or the End), as they can pick up some blocks, and preferably use strong, blast-resistant materials unless it interferes with the aesthetic that you care about, so that neither &lt;a href=\"creepers\"&gt;creepers&lt;/a&gt; nor griefers can blow it up. &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; and lightning both have massive destructive power, so if you don't have a lightning rod and \"Fire spreads\" is on, try not to use flammable blocks like &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing fire charges.\nIf the player has a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, they should not use &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;s to light casual fires. Fire charges require far more expensive materials to create than flint and steel and unlike flint and steel, each fire charge only has one use. Under normal circumstances, it is not worth wasting those hard-earned fire charges when the player could just use a flint and steel. However, if the player gets trapped in &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; without flint and steel, they can be useful for re-activating the portal, since all their ingredients appear naturally in Nether. (&lt;a href=\"Gunpowder\"&gt;Gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s obtained from &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s.) It can also be used for redstone contraptions, such as automatically lighting portals and ranged firebombs.\nSmelting ores rather than mining them.\nExcept for Ancient Debris, ores can only be obtained using the &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchantments\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. The player always gains more &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; from mining ores with the correct pickaxe to collect the raw material than from smelting the ore. Additionally, the player misses out on the chance to collect multiple items from each mined ore, especially if they own a pickaxe enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, or if mining &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; ore or &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli%20ore\"&gt;lapis lazuli ore&lt;/a&gt;. The only exception is when &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;nether gold ore&lt;/a&gt; is smelted, which makes one gold ingot (9 gold nuggets) rather than gold nuggets (2-6 for nether gold ore; average yield does not extend 9 nuggets even with Fortune III).\nBrewing weakness potions inefficiently.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; of weakness can be brewed by adding a &lt;a href=\"fermented%20spider%20eye\"&gt;fermented spider eye&lt;/a&gt; to any of the following potions:\nBy using a water bottle, the player uses the least resources, so using a water bottle is the best option for the player.\nWasting healing potions on harming potions.\nA potion of healing can be brewed into a potion of harming, but is far too valuable to waste on attempting to harm enemies. This is especially true if the potion is a lingering one, which is much stronger at either tier and far more expensive to brew. &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Instant Damage&lt;/a&gt; heals all undead mobs, including the wither, so the player must never corrupt a healing item in a situation where doing so is counterproductive. In a pinch, it is possible to throw a splash or lingering potion of healing into a crowd of undead mobs to hurt or kill them and receive the effect if close enough. Lingering potions of both healing and harming at both level I and II inflict their respective effect at half power, but once per second at a total of five seconds, meaning any entity in the cloud receives the effect a total of five times, making such a lingering potion up to 2.5 times more potent than its splash variant. Lingering potions can only be acquired by brewing their respective splash potions with dragon's breath, which can only be obtained at the ender dragon fight, making them extremely expensive. If the player wants to inflict lots of damage on other players or living mobs without damaging the environment with lava or TNT, a potion of poison can also be corrupted into harming with far less wasting of valuable resources. \nUsing coal blocks when unnecessary.\nA &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Coal\"&gt;coal block&lt;/a&gt; burns for 16 thousand ticks, which is equivalent to 800 seconds (13 minutes 20 seconds). A piece of &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; burns 1600 ticks- that means a coal block is giving out an equal energy and burning time of 10 coal, despite the fact that a coal block is crafted with 9 coal. This may seem like a good deal, but however, one coal block is able to burn 80 items; that means if you do not have 80 items to smelt, you wind up wasting some of the coal. If you plan to smelt fewer items, coal blocks should be crafted back into coal first. You can get more info &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Things%20not%20to%20do%23Coal%20blocks\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaking Planks when you need Charcoal.\nCharcoal is made from logs, not from planks; if you make planks from a log, you cannot use them as the top ingredients to get charcoal.\nMining budding amethyst blocks.\nBudding amethyst is unobtainable in Survival and is the only source of amethyst buds, clusters, and shards. This block can be hard to make out in an amethyst geode among all the normal amethyst blocks, but it has an X-shaped crack on each face and is often seen growing amethyst buds or clusters. To farm amethyst, it is advisable to mine out all the blocks touching each face of a budding amethyst block (unless it is another budding block) and allow each face to grow shards. As this can only be done in the geode in which the budding blocks are found, noting down the coordinates or building a distinct landmark would be a good idea.\nUsing Fire Protection as your main resistance from fire.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; \"can\" get you out of a bind in clutch situations. However, a Fire Resistance potion is almost always better to use, as it completely negates lava and fire damage. That, and only one type of Protection is available per piece of armor, locking out other, more viable options such as Protection and Blast Protection.\nInvolving blocks and entities.\nNot killing passive mobs with flint and steel when safe and available.\nIf the player is already carrying &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; while they are hunting, they should save themselves some time. When hunting a mob that yields &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; (porkchops, chicken, steak, mutton, rabbit), using a flint and steel cooks the meat for the player. This is especially useful on &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, since they are easy to kill and the fact that raw chicken is not as useful, as it can inflict food poisoning. The player saves &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; fuel and time they would have spent cooking it, and also, a flint and steel cost less to make than most weapons, so it is even more efficient than &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt;. When using this tip, the player should be careful not to set fire to themselves, or to try it on mobs near water. The player can also be more efficient by setting multiple animals on fire with the same flame. The player should watch out for wooden houses or trees while using this technique. \n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; also works similarly to flint and steel except that it does not have any durability and it spreads, requiring the player to quickly remove it. Also, lava is more damaging to the player than regular fire, so be even more careful when using lava. It could also burn the dropped meat by the animals.\nThe player should be careful using these methods in an animal farm since this tactic would kill the player's entire animal farm, and at least 2 animals are needed for reproduction. A good idea is to let a few of the animals out of the pen and then set fire to those animals.\nIf the player has a sword with the Looting enchantment, they may want to use it for killing animals as it provides a higher drop rate than regular weapons. Some may deem this far more useful of a tactic than the other suggestions due to the ease of collecting furnace fuel. The player should not use flint and steel or lava for killing animals if they want the experience points earned from killing animals or the raw form of an animal's meat.\nUsing swords in animal farms.\nIn the Java Edition, &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s have a sweep attack that can hit several targets at once. This is useful when fighting monsters, but can cause problems when slaughtering animals, especially in a crowded ranch. When trying to kill one mob, the player may accidentally hit or even kill another mob standing next to it, particularly with &lt;a href=\"Sweeping%20Edge\"&gt;Sweeping Edge&lt;/a&gt;. This can be avoided by using an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; instead of a sword, which has the added bonus of getting the job done in fewer hits. The player should remember that an axe hits slower than a sword.\nHowever, there is a benefit to using a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; instead of an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; to slaughter animals when the sword is enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, as these enchantments are unavailable to axes in survival and can cause additional resources to drop from the animals you kill or cook meat without having to do so in a furnace, respectively. To avoid doing a sweep attack with a sword, either attack the animal while &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; or jump and attack the animals in midair, as doing either of these actions prevent a sweep attack from occurring. In addition, attacking animals while falling after a jump causes a &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;, which can provide enough of a damage boost to kill the animal in a single strike.\nFighting magma cubes near zombified/regular piglins.\nWhen fighting magma cubes, it can be a good idea to use sweeping edge or the sword sweep attack to kill multiple tiny cubes in one hit, but that can cause problems when you are near zombified or regular piglins. An accidental hit makes the other piglins angry at you and both types of piglins are powerful, especially if you anger a &lt;a href=\"Piglin%20Brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt; and they can finish you in a few hits if your armor is not good enough.\nKilling sheep for wool when the player has enough iron for shears.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheep\"&gt;Sheep&lt;/a&gt; can only drop one block of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; when the player kills them. If the player has &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;, they can right-click on a sheep with shears, yielding one to three blocks of wool. Also, if the player right-clicks a sheep with a &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; in their hand, the color of the sheep changes to that color. If that same sheep is sheared then eats &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; to re-grow their wool, it has the same color of wool as the player dyed it earlier. This makes wool of any color renewable. Baby sheep cannot be sheared and do not drop anything when killed.\nIf the player plans on killing a sheep, they should shear the sheep first before killing them, as it increases the wool gathered before the player kills the sheep for experience points and &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Mutton\"&gt;mutton&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the only essential use for wool is a bed, so the player should avoid killing more than enough sheep to collect the wool needed to make a bed on their first few days.\nShearing mooshrooms.\n&lt;a href=\"Mooshroom\"&gt;Mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s drop 5 &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s of their color when sheared, turning them into cows. However, the player can get infinite mushroom stew out of them by right-clicking them with a bowl, meaning \"milking\" them with a bowl is more efficient. In addition, mooshrooms never grow back their mushrooms when sheared so the player needs to find another one in a &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; biome. If the player has enough mooshrooms to breed them, then shearing extra mooshrooms could be used to get cows and mushrooms. However, if the player plans on killing the mooshroom for beef or &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, then it is okay to shear them beforehand if the player needs mushrooms, as killed mooshrooms do not drop any mushrooms.\nBreaking spawners or budding amethyst.\nWhen in a &lt;a href=\"monster%20room\"&gt;monster room&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nether%20fortress\"&gt;Nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, don't try to break any spawners, with the exception of the spawner found in the . A spawner drops only 50 experience points when broken, but a working spawner can be used for mob farms to gain more experience and rare drops. The spawner should simply be disabled by placing a torch on one side, except for blaze spawners, which require many torches within a couple of blocks of it. An exception may be the stronghold since it may be annoying to try to set up a silverfish farm and the player may wish to just get experience other ways.\nWhile there &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Obtaining%20discontinued%20blocks%20and%20items\"&gt;were historically different ways to obtain spawners as items legitimately in Survival&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of players create worlds in much newer versions, and as such, actually obtaining a spawner by breaking it is no longer possible in said new versions.\nFor a similar reason, avoid breaking &lt;a href=\"budding%20amethyst\"&gt;budding amethyst&lt;/a&gt; blocks, as their supply is similarly limited and does not even drop anything when broken.\nUsing torches to break anvils.\nMany players use &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es to break &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; after having built a large tower of it. Unlike gravel, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;, if anvils fall on torches, the torch is destroyed without dropping itself as an item, and an anvil falling on a player deals damage. Use different non-solid blocks such as &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; to break anvils, all of which cause the anvil to drop as an item.\nBreaking bookshelves repeatedly without Silk touch.\nIf the player needs to move &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt;, they should use a Silk Touch enchanted tool to do so. Breaking a bookcase normally yields 3 books, which is results in the player losing 6 wooden planks (this can add up quickly). Using a Silk Touch-enchanted tool gives the player the actual block back, saving resources and time.\n&lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;Woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; libraries generate lots of bookshelves, so ignore them until you have a silk touch tool.\nDestroying ender chests without Silk Touch.\n&lt;a href=\"Ender%20chest\"&gt;Ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s drop only eight &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; blocks when destroyed, meaning that the player loses an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt;. Ender chests never lose their items, as all ender chests are linked for each player. To avoid wasting eyes of ender, a player should use a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe so the ender chest drops as an item instead of eight obsidian blocks.\nDestroying glass without Silk Touch.\n&lt;a href=\"Glass\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt; does not drop itself when broken unless the player uses a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Thus, players should be careful where they put glass, because if placed it in the wrong place and broken, it cannot be recovered. For this same reason, the player should also avoid holding &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; in the hotbar, unless they plan to use it soon. This same advice is recommended for &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;. \nShooting paintings, boats, minecarts, item frames, or armor stands.\nDo not shoot these items. They count as entities, and as such, they can be hit off walls by arrows, using the arrow in the process. In fact, an armor stand is destroyed and does not drop as an item if shot. If the player wants to practice archery, the player should shoot somewhere else. A &lt;a href=\"Target\"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; block is a much better option as it does not consume an arrow and can be linked to a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Comparator\"&gt;Redstone Comparator&lt;/a&gt; to show more precise accuracy. A &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; made of wood can also serve as a nice and cheap target if the player does not have the resources to craft a target block. Stone buttons also work, but it's better to use the stone for something else unless you have a lot of stone.\nExposing armor stands to creepers.\nCreepers explode when close to the player, and if armor stands are destroyed in the explosion, they do not drop as an item. Therefore, it is important to keep armor stands away from creepers, preferably inside, far away from any mobs.\nTry to drive the creeper away or kill it before it explodes to prevent any entity loss.\nCuring zombie villagers near zombies.\nIf the player cures a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; when other zombies are around, the other zombies attack the cured villager, reversing what the player just did. Even if the cured zombie is safe from zombie attacks, it takes longer to be cured, so zombie villagers should be kept away from zombies as they are being cured. Also, this wastes golden apples and potions of weakness, losing gold and other valuable materials.\nThis also applies for &lt;a href=\"Illager\"&gt;illagers&lt;/a&gt;, because they attack villagers and not zombie villagers.\nSmelting cobblestone excessively.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used to make tools, should the need arise. In addition, having to mine stone out again after having smelted it leaves the player without cobblestone, and the player wastes any fuel used to smelt the stone unless it had been mined with a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; tool. It is always a good idea to keep a decent stock of cobblestone on hand.\nCarelessness with the dragon egg.\nMany players want to show off that they killed the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, but many have lost the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;, which is the trophy of &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, and it is lost forever, because any subsequent dragons do not drop an egg. If the player gets too careless, they may send it back to the Overworld. When collecting the dragon egg, the player should cover up the portal with blocks and use a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; to push the egg, or make it fall onto a torch. Here are some of the things the player should not do:\nAlso, never leave it where players can obtain it in a Multiplayer server. There are multiple players, and someone might see it and steal it from the player. The player should place it in a safe place such as an ender chest and only display it if the player is playing with friends or is in eyesight of it.\nNot using end stone to build on the main end island.\nIf the player wants to build a house in the End, the player should not use anything other than End Stone and Obsidian, lest the Ender Dragon destroy it. &lt;a href=\"End%20stone\"&gt;End stone&lt;/a&gt; is best because it is easy to mine. Obsidian is not recommended, as it takes time to obtain, unless your pickaxe is really good.\nUsing Fire Aspect on an enderman when searching for ender pearls.\nThis is important for people who are purposely hunting for &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s. Fire Aspect casts the &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; on fire and make it teleport repeatedly, which means the player might never see that enderman ever again. Also, do not fight them near water, lava, or fire. This makes it easier for them to get distracted and teleport away, as all of those things make endermen teleport away. On the other hand, if the player does not want to fight an enderman and they've accidentally looked at it, they could go into water or rain, or use Fire Aspect on it.\nThrowing away emeralds.\nThis is simple theory knowledge. &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20ore\"&gt;Emerald ore&lt;/a&gt; is actually much rarer than &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s act as a currency between villager trades and on some &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer servers&lt;/a&gt;. There are multiple uses for emeralds such as &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;s and villager &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, meaning this item should not be wasted.\nUsing diamonds or netherite as beacon fuel.\nBeacons require one iron/gold ingot, emerald, diamond, or netherite ingot to activate the beacon. However, it is a bad idea to use rare materials like diamond or netherite. Iron and gold farms are easy to make and emeralds are easily obtained from cheap trades. Use those to save rare materials for other things.\nUsing golden apples on horses.\nThe player should not use &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s to breed horses, as golden apples are hard to obtain. Instead, using &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s to breed horses consumes less gold as a golden carrot costs 8 &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s while a golden apple costs 8 &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. The player should avoid using enchanted golden apples on horses even more since they are uncraftable and can only be found in loot chests.\nTrading emeralds for obtainable things.\nThe player should never trade emeralds for anything that can be obtained in the near future or would be needed only for a short amount of time, except if they are doing that in order to increase a villager's skill level.\nSelling large quantities of rare or non-renewable resources to villagers.\nSome villagers want hard-to-obtain materials, and give you a low number of emeralds. Some of the cheapest trades for obtaining emerald are trading sticks to fletchers, trading crops to farmers, giving rotten flesh to clerics, etc. You should only sell hard-to-obtain materials if you are trying to level up a villager's skill level and you already have a lot of that resource.\nGood:\nBad:\nNot converting villagers to reduce prices.\nCuring villagers can make them reduce prices and make things cheaper. It is a good idea to cure a zombie villager when you have the resources. If the trades are expensive, cure them multiple times, like infecting them and curing them. Do not do this on Easy or Normal difficulty as the villager has a 100% or 50% chance respectively to die from a zombie attack instead of being converted.\nWasting arrows.\nUntil the player has a large collection of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, has built a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20farm\"&gt;mob farm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20grinder\"&gt;skeleton dungeon grinder&lt;/a&gt;, or has the &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on their &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, they should use their arrows sparingly. Arrows are best used for more dangerous mobs such as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt;. Enemies such as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s are not as hard to kill with &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Combat\"&gt;melee combat&lt;/a&gt; so the player can save their arrows by not using them on these easier mobs. Sometimes, exceptions should be made with easier mobs, such as when a zombie is burning or their &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;. Situations such as these in which the player is in extra danger may warrant the need to use a bow. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Passive mobs&lt;/a&gt; pose no threat to the player and thus have no need to be killed from afar. A special case is the &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;, which is immune to arrows and always teleports away from them.\nCoal blocks.\nNine pieces of &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; burn for 720 seconds in total, while a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20coal\"&gt;block of coal&lt;/a&gt;, which can be crafted with 9 coal, burns for 800 seconds. This gives the player one free coal's worth of burn time.\nBesides, blocks of coal are more efficient for the inventory. This is also called compacting (compacting also works for &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s and more).\nDo not use blocks to smelt only a few items. Whole blocks are consumed at a time, so only use coal block when you are smelting more than 72 items(9 coal*8 items for each coal). For only a few items, it's a good idea to just put in any number of coal.\nNot using hay bales to heal horses when available.\nSimilar to the above involving the 9 coal and the block of coal, each &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; crop can heal a horse health; however, an entire bale of hay can heal a horse health, and &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s are crafted with only 9 wheat. Effectively, this heals the player's horse an extra health.\nPlus, just like how blocks of coal store 9 coal, hay bales act as a storage unit for wheat, as 9 wheat can be crafted from one hay bale.\nThe only exception to this is if the player's horse lost only about a few health points, they should not feed the horse hay bales and instead feed it wheat, as the horse does not need the extra health.\nGetting blue dye from lapis lazuli.\nSome players who have &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; use it for dyeing, but lapis lazuli is mainly used for &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. Blue dye can be obtained from a simple &lt;a href=\"Flower\"&gt;cornflower&lt;/a&gt;, not from a lapis lazuli, which can be only obtained from mining underground dangerously. Cornflower can be found nearly everywhere, from grassy plains to &lt;a href=\"Forest\"&gt;flower forests&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be grown by using &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, which has a chance of sprouting a cornflower other than grass.\nUsing lapis lazuli as a dye is a waste of resources and should not be used.\n&lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; worlds.\nOnly and players need to know these because in you need to use &lt;a href=\"Add-on\"&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt; if you want custom superflat worlds.\nUsing a water &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; world in.\nWhen doing a &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; world, the player should avoid creating a superflat world with water as the only block preset. This setting does not generate land. The player swims and eventually drowns, or runs out of food and starves to death. A superflat world with just water can be boring. The player can use this preset for making a Creative Mode world, to enjoy painful experiences such as Dark Souls, or to have set certain structures to spawn within the world.\nUsing a lava &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; world in.\nWhen doing a &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; world, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; should avoid creating a superflat world with lava as the only block preset. This setting does not generate any land besides &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; in . your player will eventually burn to death. If you do it in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt;, you could make a parkour course or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; islands like in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther.\nThe following things to not do in Minecraft do not fit any of the categories listed above. Still, they are equally important.\nSetting a spawnpoint in the End.\nIt is possible to set a &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;point in the End using commands. However, doing so provides no easy way out. Dying or going through the portal sends you back to the spawn point, which is &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to get out is by executing a teleport command in the Overworld or the nether or by going out through a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; placed by &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, since nether portals are disabled in the End. The player can also use codice_3 to get out, or building a end portal and jumping into it in the end can teleport the player back into the overworld where the spawnpoint can be set again.\nBuilding weak or flammable structures.\nThe player should avoid building with &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, because they are weak materials with a low &lt;a href=\"Explosion%23Blast%20Resistance\"&gt;blast resistance&lt;/a&gt;, unless it's a temporarily structure or as a temporary base (creepers cannot blow if there is a one block wall between the player and the creeper). They are easily destroyed by &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the player should use &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, which is a cheap, abundant, and tough alternative. Later on in the game, the player may want to make their main base out of more varied blocks.\nA list of low blast-resistance materials can be found &lt;a href=\"Explosion%23Blast%20Resistance\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers with the ability to have &lt;a href=\"infested%20block\"&gt;infested block&lt;/a&gt;s in their inventory (such as in creative mode) should be careful not to use them for most building projects as they release silverfish when broken.\nAlthough wood is flammable, it has a decent blast resistance and is efficient to collect in large quantities. A stack of wood blocks can be harvested at the same time as a stack of cobblestone, but yields four times as many blocks when crafted into wooden planks. For large constructions, such as mob traps, wood planks are a good choice. Wooden roofing may be easy and look nice, but it is vulnerable to being set on fire by lightning. Either the player should make the roof in a fireproof material or have a fireproof layer beneath to limit the spread of fire. In 1.17, a lightning rod can avoid this problem.\nBuilding with obsidian.\nObsidian is a blast-proof block which provides great protection but takes a lot of time to collect. The time requirement for collecting obsidian makes it difficult to use in large quantities. Also, despite the fact that obsidian has a high explosion resistance, it can still be destroyed by blue wither skeleton skulls from the wither. If the player is concerned about protecting valuables from explosions, they do so in an efficient manner to use less obsidian.\nIn some multiplayer war games, the player may want to build the exterior of their base out of obsidian because most explosions have no effect and it takes time for players to mine into it.\nNon-reusable TNT traps.\nIt is time-consuming to rebuild &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; traps. Instead, the player may want to use a more explosion-resistant material such as &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Even using cobblestone helps, even if it is not fully explosion resistant. The player could instead use water to avoid terrain damage all together as water has the ability to absorb the destructive aspect of an explosion, but not the physics or health damage, which means that the target is still damaged and launched as normal.\nFire in wood houses.\nIf you want to build using fire in a wooden house, make sure that no flammable materials are nearby, lest you burn down your house. The new &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;campfires&lt;/a&gt; can provide the look of flames without a fire hazard, though you still need to be careful not to walk on them.\nDestroying the world spawn point.\nA player who wants to play with any other items that cause explosions when used, should not do so near the world spawn point. If the player dies after blowing up the world's spawn point and loses the spawn point from a bed or respawn anchor, the player instead spawns at a now-cratered area. This makes it hard for the player to get out, lacking any tools or blocks. To help avoid this, the player may want to mark the world spawn point when starting a new world.\nLiving in the wrong biomes.\nSome &lt;a href=\"biomes\"&gt;biomes&lt;/a&gt; are better to live in than others. This also goes for the &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; and non-plateau &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biomes; while both are devoid of &lt;a href=\"trees\"&gt;trees&lt;/a&gt; and generally flat biomes, they are the perfect setting for pyramids and other exotic builds. The &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; biomes are not recommended as build sites due to &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt; spawns in the former and extreme heights and few trees in the latter. Also, in mountains biomes, there is also the danger of finding a &lt;a href=\"infested%20block\"&gt;silverfish block&lt;/a&gt; underground disguised as &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; or its variants. However, a mountains biome makes a great spot for building an epic house. A &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; boots, and &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; are recommended if a player chooses to live in a mountains biome. The &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; biomes periodically develop a layer of snow over dwellings, which can be annoying for some, or desirable for others. \nThe &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt; biomes, while full of trees, are hard to build in because of the dense foliage, and can be dangerous to navigate at night. The &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"giant%20tree%20taiga\"&gt;giant tree taiga&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; biomes are typically recommended for beginner players due to the availability of resources and spawn rates of friendly &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. Many biome variants and technical biomes are suitable too. See &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s for more. &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;Mushroom&lt;/a&gt; biomes are deceptive. No monsters can spawn, and &lt;a href=\"mooshrooms\"&gt;mooshrooms&lt;/a&gt; make infinite food sources with bowls, but the player cannot grow trees easily and mobs can still cross over from other biomes. Also, mushroom biomes are rare, making them difficult to find.\nExtra nighttime dangers of certain biomes.\nBiomes with more vegetation and hills create greater risks of the player being killed at night as mobs can be hidden behind blocks and the player can become damaged from being knocked off edges. Terrain with lots of water can slow the player, making it hard to run away from some mobs. Deserts and snowy biomes spawn husks and strays respectively, which are much more dangerous than their zombie and skeleton counterparts.\nIf living in a forested biome, it is a wise idea to clear cut any trees near your base to increase visibility and prevent mobs from hiding under them during the day. Dark forests are especially dangerous, as the extensive shaded areas can shelter many mobs throughout the day.\nCarelessness with wolves.\nA tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; can be useful as it can give the player a hand when fighting &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s and keep the player company when lonely. It can be easy for the player to forget to make the wolf sit down when not needed, which could prove problematic if the player hits an entity they do not want the wolf to fight. Also, even if sitting, any attack on the player causes the wolf to stand up and come go to its owner. After the player spends enough time with their wolves, the player is less likely to make those mistakes. The player may want a couple of wolves to ensure that they can have a new pet wolf if one dies.\nAlso, the player should beware of walking on ice, because a wolf teleporting to the player may end up trapped under the ice and drown.\nIf a player who owns a wolf is farming sheep for wool and wants to keep them alive, make sure the wolf does not teleport to the player while they are inside the enclosure, because wolves attack sheep. Similarly, wolves attack rabbits, so if you have a wolf and a rabbit, make sure to keep the rabbit away from the wolf. And this applies to foxes as well.\nNot having equipment for trips from the base.\nIt is important to be prepared if the player wants to go adventuring. There are a few things that the player should always carry with them when they leave their base:\nBeing careless with horses.\nHorses, donkeys, and mules are quick and some can give the player a place to keep excess items. The player should always keep a lead and a fence on hand when out with their horse to tie it up if the player dismounts it. If the player is going far, they may want to take a mule or donkey to help carry food and resources while providing a ride. The player should never dangle their horse from a high place with a lead. The player should be careful not to hit a horse if they own wolves, as the wolves may kill it. The player can name similarly-colored horses to help tell them apart.\nSettling in villages carelessly.\n&lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;s are great places to live. They provide you with free food, resources and shelter. However, you may want to take some precautions when settling in.\nDoing raids in your base.\nThis is important for people with villagers in their base. If your base has lots of fortifications and you are experienced enough to tackle a raid without losing any villagers, it may be a good idea to do a raid in your base. However, for other players, it is not the best idea. For example, you can risk losing valuable villagers, even if you blocked them off (attacks from vexes), ravagers destroying your crops and custom trees, pillagers shooting wooden buttons, entities and pressure plates, activating redstone contraptions and/or destroying minecarts, boats, armor stands, item frames, etc. If you are fighting near your spawn point and get killed by your spawn point, you end up stuck in a death loop because you respawn and get killed by the raider again. (This is not as much as a problem for experienced players) If you have to do a raid, consider blocking those things off and summoning as many iron golems as possible, especially near crop farms and villager trading halls, as the raiders can destroy it.\nBreaking Bedrock.\nOutside of Creative mode, &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; is unobtainable without the use of glitches. It also is unbreakable outside of Creative mode without the use of glitches, so attempting to break it just wastes time. A player who really wants to break some bedrock must be in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt; or use one of the glitches shown in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Breaking%20bedrock\"&gt;Tutorials/Breaking bedrock&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaking risks.\nIf the player's hunger bar is full, they regenerate lost hearts quickly, at the cost of hunger points. Sometimes, an earlier risk is better than a long term one such as if the player were jumping down a mountain when night is about to fall. It may, in this case, be is a safer option to jump down, than to build their way down when night is about to fall. Risk sometimes depends on what the player is carrying with them, as rarer items could be lost in more dangerous situations. Creeper explosions can help fight mobs. Spider eyes can be useful as food, even though they cause a short effect of poison. If the player has low health, has the &lt;a href=\"gamerule\"&gt;gamerule&lt;/a&gt; for regenerating health turned to false, or is playing in Hardcore Mode, they may need to judge the risk of certain situations differently.\nSometimes, you might have to build down, if you have a diamond or netherite sword and armor enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt; V and &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV, you can most likely cut down swathes of mobs. Sometimes, the enchantment might be &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; V, and there might be a lot of undead mobs coming up.\nCarelessness around redstone contraptions.\n&lt;a href=\"Redstone\"&gt;Redstone&lt;/a&gt; mechanisms can be dangerous if not used correctly. For example, the player might make a mistake and push a block into their own head and suffocate or blow themselves up, or trap themselves inside the build. This also breaks the redstone build, which costs time to repair.\nAnother danger is accidentally placing a water bucket, as redstone components are broken by water.\nCareless use of redstone components.\nRedstone components, especially redstone dust, can create lag. The player should avoid using unnecessary redstone and try to keep the number of running redstone clocks to a minimum. An \"off\" lever could be useful to deactivate large redstone devices when not in use. Locking hoppers while not in use is also advisable as hoppers produce large amounts of lag.\nUsing cursed items.\n&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Curse of Binding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Vanishing\"&gt;Curse of Vanishing&lt;/a&gt; are enchantments with negative effects. Unlike other enchantments, which can be removed using a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, you cannot \"un-curse\" an item. If you obtain a cursed item, either throw them into lava or the Void, or smelt them in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; if it is a golden, iron, or a chainmail piece.\nMove your cursor over the armor piece before wearing it in case it has curse of binding on it.\nIf you wear armor that has Curse of Binding, the only way to remove the armor is to die (if not playing on Hardcore) or to let the armor run out of durability. Even if you don't expect to remove the armor, you may later acquire an &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt; that you want to add to your armor. Doing anything to a piece of armor on an anvil requires that you temporarily remove the armor. You may also want to wear different armor with different enchantments depending on what you are doing. For example, you may normally wear armor with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; but want to use &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; when exploring in the Nether. You cannot put both Protection and Fire Protection on the same item, so you need multiple pairs of boots. Also, you cannot put both Depth Strider and Frost Walker on boots. If you wear a chestplate with Curse of Binding, you also cannot use &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurse of Vanishing causes an item to disappear when you die. While it is not dangerous to use an item with Curse of Vanishing, you should not put additional enchantments on such an item, unless playing in Hardcore.\nFeeding cookies to parrots.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt; is fed a &lt;a href=\"cookie\"&gt;cookie&lt;/a&gt;, it dies or contracts &lt;a href=\"fatal%20poison\"&gt;fatal poison&lt;/a&gt; for 16 minutes, 40 seconds.\nIt's safer to give them seeds instead.\nNot feeding pets.\nJust like the player, mobs have health bars, and will die if the health completely runs out. Pet mobs can be fed to replenish their health -- wolves eat any meat item, cats eat fish, horses and donkeys eat sugar, wheat, apples, golden carrots, and hay bales, llamas eat wheat and hay bales, and parrots eat seeds. Neglecting to feed the pets after the pet is injured will result in the pet's death if the health bar continues to deplete.\nIn the case of wolves, the player can tell how healthy the wolf is by the position of its tail -- the lower the tail, the lower the health.\n&lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossible death.\nEquipment for PvP.\nIf the player engages in combat against another player but does not have the correct equipment, they could die and lose any items they have in their inventory.\nIn a PvP (player vs player) battle, players normally take the best equipment to fight other players. Most use enchanted diamond armor or diamond swords. For PvP, the player should not use anything made out of leather, wood, or gold as armor and tools made of these materials are extremely weak. Some other less straightforward tools such as lava buckets and end crystals may also be used as weapons.\nBow attacks.\nWith a few shots from a bow, a player can be killed. Any player who leaves themselves sitting out in the open where they could easily be shot on a server that allows PvP leaves themselves open to this danger and may want to find somewhere with more cover. A &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; can be used to completely negate all arrow damage.\nAttacking players wearing Thorns enchanted armor.\nAttacking players who are wearing &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; enchanted armor with a melee weapon damages the attacking player also. The player should use non-melee attacks to avoid being hurt by the Thorns enchanted armor.\nTrusting strangers.\nThe player should be careful with trusting players they do not know. A player could be dishonest and appear otherwise until they find ways to harm another player or their base and possibly destroy their whole base with TNT.\nSetting off redstone contraptions carelessly.\nThe player may never know what a redstone contraption may do. It could trigger a trap. The player may want to dig around a pressure plate or button to first discover what it triggers. The player may instead decide to destroy any activation switches to avoid activating anything dangerous.\nBreaking tripwires.\nDestroying tripwire without shears triggers the tripwire and any connected traps, similarly to walking over the tripwire. Breaking the tripwire with the shears does not trigger any nasty traps.\nPvP in water.\nThe player's movement is hampered in water, and while engaging other players in PvP, they may knock the player further into the water so they cannot get out. In this case, it is extremely advisable to stay away from bodies of water.\nJoining PvP servers earlier.\nIf the player knows the server has newly been made, they should prepare themselves before the rest of the server's players grief the spawn point or begin killing all new players. Now there might be custom set spawn radius (in 1.9) or spawn protection, however, this does not protect the player from being killed for fun once they step out of the area.\nWasted resources.\nHaving the gamerule KeepInventory on Hardcore multiplayer.\nUsually, when the player dies, they drop their items and respawn. However, in hardcore mode, once the player dies, they do not respawn. If the player then kept their inventory in a hardcore world, then it actually consumes their items rather than dropping them which would in Multiplayer not allow other players to retrieve the dead player's items they lost. This system could be used if a player does not want items dropped upon the death of a player.\nOther.\nMoving beds.\nBeds can be helpful by letting players skip through night and set their spawn point. At the same time, if blocks are placed around a bed, the player's bed is destroyed, or a second player sleeps in the same bed the player last slept in, their spawn is set back to the world spawn instead of next to the bed. Players can avoid angering fellow players by not messing with their beds.\nNot keeping bases away from griefers.\nWhen playing on a public multiplayer server, the player should build their base away from the &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;, and even better in a hidden area. Having a base near spawn easily allows newcomers to come in and mess with the player and their possessions. Players have less need to worry about hiding a base on a private server with their friends and on servers with plug-ins which protect player's bases.\nNot hiding valuables well enough.\nIf another player finds someone's secret stash of goods, there is a good chance for these items to be stolen. If the player wants to hide a stash of goods, the items should be well hidden and possibly even defended with traps. Or even better, use an &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; as other players are unable to access it. Putting the items into shulker boxes and bringing them around is also good, but other players can still steal them if they kill the player.\nMaking large chains of hoppers for transporting of items without placing a dropper on top of most of them.\nThis causes lag and makes the server much less responsive. A hopper with nothing on top of it constantly tries to suck up nearby objects, while one with a dropper or composter on top only tries to pull stuff from the container itself. Droppers and composters are ideal for this purpose as they are do not produce extra lag as furnaces do.\nBreaking chests when moving homes.\nWhen moving bases closer to spawn, you want to gather all your items. However, the player should be on the lookout for others and shouldn't break chests or players can steal their content.\nDoing extreme challenges in hardcore.\nSome people may ask players to try extreme challenges, such as no armor challenge, half heart hardcore, wooden tools only, etc. It is not recommended to do these challenges in hardcore, unless you created a backup or is experienced enough. If you are trying half heart hardcore, don't do it on a world you care about because it is extremely easy to die. If you are doing extreme challenges on a server because another player asked you to do so, you can usually reject the request. However, if you accepted, be sure to bring another person to watch and/or bring safety precautions (totem of undying, potions).\nPossible ban or real-world consequence.\nUsing X-ray mods, hacks, or cheats.\nAdmins and other players do not appreciate the use of X-ray mods or &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s on their servers, as it gives some players an unfair advantage over the other players and may lead to punishment and ultimately being banned from the server! It is never a good thing to X-ray, no matter how far away the player thinks admins are because they never know where admins are and what tools they may have to catch rule-breaking players. If the server allows it, or the player is given permission on a server, then they may use x-ray mods or resource packs, as long as they turn off these resources when done with them.\nBreaching server consoles.\nBreaching a server's console is illegal. A player who breaches a server console risks the possibility of arrest and criminal charges. No server owner wants their servers compromised.\nTechnical.\nPlaying with high settings on weak devices.\nThis can slow down your device and ruin the fun of the game. You are also more likely to make a mistake or not be able to fight off mobs or players.\nPlaying worlds created in a newer version.\nMinecraft worlds created in newer versions may have a different data structure than older versions, and playing these worlds can corrupt them.\nDeath loops.\nBe careful while using commands, especially with /kill.\nIf you make a repeating command block that /kills you, you get stuck and are unable to do anything.\nIf you get yourself stuck in one of these loops you must either:\nIf you're on single player these only work if you are the owner of the said world. If not, it is hard to escape this, and you must ask for help.\nPossible death.\nTraveling near the world edge.\nIn \"Minecraft\" worlds, there is a world border , which prevents the player from falling into fake chunks. However, the environment near this edge affects players, just as they did in the past. Huge lag spikes may occur, paintings and various textures become distorted, and entities spawn oddly all of which hindering the player's chances of survival. Not only that, the lava textures could become lopsided and thus the player could unknowingly step into lava because it becomes unnoticeable particles. Worse of all, if someone moves the world border, when the player is near the edge, then they cannot escape quickly and may die of damage from the world border. Sometimes, TNT can become an entity at another location then it was primed and could blow up things which the player does not expect.\nIn Bedrock Edition, there is no world border, but instead a place called the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Lands\"&gt;Stripe Lands&lt;/a&gt; but the farther out you go from spawn, the greater the chance of you falling into the void due to block hitboxes not being rendered correctly, especially in the Stripe Lands. Also, many of the problems from venturing far from spawn in a world that apply to Java Edition may also apply to Bedrock Edition.\nPossible crash.\nUpdating certain superflat worlds.\nIf the player tries to build on a snow layer in a superflat world, the snow updates and begins destroying itself, which may destroy all the snow layer blocks for the entire rendered area.\nTeleporting excessively.\nTeleporting a lot requires the game to load and unload lots of chunks, which is a lot of work for the computer running the game. This can create large amounts of lag. It is also a waste of &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; if the player is in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nTriggering large amounts of TNT.\nThis may seem fun, but doing this creates lag because the game must calculate each TNT's explosion individually. A large enough set of explosions could crash the game multiple times. Also, don't make TNT superflat worlds for a similar reason.\nUsing extremely high looting or fortune levels.\n&lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; increases the number of items that mobs drop and increases the chance of rare drops, while &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; increases the number and/or chances of specific item drops. If the player is using commands, they can get a sword with a high-level looting enchantment or a tool with a high-level fortune enchantment that is not usually possible in the game. The player should not use such a weapon/tool to kill a bunch of mobs or mining resources, as those things could drop enough items to lag the game, possibly to the extent of crashing the game as well.\nDropping large numbers of items.\nIf the player drops too many items at a time, by activating a lot of dispensers and droppers or by destroying a lot of chests full of items, or even by rapidly destroying a large number of tall kelp at their bases, then a large number of items could add lag to the world. Enough lag makes the game harder to play and may even crash the game. On Multiplayer servers, the player may get kicked for crashing the server. "}

If not, the player can block it of again. After being skilled enough to beat a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, it is most recommended to always hold the &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; in your offhand to survive when the you died while still being able to hold another item but the totem still activates.\nFire and related blocks.\nAfter a few &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, the player should make a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; to go to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or cook food faster, or use it to burn other mobs later, but it is not recommended to burn a &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, because it will spread and cause more &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. The player should not use lava as it is more dangerous and will burn the item.\nArmor.\nThe Nether.\nWhile going to the Nether, the player should replace their armor (specifically damaged &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;) with new ones since it can break faster meaning the player will get more &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; when fighting or any other damage.\nThe end.\nThe player should bring at least &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; armor if not skilled enough, as the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20dragon\"&gt;Ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; can knock the player off. &lt;a href=\"Enchantments\"&gt;Enchantments&lt;/a&gt; are recommended, but not needed. &lt;a href=\"Feather%20falling\"&gt;Feather falling&lt;/a&gt; can be really helpful when the Ender dragon knocks the player off a high place, such as the &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20pillars\"&gt;obsidian pillars&lt;/a&gt; and the player's tower to get up to the pillars.\nVillages.\nPopularity.\nIf in a village and the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; is still there, the player should not hit any &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s or do any thing bad when near the iron golem because the iron golem will attack back. This is not a problem if the player killed the iron golem, but the villagers can spawn it again.\nTaiga villages.\nIf the player has weaker armor than iron or have no armor at all and is in a taiga village, the player can search for the armor stands with iron armor on them and take it, but doesn't when the player already has better armor, but the player can still take it just in case the player's armor breaks.\nCuring.\nIf want to bring a villager's price down without &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"hard\"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"normal\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt;, the player zombify the villager and cure it by using a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20weakness\"&gt;splash potion of weakness&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; and wait about 5 minutes for it to turn back, and it will give the player discounts. Note a villager in normal have a 50% chance to die instead of zombifying.\nTrading.\nThe player should only trade good trade (e.g 32 &lt;a href=\"sticks\"&gt;sticks&lt;/a&gt; for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;, 11 &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s for an emerald) unless the player is trying higher the levels or the player have a lot of those items for blocks. Bad ones such as a diamond for an emerald, 36, 25 34, etc, for one &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;, while the bell is in the village. These are not recommended as the items required is more valuable and hard to get/obtain.\nFood.\nIf running out of hunger, such as 6 hunger points () or with the &lt;a href=\"hunger%20%28effect%29\"&gt;hunger effect&lt;/a&gt; (), it is recommended to only eat when the hunger amount is lost as the exact same amount of the food the player has fills up to save more food later."}
{"id": "101945", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=101945", "title": "Tutorials/Things to do when bored", "text": "While \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" is a huge game with endless possibilities, there will always be a time where a player may believe they've done everything, or built everything possible in the game. Here is a list of ideas for players who are bored and may be looking for something fun to do in the game, although most players will have already done many of these.\nDig a quarry.\nA quarry is a big project, but the rewards are huge. You just dig a big hole down to &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; and put a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; under it.\nIn &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, a quarry is a very big push to help you survive. This might be hard to do because you have to make tools and gather wood.\nPlay &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nMost players have played normal &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, but &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; is a much more difficult variant of it. When in hardcore mode, the player is not only restricted to hard &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that mobs deal greater damage, the player can starve to death, and multiple other game features are much more challenging. Furthermore, if the player dies, they can only return to the world in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, meaning they can never interact with that world again (unless &lt;a href=\"cheat\"&gt;cheat&lt;/a&gt;s are used).\nPlay &lt;a href=\"Ultra%20Hardcore\"&gt;Ultra Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nSimilar to hardcore mode, this game mode only gives the player one life. However, this game mode also removes the ability to naturally regenerate health, meaning that golden apples and potions and even beacons have to be used to regenerate health. This is a game mode even harder than regular hardcore, which only the best players will be able to complete. So if you are new to the game I don't recommend this mode, but if you are to play this watch your surroundings!\nChange the rules.\nTry changing some rules! Here are some examples:&lt;br&gt;Level system:&lt;br&gt; Rookie (Beginner Level): You can't use &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; or craft an item. &lt;br&gt;New player (Levels 1\u20134): You can use only wooden and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; tools, only &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;. You can't wear &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. &lt;br&gt;Introduction (Levels 5\u20138): You can only use wooden and gold tools. Only wood, planks, cobblestone, &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;, dirt, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; can be used. &lt;br&gt;Citizen (Levels 9\u201312): You can use stone tools or &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Knight (Levels 12\u201315): You can do anything a citizen can do, and use &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; tools, and wear iron armor and gold armor. &lt;br&gt;Technician (Levels 16\u201319): You can do anything a knight can do, and you can create with &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s and use diamond tools and armor. &lt;br&gt;Mage (Level 20+): You can do what any technician can and create with anything.\nBuild an army.\nIf you're in a server and there's a lot of people there, why not start a war? Build up your own army, feed your warriors, give them arms and armor, and rush to destroy enemies bases, while defending your own.\nBuild a statue.\nBuild a giant statue of anything, whether it is in-game or real life, using \"Minecraft\" blocks. Examples include an &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a real-life piano, or the player's in-game skin. If playing in multiplayer, it is recommended to not build with something flammable, to prevent your structure from being torched by griefers.\nPixel art.\nSimilar to statues, pixel art uses dyed &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; or other textures to create spectacular 2D mosaics! Find a low resolution image and assign a material to each pixel. The image can then be recreated in Minecraft.\nBuild a roller coaster.\n&lt;a href=\"Rail\"&gt;Rail&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s can be combined with blocks to create roller coasters. These can have drops, sharp turns, and scenery. Although they are usually built in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, they can also be built in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, or a portal could even be used to make a roller coaster that travels through both dimensions interchangeably. There are infinite possibilities. See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Building%20a%20rollercoaster\"&gt;Tutorials/Building a rollercoaster&lt;/a&gt; for more info.\nNether village.\nIt's easy in &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; creative mode. It's time-consuming but it's also fun. You can make a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; look like the Nether! If you want to build a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; that looks like it's in The Nether, you need &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick\"&gt;nether brick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick%20stairs\"&gt;nether brick stairs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, a bucket of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;crimson&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warped%20hyphae\"&gt;warped hyphae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStep 1: Manufacturing farm: use &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;s to replace crops such as &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 2: Build nether buildings: &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick\"&gt;nether brick&lt;/a&gt;s or nether &lt;a href=\"crimson%20hyphae\"&gt;crimson hyphae&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"warped%20hyphae\"&gt;warped hyphae&lt;/a&gt; to replace overworld &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick%20stairs\"&gt;nether brick stairs&lt;/a&gt; to replace ordinary stairs, use &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick%20fence\"&gt;nether brick fence&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, the soul sand to replace &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, the ground of indoor use &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use &lt;a href=\"Door\"&gt;crimson door&lt;/a&gt;s instead of regular wooden doors. \nStep 3: Streetlights: Destroy all street lights in the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; and replace them with &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick%20fence\"&gt;nether brick fence&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 4: Lava wells: As above. Use &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; to replace &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep 5: L - shaped house: The structure is the same, but the roof should be replaced by &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; and nether brick stairs.\nStep 6: Blacksmith: The structure is also the same, but &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s should fill with &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; and items that nether mobs drop.\nStep 7: Build a large &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; cube wrapped around the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; and add &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and add &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, to make it look really like in the Nether!\nCreate redstone circuits.\n&lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit\"&gt;Redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt;s will open up new areas of Minecraft that are both complex and creative. Almost anything can be made from automatic mob traps to machines that can play music or tell you the time.\nBuild something from the real world.\nWhy not build some real world buildings in Minecraft? Choose some buildings in the real world (for example: your home, your school, McDonald's) and build them to the best of your ability. Once created, send the world of these buildings or pictures to your friends. Good luck!\nPlay \"Spleef\".\n&lt;a href=\"Spleef\"&gt;Spleef&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting game that can be played on some Minecraft servers. This game is played on top of a lava pool, which has a platform above the lava pool, usually made of &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;, because &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed very quickly and cannot be rearranged. Players take the shovel and use them to destroy blocks under other players' feet so they can fall into the lava or defend themselves. Some servers use &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;, and the player holds the &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; in his hand and ignites at the &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; under the other player's feet.\nPlay with &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;.\nDig down to &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; and build a tower of TNT all the way up, with layers of solid blocks in between(due to TNT becoming an entity when lit). Dig a quick hole down the side for access purposes, then light it all the way up! You can blow up a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; and harass the villagers. Note: make sure you're not on other's servers, these actions may be considered griefing.\nZombies vs. villagers.\nMake sure that you are in &lt;a href=\"creative%20mode\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt;. First, make a 3-block tall, 12\u00d712 box with an open top, and then use &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn some &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, watch the villagers try to survive.\nDefeat mobs.\nCircle one area, summon 100 &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and defeat all the creepers without letting them explode. This will take some time to kill all of them. These will help you in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, and you can find people who have &lt;a href=\"creative%20mode\"&gt;creative mode&lt;/a&gt;, who can use &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s to summon mobs that you want.\nSummon mobs with commands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; can be used to spawn unique and interesting mob types. Examples of what a player could create with the command may be an upside-down &lt;a href=\"spider%20jockey\"&gt;spider jockey&lt;/a&gt; on top of a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; in its hand and a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; on its head. Other useful commands used to place or modify blocks automatically are and . The player could use these to create a giant wall or building without having to manually place everything.\n&lt;a href=\"Flying\"&gt;Flying&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Note: This only works properly .\"\nDid you know that you can make &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fly\"&gt;fly&lt;/a&gt; by repeatedly punching them while they have &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;? Probably not! Here is how: &lt;br&gt;\nStep 1: Type in the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; . This will summon a pig. &lt;br&gt;\nStep 2: Type in the command . This will prevent the pig from moving. &lt;br&gt;\nStep 3: Type in the command . This will prevent the pig from falling at a normal speed and will instead fall slowly. &lt;br&gt;\nStep 4: Type in the command . This will make the pig regenerate almost instantly after every punch. &lt;br&gt;\nStep 5: Type in the command . The speed will make you reach the pig. If you don't type in the command, then you wouldn't reach the pig to punch it anymore and it would likely touch the ground before you would even hit it. &lt;br&gt;\nStep 6: Begin punching the pig with an empty fist. Once you've started punching, don't stop. After a few hits, you will notice that the pig is in mid-air while you keep punching it to constantly be in that state, looking like it's flying. How long can you keep hitting until the pig touches the ground?\nAlternatively, if you prefer to do something simpler, you could go to build limit, perform step 3, equip a saddle on the pig, and try to make it 'fly' by using a carrot on a stick.\nAttack a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you live not far from a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, why not try to attack it? Blow up the houses, lock up the &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s and take over the whole &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. If you in singleplayer, though, watch out for the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAbuse some &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThis is best done in the &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; map creative mode. &lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;Fence&lt;/a&gt; an area, summon a bunch of mobs (don't summon flying mobs or mobs that are immune to fall damage) with spawn eggs, equip a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; and fly as high as you want, but don't fly more than 34 blocks off the ground, and then start fishing for these mobs. If the fishing rod hooks a mob, \"release\" it and make it fly. You could also organize a race with your friends to see who is the best.\nYou could dig a hole in the ground and pour &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; into it and build a tower out of spider webs. Summon a bunch of mobs from the top of the tower (again don't summon mobs that can fly, mobs that are immune to fall damage, or spiders, as all can manage out of the cobwebs) and watch them fall into the lava!\nYou could also build a small ring rail with powered rails, put in some minecarts and load them with mobs, and get them moving at high speed. Finally, place the block one block high from the rail.\nYou could also dig a hole at least 3 blocks deep (1x1), summon a bunch of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in the hole with a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;, and then put &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; in the hole, watch them suffocate to death!\nYou could also build a completely enclosed room (with a roof that is closed and dark), fill it with &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, then put &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s in and watch them get killed.\nIt wouldn't be so nice though...\nMake an overpowered item!\nNote: It only works on .\nWith commands, the player can obtain a diamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with an enchantment level 32767. Try it on and go kill some &lt;a href=\"boss%20mob\"&gt;boss mob&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCommand for an overpowered :\nWith commands, it's possible to obtain an overpowered stick that knockback entities so far back. Try and beat the game with it!\n=== Command for Knockback stick (and other enchantments)\nBuilding in a different Biome.\nMost of the time, you always nestle up in one biome, this can be fun, say you always build up in the &lt;a href=\"Plains\"&gt;Plains&lt;/a&gt;, try living in the sides of &lt;a href=\"Mountains\"&gt;Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. if you make home base in the forest, Try the desert! The new challenges of the location such as water freezing, no wood, etc. can be quite fun.\nTry to play older versions.\nNote: This only works on . If you intend to do in , you will have to use third-party tools which is used for version management.\nIn order to do this, open the &lt;a href=\"launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt; and select an older version that you would like to play. There are a lot of older versions of \"Minecraft\" you can play. Here are some versions you could try:\n&lt;a href=\"Easter%20eggs%23April%20Fools\"&gt;April Fools&lt;/a&gt; versions.\nNote: It only works on .\n&lt;a href=\"2.0\"&gt;2.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"15w14a\"&gt;15w14a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1.RV-Pre1\"&gt;1.RV-Pre1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3D%20Shareware%20v1.34\"&gt;3D Shareware v1.34&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"20w14%E2%88%9E\"&gt;20w14\u221e&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2022w13oneBlockAtATime\"&gt;22w13oneBlockAtATime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2023w13a_or_b\"&gt;Java Edition 23w13a_or_b&lt;/a&gt;, are \"Minecraft\" versions that were created solely for April Fools' Day, containing multiple jokes unique to these versions. Features in 2.0 include silverfish made from redstone (called \"redstone bugs\" in-game), the pink friendly &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, extinguished &lt;a href=\"torches\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Etho Slabs,\" which are essentially &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. In 15w14a, the player is unable to directly attack &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, obsidian boats will sink and drown the player, and like in 2.0, the pink wither is present. Features present in 3D shareware include &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;s with overpowered items, cheat codes, and various 90s gaming references. 20w14\u221e is a version with over two billion dimensions, including several Easter egg dimensions. These April Fools versions can create a fun and interesting experience for players.\nJoin server.\nAlthough some servers require online registration, others can be joined at any time without any prerequisites. Numerous activities can be done in servers, such as showing your work to others (buildings, skills, etc.), viewing other people's work, and making friends with the players in the server or just having fun on all types of minigames that servers offer.\nPlay a custom map.\nCustom maps can be fun, and many have a creative storyline, challenging battles, and beautiful buildings. Map time can range from 15 minutes to 100 hours! For those who like to take risks, there are plenty of adventure maps for you to manipulate heroes and fight with countless mobs, and for those who like to take on intellectual challenges, there are plenty of maze maps for you to challenge.\nMake your own map.\nVarious types of maps can be made in \"Minecraft\", including challenge maps, parkour maps, and survival maps, and there are endless ways to build these. Some ideas would include using &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt;s to make a decryption or puzzle map, or using blocks to make a parkour or island map. Sky castles are also great. You can also do pvp maps and play with your friends.\nUpload videos.\nWith software (such as ) that allows you to record your screen, videos can be made of \"Minecraft\" gameplay. Some common categories of Minecraft videos are Survival Let's Plays, playing custom maps, and building tutorials. These videos can be put up on any website that allows for video uploading; is the most common of these, but there are alternatives available.\nUse/create a resource pack.\nChanging the &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt; won't provide new blocks or items, but it will give Minecraft a fresh look that can be exciting when the first world is created, so you can pick one on the Web and have a look at Minecraft with a new eye.\nYou can also make your very own resource pack and replace some textures, sounds, subtitles, etc. with yours!\nTry &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;.\nTry mods! Some large ones take time to be fully explored.\nThere are many Minecraft &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;. Try them out slowly. See &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.curseforge.com/minecraft/\"&gt;Curse Forge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net\"&gt;Minecraft Forums&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nTry Unmanned &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstall a computer &lt;a href=\"mod\"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt; (ComputerCraft &lt;a href=\"mod\"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt;), create \"&lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; turtles\" or \"advanced\" &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; turtles, use the built-in &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; program (tunnel length). Turtles need &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;, if it can't move, fill in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; or other kinds of &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;, type in \"refill all\" to supplement the &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;. This will make you more secure because they're diamond &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s with infinite &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, can instantly dig, and are not afraid of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or monsters. However, it can't be equipped with an &lt;a href=\"enchanted\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe.\nMake mods.\nSometimes it's difficult to make a mod (for some people or some types of mod), but you can make the game the way you want it to be, such as a new dimension, some new blocks, and mobs. If you can't program, you can also try to use some visual tools (e.g. MCreator).\nYou can use Mod Coder Pack (MCP) to modify the source code of the game for versions a1.1.2 up to 1.12.2. If you want to mod for 1.13 and onwards, you can try MCP Reborn. \nIf you intend to modify the source code, but you want it is compatible with loader mods, you can try making coremods. \nOthers.\nPlay other games- Sure, you can go do something active, and be sure to play video games other than Minecraft."}
{"id": "90724", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=90724", "title": "Tutorials/Thunderstorm survival", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;Thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s are a very dangerous weather condition. As well as giving the world a light level low enough to allow monster spawning, lightning also has the ability to strike and set fire to the surrounding blocks, cause monster mutations, and possibly be lethal to the player. However, they can be a good challenge for a well-established player.\nBasic dangers.\nIf you decide to go out during a thunderstorm, be prepared to fight monsters. Thunderstorms come without warning and, due to the low light level, monsters will spawn. If you are not ready, retreat to your house and wait it out. If you are stuck outside accidentally, either make an emergency shelter (dig down three blocks, jump in and place dirt over your head or a similar design) or just try to fight the monsters and avoid lightning as best as you can.\nKeep your health high to avoid a higher risk of dying. Try to keep your &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar over ( to keep healing, and if it gets below , you won't be able to &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;. In case of this, you should keep a food store, so that you can grab food if you happen to need some. An example of a good food to stock up on would be &lt;a href=\"Baked%20Potato\"&gt;baked potatoes&lt;/a&gt;. Remember that it is possible for lightning to strike you by surprise. Fortunately, the lightning actually hitting you is extraordinarily rare and. doesn't do much damage, but it will set you on fire. Still, it's unlikely to do much damage, even if you're unarmored.\nFires.\nEvery time lightning strikes, it will start a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, the rain will quickly put the fire out, but the fire will remain lit if it is under a ledge or on &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; and certain other blocks, allowing it to spread.\nIf you see a fire, put it out as quickly as possible. If you do not have a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;, you can break the fire simply by punching the fire's hitbox. If it is not put out, it could spread and, although there is a limit to how far it can spread individually, it is still undesirable, especially if near the player. If you don't have a water bucket to put out the fire, and it's too big to break with your fist, just get away, and the fire should eventually stop.\nNotes.\nLightning can only strike in the &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;. This means that snowy and dry warm &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s cannot have lightning, which cuts many of the hazards, such as fire and getting struck by lightning. However, you still have an \"unexpected nighttime\", as monsters can spawn, even if there is no rain.\nMobs.\nLightning strikes can spawn or change mobs in these ways:\nRemember that this will only occur if the mob(s) that are transformed in question are within 3 blocks of the lightning. However rare it may be, it's good to know in case they are present.\nSkeleton traps.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20trap\"&gt;Skeleton trap&lt;/a&gt;s look like bone/skeletal horses when created, but as soon as the player comes within ten blocks, the horse transforms into a skeleton horseman, and three more spawn instantly near it. They have the AI of a skeleton or skeleton jockey and the speed and agility of a horse. What's more, they don't despawn, and they don't burn if the sun comes out again due to their enchanted iron helmets. Their bows are enchanted as well.\nSkeleton traps have a 0.75% to 6.75% chance of spawning in a lightning strike, depending on difficulty. They do not spawn on peaceful mode.\nNever get too close to a skeleton trap unless you're prepared. If, during or after a thunderstorm, you see a horse that looks like a skeleton version of a normal horse, beware. The safest way to fight them is with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. However, you may want to activate a skeleton trap for one of these reasons:\nGenerally, iron &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; is enough to deal with them. Make use of a &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt; if you're confident in your abilities in not hitting the horses.\nCharged creepers.\nCharged &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s are much more dangerous than normal ones due to the fact that they have a much larger blast radius with double damage. All strategies that work on their normal variants still work, but the consequences for failure are more drastic.\nIf you want &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;s, you can let the creeper follow you to a mob. When triggering the explosion, make sure that you are armed with a &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; and that the mob is close to the creeper. If the mob dies, it should drop a mob head. To allow yourself to run away without stopping the explosion, trigger the creeper with &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;. Mob heads are one of the advantages of thunderstorms, as they allow the collection of &lt;a href=\"Head\"&gt;Heads&lt;/a&gt; from certain mobs, which may be unobtainable or scarce otherwise for most variants. Note that only one head can drop per explosion.\nZombified piglins and witches.\nSometimes, lightning will strike in a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt; farm or a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; that you have been &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with.\nWhen killed, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglins\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt; drop gold nuggets, rotten flesh and, occasionally, their own golden &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s. However, they have high melee damage and attack in groups if provoked. To avoid such occurrences, place &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Rod\"&gt;Lightning Rods&lt;/a&gt; away from the farms.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es are always hostile, and use potions. Their potions can be debilitating in the right circumstances, especially since their &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; deals massive amounts of damage and leaves you at until the effect ends.\nMaterials needed.\nIf you do decide to go outside in a thunderstorm, here is a list of recommended materials to carry in your inventory:\nNote that anything that works for you at night will work in thunderstorms.\nAvoiding thunderstorms.\nIf you are a less experienced player, are in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Ultra%20hardcore%20survival\"&gt;ultra hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode where &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; can't regenerate, or just don't want to risk dying, you likely want to avoid thunderstorms. If you have a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, Minecraft allows you to sleep through thunderstorms, so you can sleep and when you wake up, the thunderstorm will be gone. However, avoiding thunderstorms are more difficult to avoid safely than they seem if you don't have a bed to sleep through it.\nFirst of all, the only border between you and the outside must not be &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, or any other flammable material unless you have a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Rod\"&gt;Lightning Rod&lt;/a&gt;. If it is, one &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strike could set your whole house on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, which could destroy your home, possibly set you on fire, and allow mobs to get in. If you don't want your house to be burned down, consider making it out of non-flammable material. Otherwise, you will need to completely cover up your house with a material that does not catch fire, such as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't mind your house burning down but want a quick way to be enclosed from the outside for your own safety, make a tiny hut around yourself, made of cobblestone, dirt, or another in-expensive non-flammable block. Although wooden &lt;a href=\"doors\"&gt;doors&lt;/a&gt; can catch fire, they will not burn away or spread the flame so you do not have to worry about them.\nIf you are surrounded by a non-flammable block and you are completely enclosed from the outside, you should be safe. There are a number of things you can do so that you don't get bored. First of all, you can just dig down and start &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe explore a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; if you find one, but make sure you have enough materials and equipment for safety. Another thing you can do is organize your &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, and start crafting things for when you go outside again. Finally, putting decorations around your house is a great thing to do on a stormy day. If one has an indoor farm, they can also farm during storms. Though as monsters (especially creepers) spawn on the outside, going out after the storm is over may be a bit difficult."}

{"id": "27520", "revid": "50021265", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27520", "title": "Tutorials/Time-saving tips", "text": "Minecraft contains a mixture of interesting things to do and routine operations such as resource collection which can get very dull and repetitive. But tastes differ, and different players view different parts of the game as the dull parts. This page collates a wide variety of time-saving tips for all aspects of the game.\nIn-game Tips.\nAutomation.\nAutomating operations is by far the biggest in-game time saver. Mob grinders, item generators, experience farms, automatic smelting system and so on may require significant setup time, but this is soon repaid in the time savings they can provide. These automatic systems have their own tutorials, and so those details are not listed here.\nBeds.\nWhenever you are active above ground (especially when away from your base mapping or otherwise covering long distances), it's worth carrying a bed with you. When it starts getting dark, place the bed and sleep. Skipping the nighttime provides a significant speed-up, and is safer. It also resets your spawn (unless you play on hardcore). Mobs spawned at night are likely to disturb and interrupt you (including killing you!), and you might overlook something important in the dark. You may be worried about mobs attacking if you place the bed outside a shelter, but if you go to bed early enough, the light level will be such that they won't spawn at all, giving you a creeper-free day! You will also not be attacked by any &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt; as you are well-rested.\n\"Warning:\" If you take the bed with you, getting killed during the day will return you to the world's spawn point.\nBlock off Exhausted Mine Sections.\nIt's very easy to get temporarily lost underground, and to waste time wandering into areas of your mine that you have already cleared. By blocking off completed mine sections, you avoid accidentally wandering into them again. Ideally, use glass, fence, or leaves. This allows you to see into the area, and spot any mobs that may appear (indicating either inadequate lighting or possibly a section you have overlooked). In particular, try only using materials not found naturally underground (cobblestone is close to ideal), as you may not be able to tell if the blocked area was blocked off by you or if the apparent barrier is just naturally spawned. You can also use signs to mark off finished areas. Another good idea is to create a unique shape out of the blocks unlikely to generate naturally. In that case, you can use materials found underground.\nBlock off Water Channels.\nWhenever you have &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redstone\"&gt;redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt; close together, and you are at risk of removing the wrong block and starting a flood, protect the redstone by placing doors or other blocks that cannot be &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; at key points. This should interrupt the water flow and prevent it from washing over your circuits. Another alternative is to place one-block deep sinkholes to limit the water's spread. Either method saves time recreating your circuitry in the event of a flood.\nClear Plants and Snow with Water.\nA &lt;a href=\"water%20Bucket\"&gt;water Bucket&lt;/a&gt; is very useful for rapidly clearing snow, grain, mushrooms and some other (mainly plantable) items. Rather than clicking one by one on every block, pour a bucket of water over the area, and the water can clear over a hundred blocks in one operation and can be collected then reused. Beware, though: water also washes away redstone circuits.\nDyes.\nAvoid killing &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; for their wool. You get more wool if you &lt;a href=\"shear\"&gt;shear&lt;/a&gt; them instead. If you're really using a lot of colored wool, you can dye sheep in the colors you use a lot... but keep the others white, for easy stacking and sale of your surplus wool. Instead of keeping a complete rainbow flock and stocks of 16 kinds of wool, just stock the dyes. Then if you sometimes need a \"little\" wool in other colors, you can dye batches manually\u2014all the dyes are fairly easy to get hands on in decent quantity. \nEnchantments.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanted items&lt;/a&gt; provide a variety of benefits over standard ones. While high-level enchantments on anything but diamond and netherite items may not be worth it in terms of longevity/effectiveness, for some of the most valuable enchantments it actually doesn't matter.\nIf for a certain attempt the enchanting table isn't offering &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; III or &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; III (some very powerful enchantments to have around) on a diamond tool, try an iron one and you might have better luck (due to higher &lt;a href=\"Enchantment%20mechanics\"&gt;enchantability&lt;/a&gt;), and you will at least have something that can help you duplicate important blocks/items just as well as diamond. The effort needed to gain level 1\u20135 or so is trivial, and so you might consider even putting low-level enchantments even on your expendable tools.\nEnder Pearls.\nOnce you have collected sufficiently large numbers, &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s are very useful for moving long distances quickly. It's best to combine them with enchanted armor \u2013 particularly boots of &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 or the accumulated fall damage will soon add up and kill you.\nLava Plus Water Makes Stone, Cobblestone and Obsidian.\nLava and water can combine to make infinite &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, or smaller amounts of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from simple generators, this fact can be exploited in several ways:\nPlacing Precise Numbers of Blocks Quickly.\nIf you need to build something of known dimensions, or place exactly some number of an item, adjust the size of the stack in your active slot before you start. This way, you can use the stack itself as a counter that automatically runs out at the desired measurement. For example, if you wanted to mark out a 40\u00d750 rectangular area, fill an active slot with exactly 40 blocks. You can then place them without worrying about counting; once the stack runs out, you know you've placed exactly 40 blocks. In the other direction, fill the active slot with 49 blocks and place them. For lengths larger than 64 meters in one direction, either use stacks of 64 and then one final stack with the remainder, or size your stacks with round numbers of blocks. Use whichever method you find simplest.\nPistons.\nMade a mistake when building something? Do you now have to destroy and replace a large number of blocks? This may be a case where &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s can help. First, put gaps in key places so that no single run of blocks is more than twelve meters long. Then put temporary 'filler' blocks in any remaining gaps. Then place one or more pistons, and use it or them to nudge each section of blocks back into position. This tip is most useful when the initial block placement is complex, such as when drawing pixel art using wool, or for buildings with advanced decorative embellishments, or when using materials that cannot be removed without the silk touch enchantment, such as ice, glass or smooth stone. With care, you can even use this trick to move small buildings.\nPotions.\nOnce you are able to brew them, &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; are an enormous time-saver in many different ways. &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Potions of Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; save you having to wait so long to heal; &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Swiftness\"&gt;Potions of Swiftness&lt;/a&gt; allows you to move long distances rapidly. A splash &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Harming\"&gt;Potion of Harming&lt;/a&gt; allows you to instantly kill large numbers of mobs in a mob trap, making collecting experience much quicker and easier. Depending on the mob, or the design of the mob trap, you may need to use splash &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Poison\"&gt;Potions of Poison&lt;/a&gt; first, to weaken the mobs, and possibly Splash Potions of \"Healing\" if you need to kill undead mobs (and heal yourself at the same time).\nPressure Plates.\n&lt;a href=\"Pressure%20plate\"&gt;Pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s are handy for automatically closing &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s and gates behind you without you having to stop, turn around, and close them manually. You should generally place them on only the 'safe' side of a door or gate, particularly when mining. Word of warning: If you have tamed wolves or ocelots walking around your house, they may step on the pressure plate and open the door, letting hostile mobs walk in. They also then serve to orient you towards the exit or towards unexplored areas, which makes getting into and out of the mine significantly quicker. As a bonus, if you hear a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; trigger, you are warned there's a mob somewhere nearby in a supposedly safe area.\nSigns.\n&lt;a href=\"Sign\"&gt;Sign&lt;/a&gt;s are valuable as in-game reminders of what you were doing in a given location, or for marking areas with warnings of hazards, the non-obvious path to the exit that you habitually overlook, and so on. Use them frequently. They also stop water and lava flow, to help when mining or making mechanisms.\nSnow Harvesting.\nTo harvest large volumes of snow quickly, build a snow golem in a confined space so that it cannot move. Then fill your inventory with stone or even wooden shovels. Click and hold (don't spam-click) at the base of the golem, generating enormous numbers of snowballs. An even faster technique is to first dig another block, then slide your cursor to the snow, resulting in extremely rapid digging. Keep switching to new shovels as they break. Collect the snowballs at intervals, and if you need inventory space, craft them into snow blocks, sixteen at a time. By this method, in one Minecraft day, you can use eight stone shovels to make roughly four stacks of snow blocks or 16 stacks of snowballs. Shovels break very quickly, with the shovel lasting for about as many seconds as its durability divided by 10; so gold shovels break in 3 seconds, stone shovels (the preferred method) break in 13 seconds, iron in 25 seconds, and diamond in about 150 seconds.\nNotes:\nSplit Mines into Sections.\nWhen mining a new area, place barriers at intervals. &lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;Fence&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone%20wall\"&gt;cobblestone wall&lt;/a&gt;s are ideal. This helps stop mobs sneaking up behind you unexpectedly, and allows you to mark sections of your mine as 'safe'. If you encounter a mob in a 'safe' area, it will probably have been stopped short by your fence, preventing it from attacking you, and you now have an indication that an area is insufficiently lit, or that there is an opening you have not discovered. This trick can save a great deal of time in narrowing down where an unexpected mob has come from.\nSprint Everywhere.\nOnce your food supplies are secure, or if you are playing in &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;peaceful&lt;/a&gt; mode, you can speed things up a little by sprinting everywhere. Double-tapping the forward button or using your sprint button (default is ) will cause you to sprint. In harder game modes you should avoid doing this until you have plenty of food available, because it uses a lot more energy than walking does and only gives a slight speed-up. However, if you can sprint while holding the jump button, you can go a lot faster. But be careful, or you will waste hunger by hitting an object above you.\nSugar Cane.\nWhen clearing water out from an area, a common trick is to make a drydock by dropping sand or gravel into the water, thereby displacing it, then digging all of the sand or gravel out again, leaving a dry area surrounded by a curtain wall. In \"sloped\" areas, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; can do the same job as sand or gravel, but because sugarcane can only be placed on blocks which have water adjacent, the older &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; blocks will automatically uproot as soon as they no longer have water next to them. This saves having to dig them out as a separate stage. In deeper water, the occasional column of sugarcane can act as an airlock, making it quick and easy to move outside the dry area and float to the top level of the drydock.\nNotes:\nOut-of-Game Tips.\nExternal Tools.\nThere are many external tools which may help speed up certain types of projects. There are graphics tools to help you make blueprints (such as GIMP, AutoCAD or Google Sketchup), and shape libraries and examples, YouTube videos and more besides. For any big project, look seriously at these options. Tips and examples by other people may save you hours of experimentation or wasted work, and they may help with artistic inspiration too. \"Pencil and graph paper\" are perfectly fine tools to use too, and for some projects they are likely to be the ideal solution.\nPlanning.\nIf the player is doing anything big or complicated, planning ahead can give enormous benefits. The plan can be as simple as a quick mental checklist, or as ambitious as a full-blown blueprint plus materials requirements. You might also hop into creative mode to test out a section of a build (use a new world if you don't want to turn on cheats). Don't over-plan for a simple project, but don't underestimate the benefits of planning properly for an ambitious one.\nUser Interface Tips.\nExploiting the Crafting Grid.\nBy placing the planks in the middle of the grid in step 2, they are already in the right place to generate sticks and form the center part of the gate in step 4, which saves you from having to move them. Not many crafting recipes behave in this way, but whenever you make a lot of an item, if you are able to place the ingredients in just the right way you can save a little bit of time every time you craft it.\nRight-clicking.\nRight-clicking with the mouse selects \"half\" a stack at a time, or can be used to place a single item in a crafting or smelting slot. Using right-clicks wherever possible helps speed up many crafting recipes from steps and slabs to snowballs, because you can split the stacks into roughly equal portions and convert, for example, a stack of 16 snowballs into four snow blocks with just six clicks. Because crafting is such a big part of the game, making good use of the right-click facility is a big time-saver. Right-clicking on an odd stack gives the higher half, but if you want the lower half, right-click again.\nShapeless Recipes.\nFor a few crafting recipes \u2013 such as mushroom stew and item repairs \u2013 the way you place the items in the crafting grid doesn't matter. Knowing these recipes saves a little time every time you make them because you know you don't have to place the items just so.\nDouble-clicking.\nDouble-clicking an item attempts to pick up a full stack of it from the area you double-clicked in, then from other areas if it does not fill the stack. For example, if you double-click on a cobblestone block in your hot bar, it will pull as many as possible from your hotbar, then move on to your inventory, if the stack is not full yet. This is most useful for re-stacking &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s after you have emptied them of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. Just double-click an empty bucket and you will grab 16 of them at once. You can then put the stack back in the hotbar, then double-click one in your inventory.\nDropping Items.\nDropping items from your hotbar while holding down the control key will drop the full stack. This also works while in your inventory; hovering your mouse over an item in your inventory and pressing ctrl+q will drop the whole stack.\nVideo Settings.\nNote: If the lag is network-related rather than a local problem, these changes won't help very much."}
{"id": "6862", "revid": "35661797", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6862", "title": "Tutorials/Tips and tricks", "text": "Here are some little hints for those who are new or would like to learn more tips and tricks about \"Minecraft\". Tips may also be found under the \"Trivia\" section of some pages, and those are likely to be more in-depth.\nControls.\n&lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;Controls&lt;/a&gt; can be fully customized in nearly all versions of \"Minecraft\". By opening settings and navigating to the \"Controls\" option, the player can change their key mappings to whatever they wish. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, touchscreen, keyboard and mouse, or controller may be used to control the game. However, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; only supports keyboard and mouse control. Some additional control related options, such as auto jump, and &lt;a href=\"Sprinting\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; toggle/hold settings can be changed.\nFinding directions.\nWithin the \"Minecraft\" world, a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt; is not how you tell direction! Instead, it always points to a fixed point, the world spawn. However, it can be useful to know which way north is. There are a few ways:\nChanging the rules.\nPeaceful mode.\nIf you are having too much difficulty with hostile mobs, such as a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; or can't find any food to eat, you may be able to set the world &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; to peaceful. When you change to peaceful mode, hunger and health will quickly regenerate, the hunger bar will never decrease, and all hostile &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; will instantly despawn. \nHowever, this is a controversial move -- in a pure survival game, many players will consider it to be cheating, which takes away much of what they see as the challenge and fun of Minecraft, \"especially\" when used as a \"panic button\". That said, it's better than a ragequit, and Minecraft is meant to accommodate many different styles of play.\nWhen the \"point\" of your own game is more about construction or artistic builds than about surviving the monsters, peaceful mode becomes very helpful. It can also be used as a \"training\" mode to learn the game controls and get used to the Minecraft world.\nSingle-player worlds have an option to lock world difficulties and eliminate this option, keeping you \"honest\" in the gameplay; for multi-player worlds, you will not be allowed to change the world's difficulty unless you are the world owner (or at least an \"op\").\nGame rules.\nAnother option for moderating the game difficulty is to alter the &lt;a href=\"Game%20rule\"&gt;game rules&lt;/a&gt; with \"cheat commands\". As with peaceful mode, these are controversial, but in single-player... well, it's your game. On a multi-player server, you probably will not be able to change these rules in any case, unless you are the server owner. See the linked page for full details.\nSince version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt; on Java Edition, and on Bedrock Edition, game rules can be adjusted during the creation of a world, which can allow for a customised experience without having \"Allow Cheats\" on, if you prefer to play with cheats otherwise disabled.\nOpen the world to LAN.\nSometimes you're desperate to cheat, so as to prevent what you all done come into nothing. More specifically, you may want to change the game rule \"after\" the world was created, but you may find you did not allow cheating when creating the world.\nThere is an \"Open to LAN\" option, which allows you to enable cheats, even if you did not toggle \"Allow Cheating\" when creating the world. When cheats are enabled, you can &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Gamemode\"&gt;go into creative mode&lt;/a&gt; and replace lost items, as well as set to true. However, note that this is cheating. Many players believe that it's better to think about their mistakes and start over.\nBe careful if you open the world to LAN because if you click \"esc\", mobs, blocks, and other in-game things can still move, even when you're paused. That means if you're chasing a cow while in LAN and clicked \"esc\" to pause, the cow can still run or move.\nHowever, if you are playing multiplayer and you are not the server owner, you cannot just enable cheats. In that case, you could ask the one that hosts the Multiplayer game to replace the items or create a new world in singleplayer.\nCrafting tips.\nRecent versions of \"Minecraft\" feature a &lt;a href=\"recipe%20book\"&gt;recipe book&lt;/a&gt;, which will supply most of the recipes that can be made with all items you've ever picked up. It can also make it easier to craft as well as remember recipes. That said, it is possible to craft recipes that aren't in the book yet, by remembering their crafting pattern. (They will then be added to the book, along with many recipes using the new item.)\nFor several common wooden tools, there are routines to quickly craft them with an even number of logs, dragging the planks or sticks into place and using shift-click to craft multiple recipes.\nWhen working with the many kinds of stone, a &lt;a href=\"stonecutter\"&gt;stonecutter&lt;/a&gt; is very useful. Not only does it let you make various decorative blocks individually (without needing to craft 3 or 4 blocks at a time), but it makes stone stairs cheaper: The stonecutter can make 1 stair per block, while the crafting table needs 6 blocks to make only 4 stairs.\nLater, you will get hold of &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the important things to make from it is &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick%20fence\"&gt;nether brick fences&lt;/a&gt;. The recipe is a little complex, but can likewise be made in bulk: Smelt your netherrack into &lt;a href=\"Nether%20brick\"&gt;nether brick items&lt;/a&gt;, and take 180 bricks at a time (3 stacks minus 12). Drag these across the crafting table to split them into 9 stacks. Set aside one of the stacks, and combine the other stacks pairwise into the 2x2 &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether brick block&lt;/a&gt; recipe. That gives you the blocks and set-aside bricks for 60 fences. Even if you don't bother setting aside the 12 bricks, this will still work, you'll just be crafting a couple of extra nether brick blocks in the process.\nIf you are struggling to remember &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; patterns, try taking a closer look at a pattern, like the &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; pattern. Take notice of how the &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; line up to look like a fishing rod. Many patterns follow this trait, such as &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, which use two columns of &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt; to make the rectangular shape of a door, and swords, which use either two wooden planks, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s for the blade and a stick for the handle. \nIn single-player, you can also pause the game and visit the wiki for that item for the recipe. \nYou can also save a bit of time by stacking some items to make two or more different items in a pass. The examples below show how to stack items to craft two or three items in quick succession.\n&lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;Smelting&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor smelting, it hardly matters what's being smelted, as long as the furnace type is appropriate. \nLight and darkness.\nLight is a key resource in the game. Besides letting you see effectively, it prevents most monsters from spawning, which effectively makes it the usual way to \"claim\" territory as player-controlled. Initially, you will be getting most of your light from daylight and torches, but later on you'll be able to craft and find more effective or brighter sources of light. Each light source has a \"light level\"; the maximum brightness of that source. The light level of the light source is equal to the brightness value of blocks directly beside the light source, and the light level drops by 1 for each block away from the source in any direction. Overworld monsters will only spawn in complete darkness, or in pre-1.18 versions, light level 7 or less. \nIf you're short on torches, you can calculate the minimum number of torches necessary to keep monsters from spawning. Even if things are a little dim, any space within 13 blocks of a torch in any direction is monster spawn-proof. Additionally, monsters won't spawn within 24 blocks of the player. It's a good idea to light up the perimeter of your base, in order to prevent monsters from spawning around it, making it impossible to sleep or difficult to exit safely. Note that monsters need a \"full block\" to spawn: they won't spawn in midair (except for monsters spawned by a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Spawner\"&gt;Monster Spawner&lt;/a&gt;, a block found in dungeons), or on top of fences, buttons, or other partial blocks. Because of that, making a path or a floor out of slabs recessed into the ground can prevent monsters from spawning on top of it, and can be efficient in terms of material usage. Land monsters also won't spawn in water, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf you use the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the light level of the block you are standing on \u2014 pacing around your base with the debug screen on can help you find potential trouble spots. However, coal and wood are usually accessible on the surface of the Overworld, so basic lighting shouldn't often be a major issue there. It's important to make sure you carry a surplus of the materials to make torches; wood and coal are valuable in crafting and smelting respectively, so the raw materials are good to have on hand for both torches and other uses.\nWhile mining, it may be more difficult to access wood, particularly if you're deep into a cave and running low on supplies and tools. In order to save torches while mining, they can be placed along the floor every 26 blocks, since a torch has a light level of 14, and that spacing will ensure the light level never drops to 0, where mobs will be able to spawn. If F3 is enabled, place the torch when the light level of the block the player is standing on is equal to 2.\nIf you have shelter, wood, and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, but cannot find any &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; to fuel or &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; the environment, you can make a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; and smelt some &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s (not planks). Use the planks for \"fuel,\" and the logs as the material being smelted. 2 planks will be used up for every three logs smelted. These will smelt into &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, which is functionally identical to coal, except that it cannot be packed into &lt;a href=\"coal%20block\"&gt;coal block&lt;/a&gt;s (or sold to villagers). Trees can be grown in places on top of dirt, and at a light level higher than 8 where the sapling is placed, even underground; saplings are commonly dropped from decaying or destroyed leaves, meaning that it's possible to repeatedly farm trees wherever they're planted. They also form the basis for most tools, meaning they're generally good to keep within reach to prevent yourself from running out. \nSpending a lot of time in particularly dim areas has the potential to cause eye strain. To avoid that, change the brightness by going into codice_1 then look for the slider named \"Brightness\". By default, the game has a \"Moody\" brightness setting. Setting it up to a higher level (\"Bright\" is recommended) will make them a bit easier on the eyes. However, particularly dark areas will remain just as dark, and it won't affect monster spawning. It's generally more comfortable to play with the (in-game, and perhaps IRL) lights on, so for all these reasons, it's still important to light things up properly using torches or other light sources.\nBeds and bases.\nBuilding a house.\nFor beginners, the player might want to hollow out the side of a hill or mountain. This can be done quickly and turn into a good shelter, but keep in mind it will be harder to find the home if the player wanders off. The player could place torches around the entrance to draw attention it to avoid this, and mobs can't track any players down by light sources \u2014 zombies can, however, so another idea is to surround the entrance with unnatural blocks or block formations, which draws attention to it without potentially attracting zombies. Wood can be used for this purpose, although most wooden blocks are very flammable, and may be lit by certain mobs or thunderstorms.\nA more durable shelter can be made of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;), or &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; can't be used for anything but strictly temporary shelters since it's easily damaged by explosions. Don't build with or on &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, since they are affected by gravity, which makes them difficult to work with when trying to build underneath them, i.e. making a basement. The most durable block to make a house with is &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, which can't be blown up by anything at all. However, obsidian is very difficult to break \u2014 diamond or netherite tools are the only ones that can break it, and take a frustratingly long time to harvest it. The material isn't versatile at all, since you can't make slabs or stairs out of it, and looks bold and foreboding unlike other materials, if aesthetics are important to your base design.\nThese are some recommendations for later building:\nSet your spawn.\nIf your base is far away from the &lt;a href=\"Spawn\"&gt;spawn point&lt;/a&gt;, and if you have 3 &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, you can make a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. Using the bed will set your spawn point to the bed, and as of version 1.15 this will work even during the daytime (sleeping in the bed will also set your spawn point). However, if the bed is not there (or blocked) when you do die, the spawn point will be lost entirely and you will respawn near the world spawn point. When moving your spawn point within the base, make sure to set your spawn point to the new bed immediately.\nBe careful when decorating around the bed. Some block placements will allow you to sleep in the bed, but will prevent the bed from actually letting you respawn. Never completely surround the bed, even with half-height blocks, such as stone slabs. Also, if you put glass beside your bed, you may not be able to spawn beside it, as players cannot naturally spawn on transparent blocks. If your bed is obstructed and you died somewhere, you will end up near the world spawn point with a message saying that \"Your bed is missing or obstructed\". It's possible to check if your bed is not obstructed by building a copy of your bed and the blocks surrounding it near world spawn, and then jumping on a Pointed Dripstone until death. If all is well, you should respawn on or next to your bed, but if you ended up at world spawn, you can easily get your stuff back and edit the bed until you respawn by your bed. \nYou may need to be able to stand on the bed if you want to set a new spawn point, meaning that the spawn point won't be reset if you sleep in a bed with a block above it.\nField Bases.\nIf you have discovered a structure that could be full of loot, such as a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;, you may be tempted by the riches. However, don't attempt to enter right away, as you may lose any valuables and may not be able to reach them in time. To prevent this from happening, set up a new spawn point at the outskirts of the discovered structure by placing a bed and sleeping in it. Carry a bed at all times when exploring far away from home. This will also let you skip past dangerous nights and storms, rather than fighting or hiding for the duration.\nConsider that when you die, you will respawn \"without\" your items. For this reason, store any valuables of yours in easily-accessible chests before you attempt anything risky. If you died someplace deep underground, you are likely to have monsters between you and the dropped items. If you plan to create a spawn base nearby, that base needs to have enough resources for you to be properly equipped before charging back into the fray. The basic kit for a spawn base should be at least half a stack of iron (or the equipment it makes, sees below), at least half a stack of planks and a quarter-stack of coal, plus bow and arrows, and food. Supplies of other equipment (&lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.) are also helpful. Another technique is to use &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s. This way, you can access resources from your main base. However, for this to work, you need to have another one in your main base, and \"also\" remember to stock it with items. This technique is better for more advanced players who have the necessary resources.\nIf there is not enough to spare to stock the base, then you may be better off respawning at your distant base, \"well out of chunk loading range from the death\". Your items will not disappear in unloaded chunks, so if you want to easily regain your items, move to a few hundred blocks from the death site, and then zip back there as fast as possible before the five-minute timer runs out. As preparation for this, you can mark out your route from the surface to the mine, especially the proper entrances.\nIf you decide on a nearby spawn base, the first priority is safety \u2014 pick an area that is well lit and closed off from dangerous areas, and specially protected from creepers (stone/cobblestone walls, a door, and glassed or fenced windows to view the area in front of the entrance). A small room will do, but there needs to be enough space for a crafting table, a furnace, and at least one double-chest to store supplies (these can be embedded in the floor if needed.) Of course, you also need space for the bed, and free space next to the head of the bed to respawn. There should also be room for an infinite water source, which can be tucked half under a wall.\nWhat you need for the base will be a bed, &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. If there is no wool for the bed, you can use string (plentiful in mineshafts) to make some. The chest should contain at minimum a full set of iron armor, iron sword, a bucket, and either a second bucket, an iron pick, or shears and a flint-and-steel. (By an amazing coincidence, this is exactly what can be made with half a stack of iron ingots.) You should also have a stone pick, shovel, and axe, a bow and at least half a stack of arrows. Pre-craft some tools: another chest's worth, and at least half a stack of torches. Some fences, gates, and ladders, a door, or whatever, may come in handy too. You will need a fair bit of food, at least a quarter-stack of &lt;a href=\"steak\"&gt;steak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"porkchop\"&gt;porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s or more of lesser foods. Just to be careful, stick some spare blocks in there too\u2014a half-stack to a stack apiece of cobblestone, dirt, and gravel, as well as extra wood. (Sand is less useful, but some glass might come in handy.) Having some extra raw materials handy: coal, string, redstone, etc., is always good. If possible, top off the selection with a spare copy of the map, and a clock \u2014 these can be in frames if desired.\nBefore delving into the depths, remember to use that bed to set your spawn point (watch for the message). Just placing it is not enough, remember to sleep in the bed or use it to reset the spawn point there. Now when you die, you will reappear not helpless in the midst of a dangerous cavern, but in a secure base with a full set of supplies to go back, seek revenge, and pick up the items. \nIt's important to remember that sometimes, less is more; if you have too many items and blocks, you can run out of space in your inventory, and you have more items to make space for if you die and have to rush back to get them. It's good practice to leave valuable loot in a secure chest in field bases or in the cave itself for you to come back to. If you have a particularly large haul, you might need to make multiple trips back and forth in order to drop off all of the items; horses or a minecart route can save time in doing that, although you need to make sure you're prepared with weapons and supplies to reduce the chance of getting killed en route.\nZombie-proof door.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombies\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt; can break down &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, if the game &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is set to hard when night falls. Here's a solution that doesn't require the player to craft an &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt; or compromise the base's security. Simply break down the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, then turn so that the player is perpendicular to where the door just was, and place the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;. Get out of the hole the door is occupying, and open it by right-clicking. Now, if the door is placed it the right way, zombies will think that the door is open and avoid it. One can also place any regular block such as &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; in front of the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; to prevent &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; from getting to it. If the block is placed on the outside side of the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; will not be able to &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;. If the block is placed on the inside side of the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; can break down the door, but cannot proceed further inside.\nOne can also place &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; above the door, that way, if the zombie does break the door, it will fall and close the entrance off; or can make a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; ditch after the door, also preventing zombies and other &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s from entering. Make sure that the house is not a flammable substance, or that anything is around the ditch.\nThe simplest solution is to use a &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt; instead of a door, as zombies do not recognize them as doors. One must, however, guard against &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, which will treat fence gates as fences as per priming-time detection range mechanics (creepers will start the countdown even if blocked by fences, as they are in the same space as the fence). The laziest way to protect against &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; intruders is to dig a 1\u00d73 trench in front of the door\u2014to break down doors, zombies must destroy the top half of the door. If zombies are on the door trench, they must jump to attempt to break the top half of the door, which resets the zombie door breaking mechanic. Note that this method only works if the door was installed flush to the outside wall of the dwelling. Also, putting a block underneath the door forces the zombies to jump, break, fall, fail, repeat, exact same mechanic, simply make a 3 high doorway and instead of a door and another block on top, put a block on the bottom and door on the top two block spaces, allowing &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s to still use these doors. \nAnother way is to build a door frame around the door. Then, add a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; to the middle blocks. Zombies will not be able to break down the door.\nSimple trapdoor/fence wall.\nIf you read about &lt;a href=\"Trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;fences&lt;/a&gt;, you will know that mobs cannot jump over open trapdoors and no player or mob can pass over fences without the jump boost effect. You can completely surround your base with trapdoors or fences and open the trapdoors if you do not want to place fence gates. Note that flying mobs, such as &lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;withers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;ghasts&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt;, can still enter your base territory.\nLegitimate Motion Sensor.\nTo detect &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in their tracks, simply surround the house with a ton of &lt;a href=\"plank\"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt;s. The mobs should walk on the planks and make plank sounds, therefore alerting the player of their presence. Then the player can dig down or prepare for battle. The preferable radius is 5 blocks out.\nNote: The volume must be somewhat high for this to be effective.\nAdding &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s underneath it can increase the loudness and allow the player to detect invisible mobs/players by seeing which pressure plates are pressed down, or you can simply add redstone wires and note blocks that connect to the pressure plates to make more sounds.\nMinecart perimeter.\nA trick to defend the base that works best once the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is settled in, and have enough &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; to make at least &lt;a href=\"tracks\"&gt;tracks&lt;/a&gt;, and ideally &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;. The simple version is to just ring the house with rails -- &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; will not walk across &lt;a href=\"track\"&gt;track&lt;/a&gt;s. However, this will not prevent &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s exploding, &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; shooting across the &lt;a href=\"rails\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ing into your base.\nIf you have enough &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"powered%20rails\"&gt;powered rails&lt;/a&gt;, you can craft those plus a few &lt;a href=\"minecarts\"&gt;minecarts&lt;/a&gt;, and set the carts spinning around the perimeter. Any mobs that come close enough to the &lt;a href=\"tracks\"&gt;tracks&lt;/a&gt; will be scooped up by the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; and taken for a ride. This trap can be modified with one-block-high tunnels to suffocate any &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; in the cart. The player can also ride the carts by them - they will travel fast enough that most mobs can't attack them. This, however, takes much more skill to use, and can still trigger &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; explosions.\nEmergency Shelters.\nIf you are stuck outside in the middle of the night with many hostile mobs coming to attack you, you can make an emergency shelter. Ideally, you should dig three blocks down and place a block above you, making a cramped yet safe area to stay in. You should have a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; however; if you wish to avoid being in the dark without a light source. If the monsters aren't already too close, you can even dig out more space to place a bed. You can get out of the hole by &lt;a href=\"pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar jumping&lt;/a&gt; if you do not have any &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s. This method is not terribly thorough, as you are completely exposed to mobs as you leave. \nPillar jumping instead of digging down is another solution. You simply make a pillar directly under yourself; 10 or 12 blocks will put you out of reach of arrows from &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, and out of range from monsters in general, except phantoms. To hold off spiders, however, you will have to build an overhang around the top block of the pillar. Pillar jumping rather than digging down also removes the possibility of digging into a pit of lava or a cave, although it is rare for one of these to generate 3 blocks from the surface. Note that this will backfire horribly if you have not slept in a bed for a few days, as &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt; will easily swarm you and knock you off your pillar. These can be avoided by building out a mini-shelter atop your pillar, just enough that you have a ceiling to stand under.\nAs a last resort, you can simply set the difficulty to peaceful mode, getting rid of all the mobs. (See &lt;a href=\"%23Peaceful%20mode\"&gt;Peaceful mode&lt;/a&gt;.)\nMining.\nAs you can tell from the name of this game, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; is pretty important. Mining is more general than it sounds; it refers to almost any situation where you collect resources after breaking the blocks they consist of. Those blocks fall into four general categories according to their tool: Wood, mined with an axe, dirt-type blocks mined with a shovel, stone-type blocks (including ores) which are mined with a pickaxe, and \"other\" blocks, which are mined with \"bare hands\" or, more quickly, with a hoe. Swords can be used to break cobwebs and bamboo.\nFor most of these, you technically can collect them with bare hands, it will just be slow, sometimes \"very\" slow. Mining with any item besides one of these tools counts as \"bare hands\", and so does mining wood, stone, or dirt type blocks with a hoe. However, stone-type blocks in general absolutely require a pickaxe to get the actual block or mineral that you're looking for, and the pickaxe must also be of sufficient \"&lt;a href=\"Tiers\"&gt;tier&lt;/a&gt;\" for the ore (or mineral block) in question. Common stone and rocks, and coal ore, can be mined with any pickaxe; copper, iron, and lapis lazuli require at least a stone pickaxe; gold, redstone, amethyst and diamond require at least iron, and obsidian or ancient debris/netherite require a diamond pickaxe. If you try to mine any of these without a pickaxe, or with a pickaxe that isn't strong enough, you will \"eventually\" break through the block, but it will drop nothing. This can be useful if you have no tools or wood to make more, and just need to get \"through\" some stone, but it doesn't let you collect resources. For normal business, you will want to always be carrying an axe, a pickaxe, and a shovel, each of sufficient tiers, to quickly deal with blocks of their type. Iron tools are the best balance of rarity and utility, although diamond and netherite tools are good to have in order to mine their corresponding blocks. \nAll these tools have \"durability\", meaning that they can only mine a limited number of blocks. When they run out completely, the tool will break, leaving you bare-handed. The decreasing durability is shown by a little colored bar under the tool (no bar means that the tool is unused, with full durability). In desktop editions of Minecraft, pressing will change the display mode so that their tooltips show the numeric value of the durability. As the game progresses, you will be able to enchant tools to extend their durability and even let them repair themselves as you gain experience. \nUntil then, you will need to make new tools as the old ones wear out. You can also use a crafting grid to &lt;a href=\"Item%20repair\"&gt;combine&lt;/a&gt; two mostly-worn-out tools of the same type and tier -- this combines their durability, with a small bonus for good measure. (Doing this with enchanted tools, however, will remove their enchantment!) When going out to mine, check the durability of your tools before leaving, to make sure you don't unexpectedly get caught without a tool. You can also bring along spare tools or materials (stone or iron, plus wood) to make new tools: you will need a crafting table, but you can make one on the spot from a single log of wood. Stone tools are cheap, and for the early game you should be using mostly those, saving your iron pickaxe for the ores that need it. Once you have plenty of iron, you can start using iron tools for \"everyday\" mining \u2014 they are faster and last longer \u2014 while saving your diamond and/or enchanted tools. Diamond tools will last a long time, but not forever \u2014 don't start using them for ordinary excavation until you have plenty of diamonds. Note that gold tools are weakest of all, and are a waste of gold to craft, at least earlier on; they are very enchantable, however, so once you begin using enchantments later on, they might become more useful.\nLog collecting technique from trees.\nIf you can get to every block of wood on a tree but just can't reach the top block, try leaving the bottom block intact, then jump on it to get the rest. Once done, harvest the bottom. If you still can't reach the top you can \"pillar jump\" up by jumping and placing blocks beneath you (use blocks that are easy to break, like dirt, wood, or stone). Once done, you can mine away from your own blocks, and either break the \"tree stump\" or leave it to mark the tree's natural drops from leaf decay when you come back a bit later. For a \"giant\" tree with a 2x2 trunk, you can mine only some of the wood to make yourself a spiral staircase up to the top of the tree, and then mine those on the way down. Alternatively, you can also turn a few blocks of wood into &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;ladders&lt;/a&gt; to climb right the top of the tree.\nThe leaf blocks are hoe-type blocks; you can break them slowly by hand or quickly with a hoe, but when mining natural trees, they will also (slowly) break on their own \u2014 after you have removed the wood, the leaves will eventually decay. Whether you break them or wait for them to break on their own, they will occasionally drop saplings, sticks, and (for oak and dark oak trees) apples that you can collect.\nCollecting sand or gravel without using a shovel.\nInstead of wasting a shovel's durability by digging piles of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"Concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt;, you can use &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or various other blocks to break entire columns at once. This works with any \"passable\" block, including rails, redstone dust, or even slabs; but torches are almost always handy since they save a mining player's life more than any other tool.\nFor this trick, the player should hold a torch, and use it to break the bottom-most block if a stack then immediately place a torch on the floor of the newly empty space. The column should collapse into a scattering of items. If you placed the torch \"too\" fast, the sand, etc. might not have time to start falling, and the torch will just hold them up -- in this case just break the next block above the torch as well. \nBreaking gravel using this trick will never drop flint, which should be considered by the player depending on the resources they desire.\nAlso, you can dig down underneath it so that the sand or gravel is two blocks from the floor. Dig out the block that is two blocks away from the gravel, then place a torch there. Mine the block above the torch and the sand or gravel will fall on the torch and will drop as items.\nHow it works: The pillar of gravity affected blocks will turn into &lt;a href=\"Falling%20sand\"&gt;falling block entities&lt;/a&gt;, which can land on any full block, but pass through non-solid blocks (much as a player or mob would). If they land in an empty space, they will turn back into a proper block. However, if they land and find there is \"already\" a block in that space, they will instead break as an item.\nMining Stone and ores.\nWhen exploring underground or at night, darkness is a huge issue \u2014 monsters spawn in the dark! Try to keep at least a half-stack (32) &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es on hand at all times, and whenever you drop below that, make another batch from a log and some coal or charcoal. This will let you light up areas as you pass, and torches can also be used to mark your path. See the section on lighting above for more information. Don't forget your &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s, either \u2014 you will be encountering dirt, gravel, and perhaps sand, and a shovel makes clearing these out much quicker (especially for dirt, where the above torch trick won't help). Make sure you bring enough wood, for crafting not just torches, but other useful items like ladders and fence gates. (You can make &lt;a href=\"Wall\"&gt;walls&lt;/a&gt; out of the cobblestone or other rocks you're mining!). \nWhen looking for ores, there are two main techniques: Go into existing caves or ravines and look for exposed ores, which is called \"spelunking\", or dig your way to the desired level (different ores spawn on different levels) and then dig a mine pattern through the rock, which is often called \"strip-mining\". These tend to overlap: on one hand, digging in a straight pattern is likely to run into caves, and on the other, a ravine or cave network can help you get down to the desired level more easily. \nBranch mining.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining\"&gt;Mining Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for detailed tips on digging tunnels, shafts, and mine patterns. Always be wary of lava and caves that you may dig into. Keep a water bucket in your hotbar to quench unexpected lava spills, and keep torches handy for lighting up both your own tunnels and any caves you encounter. \nWhen looking specifically for diamonds, your main target level is Y=-58, due to the relatively high likelihood of diamond ore generation. This is right above the bedrock. \nSpelunking.\nFind a cave, and explore a branch of the cave, placing torches to light it as you go. If the cave branches off while exploring the current branch, go down one of the paths at random, pick one to explore. If the branches seem to go deep, you can craft fences or walls to block off all but one of the paths, so that monsters won't come \"out\" of that area to surprise you from behind. When you come back, you can just pick up your fences to use them somewhere else (or replace one with a fence gate, for more controlled access). If you have jack-o-lanterns, you can use them to point the way back to the exit, or make other markers. (See the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Navigation\"&gt;Navigation&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.) Note ores as you pass, but don't start mining until you've made the area safe, by lighting it up and blocking off unexplored areas. Remember the pickaxe tiers \u2014 if you only have a stone pickaxe, don't try to mine gold or better until you've made an iron pickaxe.\nNote that it is entirely fair to make chests in the field, and use them to stash your accumulation of stone blocks. You can even stash the ores and mob drops that you've found so far, in case of unexpected death. Make sure the chests are clearly visible and lit, so you can find them later. You can also make a furnace in the field, to smelt some iron and upgrade your stone tools (or make some armor) immediately.\nOnce you reach a dead end, you can go back and mine the various ores that you've passed. Leave the torches that you placed, to keep the area lit and prevent monsters from spawning. Then you can go down another branch of the cave, and repeat the above process until the cave is done. If you hear monsters but can't see a path to them, you may be near another cave or ravine \u2014 if you have a sword and some armor, try digging a tunnel in the direction the sounds are coming from... but be prepared for a fight, or a hasty retreat!\nMasses of dirt and especially gravel can hide more sections of a cave complex, and with a shovel (and the torch trick) they can be easier to get through than stone. But be careful about walking on gravel or sand \u2014 it may be unsupported beneath, ready to fall out from under you when you dig or even place a torch. Similarly, if you see \"dust\" drifting down from the ceiling, that means there is unsupported gravel or sand above you. If you can see and reach the edge of the patch, you might want to carefully set it off by digging a block while you're not actually under it. If necessary, you can even drop it onto yourself... \"after\" placing a torch at your feet to break it as it falls.\nLava flows (\"springs\") are mostly an obstacle, as you can see them easily and avoid them. If you can safely reach the source block of a lava spring, you can capture it in a bucket, or just destroy it by placing a block there. You can also try quenching the flow with water, but be careful, sometimes that can make things worse \u2014 try to have the water flowing down from above, to cover as much of the stream as possible. Before you quench or remove a lava flow, remember that it can also block monsters, and it is lighting up the area. After removing it, make sure to light up any areas that are now left dark, and explore newly-accessible parts of the cave.\nWater flows can help you reach higher areas, but they can also carry monsters to you from those same areas. If they lead up into dark areas, it's usually a good idea to treat them as a cave branch, swimming up them to light the area. Also be careful that they don't carry \"you\" into lava or other danger.\nRavine mining.\n&lt;a href=\"Ravines\"&gt;Ravines&lt;/a&gt; are deep cuts into the world, often exposing ores such as &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;. They can open onto the surface, or appear deeper within a cave network. They are certainly a quick way to get deeper to reach more advanced ores, but be careful: If you just jump in, you will at least take fall damage, and may well die of it! There are a number of ways to get down more safely:\nFarming techniques.\nPassive mobs will spawn very seldom after they have been killed, which means that meat will eventually run short if the player keeps killing animals without breeding them. The same is true for plants. A solution to this is to make farms. The general rule in Minecraft, not just for food but for a variety of other resources, is that a small investment in time and/or resources can get a modest supply, but a larger investment (usually a larger or more automated farm) can get a much more generous supply. Once you have surplus crops, you can also sell them to villagers to earn emeralds.\nWheat, carrots, potatoes, beets..\nMost players will start a &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; farm first, because &lt;a href=\"wheat%20seeds\"&gt;wheat seeds&lt;/a&gt; are one of the first items you can find (from breaking tall grass). Note that all methods for wheat will work identically for the other crops, except that carrots and potatoes don't have separate seeds \u2014 you just re-plant the the vegetables (but unlike wheat and beets, you can get more than one of them when you harvest).\nBesides seeds, players will need dirt/grass, a hoe, light, and water. One source block of water will hydrate farmland \"four blocks in every direction, including diagonally\". Therefore, the most effective (using a small area) wheat farm is 9\u00d79 with a source block in the middle. You'll want fences around it to keep out wandering mobs, that will make it 11x11. Again, that one source block extends to all tilled soil in the 9\u00d79 areas. That area yields 80 wheat after fully grown. This not only saves water sources but also gives more room to grow crops for less water. Putting a slab in the water block will let you walk over it without risk of trampling the crop.\nWhen starting out, you can speed up wheat or other crop growth by planting in alternate rows, with empty farmland or a different crop between. However, once you've gotten to the point where you \"can\" plant a whole field in one crop, the speed isn't really worth the trouble of mixed crop, as it's easier to use a water bucket to harvest the whole field at once, and it's quickest to replant the field in a single crop.\nAfter building your first basic plot for wheat, you can just stack more farms above it, every three blocks, for your other crops. The lighting block for each layer can hold up the water for the next. A half-dozen layers will let you grow all six basic crops (including pumpkin and melon), and harvest whichever crop you want at the moment.\nVillagers can be used to automate breaking and replacing of the crops \u2014 see the tutorial linked above for more details.\nPumpkin/Melon farms.\nPlayers will likely find &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s first, and these are far more useful: &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s provide &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, which are valuable for marking a path and the direction home, and can provide light underwater. Pumpkins can also be used for &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt;, and later to create &lt;a href=\"golems\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt;. A carved pumpkin can also be worn on the player's head to avoid offending &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;. Melons are a small-change food and eventually used for brewing. In any case, the two crops grow almost identically. They do use farmland, so the same 9\u00d79 plot with a water block works well, but instead of planting the whole field, you plant (almost) half the squares, which will grow into vines. You will leave the vines and harvest the fruit that grows next to it. See the tutorial above for advice on how to arrange the fields. Both pumpkins and melons make good crops for sale to villagers. Once you've been to the Nether, observers and other redstone gadgetry will let you automate pumpkin and melon farming.\nSugar cane farms.\nOnce past the initial stage when players eat any food they can, without bothering with extra preparations, and are ready to craft some more complex items, players may want to start &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; farming in order to craft &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"paper\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;: sugar being a key component of &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt;, and some potions, and paper being required to craft &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s. \nSugar cane can be placed underwater, where it provides an air bubble. This trick can be helpful when building underwater structures.\n&lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to automate sugar cane farms.\nFishing.\nOnce you have a couple of pieces of string for a fishing rod, fishing becomes a very useful source of food, experience, and even treasure. Note that fish are in infinite supply, while passive mobs respawn only rarely. Fish, while they do not replenish a lot of hunger, can be much easier to obtain compared to other foods. Here is also a chance to fish up treasure such as saddles and enchanted bows and fishing rods. See &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nYou will eventually catch enchanted fishing rods, and once you get into enchanting you can even create your own. Caught rods will have little durability, but can be saved to combine (at an anvil) as below. Any rod with Mending will tend to repair itself with use instead of wearing out, especially if it also has Unbreaking. Fishing rods do have a \"perfect\" enchantment setup, and it's straightforward to create: Once you make a \"god rod\" with Mending, Unbreaking III, Lure III, and Luck of the Sea III, it will last forever and provide a steady stream of experience, food, and treasure.\nAnimal farming.\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Ranching\"&gt;Ranching&lt;/a&gt;, or animal farming, usually refers to breeding animals so that there can be an infinite supply of meat and other passive mob drops. Simply right-click an animal with their \"desired\" food to breed, and then right-click the same animal with that same food (see \"&lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;Breeding&lt;/a&gt;\" for more) To make a simple animal farm, simply make an enclosure with &lt;a href=\"fences\"&gt;fences&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt; to access the farm. Then, lead at least 2 of the animal into the corral and start breeding them. A carpet atop a fence post can also make an entrance which you can easily jump onto, but the animals (or monsters, for that matter) will not recognize it as passable. Having a crop farm nearby will help supply food for breeding. \nChickens are easiest to start with, as you can \"breed\" them by breaking their eggs inside the corral, as well as by feeding them any kind of seed. Cows and sheep will need to wait until you have wheat to breed them, and pigs will need one of the root vegetables (carrot, potato, or beets). You may even be able to raise rabbits (they eat carrots or dandelions) but you will need high fences or a deep pit to keep them from jumping out and escaping. More advanced farms can simplify the business: even a basic cow-crusher can practically industrialize your beef supply, and variously automated chicken farms can produce batches or streams of cooked or raw meat and feathers. Sheep are usually farmed for their wool, and that can likewise be automated.\nGetting rid of extra food.\nEven basic farms will rapidly produce a lot of food, to the point of oversupply. Once you've got a chestful of cooked meat, you're pretty much set \u2014 only a few exotic foods can even compete. In general, it's worth saving some extra oversupply \u2014 remember, chests are cheap. However, at some point it will be time to just stop slaughtering animals or harvesting crops at a given farm until you actually need more to cut off the oversupply. Automatic farms can be turned off, or excess crops routed to an auto-composter to make &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. In multiplayer, one player with a farm can support others if he/she has enough food. Crops can often be fed to animals, and crops and meat can both be sold to villagers to get emeralds(see the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Villager%20trading%20hall\"&gt;Trading Hall&lt;/a&gt; tutorial). Note that food is generally sold to villagers \"uncooked\", so don't cook everything up front unless you will eat it in the future.\nStuck in the Nether.\nIt is common knowledge that the player should always have a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; in the inventory in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, just in case. Building a cobblestone house around your portal will also protect it from ghasts and prevent Nether mobs from wandering through. Always remember the coordinates of the portal so you can find your way back! \nIf a player is stuck in the Nether without a flint and steel or a fire source, there are still ways to relight the Nether portal. \nItem storage.\nIn general, \"Minecraft\" rewards pack-ratting \u2014 you never know when you might need those stacks of dirt for terraforming, or cobblestone to build a mob farm or something. Most of the items in the game have at least some use, if only as compost. At some point, you'll want to set up some kind of central storage in your base, classically a \"chest room\". You'll want to label those chests \u2014 item frames can be useful, but remember that having too many of them in one place can produce serious lag and slow down the game. Some surprising items are sellable to villagers, and every little bit helps \u2014 stashing even your rotten flesh instead of destroying it can net you a few extra emeralds down the line. Some items, like phantom membranes, become more important later in the game.\nOnce you have picked up some spare blaze rods, you can make an &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; to store items and get at them from elsewhere. You will need a second ender chest to take with you, and a Silk Touch pickaxe to pick it up after using it. If you don't have Silk Touch, you can at least install ender chests at your main bases.\nLate in the game, you can craft &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20Box\"&gt;shulker boxes&lt;/a&gt; to store extra items: they function as mini-chests that can be carried inside of your own inventory like pockets. These shulker boxes can then be stored inside an ender chest. Color code the shulker boxes to create an organized inventory. This basically gives you an extremely large backpack that keeps your items after death. Note that the shulker boxes are only safe if they're actually in the ender chest (or \"somewhere\" safe) when you die because they can still \"despawn\" like any other dropped item!\nThat said, eventually you'll start having an accumulation of useless items lying around. Low-tier tools can be merged in repairs, used up for minor tasks, or left as backups in field chests. Iron and gold tools (and armor) can be smelted into nuggets. Wooden scraps can be used for furnace fuel. Although diamond or netherite tools/weapons/armor cannot be smelted or burned as fuel, it can be used until it breaks since the items have a good durability anyways.\nA \"minor task\" is similar to mining stone during a mining operation, which can be mined using any pickaxe, even as simple as a wooden pickaxe. For example, by bringing several weak pickaxes and your best pickaxe on a mining operation, you can use the weaker pickaxes to mine stone instead of wasting durability on your best pickaxe before you find diamonds or a better ore and using your best pickaxe to mine it. It's important to note that pickaxes are made to be used, though; if you need to mine quickly, then it's not the end of the world if you use your best pickaxe to hollow out a small hole or a tunnel in a pinch.\nMany players dispose of unwanted items by dropping them into fire pits, lava, and cacti to destroy the items. But by doing so they risk accidentally dropping something valuable and losing it forever, like a diamond pickaxe. So rather than destroying the items, a smarter method of getting rid of items is to drop them into a hole with a trapdoor over it, eventually the items will despawn. By doing this you can easily recover items that you accidentally drop; plus you can't pick up items through closed trapdoors so you don't have to worry about accidentally picking up unwanted items.\nBucket jumping.\nTo ascend a cliff, an alternative to ladders or pillar jumping is to use a &lt;a href=\"Water%20Bucket\"&gt;bucket of water&lt;/a&gt; to place water as high as possible, then swim to the top of the waterfall, put the water back into the bucket, and quickly place a new waterfall at an even higher point. By repeating this process, a player can reach the top of the cliff. If the waterfall is left there, it can be used to travel back and forth.\nThe player can also jump off a high point and dump the bucket of water onto the ground before they touch the ground so they can land safely in the water, although this is a famously very risky and difficult technique to pull off even once. Only do it if you have faith in your abilities, or if you'll be able to recover your stuff if something goes wrong.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava%20Bucket\"&gt;Buckets of lava&lt;/a&gt; can also do the second trick if the player has &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; potions, but it might be harder if the fall distance is too short or a lot of flammable structures or blocks are nearby. A good way is to drink a 3-minute fire resistance potion before jumping. This trick is good for the nether since water dries immediately when placed and the nether is filled with lots of high ledges and ridges. You might not want to use lava to do this near your base.\nAscending and descending.\nOftentimes when you are on your adventure, you need to either go up or go down a significant height, usually a high cliff or overhang. Following is a few methods that can be used to traverse vertically.\nVideo.\nIf you still want more tips into survival, check out these videos.

It is extremely helpful when attempting to get rid of other people that might be a threat to someone on a server. There are many methods of tracking in \"MInecraft\". One common method is to use a map to locate other players, then go to them and hunt them down. In gamemodes such as Minecraft Manhunt, the hunter is given a compass to use to follow to track down the closest speedrunner. Another very sneaky way is to find someone who is shifting underground without a map is to utilize the list of Minecraft players and their faces."}

Check out these tutorials to set up your village or villager trading hall.\nBenefits of villager trading.\nVillager trading has many advantages. It allows you to:\nNotes.\nBefore you proceed, here are some things you'll have to do:\nFor a villager to offer useful items, you must level it up by trading. The ideal trades to do this are listed below, but as a rule of thumb, selling items for Emeralds increases a villager's experience more than buying items, and later trades offer more experience.\nThe items that villagers offer are random. If you get offers you don't want, you should either break and replace the job site block if you haven't traded with the villager yet, or you need a way to efficiently kill off villagers without lowering popularity. The best way to do this is by digging a 1x1 hole that is 3 blocks deep, and then use either lava or enough gravel or sand to kill them. You can also use magma blocks, campfires, and flint &amp; steel to do the same thing. You can use zombies and husks to kill them, but they can be used for zombie discounts.\nUses of each profession.\nArmorer.\nThis profession is a must, as it allows you to obtain chain and diamond &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; easily. In addition, you can buy &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s if you plan on starting a new village. The best way to level it up is using &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;. Iron is not too hard to get in large quantities after a large mining session, and it offers decent XP. &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;s are too hard to obtain in large quantities to be ideal. In \"Java Edition\", one villager is enough to provide a full set of diamond armor, while in Bedrock Edition, at least two villagers are needed.\nArmorers are also the only reliable source of renewable diamond armor, as the only other way is to kill extremely rare &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn with diamond armor. The diamond armor is enchanted upon purchase, but can be easily disenchanted using &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; if the player wishes to add better enchantments.\nButcher.\nThis profession does not sell anything other than food. However, it is useful to sell raw meat if the player has an efficient animal farm. &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s can be farmed fully automatically, meaning &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Porkchop\"&gt;raw porkchops&lt;/a&gt; can be sold to butchers in large quantities. &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Berries\"&gt;Sweet berries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dried%20Kelp%20Block\"&gt;dried kelp block&lt;/a&gt;s can also be easily farmed and sold to obtain emeralds.\nButchers can provide a good source of cooked food. &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Porkchop\"&gt;Cooked Porkchop&lt;/a&gt; is the most nutritious. \nCartographer.\nThe main reason to have a cartographer is to obtain &lt;a href=\"Explorer%20Map\"&gt;explorer map&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;woodland mansions&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to unique &lt;a href=\"Banner%20Pattern\"&gt;banner patterns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Paper\"&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient to level it up, but if you have lots of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Pane\"&gt;glass panes&lt;/a&gt; work fine, too. Once you have purchased the maps, the villager is still relatively useful, as paper can be continuously sold to it, as long as the player's &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; farm productivity is high enough.\nCleric.\nThis profession is mainly useful for purchasing &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Bottle%20o%27%20Enchanting\"&gt;bottles o' enchanting&lt;/a&gt; to raise your &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; level, or as a portable experience storage. In addition, it allows you to trade away &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; that has probably been either accumulating in your chests or thrown out. It is a little hard to level up, as aside from the flesh, it buys hard to obtain items, but this profession is still useful nonetheless. They are also one of the only renewable sources of &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, but a 1:1 ratio of exchange makes it highly expensive. \nFarmer.\nThe main use of this profession is to obtain emeralds by trading away crops, as well as buying &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Glistering%20Melon%20Slice\"&gt;glistering melon slice&lt;/a&gt;s without having to craft them using gold. It is recommended to sell &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, as these grow fast and are easy to mass farm. However, level them up with the &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt; trade, as it gives twice as much experience to the villager than the pumpkin trade.\nThe golden carrots obtained from these villagers can serve as a staple &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; for the player, thanks to their high nutritional value. The player can also buy &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s relatively easily from them, so they do not need to craft the cakes manually, or chop down hundreds of oak trees for apples.\nFisherman.\nOne of the less useful professions, it is really only useful for selling fish that you obtain from fishing sessions or from an AFK Fish Farm. While it buys &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, it asks for relatively high quantities, and you can sell these items to other professions. Level them up with the fish trades.\nA few advantages about fishermen still exist: First, they have the cheapest coal trade compared to other coal-trading professions (10:1 instead of 15:1), so it can be useful if the player has a lot of coal from mining or killing &lt;a href=\"Wither%20Skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Buckets of cod can be obtained, so you don't have to go mining for &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;. Second, all four types of fish they buy can be farmed in large quantities, with &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Fish%20%28item%29\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pufferfish%20%28item%29\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; having the better deals among the four. Third, they buy one boat for one emerald, a reasonably good deal. The boat trade is cheaper compared to the Fletcher's sticks to emerald trade in terms of wood planks (5:1 instead of 16:1), so you don't have to chop a lot of trees. You only need 15 logs to get 12 emeralds compared to 64 logs for 16 emeralds.\nNothing useful or unique can be bought from fishermen; the offers can all be easily obtained by other means.\nFletcher.\nThis profession is useful in obtaining emeralds, as they buy &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s, which are easy to get. In addition, if you do not have &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; on your &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, you can buy lots of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s for a relatively cheap price. If you max them out, you can get hard-to-obtain tipped arrows, as well. Furthermore, if your fletcher sells arrows of &lt;a href=\"weakness\"&gt;weakness&lt;/a&gt;, you can mass-zombify and cure villagers without having to go to the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; or hunt igloo basements for weakness. If you want them, level the villager up with sticks or buy a bunch of bows/crossbows unless you can afford the other trades.\nIf you encounter a village or an &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; with basement in early game, one of the most beneficial things you can do is to convert a villager to a fletcher, sell it sticks, and buy bow and arrows from it. this allows you to perform ranged attacks frequently, without the worry of running out of arrows. To achieve the same results, you either have to meticulously set up a &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt; farm, get really lucky to find a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;, or wait until you can get Infinity on your bow.\nLeatherworker.\nThis profession is really only useful for obtaining &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;s, since leather armor is weak, and the player is likely going to keep most of their leather for themselves. It is recommended to level it up with leather unless you can afford the later trades. However, since saddles are not stackable, and the player does not usually need a large quantity of saddles, It can be argued whether this profession is really worth it. \nLibrarian.\nThis is one of the most important professions late-game, as it allows you to obtain almost every enchantment, including &lt;a href=\"treasure%20enchantment\"&gt;treasure enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Sneak\"&gt;Swift Sneak&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, it buys &lt;a href=\"paper\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Ink%20Sac\"&gt;ink sacs&lt;/a&gt;, all of which farmable, giving a good source of emeralds. This allows you to get perfect enchanted gear, although it requires a lot of XP to add the enchantments on an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, it takes a while before you get the enchantment you need for each villager. There is no need to level them up unless you need &lt;a href=\"Name%20Tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;s, in which case level them up with the latest available trade.\nStone mason.\nThis villager is useful for obtaining emeralds, as you can trade it &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; (not cobblestone) and clay, especially if you have a stone generator and a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe or if you have a clay farm or a lush cave nearby. Otherwise, you can sell them &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Quartz\"&gt;Nether Quartz&lt;/a&gt;, extra &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt; that you picked up from a mining session, or buy &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Quartz\"&gt;quartz blocks&lt;/a&gt; for a large build. Level them up with the stone trade unless you have a lot of the stone variant to trade away. In Bedrock Edition, you need three masons to trade away each type of stone.\nMasons also offer a renewable source of &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Glazed%20Terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt;. In version 1.17, they also sell &lt;a href=\"Dripstone%20Block\"&gt;dripstone block&lt;/a&gt;s, which are pretty hard to find or farm.\nShepherd.\nThis profession does not sell anything valuable, but it can buy &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s as a good source of emeralds. There is no need to level it up. The player can have automatic wool farms and flower farms to allow for trading with shepherds.\nToolsmith.\nThis profession is also a must, since you can obtain diamond tools and &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, if you plan on using a diamond &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;, try to get a villager that sells you one, too. Like the armorer, level it up using &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaponsmith.\nThis profession is important because you can obtain diamond &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s and diamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s easily, in addition to bells. Level it up with iron, as well.\nHow to exploit villagers.\nZombifying and curing.\nIf you zombify a villager and cure it, preferably multiple times, you can reduce the prices and make the trades easier to do. If you cure the villager enough times, you can make all the trades cost one emerald or one item. This table shows the # of times you need to cure the villager to max out all the trades (1 emerald or 1 item). Works for both Java and Bedrock.\nCrazy villager exploits.\nThis video is in Bedrock edition, but most of it works in Java edition. The first part describes a bug in zombie villagers, which is Bedrock Edition only. Skip to 4:28 for the actual villager exploits that work for both editions.\nBelow are a few broken villager trade loops."}

This tutorial lists multiple designs of train stations.\nThe rail part.\nIt might be a good idea to go over a few things about the rail first:\nPutting it together.\nThe following flat-ground design, from left to right, has the following features:\nCompact Auto Minecart Station.\nThe above video is a slight variation that of the first design, that uses &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; instead along with pistons is available and does not rely on any glitches, thus is considered to be safe for use in the latest versions of Minecraft (1.6+). When the player arrives in a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;, the minecart gets broken by the lava and collected by the &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s while the player is pushed out of the exit using a glass block connected to a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;. While slightly more &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; intensive than Sethbling's design (which was exceptionally simple), it does not have any problems associated with it and is thus recommended for anyone playing in 1.6+. If you are playing in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.5.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.5.2&lt;/a&gt; or below (and not planning on updating), Sethbling's design is definitely better.\nHere's a tutorial on how to build this design:\nAnother variation made by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//youtube.com/nmoleo64\"&gt;nmoleo64&lt;/a&gt; uses a &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt; wired to a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; with the command codice_1 to remove the minecart.\nAutomated Single-Car People Mover Stop.\nThe following video is a good example of a small station:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDirection changing:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThese designs are more complex and not as annoying. It is possible to minimize the number of &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s used. Also, this can be implemented on any server, it doesn't require weeks of experimenting. This is recommended for beginners.\nAutomated Single-Cart Two-way Small Station (Tripwire).\nThe &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt; toggles the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; between 2 different routes, the cart either moves in circles, awaiting a passenger. When a passenger is present, the tripwire will activate and the cart will move in another route away from the station.\nMajor Multi-Car Train Station.\n\"Note: This design requires lots of materials, so it is not recommended for a survival world that has been recently started. The design also uses a lot of redstone.\"\nHere is how to make a working train station and powered rail system. It is most useful in multiplayer.\nYou will need the following materials to build this station:\nNote: all of these amounts may vary on the size of the station.\nStation Construction.\nThe construction of the station is one of the most important parts. Firstly, determine the size and structure of your station. You can have a massive central terminal with many platforms and on top, have ferry piers and light rail and etc. or a simple humble station with a 5-car light rail. For the test experiment, the platform only fits 3 passenger cars. You can include luggage cars in front or at the back, but to build the platform, you need a large open area. Also, determine whether your platform is a side platform or an island platform. A side platform serves only one track while an island platform serves two tracks.\nPlatform.\nNow, start the boarding area. The track below the platform will ALL be powered rails. You should include extra powered rails beyond the platform for luggage cars. Before the platform, have another set of powered rails(not connected to platform track). Make a station box across from the platform with levers controlling both sets of &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s, and place a station attendant here. Before the non-platform set of powered rails, have a room set into the side so another attendant can push the carts in an emergency.\nTicket Machines, Booths, and Turnstiles.\nAt a ticket booth, have a person behind a glass screen with a 1\u00d71 hole, with the stated price and destination above the hole. For a ticket turnstile, have a series of &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt;s separated by walls with holes in the bottom. Below the holes, have pits that open out into a room. Below each pit, have a wooden &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; connected to the door (preferably under) with a person standing next to it to collect the ticket. The ticket can be anything. \nAnother idea is to have a separate room with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; connecting the iron door in the waiting room. In the staff room, there can be a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; which when pressed will open the door. Finally, have controlled &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; flowing through a 1 block high gap which flows into the staff room (be careful of redstone.) Now, patrons can drop \"tickets\" into the water and when it reaches the staff, they can open the door.\nA new idea is a machine reading your ticket. Have a hole, then a water shaft. 2 blocks in, put hopper and a dropper below that. And put some space further on. Put a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; next to the &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;. Then, put 64x9 of your \"money\" in the dropper. Put 22 \"coins\" in the hopper. Then, put two redstone next to it and a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt; after that. Wire this up to an &lt;a href=\"logic%20gates\"&gt;AND gate&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20clock\"&gt;redstone clock&lt;/a&gt;. Wire this up to the dropper and another wire to a dropper, which has all your tickets in.\nWhen you put your money in it goes inside the hopper. This makes the comparator go one more block which powers the rest of circuit. You need an AND gate and a clock to make a pulse. The pulse makes the dropper lose one thing so it reverts to its one block. This makes it resettable. It will power the dropper to give you a ticket. If you have any wrong ones it will not go in the hopper and disappear after a while. Make the money from the first dropper go into a hopper chain to a chest.\nThis is quite advanced so only attempt if good with redstone.\nProfits.\nIf well made, ticket fees will give a considerable profit on multiplayer, possibly giving you enough resources to build a massive subway network similar to the , taking vast amounts of people to various places.\nIt is also possible to do a huge rail network with smaller, stops. Instead of using up many pickaxes while making stations, a simple single-cart network can be used.\nRemember, building a structure this large will require a lot of time and effort, not to mention the resources. When building an underground network, you will find that sealing off &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s becomes an additional problem. It is therefore wise to start building once you have gotten experience with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; circuits.\nHopper Ticket System.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s, all the tickets (or other fees) thrown into the ticket machine could be pushed with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; into a hopper on top of a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, giving the owner the tickets back (or extra money, even)!\nEnhancements.\nIf your train station gets really big, you can add some of the following features:\nPlatform screen doors.\n screen the platform from &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. They are found in rapid transit systems like the WolvHaven Metro made by Silver Wolv and the New WolvHaven Blocky Electric Rapid Transit (BERT) made by Axton, the Kasukano Train Railway built by members of Watersuno, and the Nazca Railway built by Nazca Wilde.\nAutomatic platform gates.\nAutomatic platform gates (or half-height platform screen doors) are one-block sliding doors at the edge of railway platforms to prevent passengers from falling off the platform edge onto the railway tracks. \nReferences.\n1. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//youtube.com/nmoleo64\"&gt;youtube.com/nmoleo64&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n2. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//nmoleosoftware.com\"&gt;nmoleosoftware.com&lt;/a&gt;"}

Floors and roofs are made out of purpur. Sometimes, structures are connected to a bridge only, and floating in the air. For End City structures with multiple stories, floors that are higher up are usually bigger than floors that are on the bottom. This can be done by making roofs 2 blocks bigger than the room below it. The edges of roofs have alternating patterns of purpur stairs that are upright and upside-down. End Rods can be placed on the corners of roofs for light.\nBridges are made of one row of sideways purpur pillars on the bottom, followed by the 5-block wide pathway, and finally the walls on the side, made purpur blocks and stairs facing inwards. Stairs on bridges can be made using the same architecture as shown earlier, except with slabs or stairs.\nTransportation.\nThe original End City already provides bridges as a means of transportation, but as you expand the City, you will need to add more modes of transport. Here are some ideas.\nMinecart system.\nThere are several ways to incorporate minecarts into your End City build, including above, below, and beside bridges.\n\"Teleportation gates\".\n\"Note: This requires command blocks, which are unobtainable in survival mode without cheats.\"\nFor these \"gates\" you can create pathways like bridges that end abruptly with a pressure plate in the middle. Underneath the pressure plate place a command block with the following command:\nSubstitute &lt;target coordinates&gt; with the target coordinates to teleport to (make sure it's not on top of another teleportation pressure plate). [rotation] is an optional parameter to add to make the player facing the entrance to the place it teleports to. To prevent &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; from stepping on it and accidentally teleporting players, make the ceiling on top of the pressure plate two blocks tall (as endermen are three blocks tall and will not fit).\nBuildings/rooms.\nStorage room.\nStorage rooms can serve as mere decorations, or as functional storage rooms for a survival base. For an End-like aesthetic, use ender chests or shulker boxes for storage.\nInhabitants.\n\"Note: Using endermen or shulkers as inhabitants may not be favorable in survival mode.\"\nVillagers.\nYou can transport villagers to the End City and use them as inhabitants to the City, allowing you to trade with the villagers.\nEndermen.\nAlthough they serve no useful purpose, they can join the End City simply to be there (as \"decorations\").\nShulkers.\nIn multiplayer survival servers, shulkers can stand guard to your base to prevent other players from coming in.
