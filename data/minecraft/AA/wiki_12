These can be changed when creating a world, in the &lt;a href=\"settings\"&gt;settings&lt;/a&gt;, as well as with the command.\nWhile the difficulty settings modify the challenge in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, they also affect hostile mobs in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode the same as in Survival; for example:\n&lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode is affected by difficulty as described in the sections below. \nPeaceful.\nNo &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Hostile%20mobs\"&gt;hostile mobs&lt;/a&gt; can spawn naturally, except for &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Llama\"&gt;Llama&lt;/a&gt;s are the only mob that are able to do damage in this difficulty. No &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Neutral%20mobs\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; rather than hostile mobs \u2013 can spawn naturally. When any of these mobs attempt to spawn (whether naturally, through &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;), they are removed from the game instantaneously. When the difficulty is switched from any other setting to Peaceful, all mobs that are not allowed to spawn on Peaceful are removed from the world. Players regain &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; rapidly over time. Despite this, it is still possible to &lt;a href=\"Health%23Death\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt; if damage is received quickly enough. &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; deals no direct damage to the player, but it does give knockback still, meaning a player can be killed by it if it launches them too far upward. The &lt;a href=\"hunger%20bar\"&gt;hunger bar&lt;/a&gt; never depletes; , players therefore cannot eat anything except &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Honey%20Bottle\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;, unless the player switched to Peaceful when their hunger bar was below the maximum. Players can eat normally . Additionally, if the hunger bar is below the maximum, it regenerates quickly.\n&lt;a href=\"End%20portal\"&gt;End portal&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be activated by the player in Peaceful difficulty, because it is impossible to acquire the twelve &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt; necessary to activate an end portal by killing endermen. However, it is possible for an end portal to be activated by naturally generating with an eye of ender already embedded within all 12 end portal frames. For any given end portal, there is only a 1 in a trillion chance of this happening.\nHowever, because of the huge number of possible seeds, over 8 million seeds are known to generate such end portals.\nAlso, not all advancements / achievements can be completed in Peaceful difficulty.\nEasy.\nHostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s spawn, but they deal of the damage they would on Normal difficulty plus . The hunger bar can deplete, damaging the player until remain if it drains completely. &lt;a href=\"Cave%20spider\"&gt;Cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s cannot poison players on Easy difficulty, and the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; does not cause the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither effect&lt;/a&gt;, although &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s do. &lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; sets only the struck block on fire, not surrounding blocks. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s do not break down doors, and do not turn &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; don't wear full sets of armor. Hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s deal about or damage.\nNormal.\nHostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s spawn and deal standard damage, about or . The hunger bar can deplete, damaging the player until remains if it drains completely. Zombies do not break down doors, but villagers killed by zombies have a 50% chance of turning into zombie villagers. Zombies and skeletons rarely wear sets of enchanted armor. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s can break doors.\nHard.\nHostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s deal approximately 1 times the damage they would deal on Normal difficulty, and in some cases drop higher-value items when killed. The hunger bar can deplete, not only damaging but also killing the player if it drains completely. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s can break through wooden &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s and can spawn when attacked. Spiders can spawn with a beneficial status effect (&lt;a href=\"speed\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"regeneration\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;), with these effects having a nearly infinite duration . Villagers killed by zombies always turn into zombie villagers. &lt;a href=\"Pillager\"&gt;Pillager&lt;/a&gt;s spawn near the player, with their attacks dealing damage. , if the world type is infinite, they deal damage.\nHardcore mode.\n, at the world creation screen, selecting Hardcore from among the &lt;a href=\"game%20mode\"&gt;game mode&lt;/a&gt; options causes the player to spawn in Hard difficulty, does not allow it to be changed, and allows the player only one life. In a single player world, a player who dies can choose to respawn in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode or return to the title screen. In multiplayer, upon death, the player's game mode is automatically set to &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nThe only way to change the difficulty of Hardcore is to use the \"Open to LAN\" feature in the pause menu to enable commands, or to use an .NBT editor on the world's .NBT file.\nThis difficulty is currently not available in &lt;a href=\"Realms\"&gt;Realms&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoon phase.\nThe phase of the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; has effects on the spawning of &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; biomes, and contributes to the calculation of regional difficulty. The fuller the moon is, the greater the effect.\nThe moon does not actually have to be in the sky for this effect to take place, since the moon exists in daytime and across &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRegional difficulty.\nRegional difficulty or local difficulty is a value between 0.00 and 6.75 that the game calculates by considering not just the world difficulty setting, but also the \"inhabited time\" of a &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;, the \"total daytime\" in the world, and the phase of the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;. This value is shown on the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; as the \"first\" value listed after the heading \"Local Difficulty\". This value determines several aspects of the difficulty of gameplay (see &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20effects\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe \"inhabited time\" of a chunk increases for each tick a player spends with the chunk loaded. This is a cumulative measure of time\u2014if 50 players spend a single hour in a chunk, it counts the same as if one player spent 50 hours there. The effect of inhabited time on regional difficulty is capped at 50 hours.\nThe \"total daytime\" in the world is the value from added to the \"Day\" on the F3 debug screen converted to ticks, i.e. codice_1. This is \"not\" the same as the actual playtime in the world (the value from ). It affects the regional difficulty after the first 3 in-game days, and has no additional effect after 63 in-game days.\nIn pseudocode, the calculation of regional difficulty is:\n # DaytimeFactor, ChunkFactor, and RegionalDifficulty are floating-point variables\n # MoonPhase is as in the table above.\n if (difficulty is Peaceful) return 0\n if (TotalDaytime &gt; 63 in-game days) DaytimeFactor = 0.25\n else if (TotalDaytime &lt; 3 in-game days) DaytimeFactor = 0 \n else DaytimeFactor = (TotalDaytimeInTicks \u2212 72,000) / 5,760,000\n if (ChunkInhabitedTime &gt; 50 hours) ChunkFactor = 1\n else ChunkFactor = ChunkInhabitedTimeInTicks / 3,600,000\n if (difficulty is Normal or Easy) multiply ChunkFactor by 0.75\n if (MoonPhase \u00f7 4 &gt; DaytimeFactor) add DaytimeFactor to ChunkFactor\n else add (MoonPhase \u00f7 4) to ChunkFactor\n if (difficulty is Easy) multiply ChunkFactor by 0.5\n RegionalDifficulty = 0.75 + DaytimeFactor + ChunkFactor\n if (difficulty is Normal) multiply RegionalDifficulty by 2\n if (difficulty is Hard) multiply RegionalDifficulty by 3\n return RegionalDifficulty\nThe raw regional difficulty therefore is always 0.0 on Peaceful and ranges from 0.75 to 1.5 on Easy, 1.5 to 4.0 on Normal, and 2.25 to 6.75 on Hard.\nClamped regional difficulty.\nThe clamped regional difficulty (also known as special multiplier) also is a value between 0.00 and 1.00 based on regional difficulty. This value is shown on the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; as the \"second\" value listed after the heading \"Local Difficulty\". This is yet \"another\" value that affects the difficulty of gameplay (see &lt;a href=\"%23Other%20effects\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe regional difficulty value is clamped as follows:\n if (RegionalDifficulty &lt; 2.0) value = 0.0;\n else if (RegionalDifficulty &gt; 4.0) value = 1.0;\n else value = (RegionalDifficulty \u2212 2.0) / 2.0;\nThus, on Easy, where regional difficulty is never higher than 1.5, the clamped value is always zero.\nOn Normal, the effects reach the maximum after in a fully-inhabited chunk on a full moon; and on Hard after 63 in-game days the effects reach the maximum in chunks inhabited hours during a full moon and remain at maximum in chunks inhabited over hours."}

They are used in many places in \"Minecraft\". &lt;a href=\"/Block%20IDs\"&gt;Block IDs&lt;/a&gt; are used to define blocks placed in the world and inventory items (including items in chests and items dropped in the world). &lt;a href=\"/Item%20IDs\"&gt;Item IDs&lt;/a&gt; are only valid for items. There are also &lt;a href=\"/Entity%20IDs\"&gt;Entity IDs&lt;/a&gt; for entities such as mobs and projectiles. &lt;a href=\"%23Data\"&gt;Block data&lt;/a&gt; further defines blocks placed, describing for example the height of water or the direction a torch points.\nIDs.\n&lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt; Variants.\nHorse entities have variant fields that determine the markings on the horse. Below is a list of Variant values that determine the variant of horses.\nVariant names taken from the names of the texture file they correspond to.\nSummoning a horse entity without specifying the Variant value, or using a Variant value that is not a true ID (all true IDs are displayed on the chart above), will result in a white horse.\nEnchantment IDs.\nUsed in commands such as , and .\n&lt;a href=\"Status%20effect\"&gt;Status effect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsed in command.\nData.\nUp to 4 bits of special data are used for certain block and item types. Blocks that need more than 4 bits of data beyond the block ID use a &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; or are split into two blocks. Storage differs according to level format.\n&lt;a href=\"Sapling\"&gt;Sapling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe data value is split in half. The bottom three bits determine the type of sapling (and thus the eventual tree type), according to the following table:\nThe 0x8 bit functions as the counter. The counter is cleared when a sapling is dropped as an item.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf bit 0x8 is set, this liquid is \"falling\" and only spreads downward. At this level, the lower bits are essentially ignored, since this block is then at its highest fluid level.\nThe lower three bits are the fluid block's level. 0x0 is the highest fluid level (not necessarily filling the block - this depends on the neighboring fluid blocks above each upper corner of the block). Data values increase as the fluid level of the block drops: 0x1 is next highest, 0x2 lower, on through 0x7, the lowest fluid level. Along a line on a flat plane, water drops one level per meter from the source, lava drops one in the nether and two everywhere else.\nThe stationary versions of each fluid are \"stable\" and currently not being checked by the engine for further level changes. Oddly the in-code names for stationary water and lava are \"water\" and \"lava\" and the regular versions are \"flowing_water\" and \"flowing_lava\".\n&lt;a href=\"Wood\"&gt;Wood&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlock 17\nBlock 162\n&lt;a href=\"Leaves\"&gt;Leaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf bit 0x4 is set, the leaves are permanent and will never decay. This bit is set on player-placed leaf blocks and overrides the meaning of bit 0x8.\nIf bit 0x8 is set, the leaves will be checked for decay. The bit will be cleared after the check if the leaves do not decay. The bit will be set again whenever a block adjacent to the leaves is changed.\nBlock 18\nBlock 161\n&lt;a href=\"Wool\"&gt;Wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stained%20Glass\"&gt;stained Glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese values specify the color of the wool, stained terracotta, stained glass and carpet. This data is stored in block metadata for placed wool, stained clay, stained glass or carpet, and as the \"damage\" for the item in the inventory.\n&lt;a href=\"Slab\"&gt;Slab&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSingle slabs can be either \"right-side-up\" or \"upside-down\"; this information is stored in the most significant metadata bit 0x8 as follows:\nThus a right-side-up birch wood slab has metadata value 0x2 (binary codice_1), while an upside-down birch slab is represented by metadata 0xA (binary codice_2).\nDouble slabs with the high-order bit set render the top texture on all six sides.\nThe wooden slab in the stone slabs has the properties of stone, and the texture of oak wood planks. They are unavailable in game and can only be obtained through commands.\nDouble Stone Slabs.\nThe full stone, quartz, sandstone, and red sandstone Slabs have a top texture on all sides.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;.\n0x0 is a placed or spread fire. Once it reaches 0xF the eternal fire-trick will work since there will be no further updates of the block.\n&lt;a href=\"Sandstone\"&gt;Sandstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor normal sandstone the bottom has a cracked pattern. The other types of sandstone have bottom faces\nsame as the tops.\n&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe top bit (0x8) is a status bit that determines whether the piston is pushed out or not. 1 for pushed out, 0 for retracted.\nThe bottom three bits are a value from 0 to 5, indicating the direction of the piston \"(the direction the piston head is pointing)\"\n&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston Extension&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe top bit (0x8) is a status bit that determines whether the head is sticky or not (note that the Piston Body actually has completely different block types for Sticky and Regular). 1 is sticky, 0 is regular.\nThe bottom three bits are a value from 0 to 5, indicating the direction of the piston \"(the direction the piston head is pointing)\".\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Crop%20farming\"&gt;Crops&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrops grow from values 0 to 7. Carrots, beetroot and potatoes appear to have 4 stages, but actually grow identically to wheat, merely using the same texture for multiple stages.\n&lt;a href=\"Door\"&gt;Door&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinecraft 1.1 and Earlier.\nThe two least significant bits are the orientation of the door, that is, the corner in which its hinge is positioned:\nThe two bits above are flags:\nFor example, the bottom half of a door with its hinge on the south-west corner, which is swung so that it is closed when viewed from the west, will have a data value of (3 | 4) = (3 + 4) = 7.\nStarting at Minecraft 1.2 (from weekly snapshot 12w06a).\nThe total data needed to accurately describe a single door tile is now contained in both door tiles, so both data values have to be inspected.\nCommon to both door tiles, the top bit (0x8) is as follows:\nTop Sections\nBottom Sections\n&lt;a href=\"Jukebox\"&gt;Jukebox&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe associated &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Tile%20entity%20format\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; is used to identify which record has been inserted.\n&lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Repeater\"&gt;Redstone Repeater&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffectively, add the repeater's facing value (0 to 3) to 4\u00d7(delay-1). For example, a repeater facing west with a delay of 3 redstone ticks would have a block data value of 3 + 4\u00d7(3-1) = 11.\n&lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Comparator\"&gt;Redstone Comparator&lt;/a&gt;.\nA redstone comparator's block data specifies its orientation, mode, and powered status.\n&lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Block\"&gt;Brown and red mushroom blocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nMushroom blocks consist of the same blocks throughout their structure, the data value of each block decides the texture. The default texture on all sides is porous flesh. The cap texture can be either the brown mushroom or red mushroom texture, the textures for porous and stem sides are identical. Although data values 11-13 are unused they have the same texture as data value 0 as placeholders (to keep people from destroying their maps).\n&lt;a href=\"Vines\"&gt;Vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nDetermines the face against which the vine is anchored. Note that (except for Top) these are testable as bit flags, unlike most of the other directional data for other block types. Multiple sides can contain vines. The \"top\" attachment is assumed to be present if data is 0 or there is solid block above.\n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart\"&gt;Nether Wart&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike Crops, the data value is related to the size of the Nether Wart. There are three distinct visual stages to Nether Wart's growth (the associated data values are given):\n&lt;a href=\"Brewing%20Stand\"&gt;Brewing Stand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bottom three bits are bit flags for which bottle slots actually contain bottles.\n&lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe data value stores the amount of water kept in the cauldron, in units of glass bottles that can be filled.\n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20Portal\"&gt;Nether Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNether portals created in version 1.6.4 and earlier automatically determined their orientation based on neighboring blocks. When version 13w37a added the ability to create larger portals, they started using data values to keep track of their orientation, and old portals with a data value of 0 would randomly close when upgrading to 1.7.\n&lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%20Frame\"&gt;End Portal Frame&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bottom two bits determine which \"side\" of the whole portal frame this block is a part of. To make the frame activate, each of the portal frame blocks in the pattern must \"face\" toward the middle. Since the image is near-symmetrical, it is difficult to tell which direction an individual block is actually facing, but if the block isn't facing in that direction and that is the last frame block where the Eye of Ender is placed, the frame won't activate.\nDirection vectors for the blocks are the following:\n0x4 is a bit flag: 0 is an \"empty\" frame block, 1 is a block with an &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ender\"&gt;Eye of Ender&lt;/a&gt; inserted.\n&lt;a href=\"Flower%20Pot\"&gt;Flower Pot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFor Flower Pot blocks placed from Minecraft version 1.7 on, the plant contained in the pot is stored in the associated Tile Entity. See &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Tile%20Entity%20Format\"&gt;Tile Entity Format&lt;/a&gt; for details. The absence of a tile entity indicates either an empty Flower Pot, or one whose block was placed prior to version 1.7.\nFor Flower Pot blocks placed before version 1.7 the plant contained in the pot is indicated by the data value, according to the following table:\n&lt;a href=\"Mob%20head\"&gt;Head&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFor the block, data values determine the block placement:\nFor the item and for the tile entity, data values determine the skull type:\n&lt;a href=\"Fish\"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth raw and cooked fish use the same data values. Note that clownfish and pufferfish cannot be cooked.\n&lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnvil data values differ between the item and block.\nItem\nBlock\nFor an anvil in the world, 0x1 is the bit that determines whether the anvil is orientated in a north-south (0) or a west-east (1) direction. 0x4 and 0x8 are bits which determine whether the anvil is a regular (0x4\u00a0&amp;\u00a00x8\u00a0=\u00a00), a slightly damaged (0x4\u00a0=\u00a01) or a very damaged (0x8\u00a0=\u00a01) one.\nFor an anvil in the inventory, the data value is a counter of how damaged it is.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt; filled with a potion. Potion type is stored in item's damage value as a 16-bit number. Potion effect, name, and other flags are encoded on bits. Effect duration itself isn't there, but can be calculated from other values.\nCurrent meaning of bits is described below. Note that potion name overlaps with potion effect and tier.\nTo calculate damage value of potion with desired effect use the following formula:\n DV = potion_effect + tier_bit + extended_bit + splash_bit\nfor example:\nTo get potion with certain name, use the following formula:\n DV = potion_name + extended_bit + splash_bit\nfor example:\n\"Potion name\" bits.\nNote: potion with \"name\" set to 0 is called \"Water Bottle\" only if no other bit is set. Otherwise, it is called \"Mundane Potion\".\nNote: potions with an effect and \"splash potion\" bit set have additional \"Splash \" prefix.\n\"Tier\" bit.\nNote: Fire Resistance, Weakness and Slowness effects have no second tier. Their strength and duration are unaffected by this bit.\n&lt;a href=\"Map\"&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEach map item's damage value corresponds to the &lt;a href=\"Map%20item%20format\"&gt;map ID&lt;/a&gt; saved in each world's &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT data&lt;/a&gt;. The map's parameters, such as the scale of the map, its location in the world and what areas are explored are saved in separate .dat files, unlike &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s which store their additional data directly into the item itself. If a map is cloned they will both share the same damage value and newly explored areas will appear on both instances.\n&lt;a href=\"Chorus%20Flower\"&gt;Chorus Flower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe data value denotes its age, it will not grow anymore when data value is 0x5.

This also allows for easy vertical item transportation.\nBubble Columns.\n\"For more detailed information see &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column\"&gt;Bubble Column&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Magma\"&gt;Magma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; now make bubble columns when placed underwater. Magma naturally generates in &lt;a href=\"underwater%20ruins\"&gt;underwater ruins&lt;/a&gt; and where underwater ravines meet lava, while soul sand does not currently generate naturally in oceans. Players are able to breathe while in bubble columns.\nMagma bubble columns pull things down to the bottom; this includes items, players, mobs, and boats. Soul sand bubble columns rapidly push all entities, including players, to the surface.\nBreath.\nThe breath meter no longer instantly refills when entering air from underwater; this means it is no longer possible to instantly refill the air meter with a torch while underwater.\nVision.\nWater has been given unique colors depending on the biome they are in. \nWater is also now clearer, and the longer the player is underwater the clearer it becomes."}

{"id": "118145", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=118145", "title": "Java Edition hard limits", "text": "This page documents historical hard limits of mainly earlier versions of \"Java Edition\". These are defined as boundaries which exist due to the game's code and data types, as opposed to limits which have been implemented intentionally (see &lt;a href=\"World%20boundary\"&gt;World boundary&lt;/a&gt;) or effects due to precision loss (see &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20distance%20effects\"&gt;Java Edition distance effects&lt;/a&gt;).\nCurrent limits.\nHorizontal limits.\nPrecision loss errors (X/Z: \u00b12).\nThere has been a large variety of precision loss errors throughout the game's history. There are generally very few in modern versions, although more can be found in earlier versions. These can be loosely defined as hard limits due to being limitations of the floating-point data type itself. However, due to their variety, they are not included here.\nDouble-precision floating point precision loss issues also run rampant at excessive distances.\nThe End generation breakdown (X/Z: \u00b1370,727).\n&lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;'s generation is completely absent in repeating concentric rings centered on the world. This is due to an integer overflow, causing a square root to be taken from a negative number. Since this integer overflow happens based on the \"squared\" distance (creating very high values rapidly), multiple overflows happen within a reachable distance, creating rings of void and landscape which get thinner the further away they are from the origin. The first ring of void starts at 370,727 blocks away from the center and ends at 524,288 blocks away from the center, where terrain continues generating until the next integer overflow occurs. Interestingly, all the rings (whether they are void or land) approximately cover the same area.\nLighting breakdown (X/Z: \u00b133,554,432).\nDue to the lighting being controlled by precision-losing 32-bit float, all light ceases beyond 2 blocks. All blocks appear completely black and are unaffected by sky and block light (light-emitting blocks may create a local area of light in its block space, but this cannot extend). As a result, hostile mob spawning is extremely common and &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn naturally. It is effectively mandatory to use the night vision effect to facilitate any reasonable exploration beyond this point.\nWhen teleporting to far distances, it is possible to find regions of full light. These will cause dark regions when blocks are updated.\nVillage generation limit (X/Z: \u00b11,073,741,824).\nBeyond this point, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s seem to stop generating correctly anymore. The only part which generates is the very center, sometimes with accompanying villagers - every other part is missing.\nIt has been sighted in some superflat worlds that strange phantom villages composed solely of block light can generate.\nThe reasoning for this happening remains unknown and it is not known if this is tied to jigsaw blocks.\n32-bit limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b12,147,483,647).\nA hard limit exists at X/Z: \u00b12,147,483,647\u2014the mathematical limit of a signed 32-bit integer\u2014and attempting to travel or load chunks beyond here simply causes the game to crash. 147 blocks beyond this point and the world renderer stops working and you can get stuck. All fast graphic clouds are stretched. It is advisable to set the world border to at least several hundred blocks before this limit and make sure not to teleport past this.\n64-bit limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b19,223,372,036,854,775,807).\nThe very last hard limit exists at X/Z: &gt;\u00b19,223,372,036,854,775,807 blocks\u2014the mathematical limit of a signed 64-bit integer value\u2014and attempting to travel or load chunks beyond here simply causes the game to crash.\nVertical limits.\nLighting breakdown (Y: \u00b1129 - \u00b12,048).\nThe player's skin, and an item in a player's arm starts rendering incorrectly, resulting in no lighting at all.\nAll lighting will stop working at 2,048 blocks. The effects may be slightly different in this case however, as full light has been noticed at negative coordinates.\nAbsolute limit (Y: \u00b12^1024).\nThe maximum possible &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;height&lt;/a&gt; is &gt;\u00b11.797693134862315907729305190789\u00d710308 (21024), the limit where mathematics break down in the game's code. In attempting to teleport beyond this limit, the game interprets the number as infinity and refuses to carry out the teleportation.\nThe reason why going this high is not restricted by the 32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit, etc is because chunks do not load past 320 blocks which means that there is nothing to render.\nHistorical limits.\nHorizontal limits.\nChunk spawn glitch (X/Z: \u00b1524,288\u2013X/Z: \u00b12,146,959,360).\nFrom Beta 1.6 Test Build 3 to Beta 1.7.3 inclusive, if the player moves to 524,288 on one or both axes, the player can allow the chunk they originally spawned in to re-appear. These chunks repeat every 2\u00b9\u2079 blocks on both the cardinal and diagonals. once the player reaches X/Z: 32,505,856, trees and entities can reappear past X/Z 32,000,000, even though vegetation and entities are not supposed to generate out this far because of the block limit at X/Z: 32,000,000. However, because of the block render limit at X/Z: 2,147,483,519, the maximum distance that trees and entities can spawn at is X/Z: 2,146,959,360. If the player does happen to generate natural terrain beyond X/Z: 32,000,000, then any trees or other entities that spawn begin to decay but the image remains frozen in place. For example: a flower generated in the fake chunks drops the flower item as if it has decayed, but the flower still appears in place, unable to be removed. It does this infinitely and causes countless entities to begin spawning, causing lag spikes.\nItem entity render limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b167,108,864).\nBeyond this point in some versions, &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; stop rendering entirely and dropping an item will make it stop rendering beyond this point.\nThird person view limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b1268,435,456).\nBeyond this point in some versions, third person view will always place the camera directly inside the player's head regardless of the presence of any potentially obstructing blocks.\n32-bit limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b12,147,483,647).\nAt X/Z: \u00b12,147,483,647, blocks are no longer rendered, giving way to an empty sky. At X/Z: \u00b12,147,483,794 (maximum 32-bit integer), the game is likely to crash, or the player gets stuck. However, chunks still generate along with clouds. Fast graphics clouds are however insanely stretched. It is very dangerous to reach X/Z \u00b14,294,967,296 or higher, as the chances of crashing (assuming the player has 64-bit Java) are extremely high and get higher the further the player goes.\nCloud render limit (X/Z: \u00b125,769,803,000\u2013\u00b125,769,804,000).\nBetween X/Z: \u00b125,769,803,000 and X/Z: \u00b125,769,804,000, fancy clouds stop rendering (Varies between maps). Fast graphic clouds, however, can stop rendering or either become glitched stripe lines which also can dissappear afterwards. Beyond this point, only the sky, sun, moon and void remain. The reason why this occurs is because a \"cloud pixel\" is a 12x12 block section. Dividing the two aforementioned numbers by 12 returns 2,147,483,583.33 and 2,147,483,666.67, respectively.\nChunk overflow limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b134,359,738,368).\nIf someone makes it to X/Z: \u00b134,359,738,368 (235), away from spawn, chunks will start \"looping\". While made completely unobservable due to blocks also being 32-bit integers, exceeding this limit should cause chunks from the exact opposite overflow point to begin loading. Doubling distance again will put the player in the equivalent position to (0,0), and once more will appear at the overflow point once more. As a result, this is the end of \"Minecraft\". \nAs soon as this limit is approached, the game freezes and crashes presumably due to the 32-bit block coordinate limit, resulting in an Out of memory screen. However, in some cases, the player may be able to move past this limit for a few seconds before \"Minecraft\" crashes. A chunk is 16 \u00d7 16 blocks, and 34,359,738,368 = 2,147,483,648 \u00d7 16, so the chunk coordinates are 32-bit integers as well. If you were 160ish blocks away, you would crash and the game will remain unresponsive until you force quit.\nPlayer Movement limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b12,251,799,813,685,248).\nIf the player manages to surpass the Chunk overflow limit, then as they travel outwards, their movement will begin to lose precision in a similar way to Minecraft Bedrock Edition beyond 2^22. Beyond blocks 251 away, it is no longer possible for the player to move along the axis they are traveling using normal walking speed.\n64-bit integer limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b19,223,372,036,854,775,807).\nThe highest signed value for 64-bit machines is X/Z \u00b19,223,372,036,854,775,807. However, it may not be possible (through in-game methods) to go near this point, since the vast majority of people experience instant client freeze, followed by the client crashing.\n64-bit chunk overflow limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b1147,573,952,589,676,412,928).\nIf chunks are patched to use 64-bit integers, then the farthest that you would be able to travel without crashing is roughly 147.573 quintillion blocks, or 267 blocks out. However, due to the player position itself losing precision at this point, the actual limit is likely closer. \n128-bit Indev limit (X/Z: &gt;340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456).\nThe position of the player can be modified with an NBT editor in Indev, and the maximum distance that can be achieved using this method is X/Z: 2128, or roughly 340 undecillion. If the player teleports to said coordinates in the version of Indev that pushes the player back into the map, the player is pushed from X/Z: 2128 to X/Z: 2,147,483,648 in about 5 minutes. As the player is pushed back, the sun and moon begin to render back in. When the player reaches X/Z 2,147,483,648, the game crashes,\n64-bit floating point limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b11.797693134862315907729305190789\u00d710).\nOn August 1, 2018, a YouTube user named \"Aura Gunner\" made a video showing the player teleporting to 1.797693134862315907729305190789 x 10^308 (past 21024) on the X-axis. Because 1.797693134862315907729305190789 x 10^308 is the maximum 64-bit floating-point integer, it caused the player's X coordinate to roll over to read \"Infinity\". It is impossible to go further since this is the physical limit at which Java can render, and the game always crashes at this distance.\nVertical limits.\n(Y: &lt;\u22122,147,483,647).\nIn Beta 1.7.3, as the player falls below Y=\u22122,147,483,647, the darkness of being in the void disappears. Instead of darkness, the void now looks like an empty world. It has a sky, a sun, and a moon, and they are all visible depending on the time of day. Despite this, the player still receives damage from the void.\n(Y: &lt;&amp;plus;2,147,483,647).\nIn Beta 1.7.3, as it rains when the player fly's up to the coordinates Y=&amp;plus;2,147,483,647, the snow disappears. Instead of snow being there, the sky now looks like an empty world. It has the, sun, moon, and they are all visible depending on the time of day.\n(Y: &gt;+22,502) and (Y: &lt;-30,722).\nwhen snow was added coordinates Y=22,502+ when it snows, there is a lighting bug with the snow this is because lighting system is based on a combination of block light and sky light. Block light is emitted by certain light sources or generated by other blocks, while sky light is determined by the time of day and the presence of sky visibility it does not have to be snowing it applies with the character.\nAt extreme coordinate values or distances far from the world spawn point, the rendering engine may encounter limitations in its ability to calculate and propagate lighting correctly. It's possible that the lighting calculations become way less accurate or consistent, leading to graphical glitches or anomalies like the axis Y=22,502 with snow rendering, it stops at the coordinates, Y=24,618.\nuntil you reach the 32 bit integer limit where snow does not exist but you can still see your avatar having this bug even over the 32 bit integer limit. this glitch goes on forever. if you set the time to midnight the yellow tint observed at night. in darkness it is really black in the dark areas at midnight and in light areas are fine and snow in light does not have a effect of turning yellow even though in the dark areas. if a lighting bolt spawns right in front of you can see it's light. this also happens in the sky so it does not have to be on you the light bug also happens on other particles too.\nall this also happens in the void too just it is not snowing and it just happens at -30,722 instead and also it ends -32,703 this still is a problem today."}

Although, no date has been given, both are promised to be updated in a future update:\nThe &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biome rework is the last remaining biome rework from the &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Live%202019\"&gt;MINECON Live 2019&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Live%202019%23Biome%20vote\"&gt;biome vote&lt;/a&gt;, as the winning mountains rework was implemented in Java Edition 1.18, and the swamp rework was part of Java Edition 1.19. The badlands are promised to be updated in an unspecified future update:\nOther live votes did not promise that the losing options would be planned; for information on those features, see the \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20mentioned%20features%23Mentioned\"&gt;Mentioned&lt;/a&gt;\" section.\nSuper Fancy graphics.\nDocm77 confirmed in a tweet that sometime in the future, a new graphics setting will be added to Minecraft called \"super fancy\". It is unknown whether it is the \"Fabulous!\" graphics setting added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16%20Pre-release%201\"&gt;1.16 Pre-release 1&lt;/a&gt; or another new one. The use of OpenGL 3.2 for rendering in 1.17 may lead toward the Super Fancy graphics. This could also be a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Tracing\"&gt;Ray Tracing&lt;/a&gt; functionality in Minecraft &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; or the scrapped &lt;a href=\"Super%20Duper%20Graphics%20Pack\"&gt;Super Duper Graphics Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhasing out of NBT-based crafting recipes.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt;, numerous new blocks were implemented as replacements for certain \"complex\" crafting recipes, with the replaced crafting recipes relying on NBT data. This included moving inventory tool repair to the &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, banner modification to the &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt;, and map modification to the &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;. However, several more NBT based crafting recipes still exist, and these are planned to be phased out. Certain blocks that may be added in the future to further this goal include a dedicated fireworks customization block.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14.3\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14.3&lt;/a&gt;, tool repair crafting recipes were reimplemented.\nFull split of liquids from blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; added &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogging&lt;/a&gt;, marking the start of the separation between liquids and blocks. An in-development screenshot showing water occupying &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, referred to as having \"no water blocks\", was released in 2018. However, water and lava still currently exist as blocks, and so far only water sources can occupy other blocks through the waterlogged block state; flowing water and bubble columns cannot occupy other blocks, and both still and flowing lava cannot occupy other blocks at all.\nHaving water only occupy one side of a block like a &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;, but not the other, is also something that has been considered.\nShaders.\nOn the feedback site, shaders (resource packs that override the vanilla shaders) were marked as announced, meaning that they were going to be implemented. This feature was partially implemented in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.17\"&gt;1.17&lt;/a&gt;, as resource packs can enable similar effects.\nFarming nerf.\nSomewhere in 1.16, developers stated that certain changes would be made to functionality exploited in several farms. In particular:\nThe sculk mechanics introduced in 1.19 may be intended as a replacement.\nDelayed or scrapped.\nThese features were initially promised to be implemented in a specific update, but were later postponed and have not currently been made part of another update.\nFletching table functionality.\n &lt;a href=\"Fletching%20table\"&gt;Fletching table&lt;/a&gt;s are set to gain functionality in a later update, similar to what happened with &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20table\"&gt;Smithing table&lt;/a&gt;s (originally added as a generic villager job site block and then received player functionality in a future update). Originally, this was planned for \"the next major themed update\". Later, it was stated that functionality wasn't a guarantee for &lt;a href=\"1.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt;. Later, it was confirmed that Fletching tables wouldn\u2019t be gaining functionality in 1.16. To this day, they still have no functionality beyond serving as the workplace block for fletcher villagers.\nBundle.\n Originally announced for the &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; update, development of this item was delayed for a future version. &lt;a href=\"Bundle\"&gt;Bundle&lt;/a&gt;s are a storage item that can be used for managing items inside the player's inventory, and allow for combination of multiple item types within single inventory slots. As of 1.20.2, they are still obtainable by enabling the \u201cBundle\u201d &lt;a href=\"experiments\"&gt;experimental toggle&lt;/a&gt; when creating a new world.\nFirefly.\n Fireflies were originally going to be eaten by &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s to produce &lt;a href=\"froglight\"&gt;froglight&lt;/a&gt;s, but this was scrapped due to the fact that some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of frogs in real life. They would have glowed in the dark and been two pixels in size, which would have made them the smallest mob in the game. It was officially confirmed that they were scrapped for the 1.19 update in an Ask Mojang episode.\nUpdates to birch forests and other biomes.\n In &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202021\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2021&lt;/a&gt;, it was stated that &lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Update\"&gt;The Wild Update&lt;/a&gt; would focus on biome diversity and immersion, giving a unique identity and atmosphere to different biomes. The &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt; was used as an example to demonstrate this new atmosphere, and concept art pieces depicting an improved birch forest with new flowers, shelf fungi, tree branches and fallen logs were shown. Later it was stated that \"concept art is not a commitment\" and that this part of the update was now \"not something we have continued working with\" in an Ask Mojang episode.\nPartially implemented.\nThese features had been shown by a Mojang staff member, but had no further development or were canceled shortly after. \nBlaze3D.\nA new Java Edition rendering pipeline called Blaze3D has been confirmed many times by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Stoyke\"&gt;Searge&lt;/a&gt;. There are also many references to this system in the game files, although it has not yet been fully implemented.\nColored Wood Planks.\n &lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; briefly thought about implementing colored wood planks, releasing a test image on his Twitter page. This however never got implemented, as can be seen from the following quotes. The idea was eventually replaced with colored &lt;a href=\"Terracotta\"&gt;Terracotta&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater updates have since then introduced new wood sets resembling some of the dyed plank colors, with &lt;a href=\"The%20Update%20that%20Changed%20the%20World\"&gt;The Update that Changed the World&lt;/a&gt; adding orange and brown planks in the form of acacia and dark oak wood, the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Update\"&gt;Nether Update&lt;/a&gt; adding magenta and cyan planks in the form of crimson and warped wood, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Update\"&gt;The Wild Update&lt;/a&gt; adding red planks in the form of mangrove wood, and &lt;a href=\"Trails%20%26amp%3B%20Tales\"&gt;Trails &amp; Tales&lt;/a&gt; adding yellow and pink planks in the form of bamboo and cherry wood.\nSculk Jaw.\n This block was seen at &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202020\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2020&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dark\"&gt;Deep Dark&lt;/a&gt; announcement. Walking on it would change its texture, and it is presumed that it would do damage to the player and that it could be broken with the &lt;a href=\"Hoe\"&gt;Hoe&lt;/a&gt; like with other Sculk Blocks.\nThe block was presumed to be added in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Update\"&gt;The Wild Update&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"kingbdogz\"&gt;kingbdogz&lt;/a&gt; revealed that it was unlikely to be added in the final release. In the end, it was not added.\nDirt slab.\n Before &lt;a href=\"stone%20slab\"&gt;stone slab&lt;/a&gt;s were added to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.26%20SURVIVAL%20TEST\"&gt;0.26&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; ran a test of dirt slabs.\nIn the original &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; announcement, an item called the &lt;a href=\"brush\"&gt;brush&lt;/a&gt; was showcased, which appeared to be able to lower the height of certain blocks. However, it has been confirmed that this was only a special breaking animation, and couldn't be used to physically make slabs. The showcased animation has since been changed, and it now only applies to &lt;a href=\"Suspicious_Block\"&gt;suspicious blocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nSky Dimension.\nThe Sky Dimension was a planned dimension, intended to be the opposite of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. It could be accessed using third-party programs, but portals to the Sky Dimension were never implemented. The idea was ultimately scrapped and its code was reused to make &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, which can be seen in versions prior to &lt;a href=\"14w17a\"&gt;14w17a&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"The%20End%20%28biome%29\"&gt;the End's technical biome&lt;/a&gt; was still referred to in the &lt;a href=\"debug%20menu\"&gt;debug menu&lt;/a&gt; as \"Sky\".\nUnlike the Sky Dimension, the End has a dark purple sky, no clouds, and the floating islands are made entirely of end stone.\nWith the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Buffet\"&gt;Buffet&lt;/a&gt; functionality in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; snapshot &lt;a href=\"18w15a\"&gt;18w15a&lt;/a&gt;, this can be distantly recreated by using the \"Floating Islands\" option. The addition of &lt;a href=\"custom%20world%20generation\"&gt;custom world generation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16.2&lt;/a&gt; snapshot &lt;a href=\"20w28a\"&gt;20w28a&lt;/a&gt; also included a noise preset offering similar functionality.\nMentioned.\nThese features were mentioned at one point, but later abandoned or their current status is unknown. Note that some of these features were mentioned by developers who either no longer work at &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt;, or no longer work on \"Minecraft\".\nMobs.\nThere have been several cases of mobs being mentioned by developers as potential candidates for being added to the game.\nRed Dragon.\n&lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; revealed during the &lt;a href=\"Seecret%20Updates\"&gt;8th Seecret Friday Update&lt;/a&gt; that he was planning to add dragons. Later, he mentioned dragons again during &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202010\"&gt;MINECON 2010&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 12th, 2011, he announced on Twitter that after the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, he was planning to add \"slightly less dangerous\" red dragons, which would be able to land and wouldn't destroy terrain.\nIn a thread on the same day, when questioned about how &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s phase through blocks, &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; went on record saying that \"less overpowered\" red dragons in the Overworld that wouldn't go through terrain would eventually be added. However, the red dragon has not subsequently been added.\nJeb informed participants of his AMA on that he would add red dragons, but was unsure exactly how. \nOn October 22, 2013, &lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; tweeted that the red dragon is \"shelved\" and not in development.\nLater, on December 15, 2013, a Dinnerbone post on indicated his belief that red dragons likely will be implemented at some point:\nAlpaca.\nIn 2016, Jeb was planning on adding alpacas, but due to other developers wanting llamas instead, he held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama over the alpaca.\nBarnacle, The Great Hunger and Wildfire.\nThree creatures were present in the &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Earth%202017\"&gt;MINECON Earth 2017&lt;/a&gt; vote. One was a sea creature known as as \"Mob A\", \"The Monster of the Ocean Depths\", or the &lt;a href=\"Barnacle\"&gt;Barnacle&lt;/a&gt;. It would have spawned in deep water and attacked players with a tentacle-like tongue to pull players down and drown them.\nAnother was \"Mob C, &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Hunger\"&gt;The Great Hunger&lt;/a&gt;.\" It would have had a large mouth capable of removing enchantments from items and would have camouflaged itself by entering the ground with its mouth open upward. &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the mob wouldn't have been aggressive, only damaging the player if they accidentally fell into its mouth, and it wouldn't have stripped enchantments from players' items unless players fed it intentionally. Its functionality was eventually replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Grindstone\"&gt;Grindstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe other mob was \"Mob D, &lt;a href=\"The%20Hovering%20Inferno\"&gt;The Hovering Inferno&lt;/a&gt;.\" It would have looked like a large &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; with shields instead of rods, and would have spawned with groups of blazes in the nether. This mob however appears in the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; DLC and the board game under the name \"&lt;a href=\"Wildfire\"&gt;Wildfire&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMob B, the Monster of the Night Skies, was the &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;, which won the vote and was added in the &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlligator, Monkey, Deer and River Dolphin.\nIn September 2018, a poll was held in which Chinese users could vote on which \"national treasure\" they thought would be added to Minecraft, to promote the release of &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20China\"&gt;Minecraft China&lt;/a&gt;. There were five options: , , , , or . The &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt; received the most votes and was added in &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt;. It was later stated on &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Feedback\"&gt;Minecraft Feedback&lt;/a&gt; that alligators and/or crocodiles, if implemented into the game, would likely not be hostile mobs as, like the shark (which was outright rejected), hostile mobs had to be fantasy creatures. It is unknown whether any of these mobs will be added.\nMeerkat, Ostrich and Termite.\nIn &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Earth%202018\"&gt;MINECON Earth 2018&lt;/a&gt;, a biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"Desert\"&gt;Desert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savanna\"&gt;Savanna&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Taiga\"&gt;Taiga&lt;/a&gt;. The Taiga won the vote and was updated in &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt;. The Taiga included the &lt;a href=\"Fox\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;, while the Desert will one day include the Meerkat, and the Savanna will include the Ostrich and the Termite. There has been no information as to when the Desert and Savanna will be updated.\nVulture.\nIn &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Live%202019\"&gt;MINECON Live 2019&lt;/a&gt;, another biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swamp\"&gt;Swamp&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mountains\"&gt;Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The Mountains won the vote and was updated in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;. The Swamp came in second, and was updated in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Update\"&gt;The Wild Update&lt;/a&gt;. The Mountains included the &lt;a href=\"Goat\"&gt;Goat&lt;/a&gt;, and the Swamp included the &lt;a href=\"Frog\"&gt;Frog&lt;/a&gt;, while the Badlands will one day include the Vulture. There has been no information as to when the Badlands will be updated.\nMoobloom and Iceologer.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202020\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2020&lt;/a&gt;, a mob vote was held between which mob should be added to the game next. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"Moobloom\"&gt;Moobloom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iceologer\"&gt;Iceologer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Squid\"&gt;Glow Squid&lt;/a&gt;. The Glow Squid won the vote and was added into the game in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jens\"&gt;Jens&lt;/a&gt; has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if, or when, they fit and can be prioritized.\nGlare and Copper Golem.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202021\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2021&lt;/a&gt;, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"Glare\"&gt;Glare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Allay\"&gt;Allay&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Golem\"&gt;Copper Golem&lt;/a&gt;. The Allay won the vote and was added to the game in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Update\"&gt;The Wild Update&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jens\"&gt;Jens&lt;/a&gt; has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if or when they fit and can be prioritized.\nRascal and Tuff Golem.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202022\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2022&lt;/a&gt;, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"Sniffer\"&gt;Sniffer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rascal\"&gt;Rascal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Tuff%20Golem\"&gt;Tuff Golem&lt;/a&gt;. The Sniffer won the vote and was added to the game in &lt;a href=\"Trails%20%26amp%3B%20Tales\"&gt;Trails &amp; Tales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jens\"&gt;Jens&lt;/a&gt; has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if or when they fit and can be prioritized.\nPenguin and Crab.\nIn Minecraft Live 2022, another mob vote was held to determine which mob should be added to the game. There were three options: Crab, Penguin or Armadillo. The Armadillo won the vote and will be added to the game. Jens said the the Penguin may be added later. \nPigman Bodyguard.\nDevelopment of a male mob which may have had no clothes was also mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, but this is not currently being worked on. On April 14, 2020, &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Adams\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; clarified that the mob was going to be a &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;pigman&lt;/a&gt; bodyguard, which was naked by default so that the player could provide armor for it.\nAmbient Mobs.\nIn 2012, &lt;a href=\"Jon%20K%C3%A5gstr%C3%B6m\"&gt;Jon K\u00e5gstr\u00f6m&lt;/a&gt; mentioned fish, birds, and other tree animals, to \"make the game seem more alive\". &lt;a href=\"Parrot\"&gt;Parrot&lt;/a&gt;s and four different &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; mobs were added in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nPrefix Mobs.\nNotch mentioned prefix mobs in a Brocraft stream. He gave examples of mobs such as \"Burning Spiders, Giant Zombies, and Cobble Creepers.\" Some prefix mobs have been added in the form of cave spiders, charged creepers, strays, husks, drowned, and other mob variants. Giant zombies have technically been added, but are currently unused. In the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%203D%20Shareware%20v1.34\"&gt;3D Shareware April Fools update&lt;/a&gt;, the ORDER.txt jokingly mentions \"11 new enemy variants including Buff Crepper and Evilshroom II\" for a fake game: \"MineCraft 3D: Deeper and darker.\"\nLava Zombie and Troll.\nBefore the implementation of &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mobs\"&gt;hostile mobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; stated that he liked the idea of monsters such as lava zombies or troll infestations which would roam the land and break things. Later, the &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; was implemented.\nReindeer.\nReindeer were another mob acknowledged and suggested initially for Christmas 2015. &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Earth\"&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/a&gt; version 0.6.0 added the , which is supposed to represent a reindeer. It is currently unknown if reindeer will one day be added to Minecraft or not.\nCamouflaging Mob.\nA mob which camouflages with its environment was a concept considered by &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; when designing the &lt;a href=\"Shulker\"&gt;Shulker&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally one of the mob's mechanics during development - the mob would camouflage with the surroundings, but due to difficulties with the code and rendering, he decided to abandon this element of the mob. He stated however that it may happen in the future.\nIllager Variants.\nIn 2017, a jocular suggestion regarding adding more types of &lt;a href=\"Illager\"&gt;Illager&lt;/a&gt;s was posted. One of them, the Pillager, has been implemented in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, there is a mob known as the Iceologer, known internally as the . This mob was also part of the 2020 mob vote. \nMore Ocean Creatures.\nNotch commented that sea monsters were a possibility on Minecast on July 21, 2010. He particularly noted the possibility of sharks, though Mojang has since then denied that they will be added. Hostile aquatic mobs like the &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; have been added since then. A more recent developer hinted about adding mobs involved adding seals/sea lions and/or orcas. This may be related to &lt;a href=\"dolphins\"&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt;, which were added about a month later in &lt;a href=\"18w15a\"&gt;18w15a&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoul Fire Blazes.\nSoul Fire Blazes were talked about by Jeb. He stated that he doesn't want to make another mob variant, but that it would be interesting to make a mob connected to soul fire.\nSnails.\nSnails were talked about by Xilefian. He'd make them a cube the shape &amp; size of a player head, like a mini Shulker with no foot or head, just the shell is visible and it will have solid collision and will require a pickaxe to mine. They only move when no players are looking at them, to give them the sense of moving slowly. When they do move it is 1 block at a time. They spawn in humid biomes when it rains at nighttime. If cooked on campfires then eat them you have a chance to gain a nautilus shell and possibly a 0.0001% chance of a Shulker shell. Dye their shells, race them and they potentially follow the paths of mossy blocks but you still have to look away for them to move. If given a book and if all players go to bed then when morning arrives the book is randomly delivered by the snail to another player. Maybe it lets you deliver an item to your base each time you sleep. If a splash potion of speed is thrown on them they move a little bit further when you look away.\nAudio loops.\nLoops were unused &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s, found in the game files, and were possibly meant for when the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is in a specific type of location (i.e., in &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and beside a waterfall).\nTrees.\nSeveral features regarding &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s have been mentioned throughout the game's history.\nNotch mentioned branches in a blog post during Indev. The addition of sideways logs seems to be an alternative for branches. Implemented on &lt;a href=\"chorus%20tree\"&gt;chorus tree&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"acacia\"&gt;acacia&lt;/a&gt; trees and &lt;a href=\"cherry\"&gt;cherry&lt;/a&gt; trees, but not on ordinary trees.\nThe implementation of fallen &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s (like those currently ) has also been brought up, but appears to never have been actually undertaken beyond this mention . In , a fallen tree was present in a concept art of a birch forest.\nTwo tree species were mentioned at the biome vote for MINECON 2018 called the palm and baobab. However, both trees' host biomes were voted against and the trees have yet to appear in game despite being promised implementation later.\nCave and underground features.\nMany features relating to the underground and caves have been mentioned historically, but are yet to be seen in-game. Some suggestions which were approved by Mojang include rainbow crystalline caves and cave maps, considered \"an interesting idea\" by Notch. &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt; added &lt;a href=\"Buffet\"&gt;buffet worlds&lt;/a&gt;, which has an option for cave-like generation.\nMore ores and cave types was a general target proposed by Dinnerbone in late 2013. Since this post, flooded underwater caves have been implemented, along with 1.16 adding &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;Ancient Debris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nether%20gold%20ore\"&gt;Nether Gold Ore&lt;/a&gt;, and 1.17 adding &lt;a href=\"copper%20ore\"&gt;Copper Ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amethyst\"&gt;Amethyst Crystals&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202020\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; update was announced, bringing more new types of caves.\nFriends list.\nNotch mentioned on his blog, The Word of Notch, that friends lists would be added after Beta 1.8. The Minecraft documentary team of 2 Player Productions filmed a Keynote roadmap, containing these lines. Kristoffer mentioned on Twitter that he is currently working on friends lists for Scrolls, then for other Mojang games. These will be available for players with Mojang accounts. At &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202012\"&gt;MineCon 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Jeb stated that it would be a large implementation on the server-side and will be used for all Mojang games, and that is a big project.&lt;br&gt;\nWith the release of &lt;a href=\"1.16.4\"&gt;1.16.4&lt;/a&gt;, the social interactions menu functions somewhat like a friends menu but not exactly, but the Xbox account system currently used on Bedrock and Java has a friends system.\nInventory changes.\nAn inventory rewrite was originally added in the snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w07a\"&gt;14w07a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, but a roadblock was hit and Mojang had to shelve the change before the release of 1.8. Other changes to the inventory have been mentioned, including spectators can now look at people's inventory, visible health/armor bar on all players, seeing players' GUI when spectating from their POV and the return of shift-double-clicking.\nLua scripting.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org\"&gt;Lua Scripting&lt;/a&gt; was a feature mentioned by &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; as a way to create server-side modifications. The server would be able to create custom commands, assign certain server functions to blocks, and create user groups. Players would not have to download scripts within or outside of the client, and therefore no client-side modifications will be necessary. Notch said that he wanted Lua to be an extension for \"Minecraft\", but did not want Lua to turn \"Minecraft\" into a game engine.\nLua scripting has been further hinted at by &lt;a href=\"Searge\"&gt;Searge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCertain plugins such as Spigot or Bukkit support Lua scripting implementation into servers, however these plugins are not created by nor affiliated with Mojang Studios and thus are not an official means in which to implement Lua scripting.\nNether features.\nMultiple features relating to the Nether have been proposed and acknowledged, such as utilizing the space above the Nether ceiling for something else, non-rectangular nether portals, and nether portals placing players in front if possible.\nDuring the development of the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Update\"&gt;Nether Update&lt;/a&gt;, other ideas were discussed, such as dyeable nether portals, which were dismissed as not being priority by Jeb. As a joke feature in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w14%E2%88%9E\"&gt;Java Edition 20w14\u221e&lt;/a&gt;, funky portals were added and would change color depending on the text data found in a &lt;a href=\"Written%20Book\"&gt;Written Book&lt;/a&gt;.\nRare tools/weapons.\nDinnerbone said on Twitter he would like to add weapons/tools that cannot be crafted, and could only obtained through treasure chests/trading, etc. For example, bows with faster drawback (somewhat implemented with the addition of &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Charge\"&gt;Quick Charge&lt;/a&gt;), boots that increase health, or night vision helmets. However, the attribute system has to be finished first.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; were implemented as treasure enchantments in 1.9 as well as the Curses of &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Binding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Vanishing\"&gt;Vanishing&lt;/a&gt; in 1.11, and &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s have been implemented in 1.13 as &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;-exclusive weapons, somewhat implementing this feature. In 1.16, treasure enchantments have also been made less accessible (therefore more rare) via nerfing AFK fishing, and the new &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; enchantment is exclusively obtainable through &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;Piglin bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\nResource packs.\n&lt;a href=\"Grum\"&gt;Grum&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that there may be easier customization of &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; colors.\nSince 1.16, the \"color\" tag in raw NBT text has been able to accept hexadecimal colors:\n&lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Holtz\"&gt;Ryan Holtz&lt;/a&gt; stated that he wanted to improve the rendering system to allow for customizable models and animations. &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Adams\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; later stated that player models would not be able to be changed.\nSeasons.\n&lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Adams\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; mentioned on Twitter that he was experimenting with adding seasons, and varying the length of day and night according to season. He also mentioned it during &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202013\"&gt;MineCon 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Seasons may include changes in color of tree leaves and may also be tied to real time. The later released \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;\" has a location called &lt;a href=\"Pumpkin%20Pastures\"&gt;Pumpkin Pastures&lt;/a&gt;, which resembles an autumn-themed forest biome. Autumn-colored trees also appear in in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Legends\"&gt;Minecraft Legends&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSpike block.\nSpikes received a mention in mid-2009 by &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post. These were originally planned for , working by extending and retracting spikes (and making them more \"spike pistons\" than anything), but were replaced by &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s. On May 28, 2012, &lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; stated that he'd like to add spike blocks, but is unsure of how to implement them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.17\"&gt;1.17&lt;/a&gt; update implemented &lt;a href=\"Pointed%20Dripstone\"&gt;Pointed Dripstone&lt;/a&gt;, which can damage mobs and players that fall on them, or are crushed by them.\nSteel.\nMultiple references to steel were made early on in the game's development. Notch had stated that it could be made using &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;, and that it could be used for armor and weapons more powerful than iron. In-game, &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; is crafted using iron ingots, considering the lack of steel and the need of a \u201cfire striker\u201d, despite the name of the former.\nWorkbench (Plugin API).\nThe Plugin API, dubbed \"Workbench\", is a feature that allows mod developers to easily add more content to the game. In contrast to mods, plugins will not require any alteration of the &lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt; file itself, although they will also be slightly limited in their feature set. The team will help make the official Plugin API.\nOff-hand changes.\nChanges with the off-hand slot added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt; were planned on being added to Minecraft sometime in the future. Specifically, the player would no longer be able to or place blocks with any item in their off-hand slot, similar to &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;. However, players would still be able to hold items in the off-hand slot, which still made the off-hand useful for maps and such. Also, blocking would still be able to be activated if the player is holding a shield in their off-hand. However, this regression was later retracted due to massive community backlash.\nCubic chunks.\nThis refers to changing the &lt;a href=\"chunk%20format\"&gt;chunk format&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s 16 blocks tall, allowing for infinite world height. &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Holtz\"&gt;Ryan Holtz&lt;/a&gt; discussed it with &lt;a href=\"Erik%20Broes\"&gt;Erik Broes&lt;/a&gt;, but they decided they couldn't implement it, because of the difficulty of solving problems such as the occlusion of sky light. The feature was previously rejected by &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; for similar reasons.\nBrief mentions.\nThese features were briefly mentioned, but no further information was given after it's mention.\nJoke features.\n&lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; and Mojang Studios employees have frequently joked about adding various features to the game.\nMinecraft 2.0 changelog.\nThe changelog for the April Fools update &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%202.0\"&gt;Minecraft 2.0&lt;/a&gt; contained numerous features that were not actually included. Despite the changelog being part of the joke, many of these features have since been implemented into the game.\nThe changelog:"}

It was the very first development phase of the game, lasting for less than a week; very early development of \"Minecraft\" started around May 10 or May 11 and ended on May 16, 2009. The phase was originally named \"Cave Game\" until the game was changed to \"Minecraft: Order of the Stone\" then finally to \"Minecraft\"\".\nIn the files, the game was titled \"rd\", standing for RubyDung, until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20pre-Classic%20mc-161607\"&gt;Java Edition pre-Classic mc-161607&lt;/a&gt;, when it was renamed \"mc\", standing for Minecraft.\nHistory.\nThis phase began when &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Persson\"&gt;Markus Persson&lt;/a&gt; (Notch) started working on a \"Cave Game\". He was influenced to create the game by \"&lt;a href=\"Infiniminer\"&gt;Infiniminer&lt;/a&gt;\", ', ', as well as one of his previous games, \"&lt;a href=\"RubyDung\"&gt;RubyDung&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe textures used for &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; blocks (the latter texture eventually being reworked for &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;) were from \"RubyDung\", and internally, the game's class files referred to it as \"RubyDung\". Other blocks and items were then added, such as &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, and more.\nLittle is known about this development phase, since it was never publicly released, and only Notch could test the versions. Some versions in this phase could previously be seen in videos on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtube.com/Nizzotch\"&gt;Notch's YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, though most of the videos have been blocked in most countries for unknown reasons.\nA &lt;a href=\"Cave%20game%20tech%20test\"&gt;tech test&lt;/a&gt; was released on May 10, 2009, and was shown in Notch's [ \"Cave game tech test\" video] ([ archive]).\nFive pre-Classic versions are now available to the public through the &lt;a href=\"launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt;, with the earliest being &lt;a href=\"rd-132211\"&gt;rd-132211&lt;/a&gt;, originally developed on May 13, 2009."}

This allowed any block (or indeed item) to be placed within a flower pot, but few of these would actually render with the block inside.\nIn 14w17a, almost certainly due to changes in how blocks render with them being changed to use block models rather than hardcoded models, these odd pot variants simply rendered as empty pots with no further interesting quirks, aside from the fact that their \"invalid\" contents could be retrieved from the pot via breaking or later right clicking it. They were completely removed in 17w47a, which split the flower pot block up into an individual block ID per potted object and scrapped the tile entity.\n13w36a.\nThe first version to make flower pots use a block entity, the fact that flower pots could hold ferns bled over somewhat into its other damage values, allowing shrubs and grass to exist in pots as well. Also, cobwebs would render if placed in a flower pot.\nIn order to be affected by biome coloration, potted ferns/grass/green shrubs needed to have a data value of 11 (the data value formerly belonging to the potted fern) \u2013 otherwise they would appear as their raw textures.\n14w06a.\nIn this version, a large amount of blocks now render if placed in flower pots via commands. In order to place these with commands, use the following command, with ITEM and DATA substituted with the appropriate values from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20data%20value/Pre-flattening/Block%20IDs\"&gt;Java Edition data value/Pre-flattening/Block IDs&lt;/a&gt; as necessary:\nOnly blocks that are completely unique in their rendering are shown here; some visually identical blocks do exist that are not listed here separately, such as the early stages of both carrots and potatoes, or potted pumpkins and jack o'lanterns.\nThe blocks always appear as a cross shape based on their bottom texture. Blocks with translucency appear either completely opaque or, in the case of stained glass, most pixels are invisible.\nSome blocks appear tinted by biome if their normal variants usually would be. As leaves were tinted as per their numerical data values, setting the number prior to destroy to 1 for specifically potted leaves causes them to be tinted with the spruce color, and setting it to 2 gives the birch color. 0 or 3 results in them being tinted per biome like oak and jungle leaves are.\n14w06b.\nIn 14w06b, likely due to the fix for , an additional 57 visually distinct potted objects could be placed:\n14w07a.\n14w07a introduced the iron trapdoor, which rendered in a flower pot."}
{"id": "178037", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=178037", "title": "Java Edition removed blocks/Metadata variants", "text": "Removed in 1.8 (14w26a).\nThese existed due to the previous handling of block variations through metadata, rather than through block states or as separate IDs. Extreme values of these would produce unintended effects.\nFaceless pumpkins and jack o'lanterns.\nIt was possible to place pumpkins and jack o'lantern with no actual face using metadata values 5 and above. Their models became missing in 14w10a and they faced removal in snapshot 14w26a like other unintended blocks.\nIn 17w47a, the faceless pumpkin made a comeback as the proper, default pumpkin block, with the then-current pumpkin being moved to the role of carved pumpkin.\nFaceless and exceptional furnaces.\nFurnaces (as well as lit furnaces) with metadata values 0, 1, 6, 7, 12 and 13 would have no faces, using the side texture for all orthogonal faces and the usual top and bottom texture on the top and bottom. Furnaces and lit furnaces with data values 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 would appear normal, but were probably not legitimately obtainable.\nUnlike with many blocks, these need to be placed using external editors, as always places a furnace within the normal range.\nAll of these invalid furnaces and lit furnaces lost their models in 14w10a, with the exception of the unlit furnace with data value 0, which kept the faceless appearance. The lit furnace with no facing direction regained its model sometime between 14w17a and 14w21b.\nWeird pistons.\nSix-sided versions of the piston block. When powered, some would cause immediate game crashes, which could be exploited for update suppression.\nIt took until 14w17a for weird piston blocks to lose their model and use the missing one.\nSix-sided hay bale.\nHay bales with the side texture on all six faces existed until block variants were defined using block states rather than metadata.\nThe hay bale lost its model in 14w10a like many other blocks.\nInterestingly, other six-sided blocks resulting from similar circumstances such as &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"smooth%20stone\"&gt;smooth stone&lt;/a&gt; were not removed, and were even given unique block IDs and made &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;craftable&lt;/a&gt; in later updates.\nGreen shrub.\nThese blocks had an identical texture to the &lt;a href=\"shrub\"&gt;shrub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;, with the main difference being that it was &lt;a href=\"tint\"&gt;tint&lt;/a&gt;ed based on the biome.\nUnlike the usual shrub, its inclusion within the game was most likely \"un\"intentional, as it became present in the game only after 13w10a (as it crashed the game from 13w02a to 13w09c, and appeared identical to usual grass beforehand), and sported a missing model after 14w10a like many other undefined blocks.\nOvergrown cocoa.\nCocoa has twelve possible block state combinations, as it has four possible orientations coupled with three distinct stages of growth. Before the introduction of proper block states, this therefore meant that twelve of the possible sixteen metadata variants were actually used, resulting in the uppermost four exhibiting interesting undefined behavior.\nFrom their introduction up until and including 13w01b, they used the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; texture, which makes sense as the dragon egg texture was directly to the left of the cocoa pod texture in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"terrain.png\"&gt;terrain.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;. From 13w10a up to 14w06, it appeared as a broken cocoa pod, and from then on up to its removal it used missing models.\nOvergrown wheat.\nBecause wheat has eight distinct growth stages, the other upper eight values went completely unused. As a result, for a relatively long period of time, wheat crops with such values would see vast unintentional changes, as the textures they would try to pull from would end up overflowing over to the next line of &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"terrain.png\"&gt;terrain.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;samp&gt;.\nThis included the textures commonly speculated to be for chair and table blocks. Whether Notch was using extreme inaccessible wheat values as a way to test chair models is highly unlikely, although still possible.\nOvergrown melon and pumpkin stems.\nMelon and pumpkin stems also have eight distinct stages of growth. However, instead of having eight individual textures for each of the eight growth stages, each stage reveals two more pixels of the stem texture from the top down, and the &lt;a href=\"tint\"&gt;tint&lt;/a&gt; applied to the stem texture also changes. As a result, since the stems have eight unused upper values in addition to the eight lower used states, the upper states start pulling from the texture below the stem texture on the &lt;a href=\"texture%20atlas\"&gt;texture atlas&lt;/a&gt; currently in use, and they use extreme tints that cannot normally be applied in normal gameplay. Their wireframe &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt;es would also appear to extend above the bounds of the block when targeted, but attempting to target anything above the height of the block would result in the stem not actually being targeted.\nOvereaten cakes.\nThere are six different states cake can legitimately be in: either intact, or in one of five progressively more eaten states, which was kept track of via block metadata like with many other blocks. Like with many blocks previously showcased, only some of these states were truly legitimately accessible. As such, interesting behavior is demonstrated by the inaccessible states.\nCakes with six bites, while obtainable now, were never actually obtainable in the game during the time when these odd overeaten cakes existed. Cakes with seven bites were completely two-dimensional, and cakes with eight through fifteen bites appeared especially glitchy, proceeding to invert themselves, such that their textures would be visible only on the inside rather than the outside, and these textures would be borrowed from adjacent spots of the texture atlas currently in use. Their wireframe hitboxes would also visually extend in this direction, but they could actually be targeted only by aiming at the portion of that hitbox within the block the cake is really situated. Collision boxes for these are similarly odd.\nMinor removed block variants.\nCertain blocks had removed variants with minor, but still notable, quirks.\nInvisible stairs.\nOriginally, stair blocks with data values 4 through 15 would be completely invisible and have no collisions; the only indication of their existence was their full block hitbox outline when targeted.\nIn 12w08a, these data values would go on to be used for the newly implemented upside down stairs. Data values 8 through 15 would appear to just be duplicates of 0 through 7, and were probably unused in themselves until their removal. These last eight were removed in 14w26a, like other invalid blocks. They also never used the missing model. \nWall sign with full block hitbox.\nSigns used block metadata values 2, 3, 4 and 5 to determine their facing direction. As a result, signs placed with data values 0, 1 or anything 6 and above would always appear facing south, and have the wireframe hitbox (but not physical collision box) of a full block.\nThese were probably removed in 14w26a like many other such blocks.\nInvisible random ladders.\nLadders also used block metadata values 2, 3, 4 and 5 to determine their facing direction. As a result, ladders placed with data values 0, 1 or anything 6 and above exhibited behavior atypical of normal ladders. Notably, they would appear to readily switch what block face they were attached to (sometimes seemingly randomly, but could be controlled by looking at a valid ladder, in which case they end up switching to whatever its hitbox was), which could be seen through their wireframe hitbox and their collision box. Initially they would be full cubes.\nFor most of their existence they appeared completely invisible, although in 14w07a they changed to using the missing model, which also changed in 14w10a\nThese were probably removed in 14w26a like many other such blocks.\nVines with data value 0 also appeared with the missing model, which was tinted for a while, however they still exist in 1.17 (as vines with all states set to false).\nIncorrectly modeled torches.\nWhen block metadata was still in use, torches used state 5 for normal floor attachment and 1, 2, 3 and 4 for wall torches. 0, 6 and 7 appear to be unused, and are visually identical to normal torches. 0 can be obtained only via external editors, and not by setblock.\nTorches with data values 8 and up appear to exhibit interesting behavior: 8, 13, 14 and 15 appeared and behaved as normal floor torches. However, 9, 10, 11 and 12 would have the wireframe hitboxes of wall torches, but would appear as floor torches, causing the hitbox to be detached from the torch.\nRedstone torches are affected in much the same way.\nLoading a chunk with these in 14w06a causes a game crash. These became small missing cubes in 14w06b before graduating to full missing cubes in 14w10a until their removal in what is almost certainly 14w26a.\nStrange buttons.\nNote: due to the inconsistent nature of these blocks, certain details are not fully confirmed.\nIn 1.7.10, using commands to place a button with data value 0, 13, 14 or 15 results in odd behavior. The button appears as a full oak planks or stone block, until (possibly) another button is observed or an item of said button is obtained, at which point it uses item model of button. They do not appear to change shape when pressed in either case.\nMuch information regarding these buttons remains unknown as these are inconsistent in their behavior and also somewhat unstable, breaking frequently, and their behavior probably also changes drastically per version. Despite never actually changing data value, they seem to differently register what block face they are attached to each time.\nWhat exactly the other data values of buttons were that were unused and eventually removed are unknown.\nBottomless and bricking hoppers.\nHoppers with a metadata value of 1 or 9 would previously not actually appear to point in any direction. Like many of these removed blocks, they had a missing model from 14w10a up to their removal.\nUsing /setblock to place a hopper with metadata values 6, 7, 14 or 15 would crash the game and permanently prevent that world from being loaded, although it may be possible to recover using external editors.\nNether portal post.\nIn 1.7.2's development, nether portals placed with data value 3, 7, 11 or 15 resulted in a vertical nether portal beam block.\nBoring variants.\nPrior to the introduction of proper block states, the 0\u201315 block metadata system applied to all blocks. This had absolutely no effect on the majority of blocks. All interesting cases are mentioned in above sections \u2013 those that remain are listed below.\nAll of these gained a missing model in 14w10a and were removed in 14w26a (with increasingly unstable behavior in 14w25a and 14w25b, usually causing game crashes when approached) unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nThere were a total of X of these boring blocks prior to their removal, listed in the sections below.\nRemoved in 1.13 (17w47a).\nThese were the result of block state handling combined with the old block ID system, resulting in some odd combinations.\nRedundant seamless double slabs.\nIn 13w04a, double stone slabs were changed so that those with data values 8 through 15 would use the top texture on all six sides. This resulted in the return of the block that would several years later become smooth stone, and also introduced the smooth sandstone and smooth quartz blocks. However, as the smooth stone double slab block also housed the cobblestone, old (later petrified) oak, bricks, stone bricks and nether bricks slabs, these would also end up having \"seamless\" double slab variants that were visually no different from their normal double slabs or indeed their normal blocks. These blocks persisted up to 17w47a, where they were removed by &lt;a href=\"the%20Flattening\"&gt;the Flattening&lt;/a&gt;.\nSnowy dirt and snowy coarse dirt.\nAs podzol was a numerical variant of dirt prior to 1.13, the snowy block state it used also ended up applying to dirt and coarse dirt, with no effect. These were removed in 1.13."}

As only three species existed from Beta 1.2 to release 1.1, with data values 0/1/2 (and by extension 4/5/6, 8/9/10 and 12/13/14), a data value of 3, 7, 11 or 15 would produce an undefined leaf type. This block appeared identical to conventional oak leaves, but appeared to use the spruce tint.\nThese were substituted out of the game with the first 1.2 release snapshot, as jungle leaves from then on occupied that space in the leaves block.\nSeamless stone slabs.\nStone slabs with metadata over the usually obtainable values would have a slightly different appearance from normal smooth stone slabs. These were progressively replaced by proper slabs.\nStrange levers.\nThese also had weird distorted models, and could be obtained by loading a world from 1.3 or later containing ceiling levers (0, 7, 8, 15) in 1.2.5."}

They were made by &lt;a href=\"Dock\"&gt;Dock&lt;/a&gt;, one of \"Minecraft\"s past artists. After Dock left the Minecraft development team, these MD3 mobs were cut from the game. These mobs had no animation and glided around in the same pose.

This \"Monster\" was the result of trying to spawn the base class for hostile mobs as an actual mob, a similar situation would later occur for humans too. Notch also used the name \"monster\" for the green humanoids in his unfinished game: &lt;a href=\"Legend%20of%20the%20Chambered\"&gt;Legend of the Chambered&lt;/a&gt;. The entity IDs codice_1, for humans, and codice_2, for \"Monster\", existed until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.11\"&gt;1.11&lt;/a&gt;, in which entity IDs were converted to &lt;a href=\"resource%20location\"&gt;resource location&lt;/a&gt;s.\nZombie drops.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, zombies dropped 0-2 &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s, which were replaced by 0-2 &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nZombie pigman drops.\nPrior to Beta 1.8, zombie pigmen dropped 0-2 &lt;a href=\"cooked%20porkchop\"&gt;cooked porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s, which were replaced by 0-1 rotten flesh and 0-1 &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe concept of a pig-like Nether mobs dropping &lt;a href=\"porkchop\"&gt;porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s were reimplemented into &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, added in the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Update\"&gt;Nether Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nZombie pigman Texture.\nThe zombie pigman was what the &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; was known as before the Nether Update.

From &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.2a\"&gt;Classic 0.0.2a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31%2020100205\"&gt;Indev 0.31 20100205&lt;/a&gt;, only the version number was displayed, but after &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; it switched from being \"&lt;a href=\"0.31\"&gt;0.31&lt;/a&gt;\" to being called \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Indev\"&gt;Minecraft Indev&lt;/a&gt;\" (&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%2020100206\"&gt;Indev 20100206&lt;/a&gt;), the word \"Minecraft\" was shown before the version number. In the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; development stage, the text read \"Minecraft Alpha v#.#.#(_#).\" In the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; development stage, the text read \"Minecraft Beta #.#(_#).\" This feature was only partially removed, for, among other things, the version number can now be shown by opening the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; while in-game. Before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.2.2\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.2&lt;/a&gt;, the version number did not display on the &lt;a href=\"main%20menu\"&gt;main menu&lt;/a&gt; screen.\n\"Unlicensed Copy\" message.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; stage of Minecraft's development, a message reading \"Minecraft Beta #.#.#(_0#) Unlicensed Copy :( (Or logged in from another location). Purchase at &lt;a href=\"minecraft.net\"&gt;minecraft.net&lt;/a&gt;\" was shown in the top-left corner. This message can be seen only in versions between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6%20Test%20Build%203\"&gt;Beta 1.6 Test Build 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.7.3\"&gt;Beta 1.7.3&lt;/a&gt;, as proven by a bytecode editor. The bytecode for the message was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievements.\n&lt;a href=\"Achievements\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt; were available between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.5\"&gt;Beta 1.5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.12\"&gt;1.12&lt;/a&gt; (snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w06a\"&gt;17w06a&lt;/a&gt;). They were ultimately replaced by &lt;a href=\"advancements\"&gt;advancements&lt;/a&gt;, though editions other than \"Java Edition\" still have achievements instead, although they use a different system, being synced per Xbox Live or PlayStation account and not separated by worlds.\nOld walking animation for players.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.9\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.9&lt;/a&gt;, the walking animation for the player and the human mob was different; the player and the human mob would swing their arms wildly to their sides while walking like cartoons.\nPre-loaded items.\nDifferent versions in Minecraft's history had items pre-spawned in the player's inventory. Here is a table below:\nHigh-distance anomalies.\nMany of the game's mechanics would break down in strange ways when at a large distance from the origin of the world. The vast majority of these effects have been patched, or at least minimised, in modern versions.\nHard limits.\nFor elements of the game which are integer-aligned, such as the positions of blocks, Java Edition uses integer data types, which can be either 32-bit or 64-bit. 32-bit integers were more commonly used in older versions, which allowed for 4,294,967,296 possible distinct integer values, ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Exceeding these boundaries, such as by using an external editor to move the player to beyond 2,147,483,647 blocks from the origin as to force the game to load blocks beyond this position, often would result in major game-breaking bugs and crashes.\nAccessing such regions is now much more difficult than it was previously, as distance is now much more restrictive, requiring modifications to the game to allow these limits to be exposed.\nFloating point imprecision.\nFor elements of the game which are not integer-aligned, such as the positions of entities, Java Edition uses 64-bit floating point (or \"double\") values for arithmetic and storage of relevant variables. However, there are odd cases in which a 32-bit floating point value is used instead. Such cases are rare in the modern game (a full list of those which still exist in 1.18 can be found at &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20distance%20effects\"&gt;Java Edition distance effects&lt;/a&gt;), however older versions of the game used 32-bit values (or unnecessarily casted from and to them, resulting in data loss which could have easily been avoided without this pointless casting) much more heavily, resulting in a plethora of strange gameplay bugs which were tied to how far the player was from the center of the world, getting twice as intense for every integer power of 2 blocks the player went from the center.\nOne of the most notable floating point precision loss bugs is where the rendering of the world stops being accurate depending on the player's position. Commonly experienced alongside (and frequently, and incorrectly, blamed on) the Far Lands, the position at which blocks render will not match up with that of entities and other world elements such as the &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt;es of blocks. At 8,388,608 blocks and beyond, the game will assume the player is standing at the edge or corner of each block, and will always render the blocks of the world as if they player is standing at one of those corners. This effect is difficult to describe in text, and is best experienced firsthand.\nMost of the other issues regarding floating point imprecision deal with the creation of particles, spawning of entities, and (prior to their standardisation in 1.8 with json files, which fixed all of these permanently) the geometrical distortion of block models.\nA comprehensive list of since-fixed issues, as well as breakdowns of how they progress, can be found at &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20distance%20effects/Historical%20effects\"&gt;Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoundary effects.\nBoundary effects refer to oddities which arise due to hardcoded numerical limits in the game, such as the 30 million wall (as opposed to hard limits, which are defined by the programming language and/or computer architecture rather than the game code).\nThe current world boundary as of 1.18 is a \"pseudo-wall\" which exists at 30 million blocks from the origin, a chunk beyond the &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt;. (This is defined as a \"pseudo-wall\" rather than a true wall as rather than being solid and preventing passage like the world border or a solid block does, the player's position is instead set to 30 million by the game if the player attempts to exceed it, which can be seen by the fact that the walking animation, step sounds and view bobbing can still be experienced by walking into the wall, as does the sounds of flying with an elytra.)\nHowever, previous versions had much stranger effects at great distances. The world boundary was something commonly experienced in Classic and Indev due to worlds being small by design. The first versions of Infdev, which did away with such boundaries, therefore had no such effects, instead exposing the existing hard limits of the game (although experiencing these was effectively impossible due to floating point bugs rendering the game unplayable much earlier).\nThe version of Infdev released on March 13, 2010 reimplemented a boundary at 32 million blocks, likely to prevent access to the then-relatively-new Far Lands which existed at a bit over 33 million blocks. This boundary was considerably different and buggier than those from Indev, although this was largely to be expected due to it being effectively impossible to reach legitimately. Beyond this 32 million limit, blocks would no longer exist at all, and give way to an empty void. When &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20world%20generation\"&gt;major changes to world generation&lt;/a&gt; brought the Far Lands much closer to the world origin later that same month, however, the world boundary still remained at 32 million, meaning the Far Lands were completely possible to reach without modding the game.\nUpdating blocks next to this void would cause the game to freeze due to it having to calculate an immense amount of lighting updates. This void could still be traversed by entities normally until the April 13 build, in which entities that render it would become stuck in place and jitter eternally. This was later fixed in an unknown version.\nIn Alpha v1.2.0, the boundary effects would get stranger than before. While previously no blocks would render beyond this point, Alpha v1.2.0 and onwards would cause a strange phenomenon in which chunks would appear to generate, but would be intangible, appear fully lit, and generated features such as trees and ores would not generate at all in these chunks.\nFor reasons which remain completely unknown to this day, Beta 1.8 would shrink the world boundaries inwards from 32 million blocks out to only 30 million blocks out. While the effects would remain similar, with blocks beyond the 30 million boundary appearing fully lit and ignoring collision and feature generation, these fake chunks would only generate a small distance out from this boundary, stopping at 30,000,064, or four chunks from the boundary. In addition, any entity attempting to surpass 30,000,032 would again be stuck in a jittery stasis, with players in particular having their heads twist unnaturally if looking around after this point (a bug that was patched in 12w03a, where facing direction would no longer change and preventing this unnatural twisting).\nWith the client-server split in snapshot 12w18a for 1.3 (&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.3.1/List%20of%20broken%20features\"&gt;a change which broke many other things about the game&lt;/a&gt;), the stasis bug was actually fixed, and fake chunks could be generated beyond the 30,000,064 point, allowing for the player to keep flying outwards until 32,000,000 blocks, where they would be kicked out of the game due to being in an illegal position, revealing that not all elements of the 32,000,000 limit had been removed from the game yet. 12w27a, a later snapshot for 1.3, would clamp nether portal positions to be within the 30 million limit.\n1.7 and 1.8 started to make major changes to the world boundary to bring it to its modern state. 1.7 first made all blocks beyond 30 million completely solid, including air. Said wall could still be surpassed, however, by flying over it, as it only extended to the 32-bit limit on the Y-axis, allowing for 32 million blocks to be reached once more and the illegal position game crash triggered. The boundary became more unstable from version to version throughout 1.8's development, with the end result on its release being that chunks beyond 30 million blocks would no longer render, and teleporting beyond 30 million would crash the game. 1.9 would allow chunks beyond 30 million blocks to render once more, and prevent teleportation beyond 30 million blocks at all. Little has changed about the world boundary between this point and 1.18.\nFar Lands.\nBasic theory.\nThe Far Lands were a complex terrain phenomenon which arise due to a major bug in terrain generation works. Generally, \"far lands\" are the result of what happens when a given &lt;a href=\"noise%20generator\"&gt;noise generator&lt;/a&gt; exceeds the largest value it can handle, resulting in an integer overflow and resulting in the generated values reaching unnatural magnitudes. The term \"Far Lands\" in isolation most commonly refers to what results from \"low noise\" and \"high noise\" overflowing simultaneously.\nThe Far Lands.\nIn their most well-known iteration, the Far Lands manifested as a sort of \"wall\" which would extend from the lowest point of the world to the very top. This wall contained a series of holes in it, with these holes reaching back almost infinitely, with only minor changes even after millions of blocks. The density of a cross-section of this wall was roughly 50%, with solid portions and hollow portions being around equal. Given their positions at the four sides of a world, there regions are often referred to as the \"Edge Far Lands\" when distinction from other regions of a world is necessary, and, due to their \"Swiss cheese\"-like formation, informally as \"The Loop\". \nSince the Far Lands existed on both the X and Z axes, it is entirely possible for them to \"intersect\" each other when surpassing their starting point on both axes. The resulting terrain, named the \"Corner Far Lands\" in analogy to the vertices of a square, is markedly different from that of the edge regions: the world appears to be solid layers of terrain arranged on top of each other with air gaps in between. Due to this distinctive morphology, the Corner Far Lands are also informally referred to as \"The Stack\". The terrain seen in these regions is comparable to that which is seen in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Often, major diagonal or oblique patterns can be seen within the generated terrain, which, if they exist, are especially obvious at the beginning of the corner Far Lands.\nIn the unmodified game, only four sets each of the edge and corner Far Lands can exist in a world, from the noise overflowing on the X and Z axes. However, game modifications can modify aspects of either chunk saving or terrain generation in ways that ultimately allows for noise to overflow on the Y axis as well. Such modifications reveal two more sets of Edge Far Lands for a total of six sets (corresponding to the faces of a cube), eight sets of Corner Far Lands from these Y axis Edge Far Lands intersecting X and Z axis Edge Far Lands for a total of twelve sets (corresponding to the edges of a cube), and new regions in which all three axes simultaneously overflow due to Y axis Edge Far Lands intersecting the existing Corner Far Lands, with eight of these regions in total (corresponding to the vertices of a cube). These regions, referred to as the \"Vertex Far Lands\", are incredibly unstable; sometimes these regions are completely solid, other times are completely empty, and other times still feature incredibly strange terrain atypical of even \"The Loop\" or \"The Stack\".\nWith default settings, the noise would overflow at twice the distance on the Y axis as it does on the X and Z axes, at around 25,101,640 blocks.\nThe Farther Lands.\nThe Farther Lands is the name given to another noise overflow which, by default, happens at a greater distance then the normal Far Lands. Whereas the usual Far Lands arise from the overflowing of \"low noise\" and \"high noise\", the Farther Lands sees \"selector noise\" break down instead. Low noise and high noise are two different noise generators which the game uses to generate the potential fundamental shape of terrain, whereas selector noise chooses whether low noise or high noise is used to actually generate the terrain at that given point. When the conventional Far Lands start, despite both low noise and high noise overflowing simultaneously, selector noise still functions normally, meaning that there is still a large amount of possible variation in the shape of the Far Lands.\nWhen selector noise does eventually break, which happens at roughly 1,004,065,920 blocks from the world origin, it follows that the variation between low and high noise also breaks down. Like how the usual Far Lands is a series of straight tunnels, the Farther Lands divides the world into a series of straight regions, with low noise used exclusively in one region and high noise in others. As such, the variation usually seen in the Far Lands vanishes after the Farther Lands.\nThe Corner Farther Lands take this effect to an extreme: while the normal Corner Far Lands are rich in nuance, the Corner Farther Lands are almost devoid of it. The beginning of the corner makes this all the more obvious, and also highlights edge Farther Lands-corner Far Lands intersections, making the aforementioned straight line regions clear to see.\nBefore inf-20100327.\nTerrain generation was much simpler in versions before March 27, 2010. While in modern versions, the noise generator used for terrain is 3D, earlier versions used a purely 2D noise generator for the world instead. The resulting terrain was much more cliff-based as a result, and overhangs were an impossibility. In addition, noise incremented much slower than the modern noise generator does, resulting in it overflowing at 33,554,432 blocks out (coincidentally a power of 2).\nRather than featuring a series of holes, this noise generator instead created a huge, featureless wall as it broke, as the purely 2D nature of the noise forbids any overhangs from generating. This wall is completely solid stone and extends infinitely outwards when it starts. Occasionally, the faces of this wall may appear ridged like a radiator or heat sink, resulting in a slightly more gradual transformation of the terrain.\nFurther investigations.\nWhile largely removed as of Beta 1.8, simple modifications to the game can effectively reintroduce them, in which case they behave effectively identically to how they did before, but much more stable due to the fixing of the vast majority of high-distance precision loss effects in earlier versions which caused lag and hindered movement. In addition, several aspects of the Far Lands persisted into later versions:\nModding has allowed for y-axis Far and Farther Lands, the Fartherer and Farthest Lands, and 64-bit versions of the Far and Farther Lands (distinct from the Fartherer and Farthest Lands in while they appear at the same locations as them, they result from 64-bit noise breaking normally rather than the modulo that prevents 32-bit noise from breaking itself breaking) to be seen in their natural habitats.\nGenerated structures.\nBrick pyramid.\nBrick pyramids were tall experimental generated structures made up exclusively of &lt;a href=\"bricks\"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt;. They were added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100227-1\"&gt;Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1&lt;/a&gt; and they were removed from the game in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100327\"&gt;Java Edition Infdev 20100327&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese were entirely composed of bricks - the pyramids did not have any rooms inside, however caves could generate through them &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100325\"&gt;Java Edition Infdev 20100325&lt;/a&gt; due to caves being able to generate through any blocks at the time (including trees and other structures they should not be able to).\nThese were most likely intended for testing structure generation in infinite worlds. As blocks did not drop items at the start of Infdev due to entity code still being reworked, brick blocks could not be collected from pyramids for most of their existence.\nStarting house.\nThe starting house was a building which generated at the center of Indev maps. The player would spawn inside of the starting house when the world was first generated.\nThis structure was added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31%2020100124\"&gt;Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100124&lt;/a&gt;, and was initially comprised of &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, with two &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;Torch&lt;/a&gt;es inside. The starting house was reworked in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%2020100214-1\"&gt;Java Edition Indev 20100214-1&lt;/a&gt;, having a &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; floor and walls made of &lt;a href=\"oak%20planks\"&gt;oak planks&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly iterations of the starting house contained a series of chests, which would harbor almost every block and item in the entire game at that point. These chests went through a series of changes, before being removed from the starting house entirely in later iterations.\nThe starting house was removed at &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100227-1\"&gt;Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1&lt;/a&gt; due to terrain generation being redone to accommodate infinite worlds, ditching the limited worlds of Indev and earlier.\nObsidian wall.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100227-1\"&gt;Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1&lt;/a&gt;, two obsidian walls generated in the world as to mark the orthogonal directions. One of these walls would appear where the X-axis was at 0, and another where the Z-axis was 0. The player would spawn at the point where these two walls intersected.\nLike with the brick pyramids, these were a debugging feature, and were not implemented as a source of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for players due to the inability for blocks to drop items at the time.\nThese walls would no longer generate as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100313\"&gt;Java Edition Infdev 20100313&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonolith.\nMonoliths were a terrain bug which existed from late Infdev to late Alpha. Occurring when the noise generators for handling the shape of terrain output specific values, these structures would consist of the terrain being \"inverted\" in a given region of space. Outwardly, they appear as sheer stone cliffs which reach the top of the world. Ore and sediment &lt;a href=\"ore%20%28feature%29\"&gt;blob&lt;/a&gt;s could be seen to generate in the sides of these, as could water and lava &lt;a href=\"spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;s. Further examination of these reveal that the area underneath these monoliths is completely empty all the way down to the bedrock layers, further proving that the terrain is \"inverted\", as air regions and solid regions have completely switched places. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; would generate in this empty space below monoliths, as the game would consider any air space below a given point that did not belong to a cave or other structure as an \"ocean\", and fill it with water accordingly.\nDue to being \"inverted\" sections of terrain, it is exceedingly likely that monoliths would generate up infinitely (or at least up until the vertical Far Lands) were they given sufficient space. Due to their version range, they were limited to 128 blocks. Monoliths could also fully enclose regions of normal terrain - when seen from below, these would appear as sheer cliffs, like all non-monolith terrain.\nMonoliths came with the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100611\"&gt;Java Edition Infdev 20100611&lt;/a&gt;, which overhauled terrain a third time in the Infdev development period, they persisted up until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.1.2_01\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2_01&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha v1.2.0 redid terrain generation once more, such that completely different noise generators were used for terrain, which no longer had he potential to cause these bugs. However, despite this, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Customized\"&gt;Old Customized&lt;/a&gt; worlds were still capable of generating monolith structures by defining a negative \"Biome Scale Weight\" value from snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w17a\"&gt;Java Edition 14w17a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt; to snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w05a\"&gt;Java Edition 18w05a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt;, but with the removal of the \"Customized\" world type altogether in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w06a\"&gt;Java Edition 18w06a&lt;/a&gt; for 1.13, this can no longer be recreated. Monoliths could be generated again from 1.16 to 1.17.1 by using customized worlds to set a biome's scale to a negative number.\nPlaceholder trees.\nThere are several cases in the game in which unique species of tree use the logs and leaves primarily associated with other trees. Two prominent examples are pine trees, which use spruce logs and leaves, and swamp trees, which use oak logs and leaves, rather than either of these having dedicated blocks. As a result of this, they cannot be grown from saplings, and can only be encountered when generating new chunks.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;'s development, when biomes were being added to the game, two trees were added to the then-new biomes which also reused the logs and leaves of existing trees. However, these were a temporary measure, as later in development, they were given logs and leaves of their own, alongside saplings, planks and further wood products.\nSpecifically, these were the acacia tree, and the dark oak tree. The acacia tree reused jungle logs and oak leaves, and dark oak trees used spruce logs and oak leaves.\nVillage aspects.\n&lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;s have seen multiple changes in generation since their introduction. Due to these changes, some may consider villages which generated in previous versions, or at least certain buildings within them, as \"removed\" structures.\nOld village.\nOld villages and old zombie villages could generate in plains, savanna, taiga, ice plains, and desert &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. The type of &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore the style of all structures within it, was determined by the biome where the village well was located. All village biome variants were essentially palette swaps of each other, with the exception of one house in the old ice plains village, which would generate with randomized crop items such as &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s. The \"old villages\" were not known as such until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt;.\nGravel roads.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10\"&gt;Java Edition 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s used &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; underneath to signify roads; however, in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10\"&gt;Java Edition 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grass%20path\"&gt;grass path&lt;/a&gt;s were added to signify village roads. However, grass paths sensibly were only generated where they replaced &lt;a href=\"grass%20blocks\"&gt;grass blocks&lt;/a&gt;, and gravel paths still existed until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"jigsaw\"&gt;jigsaw&lt;/a&gt; system broke it.\nSavanna village.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10\"&gt;Java Edition 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, plains villages would generate in savanna &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. Plains villages was replaced by savanna villages made out of acacia derived blocks.\nDesert village.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.3.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.3.1&lt;/a&gt;, plains villages would generate in desert &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. Plains villages was replaced by desert villages made out of sandstone derived blocks.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, plains wells would generate in desert villages. Plains wells was replaced by desert wells made out of sandstone derived blocks.\nGlass pillars.\nGlass pillars were added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease%203\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3&lt;/a&gt;. They were used to mark the location of &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s, as the &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt; did not lead to strongholds yet. One pillar extended from the main entrance and another from the portal room. They went all the way up to the build limit. This was because Jeb forgot to remove the debug pillars before releasing the version publicly. They were removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease%204\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4&lt;/a&gt;, due to eyes of ender being able to lead players to the stronghold portal room.\nMap settings.\nCloud customisation.\nThe color and height of clouds could be changed in Indev, however this functionality was removed in Infdev. Unlike many other things now customizable in Java Edition via &lt;a href=\"custom%20world%20generation\"&gt;custom world generation&lt;/a&gt;, this is yet to see a return.\nIsometric screenshot.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; versions of \"Minecraft\", players could take a screenshot of the map from an using . When the game captured an isometric image, it would save the current location of all mobs and show any and all alterations to the map the player had made that would be visible from the perspective of the sun (at sunrise). The player would not be visible unless the player was in third-person view before taking the isometric screenshot.\nThe isometric screenshot would save to their local user folder as \"mc_map_####.png\" where #### represents the number of the screenshot starting at 0000 up to 9999.\nThere are some limitations that existed with the screenshots:\nThis feature was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; due to the addition of infinite worlds.\nIndev map settings.\nDuring the development of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;, there were settings to change level's theme, type, shape and size.\n\"Winter Mode\" map type.\n\"Winter Mode\" was a randomly occurring map type in Alpha. It was added on July 9, 2010, in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.4\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.4&lt;/a&gt; and was the first \"biome\" to appear in \"Minecraft\".\nThere were a couple of differences compared to normal worlds. First, there was the presence of snowflakes, which fell constantly. There were four different kinds of snowflakes. These snowflakes would create snow on surfaces directly exposed to the sky, provided that it was a solid block. Due to a lack of unfrozen water, &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Cane\"&gt;reeds&lt;/a&gt; were rare. The second element unique to \"Winter Mode\" was the presence of ice. When a map was generated, most exposed water blocks would be frozen into ice. The water did not freeze completely near gravel beaches. The third element was a decrease in the spawning rate of passive mobs.\nWhether a world was in \"Winter Mode\" was determined with a 25% chance at creation.\n\"Winter Mode\" was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.2.0\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.0&lt;/a&gt; with the addition of proper biomes.\nBiomes prior to 1.7.2.\nVersions prior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;1.7.2&lt;/a&gt; had two biomes that were later removed from the world generator. Despite being unused, they continued to exist until Java Edition 1.18, in which mountain edge got removed.\nThe following biomes became unused in 1.7.2:\nBiomes prior to Beta 1.8.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s received a major overhaul, removing and changing many of them. Prior to these changes, there were 13 biome types that were much smaller and less distinct.\nBiomes prior to 1.18.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.18\"&gt;1.18&lt;/a&gt;, terrain height is no longer controlled by biome, so the following height variations biome have been removed and had their code merged into the main one:\n\"Customized\" world type.\n\"Customized\" was a &lt;a href=\"world%20type\"&gt;world type&lt;/a&gt; that gave control over many settings that affected terrain generation, such as ores, sea level, biomes, structures, and many variables that govern the random shape of the terrain. It was introduced in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w17a\"&gt;14w17a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;, and was removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w06a\"&gt;18w06a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt;. Although customized worlds were added back in the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt; snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w21a\"&gt;20w21a&lt;/a&gt;, there is currently no in-game menu to modify worlds; custom worlds can be generated only by importing a JSON file.\nSounds.\nAudio loops.\nLoops were unused &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s, found in the game files, and were possibly meant for when the player is in a specific type of location (i.e., in caves, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s, oceans and beside a waterfall). These sound effects were only appeared in &lt;a href=\"C418\"&gt;C418&lt;/a&gt;'s June 4, 2009 Sound Test.\nThey were found in codice_1, and could be converted to reveal four loops, of birds chirping, cave chimes, ocean and waterfall noises.\nUnused.\nThese features never had any functionality in-game.\nOther.\n\"Play Tutorial Level\" button.\nAn unclickable \"Play Tutorial Level\" button was added to the main menu during Indev. With the addition of &lt;a href=\"texture%20pack\"&gt;texture pack&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%201.2.2\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.2&lt;/a&gt;, the button was removed. No tutorial level had actually existed during that time.\nTextures.\nFluff.png.\nIn Infdev, a texture called codice_2 was added. It was used as a texture for clouds from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100611\"&gt;Infdev 20100611&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100618\"&gt;Infdev 20100618&lt;/a&gt;, but became unused in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100624\"&gt;Infdev 20100624&lt;/a&gt; and was removed by &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.2&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"chunkinfo\" command.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt; (snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w30a\"&gt;14w30a&lt;/a&gt;) to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt; (snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w45a\"&gt;17w45a&lt;/a&gt;), the file codice_3 contained translation strings for a codice_4 &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;, which never existed in game. The following keys existed:\nIt is unknown if this command was used for development or was simply a dropped feature.\nOther.\ncommand_blocks.pdn.\ncodice_5 was an unused file added in &lt;a href=\"15w34a\"&gt;15w34a&lt;/a&gt;. This file was created with the program, and presumably was used in creation of the textures for impulse, chain and repeat types of &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;, added in the same snapshot.\nAs the file in .PDN format, codice_5 also has layers. From 10 layers, by default, only \"Back Shadow\", \"Back Panel\", and \"Orange Back\" layers are visible, forming back texture for impulse command block. \"Background\" name is given to first created layer in image by program and layer is old texture for command block, which indicates that all other layers were created on its basis. From final textures those layers are differs by lack of animation frames and different colors for lamps on panels.\ncodice_5 was removed in &lt;a href=\"15w34b\"&gt;15w34b&lt;/a&gt;.\ncalm4.ogg.\ncodice_8 was a &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; file (alongside the other tracks) that was beta-tested and created by &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; himself. The song is 3 minutes and 13 seconds long. It consists of an upbeat synth, battle-like tune. At 1:36, Notch can be heard saying \"&lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Specifications\"&gt;Mojang Specifications&lt;/a&gt;\" in slow-motion.\nThe track is believed to have appeared and disappeared in the downloaded game files multiple times, but exact dates or versions are unknown.\nWith the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;1.6.1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt;, playing older versions with the track codice_8 does not allow the track to be heard, since music is downloaded separately from the jar files.\nOn February 1, 2020, codice_8 was reuploaded by Notch on his &lt;a href=\"https%3A//soundcloud.com/markusalexei\"&gt;SoundCloud page&lt;/a&gt; with the name &lt;a href=\"https%3A//soundcloud.com/markusalexei/magnetic-circuit\"&gt;\"Magnetic Circuit\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nToggle rain with.\nIn early Indev versions, pressing would toggle between rain and clear.\nSpawning nether portals with.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.2.2a\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2a&lt;/a&gt;, players had the ability to spawn &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s by pressing . In &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.2.2b\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.2b&lt;/a&gt;, spawning nether portals using was removed.\nTime control with and.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8%20Pre-release\"&gt;Beta 1.8 Pre-release&lt;/a&gt;, as a result of remaining debug code, players had the ability to use and to control in-game time. In &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8%20Pre-release%202%20%3B%29\"&gt;Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2&lt;/a&gt;, the functionality of and was removed.\n\"Player Activity\" button.\nThe \"Player Activity\" button in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Realms\"&gt;Minecraft Realms&lt;/a&gt;\" was added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.5\"&gt;1.5&lt;/a&gt;, but it was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14.4\"&gt;1.14.4&lt;/a&gt; for unknown reasons. This button was used to show the online activities of players.\nTexture pack.\n&lt;a href=\"Texture%20pack\"&gt;Texture pack&lt;/a&gt;s were added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.2.2\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.2&lt;/a&gt;, and were replaced with &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w24a\"&gt;13w24a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;1.6.1&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"3D Anaglyph\" option.\n\"3D Anaglyph\" is an option in video settings that applies a red-cyan stereoscopic effect, enabling the use of red-cyan 3D glasses to experience the game in more depth. This option was removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w43a\"&gt;17w43a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt; due to 3D glasses becoming less popular.\nVoid fog and particles.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8%20Pre-release\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release&lt;/a&gt; up to its removal in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w34c\"&gt;Java Edition 14w34c&lt;/a&gt;, a fog effect and particles would appear in the lower 16 blocks of the world.\nDispensing command blocks.\nFrom snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w07a\"&gt;14w07a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s had the ability to place &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s, when activated. This feature was removed as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8.6\"&gt;1.8.6&lt;/a&gt; to solve a security issue.\nMobs running from creepers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;, mobs ran away from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s that were about to explode. In &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8.1-pre1\"&gt;1.8.1-pre1&lt;/a&gt;, this feature was removed because every mob that had the ability to run from a creeper was looking for an exploding creeper every &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;, degrading performance.\nWater evaporating on magma blocks.\nIn snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2016w20a\"&gt;16w20a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10\"&gt;1.10&lt;/a&gt;, water evaporated on top of &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s when randomly ticked. From snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w07a\"&gt;18w07a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt;, whirlpool &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s are produced on top of magma blocks instead.\nSplashes.\nNote: When a line of splash text is removed, the line it occupied in codice_11 is deleted, meaning the line number of all subsequent splashes lowers by one.\n\"Super Secret Settings\" button.\nThe \"Super Secret Settings\", added in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w38a\"&gt;13w38a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;, were removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;1.9&lt;/a&gt; due to an internal rewrite. It was a button under the &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; menu that, when pressed, would blare a random game sound with a lower pitch, and activate a &lt;a href=\"Shaders\"&gt;shader&lt;/a&gt;.\nNative Twitch.tv integration.\nNative integration was added in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w47a\"&gt;13w47a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.4\"&gt;1.7.4&lt;/a&gt;, and was removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;1.9&lt;/a&gt;. It integrated Twitch chat into the game.\nentity.hanging.place and entity.hanging.pop.\ncodice_12 and codice_13 were two sound effects added in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w49a\"&gt;15w49a&lt;/a&gt; and removed in the next snapshot, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w49b\"&gt;15w49b&lt;/a&gt;. The sound effects were blank audio files and were likely intended as sound effects for the &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld conduit particle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; was added in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w15a\"&gt;18w15a&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt;, but those particles were changed in the next snapshot, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w16a\"&gt;18w16a&lt;/a&gt;.\n/locate New_Village.\nThere was a locate command called . This was implemented in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w48a\"&gt;18w48a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; structures from &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt; and prior were removed. Once these \"old\" villages were officially taken from the game's structure spawn list in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2019w02a\"&gt;19w02a&lt;/a&gt;, was replaced by as the codice_14 ID was no longer needed.\nFirst-person view pivot.\nRemoved in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;1.14&lt;/a&gt; for performance reasons. Before changed, the player could not look directly upwards or downwards.\nPlaceholder block drops.\n&lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt; introduced block &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt;, which were mapped as follows:\nBlock drops were reworked in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinimized textures.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt;, item &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; were restricted to the cube shape used for blocks. The projected texture was the same on all faces and the texture scale was closer to those of blocks, making it look cropped.\nTags.\nThe codice_15 and codice_16 tags were added in snapshots &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w07a\"&gt;18w07a&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w07b\"&gt;18w07b&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt; respectively and removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w10c\"&gt;18w10c&lt;/a&gt;. Before the removal, these tags functioned as follows:\nJava launcher easter eggs.\nPrior to the release of &lt;a href=\"Launcher%202.1.497x\"&gt;Launcher 2.1.497x&lt;/a&gt;, the launcher contained multiple easter eggs. If the player hovered their cursor over the \"Play\" button for a few seconds, a random mob would appear in the bottom right corner of the launcher. In the top left corner of the launcher, the player could see a translucent &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; face. There was about a 1\u204411 chance of the creeper face being replaced with a shrugging , \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. When the player clicked on either of these, they turned solid white. Clicking them again would return them to their translucent state. In addition, if the player pressed +, the &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt; pickup sound would play.\nOld walking animation for mobs.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt;, mobs (&lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s) had different walking animations.\nCreeper melee attack.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s did melee damage () to the player. In &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31\"&gt;Indev 0.31&lt;/a&gt;, this feature was removed.\nRemoved with the 1.3 server split.\nWhen 1.3 split client and server logic, several features lost significant functionality. While some of these have been effectively restored or at least substituted, many of them remain moved to this day."}

Also, only blocks whose ID's have not been replaced are listed here. This means that classic &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"locked%20chest\"&gt;locked chest&lt;/a&gt;s and similar blocks are not on this list. \nThe first table \"does not\" include blocks pre-generated inside inventories, the second table includes block items only obtainable through the Inventory, Indev House, or Beta 1.6 TB3 chests.\nReverted potions.\nBefore snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;1.9&lt;/a&gt;, potions had a form known as \"reverted\". In the inventory, reverted potions looked identical to their base potion, much like mundane and mundane (extended) potions, and their usage was also identical to their base potions, with the exception of turning into reverted potions rather than base potions. The only difference was the data values.\nThere were two general methods to create reverted potions, one of which involved the addition of &lt;a href=\"fermented%20spider%20eye\"&gt;fermented spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s. Reversion, in general, referenced changing a longer, upgraded potion into its original weaker potion (for example, changing from a potion of Poison (extended) into a potion of Harming (reverted) by adding fermented spider eye).\nA good example of this process at work is the reversion of a potion of Weakness. A potion of Weakness can be made in two ways. The first method is by adding a fermented spider eye to a mundane potion (water bottle + &lt;a href=\"ghast%20tear\"&gt;ghast tear&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"glistering%20melon%20slice\"&gt;glistering melon slice&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;), then adding redstone dust to produce a potion of Weakness (extended). The second method is by adding a fermented spider eye to either a potion of Strength or a potion of Regeneration. Potions of Strength and Regeneration, in their base or extended forms, produce potions of Weakness with equal magnitude (for the sake of this example, fermented spider eye is added to a potion of Strength (extended) to produce a potion of Weakness (extended)).\nNow, there should be two potions of Weakness (extended). Glowstone dust could be added to the potion of Weakness (extended), which reverted the potion into a base potion of Weakness. The act of reducing the duration from 4:00 to 1:30 was reversion.\nHorse saddle.\nHorse saddles worked just like regular &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;s, but for &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s, which were added in the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w16a\"&gt;13w16a&lt;/a&gt; snapshot. They could be crafted from 5 &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. Horse saddles were removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w18a\"&gt;13w18a&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlowness Arrows.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10\"&gt;Java Edition 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, slowness arrows dropped by strays contained a different NBT tag from slowness arrows crafted. The different NBT tag was fixed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10.1\"&gt;1.10.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining\nData-retaining minecarts.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.10.2&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; of any type was broken a specially named minecart was dropped. In this version, the game messed up when separating the minecart from the item inside, and accidentally let the minecart retain its previous data. The minecart obtained would be named entity.MinecartRidable.name, entity.TNTMinecart.name, entity.FurnaceMinecart.name, Minecart with Chest, entity.MinecartCommandBlock.name, entity.SpawnerMinecart.name, and Minecart with Hopper.\nObtaining:\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-95922\"&gt;Link to the bug report on the Minecraft bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;\nFish.\nPrior to Java Edition 1.13, the item now referred to as cod was simply known as fish, and had a generic texture strongly unlike the &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt; texture used currently. These were substituted out of the game in much the same way as roses.\nPotions.\n&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease%202\"&gt;Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2&lt;/a&gt; implemented 32 types of &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s for a complex brewing system involving &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s, which were functional but unavailable. These potions had effects and appeared to have different colors than the current potions. &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease%203\"&gt;Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3&lt;/a&gt; replaced the cauldron brewing system with the &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt; system used in the final game, and removed the effects and colors of the old potions. Only the mundane, awkward, and thick potions were used in the final brewing system, leaving 29 types of potions with no effect unused in the game. They were later removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w44b\"&gt;15w44b&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;1.9&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese potions could be obtained only by using the following command: . Adding a multiple of 64 to the value would result in the same potion. As with other potions at the time, adding 16384 to the value would result in a splash version of the given potion."}

{"id": "24616", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24616", "title": "Java Edition unused features", "text": "Since the beginning of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\"'s development, there have been a number of features added to the game that have no actual use in Survival or in Creative. Some of these features are leftover from removed features, or simply placeholders for new features.\nNote: that this page documents only unused features that are currently in the game. See &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20removed%20features\"&gt;Java Edition removed features&lt;/a&gt; for features previously in the game that are no longer available.\nBlocks.\nUnobtainable block state combinations.\nCertain blocks have certain combinations of block states that cannot be encountered in usual Survival gameplay, and instead require using &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"debug%20stick\"&gt;debug stick&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"debug%20world\"&gt;debug world&lt;/a&gt;, or certain glitches, many version-specific. Some may also be able to be created via update suppression methods, or be able to be created in older game versions and updated forwards. As these are impossible to encounter, mapmakers may be able to use some of them as blank slates and remodel these using model files for custom blocks as these will not be able to be encountered in any gameplay. Note, however, that these states are generally fragile.\nEntities.\nGiant.\nGiants are an unused &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; added in &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;. They appear to be a giant &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;. Giants have no movement AI, therefore they are unable to walk around. They cannot spawn naturally because the game requires the light level to be both greater than 11 and less than 8 and those conditions cannot be met in vanilla. This makes them impossible to appear through &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGiants can be summoned only by using the command.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"20w14infinite\"&gt;2020 April Fools' snapshot&lt;/a&gt;, the giant is able to naturally spawn on occasion in custom dimensions.\nThe Killer Bunny.\nThe killer bunny is a variant of the rabbit that is hostile toward all &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s and tamed &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. Its fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;'s vertical eyes.\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops quickly toward the player, much faster than a normal rabbit. It moves in a style similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;. Once it closes in, it lunges at the player, dealing a fair amount of damage. If the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player. Killer rabbits are also immune to the Thorns &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; as well, including tamed wolves. These wolves, in turn, turn hostile and attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature. It still attacks wolves (both tamed and untamed).\nThe killer bunny can be spawned only with the command.\nZombie Horse.\nZombie horses are a variant of &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s that were added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.6.1&lt;/a&gt;, along with normal and skeleton horses. There is a zombie horse &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; available only in creative mode, but they remain unused in &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to spawn eggs, zombie horses can be spawned with the command.\nIllusioner.\nThe illusioner is an unused &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt; that was added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.12\"&gt;Java Edition 1.12&lt;/a&gt;. Like other illagers, they attack &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s within a 12 blocks range. It attacks with its spells, and with its &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent, and a spell that summons duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible. \nThe illusioner has a face that is just like the face of an &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of a &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllusioners can be spawned only with the command.\nMinecart with Monster Spawner.\nMinecart with monster spawner is a combination of a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinecarts with monster spawners cannot be obtained as an item in the inventory, and can only be placed using the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe monster spawner inside the minecart acts the same way as normal monster spawners, and the mob being spawned can be changed with codice_2.\nWhen killed, minecarts with monster spawners drop 1 .\nUnused paintings.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.5.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.5.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of paintings to Pocket Edition, four unused 32\u00d732 paintings were present in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"kz.png\"&gt;kz.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; which remained unused. They were also added to Java Edition in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2022w16a\"&gt;22w16a&lt;/a&gt;. They cannot be placed by default, but can be summoned by &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; (such as ) or through a &lt;a href=\"datapack\"&gt;datapack&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Zbihlyj\"&gt;Helen Zbihlyj&lt;/a&gt;, these paintings were originally added \"as part of a Pocket Edition promo map\" (no footage found) which was planned to be a part of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; promotion at &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202012\"&gt;MINECON 2012&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202013\"&gt;or 2013&lt;/a&gt; and have never been used in game. The artist of these paintings remains unknown.\nPotions.\nThe uncraftable potion is a potion added in the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt; snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w44b\"&gt;15w44b&lt;/a&gt; with no effect that is unobtainable in survival without cheats as of 1.17. It is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows. It serves as a placeholder for potions that have missing or invalid potion-effect tags, which default to this.\nIt can be obtained using the following command: .\nThere are also potions that cannot be brewed, and give the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; status effects not intended to be received by potions; e.g. Wither, Nausea. Again, these can be obtained only through custom potions.\nStatus effects.\nVarious status effects remain unused in the game. They can be obtained using or &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; NBT data, but have no way of being obtained other than that.\nLuck increases the chance of high-quality loot. Luck can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Luck\"&gt;potion of luck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion%20of%20Luck\"&gt;splash potion of luck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Potion%20of%20Luck\"&gt;lingering potion of luck&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Luck\"&gt;arrow of luck&lt;/a&gt;, which cannot be obtained in survival. \nFrom snapshot &lt;a href=\"19w13a\"&gt;19w13a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1.14%20Pre-Release%201\"&gt;1.14 Pre-Release 1&lt;/a&gt;, the arrows of luck could be obtained from fletcher &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; when the player has the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nBad Luck is the opposite of Luck; it reduces the chances of high-quality loot. Bad Luck cannot be obtained from potions, even in creative mode.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.6.1&lt;/a&gt; snapshot &lt;a href=\"13w23b\"&gt;13w23b&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"health%20boost\"&gt;health boost&lt;/a&gt; status effect was added. It boosted the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s hearts for a temporary time. It could be obtained from eating a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;. Later, in snapshot &lt;a href=\"13w24b\"&gt;13w24b&lt;/a&gt;, golden apples gave the player absorption instead of a health boost, but the effect was still left in the game.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt;, developers gave the Health Boost effect a new texture, despite the fact that it is still not in use.\nSounds.\nAudio loops.\nLoops were unused &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s, found in the game files, and were possibly meant for when the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is in a specific type of location (i.e., in &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and beside a waterfall).\nThey were found in codice_3, and could be converted to reveal four loops, of birds chirping, cave chimes, ocean and waterfall noises. They were removed at an unknown time.\nOthers.\nSome of these sounds are still usable by running:\nCuriously, the \"affectionate scream\" can be heard in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1DhWXAiNgfQ%26amp%3Bab_channel%3DMinecraft%26amp%3Bt%3D63s\"&gt;Nether Update Official Trailer&lt;/a&gt; at 1:03 \u2013 1:04.\nResources.\nVarious resources located in the game's assets files that remain unused.\nPurple arrow.\nPurple arrows were shot by &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt; and acted the same as regular &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, but could not be picked up. The purple arrow used a texture on the same sheet as the normal arrows, but the texture is not currently in use.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt;, a new texture was added for arrows, causing the original arrow texture, including the purple arrows to be entirely unused.\nVillager speech bubble.\nThe villager speech bubble is an image that was added along with the villager.png file in the jar when the trading system was added. It showed a trade, where &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt; could be sold to &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s for another raw chicken. Both raw chickens have the old raw chicken texture. During an interview about villagers, &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; offered a possible explanation: \"We did some experiments with thought bubbles, but it didn't look good. So in the end, after I'd been lead on Minecraft for a year, we just decided to add an interface instead.\" \nThe texture has been partially overwritten by the selection arrows.\nMinecart texture.\nThe texture from the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; model is rarely visible. The texture appears to be dirt, which is an artifact of when the minecart used to act as a portable chest. The \"dirt\" level used to raise when items were put into it. The texture still appears inside minecarts, but it's blocked by a different texture.\nVillager, Vindicator, evoker, and witch hood.\n&lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es are hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s based off the &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, and they have an unused hood texture.\nThe evoker hood can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Mojang\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt; article \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-evoker\"&gt;Meet the Evoker&lt;/a&gt;\" and the witch hood can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w50a\"&gt;18w50a&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"1.14\"&gt;the 1.14 Village and Pillage update&lt;/a&gt;, the villagers also had unused hood textures.\nFootprint particle.\nDespite the particle itself being removed in the snapshot &lt;a href=\"17w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt;, the texture for the 'footprint' particle still exists within the game's jar file.\nBut the texture file has been removed since snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2021w13a\"&gt;21w13a&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe footstep &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; was introduced, but never used in-game. It was removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt;, as part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Flattening\"&gt;The Flattening&lt;/a&gt;\". They were later added as an easter egg item in the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w14%E2%88%9E\"&gt;20w14\u221e&lt;/a&gt; April Fools snapshot with the &lt;a href=\"resource%20location\"&gt;resource location&lt;/a&gt; codice_4. It could be obtained in the \"missing\" dimension or using the command. The particle itself was readded in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2022w13oneBlockAtATime\"&gt;22w13oneblockatatime&lt;/a&gt; which is spawned when the player walks around.\nZombie pigmen, guardian and armor stand.\nThe old texture for &lt;a href=\"zombie%20pigmen\"&gt;zombie pigmen&lt;/a&gt; used to contain the text \"THX XAPHOBIA\" on an unused section of the texture. The texture for the &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; contains the text \"jeb_\", which is &lt;a href=\"Jens%20Bergensten\"&gt;Jens Bergensten&lt;/a&gt;'s nickname. The &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;'s texture also contains the text \"Searge\", which is &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Stoyke\"&gt;Michael Stoyke&lt;/a&gt;'s nickname.\nBanner parts.\nbanner_base and banner_overlay item textures exist but are unused, meaning it was once going to use an item model instead of the original entity model.\nOld zombie villager texture.\nOld texture from 12w32a snapshot still exists in \"textures/entity/zombie\" directory but it's unused.\nMap icons.\nSome extra icons for maps. The white and green arrows are the only ones used normally, though the colored arrows are used for multiplayer .\nSelected and Unselected.\nSquares labeled \"SEL\" and \"UN SEL\" (likely \"SELECTED\" and \"UNSELECTED\") can be found in \"textures\\gui\\container\\creative_inventory\\tabs.png\". Purpose unknown, though they could possibly be used as a template for the selected tabs and unselected tabs with the rest of tabs.png.\nSkeleton melee attack.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s normally wield bows, but if one were to spawn in a skeleton with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, the skeleton can use it like a normal weapon. A similar case happens with &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, in which one spawned with a bow can use it as intended, except the arrow is always on fire, even without lava or enchantments.\nAlex skin.\nWhen the opacity of all pixels is set to 100%, unused textures are visible. The texture features Alex with glasses. It also features what appears to be the texture of Steve's arms implying that the Steve skin was used as a template for the Alex skin."}

What is now known as &lt;a href=\"pre-Classic\"&gt;pre-Classic&lt;/a&gt; refers to the early unreleased versions of \"Minecraft\" during the week from May 10 to May 16, 2009. The next phase, what was later called &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;, lasted from May 17 to November 10, 2009. &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;, short for \"in development\", lasted from December 23, 2009, to February 23, 2010. &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt;, short for \"infinite development\", lasted from February 27 to June 30, 2010. &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; lasted from June 30 to December 3, 2010, and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; lasted from December 20, 2010, all the way through to November 11, 2011. The official release of \"Minecraft\" (\"Java Edition\") came on November 18, 2011, at &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202011\"&gt;MINECON 2011&lt;/a&gt;, and further updates have been released ever since, the most recent being .\nFull release.\nThe full release stage of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;\"Minecraft: Java Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;'s development started on November 18, 2011, and has continued until the present day. At this point of development, the game was considered \"complete\", having both an \"&lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;ending&lt;/a&gt;\" and being ready for ratings and reviews. The game's price also increased from what it was in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt;, but users who previously bought the game were not charged extra.\nBeta.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; development phase started on December 20, 2010 and ended on November 18, 2011. The main goals of this development stage were a larger focus on polishing gameplay, additional content, and stability. The game's price also increased from what it was in Alpha, but users who previously bought the game were not charged extra.\nAlpha.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; development phase started on June 29, 2010, and ended on December 20, 2010. This version also limited the gamemode to Survival, but saw a re-release of multiplayer. At this time, &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; began developing the game full time, causing much more frequent updates. These were also the first versions which had to be purchased, though the price increased in later stages.\nInfdev.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; development phase started on February 27, 2010 and ended on June 30, 2010. During this stage, \"Minecraft\" was only available in single-player &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode and versions were unnumbered under the name &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Infdev\"&gt;Minecraft Infdev&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; rewrote the game code to allow mostly \"infinite\" terrain.\nIndev.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; development phase started on December 23, 2009, and ended on February 27, 2010. It was the successor to the previous &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt; and continued expanding the survival aspects of the game, making it a lot more like the current gameplay. Versions in this stage were either unnumbered or used the same number.\nClassic.\n&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt; was the first long development phase of the game, in which it was constantly improved and updated over several months. It occurred between May 16 and December 23, 2009. The original game mode was &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;, but on September 1, 2009 development began for &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode under the name &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt;.\nPre-Classic.\n&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20pre-Classic\"&gt;Pre-Classic&lt;/a&gt; was the initial development phase of \"Minecraft\", in which the very basic mechanics and elements of the game were developed, tested and improved over the period of less than a week\u2014from May 10\u201316, 2009. It was not originally released to the public, but some versions are now playable via the &lt;a href=\"launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt;."}

This enabled the official updates to be considerably more stable.\nMojang Studios generally releases snapshots on Wednesday. The day had been Thursday, until the release of &lt;a href=\"14w26a\"&gt;14w26a&lt;/a&gt; on June 25, 2014, in the middle of development for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment versions.\nAvailabilities.\nThese versions are publicly available, though they are not auto-installed by the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt; unless the \"Enable snapshots\" checkbox is ticked in the profile editor, and then it will only download the current version's development's set of snapshots and pre-releases. The &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is able to change to other snapshots through the profile editor.\nNaming.\nThere are several development builds of Classic versions of the game which were never released to the public. Some of them are now available through the launcher. In-game, the versions were labeled as their public release counterparts (e.g. 0.0.14a), but had distinct differences from the versions released to the public. Classic 0.24 is the only exception to this rule, as it was labeled simply \"0.24\" in-game, whereas the full release was labeled \"0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST\" \nThere are several builds of Indev 0.31 20091223-1 which were never released to the public. Most were still labeled \"0.30\" in-game. \nThe day before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6\"&gt;Beta 1.6&lt;/a&gt; was released, Mojang created a &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6%20Test%20Build%203\"&gt;Test Build&lt;/a&gt; version that was never released, but was nonetheless a development version for Beta 1.6. Between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.7.3\"&gt;Beta 1.7.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, Mojang began to issue &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8%20Pre-release\"&gt;pre-release&lt;/a&gt; versions, specifically for Beta 1.8 and what then was known as Beta 1.9. As Beta 1.9 came to be re-designated as release version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, candidates subject to release were designated with the prefix \"RC#\".\nThe weekly snapshots for release &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.1\"&gt;1.1&lt;/a&gt; and onward are named by using the format \"YY\"w\"WWn\". \"YY\" is the two-digit year, \"w\" simply stands for \"week\", \"\"WW\" is the two-digit week number within the year, and \"n\"\" is a unique letter identifier \u2013 starting with \"a\", then \"b\", and so on \u2013 for when there is more than one release per week. Currently the highest letter reached is \"e\", a tie between &lt;a href=\"12w30e\"&gt;12w30e&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"13w47e\"&gt;13w47e&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"15w35e\"&gt;15w35e&lt;/a&gt;. The naming convention is, however, broken by &lt;a href=\"13w12~\"&gt;13w12~&lt;/a&gt;. The update that has the most snapshots is release &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;1.9&lt;/a&gt;, with a total of 56 snapshots. The update that has the most pre-releases is release &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt;, with 10 pre-releases.\nPre-releases were originally named as &lt;samp&gt;\"version number\" Pre-release \"x\"&lt;/samp&gt;, where \"x\" was either blank or a revision number; this format was used during development of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.8%20Pre-release%202\"&gt;Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2&lt;/a&gt;). Pre-releases for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; removed the hyphen in the word \"Pre-release\" (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.9%20Prerelease%203\"&gt;Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3&lt;/a&gt;). Pre-release versions until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.4\"&gt;1.7.4&lt;/a&gt; were released as full versions and incremented the minor version number for each pre-release (for example, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4\"&gt;1.4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.1\"&gt;1.4.1&lt;/a&gt; were both pre-releases for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.2\"&gt;1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, and the pre-release for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.7\"&gt;1.4.7&lt;/a&gt; is identical to the full release of 1.4.7). From &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.6\"&gt;1.7.6&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13.2\"&gt;1.13.2&lt;/a&gt;, pre-releases had the format &lt;samp&gt;\"version number\"-pre\"x\"&lt;/samp&gt;, where \"x\" is the revision number (e.g., &lt;a href=\"1.12-pre2\"&gt;1.12-pre2&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;1.14&lt;/a&gt; started naming pre-releases as &lt;samp&gt;\"version number\" Pre-Release \"x\"&lt;/samp&gt; (where the word \"release\" may or may not be capitalized, starting from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.15%20Pre-release%201\"&gt;Java Edition 1.15 Pre-release 1&lt;/a&gt;), where \"x\" is the revision number (e.g., &lt;a href=\"1.14.1%20Pre-Release%202\"&gt;1.14.1 Pre-Release 2&lt;/a&gt;).\nRelease candidates were re-introduced with &lt;a href=\"1.16%20Release%20Candidate%201\"&gt;1.16 Release Candidate 1&lt;/a&gt;. These are intended to be the last version before the full release, unless a major game-breaking bug is discovered. Release candidates are formatted as &lt;samp&gt;\"version number\" Release Candidate \"x\"&lt;/samp&gt;, where \"x\" is a revision number.\nExperimental snapshots were introduced with &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14.3%20-%20Combat%20Test\"&gt;1.14.3 - Combat Test&lt;/a&gt;. This type of snapshot is released only on special occasions, when Mojang developers want to get testing and feedback on a particular set of features that are outside the scope of a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;, but which they cannot currently include in a normal snapshot or in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20version%20history/Development%20versions\"&gt;Bedrock development versions&lt;/a&gt;. As they are exempt from the typical standards of other development versions, there has not been a standard format for the naming of experimental snapshots.\nPromotional screenshots.\n&lt;a href=\"Erik%20Broes\"&gt;Erik Broes&lt;/a&gt; (Grum) appeared in promotional screenshots on the Mojang blog for a number of snapshots and pre-releases. He was often hiding, and occasionally simply his player head was present.

Jukeboxes also drop all of their contents.\nUsage.\nPlayback.\n a &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt; on a jukebox inserts the disc and plays &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; corresponding to the type of music disc used. Pressing on the jukebox again ejects the disc and stops any music playing. Music discs play only once before they must be ejected and reinserted. Note &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; emit out the top when sound is playing. The sound from the jukebox travels roughly 65 blocks in all directions. It supports all available music discs in the game.\n&lt;a href=\"Hopper\"&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to insert a &lt;a href=\"Music%20Disc\"&gt;disc&lt;/a&gt; into a jukebox.\nTamed &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;s dance when in a 3 block radius from a jukebox that's playing a disc. \nAllay duplication.\nIf an &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20shard\"&gt;amethyst shard&lt;/a&gt; is used on an allay dancing next to a playing jukebox, the allay consumes the amethyst shard, emits heart particles, and duplicates into two allays. Both allays have a 5-minute cooldown before they can be duplicated again.\nRedstone component.\nActive jukeboxes give off a redstone signal when a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; is placed directly behind it or through an adjoining block; its strength depends on the ID of the inserted disc. The following table shows the redstone strength output for each disc.\nThey also emit a redstone signal when any music disc is played inside.\nLooping.\nJukeboxes disable adjacent hoppers when a music disc is playing inside them, due to them emitting a redstone signal even without using a comparator. When the song ends, the hopper placed below the jukebox will be re-enabled, so the disc will be automatically ejected and stored in the hopper. A system of hoppers and droppers can then be used to automatically re-insert the disc, causing it to loop.\nIf the hopper under the jukebox is powered by anything else, it will not eject the disc, breaking the loop.\nFuel.\nJukeboxes can be used as a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nNote Blocks.\nJukeboxes can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nPiston interactivity.\nJukeboxes cannot be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s.

{"id": "23581", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23581", "title": "Jungle", "text": "A jungle is a &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; full of dense vegetation which generate in areas with high &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; values, often next to &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s. There are three varieties of jungles.\nDescription.\nLarge oak trees and small or tall jungle trees generate here. &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20tree\"&gt;Jungle tree&lt;/a&gt;s can grow tall and are the tallest trees in the game, with the tallest of them being over 30 blocks in height. Many of the &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s have &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and ferns. &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20Bush\"&gt;Jungle bushes&lt;/a&gt; made of oak &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; or jungle leaves and a single &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; grow on the floor of the jungle, which frequently obstruct view of the light-green grass below. Many of the leaves and logs of both types are covered in &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cocoa\"&gt;Cocoa&lt;/a&gt; pods and &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s generate on logs of small jungle trees and in patches on the ground, respectively. Melon patches are exclusive to jungle biomes, and they generate somewhat more often than &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; patches do in other biomes. &lt;a href=\"Parrot\"&gt;Parrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s exclusively spawn in jungle biomes. Jungles contain varying vegetation, from the typical dense foliage of the main jungle biomes to the grassy meadows that form in sparse jungle biomes.\nJungles are usually bordered by &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"plain\"&gt;plain&lt;/a&gt;s, but also often border &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt;s. Regular jungles are often separated from sparse jungles or bamboo jungles by &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;Jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s may generate in bamboo jungles and regular jungles, which is exclusive to jungle biomes. As these temples are partially made of &lt;a href=\"Mossy%20Cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and also covered in &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, they can prove hard to spot from a distance due to the density of the trees.\nSurvival in jungles can be difficult. While running out of logs is unlikely, obtaining logs can present a challenge due to the heights of jungle trees. Jungle trees are significantly less sustainable compared to other trees, as their leaves drop &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s only 2.5% of the time, compared to 5% for all other trees; this means large jungle trees often drop only enough saplings to regrow them and not plant any new trees, while small jungle trees may not even drop a single sapling. The dense, foliage can easily get a player lost without some sort of trail marker, such as &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and clearing this maze-like foliage for shelter is no easy task, due to both the heights it can reach and the sheer amount of it. However, parrots can make for useful pets when tamed; ocelots cannot be tamed, but can gain trust. They can repel &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, while parrots can alert players of nearby monsters. &lt;a href=\"Cocoa%20bean\"&gt;Cocoa bean&lt;/a&gt;s and melons can also be farmed for &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; and decoration.\nIn jungles, &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; are the only fish which may be caught during &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; . Otherwise, &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cocoa%20beans\"&gt;cocoa beans&lt;/a&gt; can also be collected.\nJungle biomes are significantly more resource-demanding to load and render compared to other biomes. Thus, players exploring in jungles may wish to turn down their graphics settings to avoid lag and FPS drops.The frequency of large jungle trees generated in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; is lower than in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVariants.\nThere are three jungle biome variants: jungle, sparse jungle and bamboo jungle. There are four removed variants: jungle hills, modified jungle, modified jungle edge and bamboo jungle hills in previous versions.\nJungle.\nThe regular biome variant features the distinctive large jungle trees and dense jungle bushes across the ground. Oaks and small jungle trees along with cocoa beans also generate here. Single shoots of &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; may generate on the floor as well. &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;Jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"trail%20ruins\"&gt;trail ruins&lt;/a&gt; may generate in this biome. &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s, parrots and pandas may spawn here.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSparse Jungle.\nThe sparse jungle or jungle edge biome is a sparser variation of the jungle. Oak trees, jungle trees, jungle bushes, and patched melons generate here, though at significantly lower rates than the regular jungle, roughly comparable to the rate of trees in the &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biome, additionally only small jungle trees generate in this biome. Bamboo does not generate here.\nThe grass still takes on a bright green color, though slightly less vibrant than the main jungle. , ocelots, parrots and pandas may spawn in this biome. &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;Jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s do not generate here in both and .\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\n, sparse jungle use the same mob spawning chances as jungles.\nBamboo Jungle.\nThe bamboo jungle is a rare variant with dense bamboos. Oak trees, jungle trees, and jungle bushes are much less dense in this variant than in the regular jungle, and more dense to the sparse jungle, but boasts countless amounts of &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; across its landscape. Patched melons are as common as in regular variants. Some swaths of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s are replaced with &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, similarly to &lt;a href=\"old%20growth%20taiga\"&gt;old growth taiga&lt;/a&gt;s. Naturally-generated trees are large variants; only 2\u00d72 jungle &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s and large, branching oak trees may generate, though many of the oaks are simply small \"balloon\" oaks. Cocoa beans cannot be found here, since they generate only on small jungle trees. All jungle-exclusive mobs spawn here. Pandas have a higher spawn rate in bamboo jungle than in regular jungle. Jungle pyramids may spawn here , whereas there are no jungle pyramids .\nDue to their exceptionally high &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; values, bamboo jungles are almost guaranteed to have &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; generate below them.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Jungle or in the Bamboo Jungle\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Sparse Jungle"}

{"id": "27004", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27004", "title": "0x10c", "text": "0x10c was a space sandbox game that was being developed by &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Persson\"&gt;Markus \"Notch\" Persson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20AB\"&gt;Mojang AB&lt;/a&gt; during 2012 and 2013 as a followup to \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\". It has since been cancelled, and at present it seems unlikely that Notch, or anyone currently working at Mojang, will resume its development.\n\"0x\" is a prefix used in several programming languages to indicate a hexadecimal number. \"0x10c\" (ten to the C power) is a hexadecimal number equivalent to 1612 in decimal, which equals 281,474,976,710,656, which was the number of years that had passed since 1988 in the game's story.\nAnnouncement.\nIn March 2011, Notch was asked in an interview if Mojang had any plans for another game, and Notch expressed his desire to create an \"extremely nerdy\" space trading simulator. Later, in December 2011, Notch announced he would be stepping down as lead developer of \"Minecraft\", and that he would begin working on another project. Mojang CEO &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Manneh\"&gt;Carl Manneh&lt;/a&gt; said in an interview with Edge Online in January 2012 that Mojang was committed to supporting a new project that Notch was developing. In March 2012, he revealed that there were three different projects he was working on, but he had yet to decide which one he was committed to. On March 13th, he announced he would begin prototyping a space game, and on March 21st, in an interview with PC Gamer magazine, he announced that he was working on a space-themed game that was inspired by the television show \"Firefly\" and the video game \"Elite\".\nOn April Fools' Day 2012, instead of a typical \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"April%20Fools\"&gt;April Fools&lt;/a&gt; joke, as was the case the prior year and every year since, Mojang launched a satirical website for a space game entitled \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120402231307/http%3A//marseffect.net/\"&gt;Mars Effect&lt;/a&gt;\", citing a lawsuit with Bethesda regarding the title of the Mojang game \"&lt;a href=\"Scrolls\"&gt;Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\" as an inspiration. However, the gameplay elements remained true, and on April 3, 2012, Mojang revealed it as an actual space sandbox title, \"0x10c.\nThe game's backstory, as told by Notch on the website, was this:\nThe game was to feature:\nOf particular interest was the in-game computer, the DCPU-16. This was a fully functioning emulated 16 bit CPU that could be used to control the entire ship, or just to play games on while waiting for a large mining operation to finish. Full specifications of the CPU were released soon after the game's announcement, so the more programatically advanced of the playerbase could get a head start. These specifications, along with the specifications for several pieces of in-game hardware that would be able to interface with the DCPU-16, can be found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/lucaspiller/dcpu-specifications\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"0x10c\" was planned to require its players to pay a monthly subscription fee in order to access the global multiplayer server that was planned to exist, due to the computational cost of simulating the trajectories and onboard systems of all the players' ships, even when the players piloting those ships weren't logged in. A recurring fee would not be required to play singleplayer, and it's likely there would be the option to play on smaller, privately hosted servers for free, as in \"Minecraft\". The initial cost of buying the game was planned to start out small and increase as the game was developed, similarly to how \"Minecraft's\" price increased during the first few years of its development.\nDevelopment.\nSoon after the announcement of \"0x10c\", Notch began posting on Twitter about his plans for the game, and began putting images of the prototype versions on his website. A &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20180308193746/http%3A//www.0x10cforum.com/\"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//reddit.com/r/0x10c\"&gt;Reddit community&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130725135043/http%3A//0x10cwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page\"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and numerous other fan-made websites were created, and Notch began communicating with fans about the game on the Reddit community as well.\nOn April 16, 2012, Notch posted &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120803014301/http%3A//www.0x10c.com/screenshots/009.png\"&gt;an image&lt;/a&gt; on the \"0x10c\" website containing a puzzle. When decoded, it revealed the word \"Montauk\", which was the password to get into &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120827055415/http%3A//0x10c.com/highnerd/codes.txt\"&gt;another page&lt;/a&gt; on the website, which contained 99 codes which could each be redeemed once on the Mojang website to add \"0x10c\" to the user\u2019s Mojang account, which would have allowed them to play it as soon as the game was eventually released. \"0x10c\" remained part of these user\u2019s Mojang accounts until it was eventually removed from the Mojang account system in 2020.\nOn May 2, 2012, Notch launched an ARG to promote the game. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120629123629/http%3A//psrx0392-15.0x10c.com/\"&gt;A secret page&lt;/a&gt; on the \"0x10c\" website read \"insufficient power\" along with a power percentage. The more people visited this page, the higher the power percentage became until eventually reaching 100%, whereupon &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120505144544/http%3A//0x10cwiki.com/arg/dump.html\"&gt;a large amount of garbled code&lt;/a&gt; was revealed, which the community determined represented radio signals from a pulsar. Discrepancies in the repeating pulsar signals were eventually decoded and revealed to be garbled text taken from Isaac Asimov\u2019s short story \"\", which, like \"0x10c\", also takes place in the extremely distant future of the universe.\nNotch also began livestreaming himself coding \"0x10c\" on Twitch. One of the results of this was viewers were able to copy significant amounts of the code and create a reverse-engineered version of the game. Notch asked that this not be publicly released, as the game was not yet close to a state he felt comfortable releasing. However, a prototype version of the game was accidentally leaked anyway, when Notch uploaded it to a private page on his website but forgot to disallow users from viewing all the site's files. This prototype, featuring a dark room with a computer, can be found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.org/details/0x10c\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, Notch intended for the art style of \"0x10c\" to be mostly textureless, citing the 1993 game \"Frontier\" as inspiration. However, he later changed his mind, and in September 2012, &lt;a href=\"Jonatan%20P%C3%B6lj%C3%B6\"&gt;Jonatan P\u00f6lj\u00f6&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;a href=\"Eldrone\"&gt;Eldrone&lt;/a&gt;, was hired as an artist for the game, and created most of the textures and models seen in the later footage. According to Eldrone:\nProgress continued, and eventually, in October 2012, Notch released several videos on YouTube and the \"0x10c\" website showcasing the progress he had made, including &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.org/details/0x10c-alpha-tests\"&gt;two physics test videos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20121022043028/http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnYojT0Xgt9Y%26amp%3Bgl%3DUS%26amp%3Bhl%3Den\"&gt;an art test video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20121031031507/http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dw2k8QBcaaUM%26amp%3Bgl%3DUS%26amp%3Bhl%3Den\"&gt;a multiplayer test video&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, a semi-playable version, featuring a fully modeled and textured spacecraft with an interior and exterior, functional multiplayer and PVP, and the basics of the in-game computer systems, was created, and Notch livestreamed himself battling other Mojang employees onboard the ship.\nOn October 20, 2012, it was announced on the game\u2019s website that three \"0x10c\"-themed shirts were available to purchase from JINX. One of these shirts had a string of numbers on it that was revealed to be a phone number. When called, it played back a distorted sound clip, which, when enhanced, was revealed to be a message relating to the software error from the game\u2019s backstory.\nLater, on January 21, 2013, Eldrone released a \"Facebuilder\" demo as a preview of \"0x10c\"'s player customization system, created in Unity. This can be found &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.org/details/0x10c-FaceBuilder\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nCancellation.\n\"0x10c\" was eventually put on hold in April of 2013 because Notch had found creative blocks. However, at the time, he was still interested in expanding the development staff to push the game toward release.\nEventually, on August 13, 2013, Notch announced in a \"Team Fortress 2\" livestream that \"0x10c\" was indefinitely shelved, but Notch added that it could be made in the future if another Mojang employee was interested in developing it.\nOn August 19th, Notch wrote on his blog \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Word%20of%20Notch\"&gt;The Word of Notch&lt;/a&gt;\" about his reasons for the game's cancellation:\nHe then expressed his desire to not become \"another under delivering visionary game developer\", and said he would instead focus on making \"smaller games that can fail\" in the future. Regarding \"0x10c\", he said that \"I want to play this game so much, but I am not the right person to make it. Not any more. I\u2019m convinced a new team with less public interest can make a vastly superior game than what I would make.\"\nOn September 15, 2014, following Mojang's acquisition by Microsoft, and Notch's departure from the company, the soundtrack for \"0x10c\" was released by &lt;a href=\"Daniel%20Rosenfeld\"&gt;Daniel Rosenfeld&lt;/a&gt;. He stated:\nEldrone would later release images of additional art assets created for \"0x10c\" on his Twitter and website.\nGameplay.\n\"0x10c\" was planned to have \"\"Minecraft\" in space\" style gameplay. Players would be able to build their own ships using a ship editor. Players would first build the external part, and then go into a room mode with a cutaway view of the ship, in which players would be able to carve out rooms with custom dimensions. Using the ship editor, players would be able to make convex rooms with 45 degree walls, to keep it simple to use, and to encourage the use of multiple rooms. Rooms could have variable height and be placed on different heights. The ship editor would create a more or less empty frame of a ship, and players would then have to place panels and other things manually in the actual game. It would be impossible to design a ship that isn't airtight, as a bounding volume would be made first, then rooms would be dug out after. Things like stripes and names could be placed on the outsides of ships.\nWhile inside a ship, players would always be oriented upright, even in zero-gravity. Outside ships, players would be able to rotate freely in any direction. Everything\u2019s position would be measured relative to the center of the player\u2019s current ship, with the rest of the universe moving around it from the ship\u2019s point of view. Explosions in space would be realistic. When a ship explodes, it begins to leak air and spin around before popping apart. There would be no sound transmission through vacuums, but sounds from ships getting hit by things such as debris from explosions would be audible from inside those ships. Players would keep their ships after respawning.\nSpacecraft would be \"smaller than the nostromo, larger than a tie fighter.\" Smaller ships could be docked inside of and launched from larger ships. Hyperspace travel would also be present. Ships would have sometimes gone dark for various reasons such as power failures, technical problems, and trying to avoid visual detection through windows. Ships would receive and lose heat from thermal radiation. Passive stealth through minimizing a ship's emitted energy would be possible. Crashing into asteroids or planets would damage onboard systems and require players to scavenge for parts to repair their ship. Ships could have specialized rooms, such as medical bays, and mess halls for food. Oxygen would \"magically last forever\", unless there was a hull breach.\nThere would be a large selection of different devices and other objects players would be able to place on their ship. Devices would be able to be overclocked, which may cause them to catch fire. Underclocking devices would let them use less power at the cost of being less efficient. Players would be able to map controller inputs to ingame hardware. There would be electrical and mechanical engineering, rotating rooms, and machines built using the physics engine. It would be possible to build computer-controlled ground vehicles with wheels, batteries, mineral sensors and digging modules. Hardware would be memory mapped to connected computers. For example, an engine would have its power and rotation mapped to a memory region. Players would control the engines, not the ship, which would then push the ship around. Computers would translate the position of enemy ships from sensors into angles for the ship's cannons to use in aiming. Cheap turrets and sensors would have built-in inaccuracy.\nThere would be a large selection of different tools and other items players would be able to use. There would be player XP and skills. There would be a leveling system in which players would level up in specialized skills. Dying would reset the player\u2019s levels. There would be sounds from the player\u2019s body. There would be a player-driven economy system, and building ships and space stations would cost resources. Singleplayer would have optional cheats. Transferring information would be possible through floppy disks and radio arrays. There would be a credits system and an ingame program store. Large bases and structures built by players such as space stations would be shared between games and could be encountered in singleplayer. There would also be randomly generated abandoned ships floating in space, with aliens and robots inside, and loot such as screens and CPUs.\nThere were to be \"very pretty\" stars and planets. Asteroids and planets were \"icosahedrons (20 sided dice) fed to a make-surface-from-arbitrary-triangle-mesh code that subdivides, colorizes and offsets the polygons based off various parameters tweaked per body type\". There may also be \"orbitals and halo worlds\" with planetary terrain on their interiors. Planets would be big enough that 32 players on a planet would \"pretty much never see each other\". There would be planet gameplay, liquid water on planets, and planetary ecologies, though most life would be dead. There would also be many different planet types. Planets would be realistically sized, and there would be realistic orbital mechanics, and rogue planets. The game would not show any planet or star names. Players would be able to mine for gold and other metals. Terrain was not planned to be modifiable, in order to reduce world file sizes.\nSpace was to be very dark, with most surviving stars being fairly dim and small. The number of stars would be \"large enough to feel large, but small enough so that players could map them all if they wanted to.\" There would be an \"explorable number\" of stars, about 100,000. Star positions would be static, but planets would orbit and spin. Stars would be closer together due to the big crunch. Some areas of the universe would have a lot of radiation. There would be neutron stars, and black holes with gravitational lensing around them. Most solar systems would be a brown dwarf with very few surviving planets, though there would be an extremely small number of young stars.\nLighting was planned to be more complex than in \"Minecraft\", which was because \"Minecraft\" focused on many blocks and polygons that could all change at any time, whereas \"0x10c\" focused on modern lighting with very few polygons that rarely changed. For example, computer monitors would illuminate their surroundings with the same colors being displayed on the screen. The game would have a \"this is what we thought the future would be like in the 80's\"-look, and a wireframe graphics mode. Music would take a long time to build up, and there would be a lot of ambient sound effects. The sound engine supported samples, procedural sounds and effects.\nA monthly subscription fee would be required to access a global multiplayer server called the multiverse, due to the computational cost of simulating the trajectories and computers of all the players' ships, even when the players owning those ships were offline. Private multiplayer servers would be free to use, have IP-based and LAN options, and could be run on older versions. The game would run on a local server even in singleplayer. VR support was planned. There were to be a large number of fictional hardware and software developers, and possibly a faction that outlaws open source software. A full time writer for the game was planned.\nFeatures.\nSome of the known devices and items that were planned for the game include:\nMusic.\n0x10c is the soundtrack released for \"0x10c\" by &lt;a href=\"C418\"&gt;C418&lt;/a&gt;, which features several songs created for the game before its cancellation. It was released on September 15, 2014 on Bandcamp."}

The pattern of the podzol reaches at most 6 blocks in the eastern and southern (positive X and Z) directions, and 5 blocks in the western and northern directions.\n, since podzol can be converted from moss blocks, and moss can be grown on renewable &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, dirt can be renewably created as long as there is access to water, lava, moss, spruce saplings and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;.

A podzol block can be turned into a &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt; by pressing on it with any type of &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, but it cannot be tilled with a hoe to make &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;. However, the player can first use the shovel on the podzol to turn it into dirt path, then use the hoe on the dirt path to turn it into farmland."}

Pointed dripstone breaks instantly when hit by a thrown &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;. \nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s can sell 2 pointed dripstone for 1 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-generation.\nStalactites grow extremely slowly, speeding up if there is a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source or a &lt;a href=\"waterlogged%20block\"&gt;waterlogged block&lt;/a&gt; above the dripstone, growing even faster if the block between the water and the dripstone is a &lt;a href=\"dripstone%20block\"&gt;dripstone block&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, if there is a solid block less than eleven blocks below this stalactite, a stalagmite grows on that block toward the stalactite. This growth does not occur if the stalactite's tip is &lt;a href=\"waterlogged\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;, and a stalagmite below does not grow if its tip is waterlogged. They do not grow to more than seven blocks long.\nEvery time the block receives a &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt; there is a small chance of 1.138% () for a stalactite or stalagmite to grow one block, meaning that every single growth step takes an average time of 5 in-game days (100 minutes).\nUsage.\nPointed dripstone comes in two different forms, stalactites and stalagmites. Placing a pointed dripstone between a stalagmite and stalactite without &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; connects them. It can be &lt;a href=\"waterlogged\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;. Mobs can jump up pointed dripstone as long as its height does not exceed four blocks. &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s and other similar mobs can travel up the same pointed dripstone as if they were stairs.\nStalactites.\nStalactites are created when pointed dripstone is placed on the bottom of a block.\nStalactites less than 11 blocks tall passively drip water &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s (or lava particles in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;) in the absence of a liquid source, but these particles do not fill cauldrons. A waterlogged pointed dripstone at the tip of a stalactite does not produce drip particles. Waterlogging other parts of the stalactite does not affect the dripping.\nIf the block supporting a stalactite or any block of the stalactite is broken, all of the unsupported pointed dripstone below the broken block drops, causing damage to any player and mobs standing beneath it, similar to a falling &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of damage is for each block of falling distance after 2 blocks (e.g., a stalactite that falls 4 blocks deals damage). The damage is capped at , no matter how far the stalactite falls. Wearing a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; reduces the damage by 1\u20444, but this costs twice as much durability on the helmet as on other armor pieces. When a player dies by a stalactite falling on them, the &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;\"player\"&gt; was skewered by a falling stalactite\" appears. However, if a player is merely touched by a falling stalactite entity, no damage is dealt unless the stalactite hits the ground in the same block where the player is located. Stalactites with multiple pointed dripstone can cause multiple damage; however, &lt;a href=\"damage%20immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt; prevents most of the damage from additional blocks.\nCauldrons.\nWhen the uppermost block of a stalactite less than 11 blocks tall gets &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;randomly ticked&lt;/a&gt;, it checks for a water source or waterlogged block two blocks above it and a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; within 10 blocks under the tip with no non-air blocks in between. If both conditions are satisfied, there is a (~17.6%) chance for it to drip water and fill the cauldron by one level. If there is a lava source above the stalactite, there is a (~5.9%) chance for it to completely fill an empty cauldron with lava instead, making lava a &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resource\"&gt;renewable resource&lt;/a&gt;. Refilling a cauldron with water or lava averages nearly one \"Minecraft\" day (19+ minutes) although the actual time for any individual refill varies.\nFlowing water and lava will not cause the stalactite to fill the cauldron. The liquid must be a source (or a waterlogged block).\nConverting mud into clay.\nIf &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;\u200c is placed above a block with a stalactite underneath, it eventually turns into &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;. This conversion does not happen in the Nether.\nStalagmites.\nStalagmites are created when pointed dripstone is placed on the ground.\nFalling onto stalagmites multiplies the fall distance by two to calculate the total amount of fall damage, using the formula codice_1. Note that the distance traveled during the last &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt; of falling time is not included in this calculation, making it slightly off at higher distances; see for more information.\nIf a player dies from falling onto a stalagmite, the &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;\"player\"&gt; was impaled on a stalagmite\" appears.\nAll mobs that are immune to fall damage do not take damage from falling into stalagmites, the same applies to the player if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; codice_2 is set to codice_3.\nColumns.\nDripstone columns can be found naturally in &lt;a href=\"Dripstone%20Caves\"&gt;dripstone caves&lt;/a&gt;, they are formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together in mid-air.\nTo create them manually, simply keep stacking pointed dripstones on either the stalactite or the stalagmite or both until they join together, the last pointed dripstone placed being the most slender part of the whole column. Based on the direction of the last block placed, the shape of the column's slender part can vary."}

If there is a group, the second polar bear is a cub.\nThey can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"frozen%20river\"&gt;frozen river&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"legacy%20frozen%20ocean\"&gt;legacy frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt;, also sometimes at the &lt;a href=\"jagged%20peaks\"&gt;jagged peaks&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"frozen%20peaks\"&gt;frozen peaks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nAn adult polar bear drops one of the following when killed:\nKilling a baby polar bear yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nPolar bears can exist in a passive or hostile state. The &lt;a href=\"Breeding%23Baby%20animals\"&gt;cubs&lt;/a&gt; are passive; adults are hostile when with cubs or provoked (unless it's killed in one hit), adults also attack if a player gets near cubs in Bedrock edition.\nIf a cub is attacked, unless killed in one hit, all adults within a 41\u00d721\u00d741 area become hostile toward the player or mob, regardless of difficulty, although in Peaceful difficulty their attacks do zero damage to players. \nAttacking an adult who is within a 16\u00d78\u00d716 area of a cub also provokes other adults within a 21\u00d721\u00d721 area of the attacked adult. \nPolar bears also attack &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es.\nPolar bears attack by rearing on their back legs and mauling down with their front paws. Their swimming speed is equal to the player's, making them difficult to get away from if they are attacking in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolar bears cannot &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; and cubs' growth cannot be sped up.\nThey do not take freezing damage from &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nPolar bears use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nPolar bears have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

The exact chance depends on the style of the village:\nFully grown potato crops drop 2 to 5 potatoes ( per crop harvested on average) and have a 2% chance of dropping an additional &lt;a href=\"poisonous%20potato\"&gt;poisonous potato&lt;/a&gt;. Potato yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, with Fortune III harvesting an average of potatoes. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used to mature the potato to its last stage of growth.\nThe first two potatoes always drop, and then three more attempts are made to drop a potato with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0\u20133 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.\nMob loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s have a 2.5% () chance of dropping either an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% () per level of looting. This gives potatoes the following chances of dropping:\nIf a zombie, husk, or zombie villager is killed with fire, it drops a baked potato instead.\nUsage.\nFarming.\nWhen farmed, potatoes require 8 &lt;a href=\"Block%20tick\"&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt; to grow. However, there are four \"visible\" stages due to having only four distinct textures: every two stages have the same texture, except that growth stage 7 keeps the same appearance as stages 5\u20136, so that only stage 8 has the final, mature appearance. Planted potatoes require a light level of 9 or greater to continue growing. If the light level is 7 or below, the crops instantly un-plant themselves (\"pop off\"). It is not possible to plant potatoes if the light level is too low.\nCrops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is &lt;a href=\"Farmland%23Hydration\"&gt;hydrated&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.\nCrops break if pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\nFood.\nTo eat a potato, press and hold while it is selected in the &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;hotbar&lt;/a&gt;. Eating a potato restores hunger and 0.6 &lt;a href=\"Hunger%23Mechanics\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreeding.\n&lt;a href=\"Pig\"&gt;Pig&lt;/a&gt;s follow and can be &lt;a href=\"bred\"&gt;bred&lt;/a&gt; by a player holding a potato.\n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s can pick up potato items to become willing, which allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 potatoes to become willing.\nTrading.\nNovice-level farmer villagers have a 25% or 40% chance to buy 26 potatoes for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; as part of their trade.\nComposting.\nPlacing a potato into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. This is less efficient than composting with &lt;a href=\"baked%20potato\"&gt;baked potato&lt;/a&gt;es, which has a higher success chance of 85%."}

A command to give a Luck Potion is , while a Potion of Decay can be obtained via . Both are also available in the &lt;a href=\"creative%20inventory\"&gt;creative inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nChest loot.\nTwo Health II potions can be found in the brewing stand on ships in &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, and one splash potion of Weakness can be found in a brewing stand in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basements.\n, the cauldron in a &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt; contains a random potion.\nBartering.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s may &lt;a href=\"barter\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; a potion or a splash potion of Fire Resistance when given a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nPotions are used by pressing and holding with the potion bottle in hand, as with all consumable items. When drunk they bestow the corresponding &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; to the player.\nDrinking a potion while already under the effects of the same potion does not add onto the effect's duration, but simply resets it. A potion effect does not \"downgrade\" if a lower level is activated. For example, if a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; II, drinking a regular potion of Regeneration does not have any effect.\nUsing a potion on a cauldron does not transfer the potion to the cauldron, but begins to play the drinking animation.\nModifiers.\nPotions can be modified in five ways. \nThe modifications of Enhancement and Extension are mutually exclusive. \nEnhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect. For example, the base Regeneration works for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time. \nExtending a potion generally makes it last as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes. \nCorruption.\nThe usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example Swiftness becomes Slowness). Interestingly, corrupting Poison (continuous damage effect) creates a Potion of Harming, an instant damage effect, instead of the continuous healing effect (regeneration) one would normally expect. Corrupting a Potion of Night Vision turns it into a Potion of Invisibility rather than an inverse effect that might be something like blindness.\nCorrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect. All of the \"corrupted\" potions except Harming can be extended, but it is the only one that can be enhanced. , the corruption of Healing II or Poison II potions results in a potion of Harming I.\nBase potions.\nBase potions are potions that have no effect when the player drinks them, but are necessary as the basis for other potions.\nUncraftable Potion.\n, the Uncraftable Potion is a potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay.\nIt is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\nIt can be obtained using the following command: . It is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\nUndead mobs.\nThe effects given by Potions of Healing and Harming are opposite on undead mobs, which includes skeletons and zombies. Potions of Healing cause harm, and Harming heals them. In addition, undead mobs are not affected by Poison or Regeneration. \n, hitting an undead mob with a Regeneration Potion will always register as Regeneration I, no matter the level of the used potion.\nMud conversion.\nUsing a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt; will convert it into &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;, returning a glass bottle with it. This process can be automated with a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;. \nFilling cauldrons with Potions.\n potion bottles may be used on a cauldron to fill it. Using a glass bottle on a cauldron filled with a potion drains it and fills the bottle. Potions cannot be combined in a cauldron, nor can they be mixed with water, but as an added bonus if you use a stack of arrows in a full cauldron you get a stack of tipped arrows. for 1 layer you get 16, 2 layers 32.\nCustom effects.\n, potions can also be obtained with any status effect using and the tag codice_1, which is an array of effects for the potion. See &lt;a href=\"Item%20format%23Potion%20Effects\"&gt;Item format#Potion Effects&lt;/a&gt; for more information, and &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; for a list of effects and IDs.\nData values.\nMetadata.\n, potions use the following item data values to indicate the kind of potion:\nItem data.\nJava Edition.\nNormal potions use an NBT \"Potion\" tag to indicate the potion type. The values of the tag (to be prefixed with codice_2) are:\nUnused potions.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" has &lt;a href=\"History%20of%20textures/Unused%20textures%23Unused%20potions\"&gt;unused potion textures&lt;/a&gt; for several &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;s, along with their &lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion%23Unused%20splash%20potions\"&gt;splash variants&lt;/a&gt;.

These unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.1%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, except for the potion of levitation, which was added in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;Pocket Edition 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;. The textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the &lt;a href=\"texture%20update\"&gt;texture update&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.10.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.10.0&lt;/a&gt;.
