Bees pollinate &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s and, when they do, add honey to their home when they return to it. When full, bee nests or beehives can be harvested with &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Bottle\"&gt;glass bottles&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Honey%20Bottle\"&gt;honey bottles&lt;/a&gt;. If provoked by being attacked or breaking or harvesting their hive or nest without the correct precautions, bees suicidally attack in a swarm.\nSpawning.\nNatural generation.\nNaturally generated &lt;a href=\"Beehive\"&gt;bee nests&lt;/a&gt; generate with 3 bees in them.\nNaturally-generated birch or oak trees have equal chances to generate with a &lt;a href=\"Beehive\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the biome:\nSaplings.\n&lt;a href=\"Oak\"&gt;Oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mangrove\"&gt;mangrove&lt;/a&gt; trees grown from &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s that are within 2 blocks of any &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt; have a 5% chance to grow with a &lt;a href=\"Beehive\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; having 1\u20133 bees in it.\nDrops.\nUpon death, adult bees drop orbs when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or a tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; successfully, is dropped.\nLike other baby animals, killing a baby bee yields no &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nBees do not fly (like &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s or the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;), but instead hover a few &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s above the ground similar to &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBees are &lt;a href=\"arthropod\"&gt;arthropod&lt;/a&gt;s and take increased &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. , they take damage when touching &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, but they don't.\nBees can be attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, even when angered. They can still attack while attached.\nBees usually venture up to 22 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s from their &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; to find something they can pollinate or to attack someone. Bees can venture further away if necessary.\nA bee can fly horizontally and vertically upward through scaffolding but does not fly downward. A bee does not fly through an open trap door or regular door on its own (a bee can be led through a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; with a flower) but babies can fly through the gap above a fence gate in a 1\u00d72 doorway.\nDespite that they appear to be flying, bees can destroy &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s when on top of them.\nPollinating.\nBees leave their nest one by one during the day. They fly around &lt;a href=\"Beehive\"&gt;their nests&lt;/a&gt;, and are attracted to &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flowering%20azalea\"&gt;flowering azalea&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flowering%20azalea%20leaves\"&gt;flowering azalea leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20propagule\"&gt;mangrove propagule&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pink%20petals\"&gt;pink petals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cherry%20leaves\"&gt;cherry leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spore%20blossom\"&gt;spore blossom&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"chorus%20flower\"&gt;chorus flower&lt;/a&gt;s. Bees can pollinate &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt;s and die as a result, despite that wither roses are harmful to them. Bees completely ignore flowers in &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter circling a flower or berry bush for about 30 seconds while making happy buzzing sounds, a bee collects pollen. A bee carrying pollen changes its texture to include pollen spots on its abdomen, and drops pollen &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s to fertilize plants below the bee. \nBees that have pollen may pollinate &lt;a href=\"Wheat%20Seeds\"&gt;wheat crops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato crops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot crop&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beetroots\"&gt;beetroot crops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon%20stem\"&gt;melon stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Berries\"&gt;sweet berry bushes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20stem\"&gt;pumpkin stem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Berries\"&gt;cave vines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"torchflower%20crop\"&gt;torchflower crop&lt;/a&gt;s they fly over. When one of these plants gets pollinated, it advances to another growth stage, similar to using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. To pollinate a plant, bee must be 1 to 2 blocks directly above the plant and must have a valid home hive. A bee can fertilize plants 10 times each time they have pollen, and whether fertilization is attempted each &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; is random (approximately a 1% chance).\nAfterward, the bee flies back into its hive/nest and makes honey. It takes about 2 minutes for the bee to do this. That increases the amount of honey in a hive/nest by 1; there is a 1% chance for it to increase by 2. When the amount reaches 5, honey can be seen dripping from the bottom and front of the hive/nest. A hive/nest must have 5 honey inside before a player can collect &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHousing.\nBees live together in colonies and take any &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; that has enough space as their home. One bee nest or beehive can house up to 3 bees. Homeless bees wander around, searching for empty beehives. Bees can enter a beehive from any side, but exit only from the front. One-way bee-gates can be made in this way.\nBees return to their nest when it &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;s or when it is &lt;a href=\"night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt;. They return even when in biomes that don't rain like &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;. They stay in their nest or hive for at least before coming back out. The bees that come out keep their data (&lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, name, etc.). \nBreaking a nest or hive that contains bees releases all the bees. If a bee nest containing bees is harvested using a &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enchanted\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the bees inside are kept, with their corresponding data, in the hive. They can exit the hive again when it is placed.\nWhen a bee that has pollen enters and then leaves its nest or hive, the honey level of the nest or hive is increased by one. When the honey level of that hive reaches 5, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can harvest it, which then sets it back to 0.\nBecause there is neither &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;daylight cycle&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, bees work without resting in these dimensions. This behavior is distinct from that of the &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, which follow their daily routine according to the time in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of which dimension they are in.\nAttacking.\nAll bees nearby are angered when an individual bee is attacked (unless the bee attacked is killed in one hit), honey or honeycombs are collected (unless a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; is placed under the nest), or a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; is destroyed. Hitting or walking on a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;nest&lt;/a&gt; does not anger bees; it must be destroyed to anger them. When destroyed, a beehive releases any bees that it contained, and the bees will be angry. If the beehive is destroyed with a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; tool, bees outside the hive become angry , while those kept within it remain neutral even after the hive is placed again.\nBees attack and swarm the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; as a group when angered, and the eyes of angered bees turn red. Collecting a &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt; from a nest or hive causes the bees that are currently in that nest or hive to leave and swarm the player unless a campfire is placed below the hive. Bees attack only once, similarly to &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s and non-aggressive &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s. Bees do not deal any damage in &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty.\nIf the player deflects a bee's attack with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, the bee continues attacking until it succeeds in hitting the player.\nWhen a bee's attack on a player succeeds, the player is &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;ed. A bee loses its stinger after a successful attack, cannot attack further, and dies approximately one minute later. This can be delayed with &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt;) that have a 255 potency.\nIt is possible to (quickly) breed at least one angered bee with another, even if it or they had stung and lost the stinger. However, they remain angered and still die later due to having lost their stingers.\nBees also swarm and attack other &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s when &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;d; for example, if a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; accidentally shoots a bee.\nBees become neutral if they fail to land a hit on their target within 25 seconds.\n, a bee's stinger is visible on the player as a small black dot after the bee successfully attacked.\nHoney Blocks.\nBees attach themselves to honey blocks, as if they are \"eating\" the block.\nBreeding.\nBees follow &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s holding &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, flowering azalea, cherry leaves, flowering azalea leaves and &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20propagule\"&gt;mangrove propagule&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is standing still and being followed by bees, the bees go toward the player, face the player, and rest on the ground. They do this until the player moves.\nIf bees are given a &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;, they enter love mode and pair up to create baby bees, granting the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; 1-7 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. The parent bees have a cooldown of 5 minutes (6000 ticks) before they can &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; again. Babies take to grow up. The growth of baby bees can be accelerated using flowers; each use reduces the remaining time by 10%. However, bees' growth timer and breeding cooldowns are frozen while working in a hive; thus, when rapidly growing a population, it may be desirable to temporarily remove the hives.\nAny of the 1- or 2-block flowers can be used for breeding, including the &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt;, even though it usually harms bees that touch it.\nSounds.\nBees use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nBees have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

They fill with honey as bees pollinate flowers and return to their homes and, when full, can either be &lt;a href=\"shear\"&gt;shear&lt;/a&gt;ed for &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s extracted using &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nObtaining.\nNatural generation.\nNaturally generated bee nests generate with 3 bees in them. The bee nests always face south.\nBee nests generate in the following biomes with different chances:\nBreaking.\nBeehives and bee nests can be broken using any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; or by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s fist, though they break faster with an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf a bee nest or beehive is broken using a tool not enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, it drops nothing, and any bees inside emerge angry at the player.\nIf a Silk Touch tool is used, the bee nest or beehive drops itself and any bees inside remain inside. The bees will not become angry when the block is placed.\nIf a bee nest or beehive is destroyed with a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; under it and without a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; tool, they will emerge angry at the player.\nIf broken in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode with bees inside, the bee nest or beehive drops itself and bees inside remain inside.\nCrafting.\nBeehives can be crafted in a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;.

This holds true in any biome in any dimension, and for any flower including &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt;s and flowering &lt;a href=\"azalea\"&gt;azalea&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nBee housing.\nBee nests and beehives can house up to 3 &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s at a time. They can enter through any unobstructed side, top, or bottom, but can exit only from the front, and only if it is unobstructed by a &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt; (including a &lt;a href=\"Opacity%23Types_of_transparent_blocks\"&gt;non-full solid block&lt;/a&gt; ).\nBees fly into a nest or hive at &lt;a href=\"night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, and after loading up with pollen from a flower. They first look for one at the same coordinates as the last one they entered, but if there is no nest or hive there or it already contains 3 bees when they arrive, they search the nearby area for another one.\nIgniting a nest or hive allows any bees inside to escape, possibly catching fire as they flee.\nHarvesting.\nOnce full, bee nests and beehives provide two harvestable products: &lt;a href=\"honey\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach time a &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt; enters a nest or hive covered in pollen, it starts converting it to honey and honeycomb. After it is done, it waits for daylight with no rain (if necessary), then exits to go collect more pollen. When the bee exits, the nest or hive increments its honey level by 1, to a maximum of 5. Once it is full, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it is not a full &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;, starts dripping honey &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron). These changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting.\nTo harvest honey, the player a glass bottle on the nest or hive; the bottle then becomes a &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;. To harvest honeycomb, the player shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycomb items. After harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance).\nAlternatively, honey or honeycomb can be harvested by powering a redstone &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; containing either a or . The dispenser must be placed beside and facing the hive or nest.\nHarvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the player, unless there is a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; directly beneath it or a lit &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; within five &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s below, and the smoke is not obstructed. Smoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire. Placing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage. In \"Java Edition\", the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke. Without a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4\u20135 blocks below the nest.\nRedstone component.\nBeehives and bee nests have &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block. Once the beehive or bee nest is filled with honey it emits a signal strength of five.\nNote blocks.\nBeehives and bee nests can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce bass sounds.\nFuel.\n, beehives and bee nests can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA beehive has a &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; associated with it that holds additional data about the block."}

Journeyman-level weaponsmith villagers sell bells for 36 emeralds.\nUsage.\nWhen a bell is placed near a claimed &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, the bell is claimed, which is displayed by green particles appearing above the bell. A claimed bell defines a gathering site of a village. If the bell is broken, angry particles will appear above the village leader's head.\nWhen the side of a bell is , it produces a sound as well as a \"swaying\" animation.

Bells can be anchored to the side of blocks, ceilings, and floors. Also, if the player the bell while villagers are sleeping, all of the villagers wake up. Bells can be rung only from certain angles; trying from an incorrect angle does not cause the bell to ring.\nIf a player rings a bell, the villagers run to their houses even if there is no raid.\nRaid.\nWhen the bell is rung, villagers within a distance of 32 blocks run into their houses immediately.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;'s first wave appears, , at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house. , bells in the corresponding &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; ring automatically at the start of a raid, warning villagers to return to their houses.\nGlowing effect.\nAdditionally, , if a bell is rung and there is a raid mob within a 32 block spherical range, the &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;Glowing&lt;/a&gt; effect is applied to all raid mobs within 48 blocks, and particles appear. It produces a resonating sound once this process is complete. The raid mobs don't have to be actively participating in a raid to receive the Glowing effect: the effect applies to &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es that naturally spawns in the Overworld.\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s admire bells as golden items.

Beta testing for the update for Android &amp; Windows 10 began on July 31, 2017 and for Xbox One on August 24, 2017. It was submitted to certification for 9 of the 10 platforms on September 15, 2017.

It can rarely (10% chance) be enchanted at level 5\u201319 regardless of being enchanted when spawned.\nTrading.\nJourneyman-level Fletcher &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s offer to &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt; an unenchanted crossbow for 3 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMaster-level Fletcher villagers have a (6.25%) chance of selling an &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; crossbow for 8 emeralds.\nMaster-level Fletcher villagers have chance of selling an enchanted crossbow for 7-22 emeralds.\nUsage.\nDespite using &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s in their crafting recipe, crossbows cannot be smelted into &lt;a href=\"iron%20nugget\"&gt;iron nugget&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWeapon.\nCrossbows are similar to &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, but take longer to load and are slightly more powerful, shooting farther with slightly higher accuracy. Alternatively, they can be loaded with a firework rocket, which flies in a straight trajectory.\nLoad them by them, which makes the player move at sneak speed. Unlike bows, the &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt; can be fired only if the player releases the use button after the crossbow is loaded or if the crossbow finishes its loading animation . At this point, it \"must be used a second time\" to fire its bolt.\nOnce it has reached full charge, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s speed returns to normal. After that, shooting a charged crossbow does not delay any of the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s current action like &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe crossbow can even be placed in another &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; slot or into an &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt; without the &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt; being unloaded or fired. A charged crossbow also remains charged after enchanting it with an enchantment table or with an anvil.\nIn order to use the crossbow, at least one arrow or firework rocket must be present in the inventory. The player can choose the type of arrow to fire based on its location in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;:\nCrossbows take 1.25 seconds (25 ticks) to load. \nThe player can load either an arrow, spectral arrow, tipped arrow (of any effect) or a firework (of any color/type).\n&lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; teleport away from projectile paths, so they cannot be hit with crossbow &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. They can still get harmed by &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt; explosions, either by direct hits or being in the blast radius of one on the ground.\n\"Java Edition\":\n\"Bedrock Edition\"\nFireworks.\n&lt;a href=\"Firework%20rocket\"&gt;Firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s can be fired by loading the crossbow only while holding the rockets in the off-hand. They fly at 32 m/s. Firework rockets with higher flight duration have a longer time before they explode and therefore travel farther; commands can be used to increase the flight time and range of the rocket outside the normal window. Firing a firework rocket uses 3 &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; points per shot.\nFirework rockets also work with the &lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, enabling the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to shoot 3 firework rockets at a time. The increased durability usage stacks, resulting in 9 durability being consumed with each shot.\nA shot firework rocket explodes instantly when it hits a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;. If the firework rocket has no explosion effect, it deals no &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion of a firework rocket deals to points of damage, with one &lt;a href=\"firework%20star\"&gt;firework star&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion has a radius of roughly 4 blocks, which is unaffected by the firework star's &lt;a href=\"Firework%20Star%23Effects\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. Each additional firework star on the rocket deals an additional to points of damage, for a maximum of to with 7 firework stars. The flight duration of the firework increases the maximum range the firework can travel before exploding, but does not affect the damage output. Likewise, the damage remains the same regardless of any dyes used. Unlike an arrow shot from a bow, the firework does not slow down under water.\nFireworks crafted without firework stars shot from crossbows upon contact with terrains, slide on them. They continue their original trajectories as soon as they break contact from the blocks they slid on.\nRepair.\nCrossbows can be repaired in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; by combining two crossbows. Any loaded ammunition is retained from the crossbow in the first slot but sacrificed from the crossbow in the second slot.\nEnchantments.\n&lt;a href=\"Multishot\"&gt;Multishot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Piercing\"&gt;Piercing&lt;/a&gt; are mutually exclusive. Normal methods of &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; allow only one of them to be applied to a crossbow.\nCrossbows have a base enchantability of 1. Enchantments specific to crossbows include &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Charge\"&gt;Quick Charge&lt;/a&gt;, Multishot and Piercing.\nFuel.\nCrossbows can be used as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt; 1.5 &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s per crossbow."}

Both Crowdin projects, which are open to the public, consist of over 100 different &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;s. Users can contribute to any of the languages listed on the project and require a Crowdin account to do so.\nTranslators.\nA user first joining the project is automatically a translator. Translators can contribute by selecting their language of choice, where they can start translating individual strings. Translators can upvote strings by clicking the \"+\" button after a listed string or downvote them by clicking the \"-\" button. The number after the buttons shows the net vote count of each string.\nEach project on Crowdin has a dedicated discussions forum, visible to everyone, in which all project members can participate for formal communication. Likewise, every single string has its own comment section, shared between languages, for discussion on that particular string. However, for informal and direct communication, it is highly advised to use the public &lt;a href=\"https%3A//discord.com/invite/wpD5sPD\"&gt;\"Minecraft\" Translators community Discord server&lt;/a&gt;, run by some proofreaders. In this server, anyone may discuss with translators and proofreaders about topics not limited to just Crowdin. It also contains links to useful and important translation resources, as well channels with updates related to the Crowdin project and the game.\nProofreaders.\nProofreaders are experienced users who have shown high engagement with the project. Having been translators in the past, they have consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of their language along with the willingness to cooperate so as to ensure the project is kept to the highest standards. They have additional permissions, such as being able to approve, disapprove or delete any translation, as well as resolve issue comments submitted by translators.. When approving a translation into the game, they need to ensure consistency throughout the project, which requires familiarity with the game's strings. In addition, they need to account for the game's technical requirements, such as UI and variable limitations, where testing is often needed as well as adjustments depending on the language. Moreover, proofreaders are responsible for enforcing Mojang's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xxDvR2MrPUaxXwNfn-oJX-fBerEsZkfo\"&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt;. They also need to address questions and reports from translators in a timely manner as well as take appropriate measures against bad actors. Finally, proofreaders coordinate with each other and, occasionally, with Mojang employees to resolve issues.\nMojang recruits new proofreaders for a language when deemed necessary. The minimum requirements to be considered are high and long-term project involvement as well as experience with the Crowdin interface, functions and tools. Furthermore, all proofreaders must be over the age of 18. Typically, each language has 1-2 active proofreaders. Once a translator is promoted, their permisions are updated in both projects and they are invited into a private Discord server for proofreaders and Mojang employees only.\nLanguages.\nIt is possible to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//crowdin.com/project/minecraft/discussions/1386\"&gt;request for a new language to be made available for translation&lt;/a&gt; if there is a good reason for its addition and contributors are available to work on it. However, new additions may take many months to be considered by Mojang, and very few applications end up being successful.\nA language only appears in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Minecraft: Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt;\" provided that it meets a high enough approval percentage on Crowdin. Especially in languages \u200b\u200bwith little activity, some strings may not have been properly translated or proofread and can therefore contain mistakes, problems, or even vandalism. Mojang is not responsible for such content and, if an error is found in a language, it should not be reported in the bug tracker but instead addressed directly to the respective proofreaders on Crowdin.\nNew versions.\nAvailable languages, along with their current translations, are updated in the game and launcher, occasionally, following minor or major updates and, hence, it may take a long time for changes on Crowdin to be reflected elsewhere. As of September 2022, language versions in the \"Minecraft\" project are no longer linked to individual game versions. As such, each language version on Crowdin is now of the format \"Version \"n\"\", where \"n\" is the version number, starting from 1.\n\"Minecraft\" glossary.\nIn January 2016, Mojang created a glossary of \"Minecraft\" terms that must be kept untranslated in all languages, including joke ones, as they are standard game terminology. Some of these include the names \"&lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;Enderman&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;\". The glossary is available &lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xxDvR2MrPUaxXwNfn-oJX-fBerEsZkfo\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is used to make the &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;, a block that has the function of letting players respawn in the Nether.\nWhen placed, crying obsidian occasionally produces purple dripping particles, as if it is \"crying\". These droplets are purely decorative.\nUnlike obsidian, crying obsidian cannot be used as a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; frame. &lt;a href=\"End%20crystal\"&gt;End crystal&lt;/a&gt;s also cannot be placed on crying obsidian.\nLight.\nCrying obsidian gives off a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of 10, which does not melt snow or ice. Its blast resistance distinguishes it from other light-emitting blocks.\nNote blocks.\nCrying obsidian can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nPiston interactivity.\nCrying obsidian cannot be pushed or pulled by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s."}

For items without durability, the player must die to remove the item, making removal in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode impossible.\nAll mobs also follow the curse of binding; for example, if wearing a leather helmet enchanted with curse of binding, they cannot take it off to equip their preferred netherite helmet if they found one. A player cannot remove the enchantment using a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; or crafting table; instead, the item returns to the player still cursed. However, if the cursed item is a pumpkin or mob head, placing and breaking the head removes the curse.\nIf the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"gamerule\"&gt;gamerule&lt;/a&gt; is set to codice_2, the player keeps the cursed item even after death. Only breaking the item, if possible, removes it.\nIf a player applies the enchantment to a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; and wears it, the player becomes unable to remove the carved pumpkin. If the &lt;a href=\"gamerule\"&gt;gamerule&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 is set to codice_2 or the player is in Hardcore mode, it becomes impossible for the player to remove the carved pumpkin without cheating in-game or dying in Hardcore mode. This can be used to troll other players, as the pumpkin overlay on the screen makes the game difficult to play. Because pumpkins have no durability, they are the most effective item to use this curse on. However, most players would not deliberately equip a cursed pumpkin, although a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; can be used to forcibly equip it onto a player.\nThe &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt; is the only item affected by Curse of Binding that cannot be equipped.\nThis enchantment does not prevent removal of the affected item from one's inventory until it is equipped."}

If the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is playing on a Mac, they have to press .\nStorage and display.\nHealth and damage are stored as floating-point numbers in units of half-hearts. When displaying the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt;, fractional values are rounded up to the next integer.\nDealing damage.\nPlayers can deal damage by hitting most &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; with targets at close (melee) range. Attacking without any tool (or with items not intended for attacking) does damage, but &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and certain tools do more:\nThere are a few ranged weapons in the game:\nThe values below show the base damage dealt per hit using various weapons. Critical hits do 50% extra damage.\nAttack cooldown.\nWhen a player attacks too quickly, the strength of attacks is reduced. The base damage done (as a fraction of the full possible damage) depends on the time between attacks, which is also reflected in the height of the held weapon on screen and the attack indicator bar (configurable in the &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; menu):\nThe codice_2 attribute controls the length of the cooldown time, with the time taken being codice_3 ticks. The damage multiplier is then codice_4, restricted to the range 0.2 \u2013 1, where codice_5 is the number of ticks since the last attack or item switch.\nDamage done by &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt;) is also reduced, but not as severely (the multiplier is not squared):\nCritical hit.\nA critical hit is an attack that deals more damage compared to a regular attack. Critical melee strikes, regardless of the weapon used, cause small star, cross shaped particles to fly out of the target who was critically hit. Arrows shot from fully charged bows have a 25% chance of becoming \"critical arrows\" and dealing extra damage, but all arrows from fully charged bows leave a trail of the same small star particles as they fly through the air. Critical hits affect all damageable &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn melee combat, a critical hit occurs when a player attacks a mob while \"falling\", including while coming down from a jump, but not while jumping up. The attack deals 150% of the attack's base damage (\"after\" strength is applied and before / after enchantments or armor are applied).\nThe requirements for a melee critical hit are:\nMaximum damage dealt.\nIn Survival mode, the maximum damage that can be dealt by a player depends on various factors as described below.\nImmunity.\nAfter sustaining damage from any source, a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; turns red for half a second. During this period, it is immune to most kinds of further damage. For instance, if the player attacks a mob by repeatedly hitting the button, attacks that land while the mob is immune deal no damage, and does not reduce the &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; of a melee weapon. Unsuccessful attacks also do not anger neutral mobs.\nDuring the immunity period, any damage which is equal to or less than the original damage that caused the immunity is ignored. However, any \"higher\" damage (before accounting for armor, enchantments, or status effects) causes only the difference between the original and new damage amounts to be dealt. For example, if a mob is attacked with a weapon dealing damage and then attacked with another weapon dealing damage during the immunity period, the second hit deals damage (resulting in total). This does not reset the immunity period.\nWhen an attack deals a fatal amount of damage to a mob, so that it dies while immune, its death sound is not triggered. \nInflicted by mobs.\nKnockback.\nWhen receiving damage from players, mobs, most projectiles, or explosions, players and mobs are also knocked back. The resulting disorientation and loss of control should not be underestimated, as it is possible to be knocked back over a cliff or into lava, both of which are potentially fatal.\nA sprinting attack causes extra knockback. A thrown &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt; also causes knockback, despite not damaging most mobs. Entities riding another entity never receive any knockback when attacked. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;wardens&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; also don't receive knockback, and certain &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Knockback_resistance\"&gt;other mobs&lt;/a&gt; have varying levels of knockback resistance. Each piece of &lt;a href=\"netherite%20armor\"&gt;netherite armor&lt;/a&gt; adds 10% knockback resistance to its wearer, giving 40% knockback resistance with a full set.\nNatural damage.\nBesides mob attacks, players can take damage from several other sources.\nLightning damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; striking on or near the player inflicts damage, which can be reduced with armor. Natural lightning strikes on the player are rare and occur only during thunderstorms. Players and mobs that get hit by lightning are set on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, which is quickly extinguished by the &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; during a thunderstorm.\nFall damage.\nMost mobs receive damage when falling from excessive heights. &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; itself does not reduce fall damage, however the enchantments &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; do.\nThe is immune to fall damage only if the codice_6 &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to codice_7.\nHostile mobs immune to fall damage:\nPassive mobs immune to fall damage:\nThese mobs are resistant to fall damage:\nFor mobs that are subject to fall damage, the fall damage is calculated based on distance fallen rather than on velocity when hitting the ground. \nFall damage is for each block of fall distance after the third. Thus, falling 4 blocks causes damage, damage for 5 blocks, and so forth:\nWhile a 23 block fall \"should\" be fatal for a player at full health (23 - 3 = of damage), due to the way fall distance is calculated, a 23.5 block fall is required instead, because the last tick of fall distance isn't added in when calculating fall damage. For certain heights, including 23-block falls, this discrepancy is enough to avoid an entire of damage.\nTherefore, without &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; or relevant &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s, or immunity to fall damage, the minimum guaranteed lethal fall height for any mob is:\nFalling from smaller damaging heights (4-7 blocks) plays a thud sound; larger heights (8+) give a click/cracking sound.\nIn some cases, it is possible to avoid falling or otherwise survive a fall.\nFalling block.\n&lt;a href=\"Falling%20block\"&gt;Falling block&lt;/a&gt; entities deal damage to players and mobs in the same block space where they land. The damage is dealt only on landing, and is not dealt to players and mobs that collide with falling block entities in mid-air.\nA falling &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; deals per block fallen after the first block (e.g., an anvil that falls 4 blocks deals damage). A falling &lt;a href=\"stalactite\"&gt;stalactite&lt;/a&gt; deals per block fallen after the first block (e.g., a stalactite that falls 4 blocks deals damage).\nThe damage is capped at , no matter how far the anvil or stalactite falls.\n&lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;s take twice as much &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; damage as other armor pieces, but do not provide any special protection other than the normal armor damage reduction.\nIf cheats are enabled, a falling block entity that deals damage can be &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;ed if its tag is set to . The amount of damage dealt per block fallen can be customized via the tag, and the maximum damage dealt can be customized via the tag.\nThorns enchantment.\nWhen a player or mob deals melee or projectile damage to a player or mob that is wearing &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, part of the damage is reflected back at the attacker. The amount varies with the enchantment level. (codice_10% chance of inflicting \u2013 damage, or codice_11 damage if level is over 10) however, thorns increases the amount of durability lost per hit on the enchanted armor.\nSuffocation.\nSuffocation occurs when a player or mob's eyeline is inside of certain blocks, receiving damage every half-second. \nBlocks that are transparent or do not fill an entire block do not cause damage. This includes &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20cluster\"&gt;amethyst cluster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chain\"&gt;chain&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chorus%20flower\"&gt;chorus flower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Chorus%20Plant%20%28block%29\"&gt;chorus plant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cocoa%20beans\"&gt;cocoa beans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"daylight%20detector\"&gt;daylight detector&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lectern\"&gt;lectern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lightning%20rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt;s, extended &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; heads, &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s that are not double, &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stonecutter\"&gt;stonecutter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite being fully to partially transparent, &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; can cause suffocation. &lt;a href=\"Dirt%20path\"&gt;Dirt path&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt; can also cause suffocation, regardless of them not being full blocks.\nThe player's screen displays a darkened form of the block in which the player is suffocating. When the player is in &lt;a href=\"third%20person\"&gt;third person&lt;/a&gt;, the view automatically switches to the first-person view.\n, an oxygen bar is also present in the suffocation process. Water Breathing effects can prevent suffocation .\nThe usual ways a mob can suffocate are:\nEntity cramming.\n, players and mobs take damage if too many entities are packed into the same block space. Specifically, the codice_12 &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; defines the maximum number, above which a player or mob takes suffocation damage every half-second, as long as that player or mob is pushing greater than that number of other entities. The default max number of entities in one block space is 24. Pushable entities include players, mobs, boats, and minecarts.\nIf the entities exist within the area of effect of a block under the &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vine&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;), entity collision is not calculated, and the number of entities in that block space can exceed the amount defined by . Spiders and cave spiders are still counted, however.\nIf a player is killed by entity cramming damage, the &lt;a href=\"death%20messages\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; reads &lt;\"player\"&gt; was squished too much.\nDrowning.\nA player who runs out of &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; underwater begins drowning, taking approximately damage per second. Damage is taken when the air supply value reaches -20. Usually, the air supply value decreases each tick. It resets to 0 after damaging. &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; gives a chance for air supply to not decrease itself per tick. Chance is \"x\"/(\"x\" + 1), where \"x\" is the level of enchantment.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to , the air supply of players deplete normally, but no drowning damage is inflicted when players run out of air.\nMobs can also drown, although most mobs that can drown attempt to swim upward. Normally, mobs can remain underwater for 15 seconds before their air supply fully depletes. They can remain underwater for 16 seconds before actually beginning to take damage.\nWhen the player is no longer submerged in water or is in a &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;, the air supply regenerates at a rate of 1 bubble every 0.2 seconds (4 game ticks). A &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; helmet adds an additional on average 15 seconds duration underwater per enchantment level, and a &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt; adds an additional 10 seconds. &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conduit%20Power\"&gt;Conduit Power&lt;/a&gt; regenerate the air supply. , both effects affect squid and fish.\nStarvation.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar becomes empty (), the player takes damage every four seconds. The player stops taking starvation damage when the player eats &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; or the health bar drops to on Easy difficulty or on Normal difficulty. In Hard difficulty and on &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, the player continues taking damage, which stops upon eating something or death by starvation.\nAll mobs are immune to starvation, because they do not have a hunger bar.\nCactus.\nPlayers and mobs take damage every half-second when they are touching or within the same tile-space as a &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBerry bush.\n&lt;a href=\"Sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;Sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt;es deal damage every half-second when a player or mob (besides &lt;a href=\"foxes\"&gt;foxes&lt;/a&gt;) is moving inside them.\nFire.\nWhen mobs and players without &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; immunity stand on fire, they take damage every half-second and get burned. Standing in soul fire does damage every half-second instead. They continue burning after leaving the fire block. Fire damage can be prevented by the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect. Fire duration can be decreased with the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Most Nether mobs are immune to fire, but they can still drown in lava.\nPlayers do not take damage from fire if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nLava.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; is a dangerous natural occurrence. Players and mobs (except various Nether mobs) get burned and take damage from contact with lava at a rate of every half-second, and they continue burning after they leave it. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; nullifies both the direct damage from lava and the burning damage.\nPlayers do not take damage from lava if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nGhasts sometimes take a dive into the lava seas in the Nether, magma cubes can hop around on lava, in a similar manner to floating. &lt;a href=\"Strider\"&gt;Strider&lt;/a&gt;s can walk across lava.\nBurning.\n&lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s and many &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s burn when exposed to fire or lava or attacked by certain kinds of burning projectiles, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Aspect\"&gt;Fire Aspect&lt;/a&gt; weapons, or burning &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, armor itself does not reduce burning damage; to do so, armor needs either the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, or the &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly and, unless the player or mob has Fire Resistance, inflicts damage at a rate of per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. Burning lasts some amount of time depending on its cause, but it is extinguished by &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlayers do not take damage from burning if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nExcept for piglins, hoglins, skeletons, and endermen, mobs that spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; do not burn and cannot be damaged by fire. &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s also do not burn. Burning is not considered a &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; and therefore cannot be cured by &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagma block.\nMobs without &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; immunity and players take damage every half-second if they are walking on &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s. This can be avoided by having the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect, &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;, or wearing &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers do not take damage from magma blocks if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nCampfire.\nPlayers or mobs standing on top of a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; take damage every half second. Standing in a &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;Soul Campfire&lt;/a&gt; does damage every half second instead. Unlike any other damage sources, armor itself does not reduce campfire and soul campfire damage; to do so, armor needs either the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, or the &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;. , it also inflicts damage for after the player exits the block.\nPlayers do not take damage from campfires if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nStatus effects.\nStatus effects are either helpful or harmful conditions that can be given to players and mobs alike. They can be given in different ways: being in range of thrown splash potions or lingering potions, being afflicted by certain mobs' attacks, simply being near certain mobs, being near &lt;a href=\"Conduit\"&gt;conduits&lt;/a&gt; and beacons, and eating specific types of food (such as &lt;a href=\"Rotten%20Flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt;). Status effects can last for a certain amount of time, or can happen instantaneously.\nEntities under a status effect will emit colored particles, with the color of the particles resembling the type of status effect. Having multiple status effects will combine the respective colors.\nInstant damage.\nInstant Damage caused by &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"tipped%20arrow\"&gt;tipped arrow&lt;/a&gt;s can damage the player at level I and at level II. This damage occurs instantaneously. &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs are instead healed, but are similarly damaged by the Healing effect. Zombified piglins that are splashed by a instant damage potion do not attack the player who threw it, as it heals them.\nPoison.\n&lt;a href=\"Cave%20spider\"&gt;Cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"witches\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; players when they attack (except on easy difficulty). Pufferfish inflict poison as defense against players or certain mobs if they are nearby. Poisoning also occurs upon eating a &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"poisonous%20potato\"&gt;poisonous potato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt; made out of lily of the valley. Drinking or being hit by a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; or arrow of poison also results in poisoning. While poisoned, the hearts in the health meter turn from ( on Hardcore) to an olive green ()( on Hardcore) and the player takes every 25 ticks (1.25 seconds) on level I. See &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; for a table for higher levels. The Poison itself cannot kill the player, but it can reduce them to half a heart (), thus leaving them vulnerable to damage from other sources.\nWither.\n&lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s inflict the Wither effect with their attacks (the wither skulls do not inflict the effect on easy difficulty). This darkens the health bar to on &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;, while inflicting damage over time. The effect deals every 2 seconds (40 ticks) for the wither skeleton's attack (level I), and every second for the Wither's skulls (level II). Wither roses also inflict the Wither effect to any mobs colliding it. Players also get the Wither effect after eating suspicious stew made out of wither rose or when hit by potion or arrow of decay. Unlike Poison, withering can kill on any difficulty level, and the darkened health bar makes it harder to keep track of the damage, which the only way is seeing the white spark on the left of the heart.\nVoid.\nIf one were to break through the &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; barrier found at the bottom of worlds, the void can be seen. Players in the void below the Y-axis of -64 or -128 take damage at a rate of about per half-second. The player usually dies from falling in the void, even in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; modes, but the player may be saved by throwing an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; before falling below the Y-axis of -64 or -128.\nFalling into the void in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; is more likely, and is the only way to access the void in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode without exploiting glitches.\nBy using to give the player &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; 5+ or &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt;, they can fall infinitely into the void without dying until the effect wears off or the game crashes.\n, the player can survive in the void in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, but there is a one-way barrier at y=-104 to prevent falling further into the void. However, this barrier can be teleported past by teleporting the player to any location with a y value of -106 and below. The player continues falling until the player teleports away, flies back up, or crashes the game.\nExplosions.\nExplosions cause varying amounts of damage based on the explosion strength, the entity's proximity to the explosion, and whether it is obstructed by &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirework rocket explosion.\n&lt;a href=\"Firework%20rocket\"&gt;Firework rocket&lt;/a&gt; explosions can deal damage to entities if crafted with a &lt;a href=\"firework%20star\"&gt;firework star&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe maximum damage about is at the explosion's center with one firework star, decreasing to at the edge of a radius of 5 blocks (exclusive). Each additional firework star adds to the maximum.\nIf a rocket crafted with a firework star is d to provide a speed boost while gliding with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, it explodes as it is used, dealing damage to the player.\nFreezing.\nWhen an entity is inside a &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow%20block\"&gt;powder snow block&lt;/a&gt;, they begin to freeze, taking damage. \nA player submerged in powder snow sees a frosty frame slowly fade in at the sides of the screen and the FOV slowly decreases. After seven seconds (140 game ticks), the player's hearts change to a cyan frosty texture (), and the player begins taking damage at a rate of HP every two seconds (40 game ticks). If the player leaves the powder snow block, the vignette slowly fades away. A frozen player moves slower than usual until the vignette fully fades away. This is controlled by the \"TicksFrozen\" data tag, which increases by 1 every tick (to a maximum of 300) for an entity within the powder snow block. It decreases at a rate of 2 per tick after the entity leaves the powder snow block. This is currently not a separate effect when used with commands such as codice_13, and does not have its own unique art, particles, or potion. \n, players do not take damage from powder snow if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nMobs and players that are freezing have a shivering animation.\nWearing any piece of &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; stops the freezing effect and damage. This applies to entities that can wear armor, such as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s wearing leather &lt;a href=\"horse%20armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt; also don\u2019t take damage from freezing. \n&lt;a href=\"Snow%20golem\"&gt;Snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s are immune to freezing damage. Fire-related mobs like &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s take extra damage from freezing. A &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; can freeze but does not take damage; instead, it begins the process of converting to a &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt; when continuously in powder snow for 7 seconds.\nHistory.\n \n "}

They control which attributes the damage has as well as which death message is used when an entity dies due to that type of damage.\nAdditionally, the built-in &lt;a href=\"Tag%23Damage%20types\"&gt;damage type tags&lt;/a&gt; control many aspects of how damage is applied by the game.\nCustom damage types can currently only be applied using the command.\nFile format.\nDamage types are stored as &lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; files within a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;, at the path codice_1.\nFor example, here is JSON for the built-in :\n \"exhaustion\": 0.1,\n \"message_id\": \"arrow\",\n \"scaling\": \"when_caused_by_living_non_player\"\nScaling.\nDamage types control whether damage scales with &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossible values of :\nEffects.\nDamage types control how incoming damage is shown to the player.\nPossible values of :\nDeath messages.\nDamage types control the &lt;a href=\"death%20messages\"&gt;death messages&lt;/a&gt; displayed when players or pets die.\nPossible values of :\nDefault message type.\nWhen standard death message logic is being used, messages are generated as follows, making use of the tag:\nDesign.\nBecause of how the default death messages are set up, most vanilla damage types are divided into ones that will always have an attacker and ones that will never have an attacker. Depending on whether there was an attacker, the translation for normal deaths (codice_5) will have either one or two available insertions. Translations have no safe way to access an insertion that may or may not be there, so the primary options are:\nThe death type is planned to always have an attacker.\n\"death.attack.mob\": \"%s was slain by %s\",\n\"death.attack.mob.item\": \"%s was slain by %s using %s\",\nThe death type is planned to never have an attacker.\n\"death.attack.drown\": \"%s drowned\",\n\"death.attack.drown.player\": \"%s drowned whilst trying to escape %s\",\nThe death type may or may not have an attacker.\n\"death.attack.electricity\": \"%s was electrocuted\",\n\"death.attack.electricity.item\": \"%s was electrocuted by %s using %s\",\n\"death.attack.electricity.player\": \"%s was electrocuted whilst trying to escape %s\",\nTo avoid the awkwardness of the third option you can have two different damage types, one for use with an attacker, and one for use without an attacker:\n\"death.attack.active_electricity\": \"%s was electrocuted by %s\",\n\"death.attack.active_electricity.item\": \"%s was electrocuted by %s using %s\",\n\"death.attack.passive_electricity\": \"%s was electrocuted\",\n\"death.attack.passive_electricity.player\": \"%s was electrocuted whilst trying to escape %s\","}

It is known for its thick, dense leaf canopies that block light sufficiently to allow hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn during the daytime.\nDescription.\nDark forest is almost exactly the same as the regular &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; biome, except that the trees generated are different. Dark forests feature a much higher density in &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s compared to other forest biomes, which often times block direct views of the sky entirely. &lt;a href=\"Oak\"&gt;Oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dark%20oak\"&gt;dark oak&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s generate in these biomes; it is the only place where dark oak trees naturally generate. &lt;a href=\"Beehive\"&gt;Beehive&lt;/a&gt;s are not generated with trees. Additionally, both types of &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s generate among the &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, though the red variants are more common. Unlike regular forests, wolves do not spawn in dark forests.\nUnique to dark forests are &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, enormous dungeon-like structures that rarely generate within the trees. Woodland mansions are home to the dangerous &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt; mobs and are one of the only places where said mobs spawn. &lt;a href=\"Mansion\"&gt;Mansion&lt;/a&gt;s contain various rooms and valuable loot for the player to plunder.\nAlthough players are unlikely to run out of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; in dark forests, survival can still be more difficult compared to other forest biomes. The dense leaf canopy can diffuse skylight sufficiently for &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn during the day in some spots. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn atop &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s and suddenly fall near to the player. &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20mansion\"&gt;Woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s are dangerous to explore without adequate preparation, due to their large size and the difficult Illager and other hostile mobs inside. The high density of trees can easily lead to players getting lost unless trails are marked using &lt;a href=\"torches\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt; or other distinct markers. Using &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; in these biomes can help to clear out some &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s due to their flammability.\nDark forests generate in areas with very high &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; values and are usually bordered by &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"old%20growth%20taiga\"&gt;old growth taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, but can also border &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to their high humidity value, dark forests are almost guaranteed to have &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; generate below them.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Dark Forest"}

They are found in the &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nStructure.\nDark oak trees generate with thick 2\u00d72 trunks. &lt;a href=\"Dirt\"&gt;Dirt&lt;/a&gt; blocks appear under the trunk if generated on a steep cliff. Dark oak trees nearly always generate with irregular &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s connected to the trunk \u2013 these represent large branches.\nDark oak trees with trunks consisting of 1\u00d71 dark oak logs, instead of 2\u00d72, can be found in two types of rooms in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s: the &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20mansion%231x2%20a6\"&gt;tree chopping room&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion/Structure/Trophy%20Rooms%23Tree%20Room%20With%20Water\"&gt;nature room&lt;/a&gt;. These are not generated elsewhere in the world, and cannot be grown from saplings.\nGeneration.\nDark oaks spawn naturally only in the biome. A dark oak always generates with &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nBlocks and items.\nThese items can be obtained from all variants of dark oak:\nPlanting.\nDark oak &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s can be planted on:\nGrowing these trees requires four dark oak saplings arranged in a 2\u00d72 grid; they do \"not\" grow if planted individually. Dark oak trees grow at a much faster rate than most other trees. They require a 3\u00d73 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. Additionally, dark oak trees require 5\u00d75 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (saplings planted in a 2\u00d72 hole 1 block deep still grow).\nDying dark oak.\n, dark oaks can generate as a dying tree. Dying dark oaks generate naturally, and can be grown from normal saplings. A dying dark oak has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;."}

A dark vignette appears around the player, which initially makes faraway objects hard to see. The vignette then steadily closes in around the player, diminishing the player's eyesight. The player can only see about 14 blocks away. When the effect wears off, the vignette retreats and the player's vision reverts to normal.

They sell 4 carpets of the same color for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nCarpet has the same visual thickness as a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. It has a hitbox of of a block and covers the entire surface of the block it is placed on. This thickness prevents &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;mob spawning&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarpet can be placed on any block, including non-solid blocks, except &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;. When placed on &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;, they break and the carpet is placed on the block below. When placed on &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, the topmost block of vines breaks and the carpet is placed on the block below, any vines blocks below the first one don't break. It can even be placed over &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; blocks, but to do so you must target an adjacent block with a visible hitbox.\nCarpet can be pushed and pulled by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s but pops off if pushed onto a hole or pulled downward. It can also break falling sand and gravel.\nCarpet is an opaque block but does not decrease light going through it. Because of this and the fact that it can be placed on any block, a common decorative strategy is to place carpet on a light-emitting block in the floor, illuminating a room and hiding the light source at the same time.\nCarpets can be placed on top of &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;s to allow the player to jump on top of them while still preventing animals and mobs from crossing. This is because mobs do not try to jump over fences and walls, even with a carpet above. \n, if a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt; is placed beneath a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; to pacify &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, the campfire can be placed below ground and a carpet placed over the campfire to protect bees from the fire. , a carpet over a campfire removes the campfire's pacifying effect on bees.\nIf a carpet is placed so that it lays on top of a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;, the hopper can still collect &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; through the carpet. This is because hoppers can collect items from &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;less than a full block&lt;/a&gt; above in \"Java Edition\", or less than of a block above in Bedrock Edition.\nCarpets can also be placed over other carpets. Mobs are unable to walk over two or more layers of carpets, because the mob's AI treats carpets as if they are &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; blocks. If a mob stands on a double carpet layer, it stays perfectly still. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; are unable to teleport onto double carpet layers.\nCarpets, similar to &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, dampens vibrations from &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt;s. These include placing, breaking, and entities walking/jumping on.

Zooming it out makes the map aligned to the grid that would include the area of the original map. To build a set of maps such as for a map wall, a player cannot create several level 0 (base) maps at one location then zoom them out before going out into the world to fill them in; the player must start with a base map created in each area to be covered by the zoomed out map.

They can be &lt;a href=\"Taming\"&gt;tamed&lt;/a&gt; and used to repel &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpawning.\nA cat can spawn every 1200 ticks (1 minute). A random &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is selected (including spectators) and a random location is chosen 8-32 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s away from the player horizontally in both directions \"and at the same height\". A cat can spawn if that block is less than 2 &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s from a village with fewer than 5 cats, or inside a &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;.\nVillages.\nUntamed cats spawn in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s as long as there are at least five claimed &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s within 48 blocks and at most four cats within a 97\u00d717\u00d797 box centered around the spawn position. Cats that spawn with the creation of a village do not &lt;a href=\"despawn\"&gt;despawn&lt;/a&gt;, however, any additional cats that spawn within a village may despawn. A village cat spawns with a random appearance, although black cats may spawn only during a &lt;a href=\"Moon%23Phases\"&gt;full moon&lt;/a&gt;; which works on both &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. The spawning of cats in villages is a separate process from the natural spawning of passive mobs and thus is not affected by the Creature mob cap.\n, a village periodically spawns stray cats to fill a quota of 1 cat per 4 owned beds, up to a maximum of 5 cats for 20 or more owned beds. Only \"owned\" beds (those currently claimed by a villager) are counted for this purpose. All cats within the village boundaries are counted, including kittens, cats that wander in from outside and even tamed cats owned by a player. If the number of cats found is short of the quota, the village tries to spawn one cat or kitten within a volume of 16 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 16 blocks centered on the village center. (This is the same volume used when a village spawns an iron golem.)\nSwamp hut.\nOne untamed black cat generates alongside a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;s upon world generation. This cat never despawns. Additional cats can spawn within the hut similarly to witches; for this to happen, there must be &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s present inside the bounding box of the swamp hut. , any other cats to spawn within the swamp hut (from &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s and commands without cat type set) always spawn as black. A new cat does not spawn in a hut if there is already a cat within a 16\u00d78\u00d716 block volume.\nBedrock Edition.\n25% of cats spawn as kittens. During a full moon, 50% of cats that spawn are black.\nDrops.\nAdult cats drop:\nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped.\nLike other baby animals, killing a kitten yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nDespite sharing the same &lt;a href=\"model\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt;, cats are smaller than &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s. There are currently 11 skins that cats can have. One of the cat skins was designed after Jellie, the late cat of YouTuber , and was chosen by the community in a Twitter vote. The current skins are:\nIn the default &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby exists. It is however completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game. \nLike tamed &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, tamed cats also have a collar on their necks. The color of the cat's collar is red when tamed and can be changed by using &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBehavior.\nCats are immune to &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;, but they still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to normally cause fall damage.\nCats can see players even if they have the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; status effect. With the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults. They hiss at &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s that are currently pursuing a player. &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s avoid cats, even while pursuing a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, keeping a distance of 6 and 16 blocks away respectively from any cats. However, a creeper that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius.\nStray cat.\nA stray cat is an untamed cat. Naturally spawned cats always spawn as stray cats. Unlike untamed &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, stray cats may despawn naturally. They pursue and attack &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s and baby &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s up to a distance of 15 blocks. Even though they spawn in villages, they don't necessarily remain there; instead, they explore.\nThey sprint away from any player within 7 blocks (unless the player is sneaking or difficulty is set to peaceful), and avoid players within 16 blocks. However, they slowly approach a player holding raw &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; within 10 blocks, allowing the player to feed and tame it (see below). If the player turns too quickly or stops holding the fish within 6 blocks, the cat flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.\nStray cats can be leashed.\nTamed cat.\nUnless commanded to sit (see below), tamed cats do not remain still for long and explore around the player.\nA cat not already sitting attempts to get on top of &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, the foot part of &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, or active &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s at the cat's current Y-level within a 4-block-radius square horizontally, and once on top often assumes a sitting position without a command from the player. A cat also occasionally attempts to sit on these blocks if the blocks are at ground level. A chest with a cat sitting on top of it becomes unusable unless the cat is commanded to stand.\nCats that sit on their own can be ordered to stand, or they may get up if the player holds a raw &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; nearby. The cat can also be brought down by removing the &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; or pushing it off. A cat can also be forcibly moved by attacking it. A cat does not sit on a block that is obstructed by another block above it.\nLike other mobs, cats enter nearby &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, trapping themselves.\nIf a player is harmed by a hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or a harming potion, but not by environmental damage, a cat sitting in proximity to the player stands, moves a few blocks from its sitting location and then resumes sitting.\nGifts.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; sleeps, tamed cats move toward their owner and sleep near them. When the player wakes, their tamed cats also wake. There is a 70% chance for a tamed cat to give the player a gift after they wake up, but only if the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; sleeps at night (if the player sleeps during a thunderstorm during the daytime, or if the tamed cat has been ordered to sit, the player receives no gift). The gift is a dropped &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; from the loot table:\nAfter a cat gives a gift, both the cat and the gift are located in the general area of the bed the player slept on, including on the other side of walls or floors.\nIf a player has multiple standing tamed cats in the area, only the tamed cat that sleeps on the player may provide a gift. If all standing tamed cats in the area are prevented from reaching the player (i.e. trapped in minecarts or boats), then each cat has a 70% chance of providing a gift while only one cat may give a gift.\nTeleportation.\nTamed cats teleport to the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; if they are more than 12 blocks from the player, except where listed below. It is possible for a tamed cat to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g. under &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;) and be injured or &lt;a href=\"suffocate\"&gt;suffocate&lt;/a&gt; of various causes as a result.\nA cat does \"not\" teleport:\nCat teleportation is completely silent.\nTaming.\nStray cats can be tamed using raw cod or raw salmon (see &lt;a href=\"%23Behavior\"&gt;#Behavior&lt;/a&gt; for how to approach a cat). Once tamed, cats follow the player who tamed them. They do not despawn, no longer fear the player and purr or meow frequently. Like &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and with the same limits, they can &lt;a href=\"%23Teleportation\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; to a player who moves 12 blocks away.\nThe player can order a cat to sit/stand by pressing on it. If the player is holding a raw cod or salmon when commanding a cat to sit or stand, the fish is given to the cat instead, causing it to enter love mode. Once in love mode, the player can command a cat to sit or stand while holding a fish. Cats also sit on certain things of their own accord (see &lt;a href=\"%23Tamed%20cat\"&gt;#Tamed cat&lt;/a&gt;).\nBreeding.\nWhen tamed cats are fed a &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, they enter love mode. Breeding creates a kitten, and the parents cannot breed again for 5 minutes. The kitten has the coloring of and belongs to the owner of one of the parents. \nTwo sitting cats are unable to breed, but a mobile cat can breed with a sitting cat, in which case the mobile cat's owner also owns the kitten.\nThe 20 minute growth of kittens can be reduced using raw cod or salmon. Each fish reduces the growth time remaining by 10%.\nHealing.\nFeeding an injured tamed cat an uncooked cod or salmon restores its health by . Unlike tamed &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, a tamed cat's tail is not an indicator of its health.\nSounds.\nCats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nCats have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

It also serves as a &lt;a href=\"leatherworker\"&gt;leatherworker&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"job%20site%20block\"&gt;job site block&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nA cauldron can be obtained using any &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Regardless of the tool, when a cauldron is destroyed, its contents are lost.\nNatural generation.\nA single empty cauldron is generated in each &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;. , the cauldrons generated there are to full of a random &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;.\nA cauldron full of water is generated in each &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basement.\nCauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTwo filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and snowy tundra &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; tannery houses.\nA single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses.\n, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses.\nCauldrons can also spawn in &lt;a href=\"trail%20ruins\"&gt;trail ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting.\nA cauldron can be crafted from &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nStorage for substances.\nCauldrons can hold a variety of substances. Fluids they cannot hold include &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Honey%20Bottle\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and any food items that exist in &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt;s; namely &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot%20soup\"&gt;beetroot soup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rabbit%20stew\"&gt;rabbit stew&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt;. , cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them.\nHolding water.\nA cauldron can be filled with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; on the cauldron. Once completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by an empty &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron. Despite containing water, using a &lt;a href=\"fish%20bucket\"&gt;fish bucket&lt;/a&gt; on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.\nA cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron. Once the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.\nIt can contain three levels of water. One level of water can be added to a cauldron by a &lt;a href=\"water%20bottle\"&gt;water bottle&lt;/a&gt; on it. One level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by a &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt; on it.\nA cauldron slowly fills with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;ed upon, if starting empty or with some water. This happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nWater can be stored in a cauldron even in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Water in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.\nWater in a cauldron does \"not\" absorb &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; damage; make &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s; absorb fall damage; allow &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s to activate; or damage &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s. Cauldrons do \"not\" deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them and &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; act as if there is no water inside it. The player \"cannot\" float or &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist. Jumping in a cauldron does \"not\" produce any bubble or water particles.\nA cauldron placed below a down-facing &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water. The same works with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for infinite lava generation.\nAttempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron. \nThe water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not. \nApplying dye to cauldron water.\n, leather armor is dyed through a cauldron, so a cauldron can hold dyed &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye. Different dyes may be added to produce mixed colors. &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather%20horse%20armor\"&gt;leather horse armor&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"wolf%20armor\"&gt;wolf armor&lt;/a&gt; on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.\nAttempting to add water, lava or potion to dyed water empties the cauldron.\nHolding lava.\nCauldrons can be used to hold lava. , when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound. A cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; inside of it; , this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron. The lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron.\nA &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.\nA cauldron placed below a down-facing &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava.\nIf a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing.\nHolding powder snow.\n&lt;a href=\"Powder%20snow\"&gt;Powder snow&lt;/a&gt; is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron. A cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt;, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside. Up to three layers can be filled. When the cauldron is full, using a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;, creates a &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow%20bucket\"&gt;powder snow bucket&lt;/a&gt; and empties the cauldron. Entities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing &lt;a href=\"leather%20boots\"&gt;leather boots&lt;/a&gt; still fall through the powder snow.\nA &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.\nContrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.\nFilling cauldrons with potions.\n, a cauldron can hold normal &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lingering%20potion\"&gt;lingering potion&lt;/a&gt;s. a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by one level. A glass bottle can then be on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion. This reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level.\n an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a &lt;a href=\"tipped%20arrow\"&gt;tipped arrow&lt;/a&gt; with that potion &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;, and reduce the potion in the cauldron by one level. Tipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once. 1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, and a full cauldron can tip a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion.\nAttempting to put &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied.\nAn entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.\nUsing an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.\nRemoving dye from items.\nA cauldron with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; can wash the dye off of leather &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;, by pressing on the cauldron with the leather armor, shulker box, or banner in hand. Each wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level. The water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.\nChanging profession.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; has a cauldron that has not been claimed by a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, any villager that does not already have a profession or &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block may change their profession to &lt;a href=\"leatherworker\"&gt;leatherworker&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtinguishing fire.\nA cauldron with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt; extinguishes &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; that fall into it and the entity emits black particles. This includes &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Flaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished. Entities must reach the water or powder snow in it. Each entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level. If the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.\nRedstone component.\nA cauldron can act as a power source for a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;. With a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava. However, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\nData values.\nBlock data.\n, a cauldron has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20level%20format/Block%20entity%20format\"&gt;Bedrock Edition level format/Block entity format&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "211", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=211", "title": "Cave", "text": "A cave (also known as a cavern) is a common &lt;a href=\"terrain%20features\"&gt;terrain feature&lt;/a&gt; that generates in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the nether&lt;/a&gt;. Caves are usually found underground. They are open spaces of various sizes and shapes that often intersect with each other or with different &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;, creating vast cave systems. They feature an abundance of &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as hostile mobs that spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneration.\nCaves are underground structures consisting of randomly generated cavities of &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, hollowing out an area and exposing other blocks generated with the terrain (such as &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ore%20%28feature%29\"&gt;ore feature&lt;/a&gt;s) in the interior. Their structure typically consists of a series of irregular tunnels branching off and winding in other directions, which may connect to the surface, creating natural entrances to the cave. In &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt; generate in caves near the surface. &lt;a href=\"Sand\"&gt;Sand&lt;/a&gt; often falls into caves generated near the surface of a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;; craters in the sand can alert the player to caves below the surface. Caves cannot cut through &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;s, despite these generating as a surface block in several biomes.\nCaves generate at any &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; up to Y-level 256, and may span from the surface all the way to Y-level -59. They frequently intersect natural structures such as other caves, &lt;a href=\"monster%20room\"&gt;monster room&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s. Because of low &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; levels, hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s and certain animals like &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Squid\"&gt;glow squids&lt;/a&gt; (only in water) often spawn in caves.\nTypes.\nCaves come in two types: carver caves and noise caves.\nCarver caves.\nA cave may have a main room (aka. circular void) connecting 1 to 4 trunks, each trunk with zero or two branches. It may also have no main room, only one trunk and zero or two branches on it, that is, an I-shaped or T-shaped cave. There is a one-in-four probability of generating a cave with the main room, and another three-quarters probability of generating an I-shaped or T-shaped cave.\nThe main room is an ellipsoidal void of various size. It sometimes may be too small to be found, making the cave looks I-shaped or T-shaped. But as long as the cave is not I-shaped or T-shaped, it must have a main room. \nFor each trunk or branch, it is usually thin at both ends and thick in the middle. However, the thickness does not vary so evenly. It sometimes flickers thick and thin as it advances. Sometimes it becomes so thin that there are some interruptions. Multiple interruptions make it look like a series of continuous bubbles. The length from the root of the trunk to the top of a branch varies from 85 to 112 blocks.\nThe trunk and branches are curved, and they are often intertwined with each other, making the cave very complex. Multiple caves sometimes merge with each other making them more messy and spacious.\nThe ceiling of the main room, trunks and branches is usually round, while the floor usually tends to be flat.\nOverworld cave.\nThe cave generation in the Overworld starts from Y=-56 to Y=180. The probability of cave generation is higher at Y=-56\u201447.\nTheir main rooms vary from roughly 1 to 14 blocks in height, and from roughly 5 to 15 blocks in diameter.\nThe horizon thickness of trunks varies from roughly 2 to 38, while the vertical thickness of trunks varies from roughly 1 to 36.\nThe horizon thickness of branches varies from roughly 2 to 7, while the vertical thickness of trunks varies from roughly 1 to 7.\nA cave may connect to the surface of the terrain, creating natural entrances to the cave. They sometimes connect to the sea. Caves also regularly contain at least minor &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flows as well as a number of aquifer of water and lava.\nNether cave.\nThe cave generation in the Nether starts from Y=0 to Y=126.\nTheir main rooms vary from roughly 2 to 8 blocks in height, and from roughly 5 to 15 blocks in diameter. Compared with the caves in the Overworld, the vertical thickness of the caves in the Nether is higher. The horizon thickness of trunks varies from roughly 3 to 15, while the vertical thickness of trunks varies from roughly 12 to 64. The horizon thickness of branches varies from roughly 3 to 5, while the vertical thickness of trunks varies from roughly 12 to 22.\nUnderwater caves.\nUnderwater caves are completely flooded caves that may have &lt;a href=\"underwater%20magma\"&gt;underwater magma&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeing completely underwater, only the magma blocks provide any air for entities to breathe, since they generate &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s. They have sometimes &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt;, but since they don't generate exposed to sky, &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; cannot generate, unlike sea-access caves.\nNoise caves.\nNoise caves are generated using a noise. They come in the form of cheese caves, spaghetti caves, and noodle caves. By adjusting noise frequency, hollowness (for cheese caves), and thickness (for spaghetti caves, noodle caves, and noise pillars), noise caves can vary in extremely diverse ways. When generating noise caves, the game firstly generates a random noise field, and \"smudges\" it using a mathematical trick called . These processes then result in a 3D noise image. Noise pillars also generate inside cave blobs.\nCheese cave.\nCheese caves are pocket areas of the underground that come in various sizes. Cheese caves offer large and open spaces, being the largest cave type on the game. They frequently generate noise pillars and expose many &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s. When generating, the black part of noise image becomes stone or deepslate, and white part becomes air, making it resemble a cheese with many holes.\nSpaghetti cave.\nSpaghetti caves are long, narrow caves that wind their way through the underground and are a bit similar to small or medium carver caves, but longer. When generating, the edge of black and white part of noise image becomes air, making it look like long and wide spaghetti.\nNoodle cave.\nNoodle caves are a thinner and squigglier variant of spaghetti caves. They consist of tunnels usually 1 to 5 blocks in width. When generating, the edge of black and white part of noise image becomes air, making it look like long and thin noodles.\nNoise pillar.\nNoise pillars look like &lt;a href=\"Dripstone%20%28feature%29\"&gt;large dripstones&lt;/a&gt; or speleothems, but consist usually of stone. They can be found in any type of noise cave, making caves more realistic.\nAquifer.\nAquifers are liquid systems used to generate bodies of liquids in a world. Almost all liquids in a world (including those in carvers, noise caves, rivers and oceans) are generated by aquifers. Aquifers may create underground liquid bodies that look like lakes, as well as water or lava waterfalls. Note that &lt;a href=\"lava%20lake\"&gt;lava lake&lt;/a&gt;s are also generated underground, but they're not aquifers.\nAquifers below Y=0 may sometimes generate with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; instead of water. And aquifers from y=-55 to -63 always consist of lava.\nIf two liquid bodies of different levels or types are too close, some blocks may be generated between them to separate them.\nStructures and features.\nMonster room.\nMonster rooms, more commonly referred to as dungeons, are structure-like &lt;a href=\"feature\"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;s that appear in the underground that contain &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s. They are small rooms made of cobblestone and mossy cobblestone and contain a monster spawner and up to 2 &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. Finding a monster room without a chest is unlikely but possible.\nAncient City.\nAn ancient city is a palatial structure found in the deep dark, harboring chests containing items that cannot be found anywhere else or that help a player avoid a warden. An ancient city features a very large palace that stretches throughout a deep dark biome. The palace is made up of long corridors with gray wool floors to prevent vibrations as well as some smaller ruins off to the side of the main corridors, which contain between one or two loot chests. The city center features a frame resembling a warden's head, where there are reinforced deepslate blocks, which is an unobtainable material in Survival mode. Other unique blocks such as soul lanterns and candles as well as different forms of deepslate can be found here.\nMineshaft.\nA mineshaft is a generated structure found underground or underwater, having mazes of tunnels with cave spiders and ores exposed on the walls or floor regularly.\nLava lake.\nLava lakes may generated underground with air pocket, which makes them look like small caves with lava aquifer.\nAmethyst geode.\nAn amethyst geode is a &lt;a href=\"feature\"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; found in the underground of the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. Amethyst geodes contain &lt;a href=\"smooth%20basalt\"&gt;smooth basalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt;, and are the only source of &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20cluster\"&gt;amethyst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20shard\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20amethyst\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCave biomes.\nThere are some &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s generated only in caves.\nDripstone Caves.\nA dripstone cave is an underground &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; biome which is often found far away from oceans, in areas with high &lt;a href=\"continentalness\"&gt;continentalness&lt;/a&gt; values. It features a landscape filled with stalagmites and stalactites, as well as giant versions of them, as well as &lt;a href=\"dripstone%20block\"&gt;dripstone block&lt;/a&gt; littering the ground. Small sources of water can be found on the floor. &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt; can spawn here in aquifers.\nLush Caves.\nA lush cave is an underground &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; biome that is usually found below biomes with high &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; values. It is filled with unique flora, &lt;a href=\"cave%20vine\"&gt;cave vine&lt;/a&gt;s covering the roof, and &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; pools of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on the bottom. This biome can be found underground below &lt;a href=\"azalea%20tree\"&gt;azalea tree&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt; can spawn here.\nDeep Dark.\nThe deep dark is an Overworld biome that generates deep underground (below Y = 0), usually in mountainous areas with low &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt; values, and never below an ocean. The floor in this biome often has patches of &lt;a href=\"sculk\"&gt;sculk&lt;/a&gt; blocks surrounded by &lt;a href=\"sculk%20vein\"&gt;sculk vein&lt;/a&gt;s, which include sculk-related blocks such as &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"sculk%20catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt;s. No mobs spawn in this biome, but if a player triggers the sculk shriekers a certain amount of times, the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; may appear, giving the player the &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; effect."}

If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.\nNatural generation.\nChains generate in &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s and sometimes in &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s that generate in the Nether.

They generate on the sides of a wooden bridge (a mid-air corridor) when the distance between the bridge and the highest solid block below it is higher than the distance to the lowest solid block above it. Chains here generate vertically in a pillar between the bridge and the ceiling. The lowest block of the pillar, connecting the chain to the bridge, is always either an oak or a dark oak &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; depending on the type of mineshaft.\nUsage.\nChains can be used to suspend &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hanging%20sign\"&gt;hanging sign&lt;/a&gt;s, or both types of &lt;a href=\"lantern\"&gt;lantern&lt;/a&gt;s (normal lanterns and soul lanterns), as the chain texture connects to the chain of the lantern seamlessly as if it were part of it, and it connects the hanging sign chains together. Chains do not require a supporting block to be placed whether it is on the top, next to it or at the bottom. It can exist completely free-standing in mid air and it can be rotated. Chains connect horizontally or vertically, but not across different orientations (so a chain with N orientation does not connect to a chain with E orientation in the adjacent block).\nHorizontal chains one block above a surface may be walked over. Horizontal chains two blocks above a surface prevent players from traveling past them. Vertical chains block travel if targeted directly, but may be skirted.\nPrecision is required, but chains can be walked on, allowing for inconspicuous, although somewhat costly, bridges.\nChains can be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s without being broken."}

For instance, if a Channeling trident hits an &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt; next to a creeper in water, the lightning is summoned as normal, and the creeper becomes charged from being in the affected radius of the lightning.\nChanneling tridents thrown at &lt;a href=\"lightning%20rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt;s always create lightning without the need for a mob.\nLightning created with a Channeling trident cannot be redirected into a lightning rod.\nLightning from a Channeling trident never spawns a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Horse\"&gt;skeleton trap horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIncompatibilities.\nChanneling and &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; are mutually exclusive. If combined using commands, Riptide supersedes Channeling."}

Just like meadows, &lt;a href=\"emerald%20ore\"&gt;emerald ore&lt;/a&gt;s can be found here, especially at higher altitudes, and both &lt;a href=\"Coal%20ore\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; ores are commonly found here. &lt;a href=\"Infested%20block\"&gt;Infested block&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ore%20%28feature%29\"&gt;blobs&lt;/a&gt; also naturally generate in cherry groves. &lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;s cannot generate here, but , &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outposts\"&gt;pillager outposts&lt;/a&gt; can. , unlike most overworld biomes, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; patches cannot generate here.

The cherry trees can generate densely enough to create a cover of leaves. The cherry grove biome is good for a &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode world, as the sparseness of trees can help the player not to get lost while collecting unique resources. However, care should be taken when exploring underground, because as a mountain biome, the Deep Dark will usually be underneath a cherry grove. \nWhile using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s in this biome, pink petals generate on the ground in place of small flowers.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\n, cherry groves use the same mob spawning chances as meadows.\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Cherry Grove."}

Chests always drop themselves when mined. If the chest contains items, the items are also dropped when the chest is broken. If one half of a large chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed chest are dropped and the remaining half continues to function as a small chest.\nNatural generation.\nChests generate naturally in all three dimensions. They generate in &lt;a href=\"monster%20room\"&gt;monster room&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20cities\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarge chests can occasionally generate in &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Room\"&gt;monster rooms&lt;/a&gt; by one single chest generating next to the other. They can also generate in certain types of &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBonus chest.\nThe bonus chest is a chest that appears near the player's spawn if the \"Bonus chest\" option is toggled on the &lt;a href=\"main%20menu\"&gt;main menu&lt;/a&gt;. It generates with a semi-random collection of basic items to help the player survive early on and gather necessary resources, including wood, tools, blocks, and food.\nUsage.\nChests can be used as containers and as crafting ingredients.\nTo place a chest, use the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt; on the face of a block adjacent to the space the chest should occupy.\nA chest placed adjacent to another chest joins to create a large chest. A player can prevent this, and place two small chests side by side, by while placing the second chest, pushing a chest into place with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, or placing the second chest facing a different direction from the first chest. Alternatively, &lt;a href=\"trapped%20chest\"&gt;trapped chest&lt;/a&gt;s do not combine with normal chests.\nChests can be moved by pistons, and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow around chests without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to chests as if the chests were flammable, but the chests do not actually catch fire and cannot be burned.\nContainer.\nA small chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large chest has twice that amount, at 54 slots. In the \"Java Edition\" interface, the top three rows for a large chest correspond to the left half of the chest when facing it, and the bottom three rows correspond to the right half. In Bedrock Edition, the top three rows correspond to whichever half was placed first and the bottom three to the other half.\nChests open when . To move items between the chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. Holding and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the chest, to the extent that space is available for them. To exit the chest GUI, use the control.\nA chest cannot be opened if there is an opaque block above it (, bottom-half slabs prevent chests from being opened). Solid faces do not prevent chests from opening, so the lid of the chest can phase through blocks such as bottom-half &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, and transparent full cubes such as &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s sitting on chests prevent them from opening. Because chests themselves are functionally transparent, two chests can be stacked on top of one another while still allowing the lower chest to be opened. Players can open chests when players are being hurt (effect of instant damage, poison, wither, fatal poison or on fire) or hurt by anyone (&lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.).\nBy default, the GUI of a chest is labeled \"Chest\" and the GUI of a large chest is labeled \"Large Chest\". A chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the chest in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; before placing it, or by using the command (for example, to label a chest at (0, 64, 0) as \"Bonus Chest!\", use ). If half of a large chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large chest, but if the named half is destroyed the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large chest have different names, the GUI uses the name of the northernmost or westernmost half.\n, a chest can be \"locked\" by setting its tag using the command. If a chest's tag is not blank, the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the codice_1 tag's text. For example, to lock a chest at (0,64,0) so that the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Chest Key\", use .\nThe capacity of a chest varies greatly, depending on its size, whether the items inside it are stackable, and whether &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es are used. The minimum capacity is obtained when storing only non-stackable items while the maximum capacity can be achieved when storing items that stack to 64. Filled shulker boxes are not stackable, but each can hold 27 stacks of up to 64 items (excluding other shulker boxes), so filling a chest with them increases the maximum by a factor of 27.\nDonkey, mule, or llama pack.\nA chest can be added to a &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt; by pressing on the respective animal.\nA chest attached to a donkey or mule has only 15 slots. A chest attached to a llama has anywhere from 3 to 15 slots depending upon its \"Strength\" value (see ). The chest cannot be removed except by killing the carrier. The chest can be opened by holding and pressing , or by riding the carrier and pressing .\nIf shulker boxes are again used, each donkey, mule or strength value 5 llamas with a chest attached to it can carry up to 405 stacks of items (up to 25920 items), and with strength value 5 llamas, each caravan of 10 llamas with inventories full of shulker boxes can carry up to 4050 stacks of items (up to 259200 items).\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s become hostile toward &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s who open or mine chests.\nFuel.\nChests can be used as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per chest.\nNote blocks.\nChests can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce the \"bass\" sound.\nChristmas chest.\nOn December 24\u201326, chests, large chests, and their trapped chest counterparts have their textures changed to \"Christmas chests\" that look like wrapped Christmas presents. Since the game uses the date stored on the player's computer, players can access the Christmas chest textures at any time by changing the date on their computers to December 24-26.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA chest has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\""}

Chickens do not spawn in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice%20spikes\"&gt;ice spikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Badlands%23Wooded%20badlands\"&gt;wooded badlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jagged%20peaks\"&gt;jagged peaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"frozen%20peaks\"&gt;frozen peaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stony%20peaks\"&gt;stony peaks&lt;/a&gt;. , chickens are more common in &lt;a href=\"sparse%20jungle\"&gt;sparse jungle&lt;/a&gt;s. Chickens spawn individually after the world generation and 5% of chickens spawn as baby chickens. , chickens require a light level of 7 or more to spawn and spawn in groups of two to four during the world generation.\nChicken jockey.\nAll baby &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; variants and baby &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s have a 5% chance to spawn riding a chicken, forming a chicken jockey. Because a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.25% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%. A chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command: \nChicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped. Baby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a &lt;a href=\"golden%20sword\"&gt;golden sword&lt;/a&gt;. Harming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack. Chickens spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; in this way.\n, baby zombie jockeys do not spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking the player, a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;, an adult &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nAdult chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay an egg every five to ten minutes. \nWhen an adult chicken is killed, it drops from zero to two feathers. The maximum is increased by one per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of zero to five with Looting III. The chicken also drops a raw chicken or one &lt;a href=\"cooked%20chicken\"&gt;cooked chicken&lt;/a&gt; if it is killed while on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;). The maximum is increased by one per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of one to four with Looting III. From one to three &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs are dropped when the chicken is killed by the player or a tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; or ten experience orbs if it was part of a &lt;a href=\"chicken%20jockey\"&gt;chicken jockey&lt;/a&gt;. When two adult chickens &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt;, from one to seven experience orbs are dropped. Killing a baby chicken yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nA chicken wanders aimlessly but go after players holding various seeds within a six by four by six cubic area, while a baby chicken follows adult chickens. Chickens uniquely attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally. \nChickens avoid falling off cliffs and flap their wings when they are in middle air and fall slowly, thus they are immune to fall damage. When harmed, chickens flee around for a two seconds. &lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es pursue and attack chickens. \nWhile in a loaded &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;, an adult chicken lays an &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; every five to ten minutes (from 6000 to 12000 in-game &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s), unless it is or was, a part of a &lt;a href=\"chicken%20jockey\"&gt;chicken jockey&lt;/a&gt;. If the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, an indicative sound is heard.\nChickens stay underwater for 15 seconds or can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water surface. While swimming, a chicken needs only one block of air above its head.\nA chicken is 11 pixels or 0.6875 blocks tall. A baby chicken is 5.5 pixels tall or 0.34375 blocks tall.\nBreeding.\nIf two adult chickens are fed &lt;a href=\"wheat%20seeds\"&gt;wheat seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot%20seeds\"&gt;beetroot seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon%20seeds\"&gt;melon seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20seeds\"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"torchflower%20seeds\"&gt;torchflower seeds&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"pitcher%20pod\"&gt;pitcher pod&lt;/a&gt;, a baby chicken spawns. The adult chickens cannot breed for five minutes afterward.\nBaby chickens take 20 minutes to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed seeds. A baby chicken fed a seed once per second will grow up in approximately 48 seconds using 47 seeds. A baby chicken fed a seed once per ticks will grow up in approximatedly three seconds using 56 seeds. Baby chickens are smaller than a half-block and can unwillingly pass through openings smaller than a full block, but do not walk through half-block-tall spaces. A baby chicken riding a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; cannot be hit because it is completely inside the minecart's &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt;.\nEggs.\nChickens are an &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; mob that can repopulate without breeding. Adult chickens lay eggs at random and an &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; thrown at the ground by a player or a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; has a chance of spawning a baby chicken. If a baby chicken spawns from a thrown egg, there is a further chance to spawn three extra baby chickens or overall. It is theoretically possible for a stack of 16 eggs to yield 64 chickens if all spawn chances succeed for all eggs.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; throws an &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;, the baby chicken can spawn on the far side of the pane.\nAs chickens can produce each other with eggs, they're perhaps the only passive mob you can farm with just a single individual, if you're willing to wait patiently and constantly throw eggs.\nSounds.\nChickens use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nChickens have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nHistory.\n "}

They do not drop anything when pushed by a piston or water, destroyed by a ravager, or when their supporting block (the &lt;a href=\"chorus%20plant\"&gt;chorus plant&lt;/a&gt; block) is destroyed, since the chorus flowers grows on top of &lt;a href=\"chorus%20tree\"&gt;chorus tree&lt;/a&gt;s. They also drop when hit by a trident, arrow, or &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; shot from a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;.\nNatural generation.\nChorus flowers are naturally generated in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; at the top of &lt;a href=\"chorus%20tree\"&gt;chorus tree&lt;/a&gt;s, in their fully-grown state.\nUsage.\nChorus flowers are used to grow chorus plants. They can be planted on &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; in any dimension.\nChorus flowers can be pollinated by &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFarming.\nChorus flowers can be planted on &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; and grow in any dimension, regardless of light level. A flower stops growing once it has reached age 5 (appearing purple rather than white), but may be harvested and replanted to reset the age. Chorus flowers do not grow if planted 1 block below the surface of the ground.\nPlacement and growth.\nChorus flowers must be above &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"chorus%20plant\"&gt;chorus plant&lt;/a&gt;, or be above air and horizontally adjacent to exactly one chorus plant. If these conditions are not met, the block breaks without dropping anything.\nEach block tick until the flower reaches age 5, the flower attempts to grow if the block above is air. The flower does not age if growth is not attempted due to lack of an air block above. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; has no effect on growth.\nThe flower may attempt to grow upward depending on the structure of chorus plant blocks directly beneath:\nThe growth attempt succeeds if the blocks horizontally adjacent to and above the target block above are all air, and results in the target block becoming a flower block with the same age while the existing flower block turns to chorus plant.\nIf upward growth does not occur and the flower's age is less than 4, the flower may attempt to branch horizontally. 1\u20134 branches are attempted on an unbranched plant or 0\u20133 on a branched plant. For each branch a horizontal direction is chosen at random, and if the block in that direction is an air block with more air blocks on all other horizontal sides and an air block below, it is replaced with a flower with age incremented by 1. If at least one branch succeeds, the original flower block is turned to chorus plant.\nUpon a successful growth attempt, the chorus flower emits a low-pitched sound, similar to the sound &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; emit when teleporting.\nIf no growth occurs on a growth attempt, the flower's age is set to 5.\nThe amount of chorus flowers a player gets from a fully and unrestricted grown chorus plant ranges from 1 to 8, averaging at around 3.7 flowers per plant. \nPlant heights range from 5 to (rarely) 22 above the &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; block on which the original chorus flower was planted, with over half falling in the range 13\u201316. Flower heights range from 3 to (rarely) 22, with over half falling in the range 11\u201316 above the end stone block."}

Chorus fruit has a cooldown of 1 second before being able to be used again. The cooldown is represented by a white overlay on the chorus fruit in the hotbar. The cooldown is applied to all chorus fruits items, including those in the player's inventory and containers.\nEating chorus fruit may teleport the player into areas protected by &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier blocks&lt;/a&gt;, or other blocks that are otherwise unbreakable in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode.

They can walk on &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and be &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;d and ridden by the player. A &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;warped fungus on a stick&lt;/a&gt; is needed to control a strider, similar to how a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt; is controlled by a &lt;a href=\"carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nStriders can spawn in every &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; biome. Two to four striders spawn on spaces of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; that have an &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; block above. , striders are the only &lt;a href=\"passive%20mob\"&gt;passive mob&lt;/a&gt; in the Nether, so spawning attempts are made every 400 &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt;s. , striders share the animal population cap with &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s and their spawn rate depends on biome, being impacted by the ability of other mobs to spawn at a given coordinate.\nFor every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional &lt;a href=\"baby\"&gt;baby&lt;/a&gt; strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. This behavior is limited to one strider. A baby strider on the adult strider continues to grow although it does not dismount the adult strider once it has grown up. \n&lt;a href=\"Zombified%20piglin\"&gt;Zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider. If this happens, the strider spawns with a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt; and the zombified piglin spawns carrying a &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;warped fungus on a stick&lt;/a&gt;. The zombified piglin does not despawn naturally, and does not count towards the mob cap. On &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, the zombified piglin despawns immediately, leaving a saddled strider.\nIf a strider spawns under &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, it rises out of the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. , baby striders spawn more commonly than adult striders do, including when spawned by a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nAdult striders drop 2\u20135 upon &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 2\u20138 with Looting III.\nStriders wearing a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt; always drop the saddle upon death, regardless of whether they spawn wearing it or a player put it on them. The only way to remove a saddle from a strider is to kill the strider. When an adult strider is killed by a player or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, / experience is dropped.\nBehavior.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; does not damage striders. Unlike most &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, striders can walk on top of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; without sinking. Upon being harmed by another mob, striders attempt to flee for a few seconds while making \"retreat\" noises. Striders are damaged by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"splash%20water%20bottle\"&gt;splash water bottle&lt;/a&gt;s, which deal damage by per splash water bottle or half-second in water or rain, which can kill them. While in water, they slowly sink while taking damage. Striders still take damage from rain even if they are in lava. However, they are not harmed when standing in a filled &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. They are not harmed by &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s. They take extra damage from freezing in &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, striders can exist safely in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, as long as they are kept away from water and rain. Unlike some other mobs, striders do not zombify when leaving the Nether. Striders outside of lava change to a dull purple color, change their expression to more of a frown, shiver, and their legs become slightly shorter. They also move slower when outside of lava. \nIf a strider has the effect applied to it, the strider moves faster on both land and lava (though its land speed is still considerably slow). If a zombified piglin is riding a strider, the strider pursues the player if the zombified piglin is angered.\nDue to a bug, striders that fall from a height take fall damage when landing in lava source blocks. This does not occur for striders that fall into flowing lava. A baby strider on an adult strider still grows into an adult. Apart from this, adult striders riding other adult striders do not spawn naturally. Baby striders not riding on an adult follow the closest adult strider.\nRiding.\nThe player can ride on an adult strider using a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;. \nSimilar to how &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s are controlled using a &lt;a href=\"carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt;, striders move forward automatically while their direction is influenced using a &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;warped fungus on a stick&lt;/a&gt;, at a speed of 4.14\u00a0m/s if on a flat lava surface (such as the Nether &lt;a href=\"lava%20sea\"&gt;lava sea&lt;/a&gt;) or 1.74\u00a0m/s if on land. They walk especially slowly against the lava flow direction.\nWarped fungus on a stick can be , causing the strider to boost and walk at a greater speed and taking 1 point of durability from the warped fungus on a stick. They also follow players holding a &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus\"&gt;warped fungus&lt;/a&gt; or a warped fungus on a stick. \nUnlike underwater boats, players riding striders into lava (for example, getting into flowing-only from heights or horizons, static lava from horizons) do not dismount if the strider submerges into the lava, and striders slowly rise back up to the surface if this happens. However, players risk getting burned by the lava while submerged. However, , players cannot start riding a strider that is fully submerged within the lava.\nWhen ridden over land, striders automatically walk up any one block high slope. They also cross any 1-wide block gap or air space that is only one block higher - diagonally up - when ridden directly upward and not completely sideways to the slope.\nTo safely dismount from a strider, a player who does not have &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; may face a solid block within reach before dismounting to dismount onto that block, instead of at the strider's location (which is usually in lava).\nStriders can still be equipped with a saddle while another mob is riding it.\nBreeding.\nIf striders are given &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus\"&gt;warped fungus&lt;/a&gt;, they breed to create baby striders, granting the player 1\u20137 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs. The parent striders have a cooldown of about 5 minutes before they can breed again. All babies obtained through breeding take 20 minutes to grow up. The growth of baby striders can be slowly accelerated using warped fungus; each use takes 10% off of the remaining time to grow up.\nSounds.\nStriders use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nStriders have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

{"id": "14621", "revid": "50268604", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14621", "title": "Stronghold", "text": "The stronghold is an underground &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; that occurs naturally in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and is the only place where an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Strongholds can be located by using an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneration.\nStrongholds generate at any Y level, mostly underground, and prefer to generate in &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s above sea level, but generate underwater if necessary. Strongholds may generate at &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; level, cutting the bedrock. \nMost parts of the stronghold can be overwritten by &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s, abandoned &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20geode\"&gt;amethyst geode&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"monster%20room\"&gt;monster room&lt;/a&gt;s, but it is rare for the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; to be replaced, which would force a player to find one of the other strongholds, as a portal can be activated only with all 12 &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt;s present. &lt;a href=\"Ravine\"&gt;Ravine&lt;/a&gt;s do not overwrite strongholds; rather, a stronghold can occasionally be found exposed by a ravine.\n, strongholds are at least 160 blocks away from the world origin. There is no limit to the number of strongholds that can generate. There are 3 extra strongholds at least 453 blocks away from the world origin. \nBecause \"Bedrock Edition\" begins stronghold generation at a spiraling staircase, it is rare to find no portal room in the stronghold.\n, all strongholds are located at random coordinates within rings in all biomes, where each ring is a certain radius from the center of the world (X=0, Z=0). For a given ring, the strongholds are generated at roughly equal angles from the center point of the world, each stronghold in a ring of 3 is in the region of 120 degrees from the others, measured from the origin. The game does not generate a stronghold partially above-ground, any portion above the sea level is replaced with &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a cutaway. If a stronghold generates in an &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;, it generates with terrain covered above it.\nThere are eight rings, containing 128 strongholds in total:\nStructure.\nStrongholds vary in size and contain rooms built of &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; (45%), &lt;a href=\"mossy%20stone%20bricks\"&gt;mossy stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; (30%), &lt;a href=\"cracked%20stone%20bricks\"&gt;cracked stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; (20%) and &lt;a href=\"infested%20stone%20bricks\"&gt;infested stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; (5%). Infested cracked stone bricks and infested mossy stone bricks do not generate, unless &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; enter these blocks. Strongholds are lit by enough &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es to provide visibility in most areas, though not enough to suppress &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; spawns. &lt;a href=\"Stairs\"&gt;Stairs&lt;/a&gt; that generate within these structures include stone brick and cobblestone stairs, but not their mossy variants.\nIn generated corridors and storerooms, dispersed &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s containing a variety of &lt;a href=\"%23Loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nRooms.\nStrongholds feature various types of main rooms. Each room has an entrance, which is either a plain 3\u00d73 opening, a wall with an oak wooden &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, a wall with an iron door with a stone &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; on each side or a 3\u00d73 opening with a gate of &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt; along the top and sides. Rooms may have exits to other room pieces or dead-end exits into stone. Additional passages between rooms may exist if their generation overlaps or if the stronghold intersects a cave or other structure. Sometimes, doors can be sealed off by stone bricks in five-way crossings, resulting in hidden doors.\nStronghold generation begins with a spiral staircase room with a five-way crossing at the bottom, with additional rooms being generated from the exits of previous rooms up to a maximum distance of 50 rooms and 112 blocks horizontally. If a portal room is not generated, the generation is redone. \nThe wooden and iron doors always face the direction the stronghold generates towards, meaning a door flush with the wall always leads away from the starting staircase and a door indented into the wall leads towards the starting staircase. \nLibraries.\nLibraries occur in two sizes: small libraries and duplex libraries. All libraries contain &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt;, oak &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; and one (single level) or two (duplex) &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, with &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s dispersed.\nSmall libraries usually generate when the second level of the library is blocked by another part of the stronghold. If there are no obstructions, then large libraries usually generate. \nLarge libraries contain a second level consisting of a surrounding balcony with &lt;a href=\"oak%20fence\"&gt;oak fence&lt;/a&gt;s as railings and fences and &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es arranged like a chandelier over the center of the room. The two levels are connected by a &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; on the wall furthest from the entrance. No cobwebs generate on the second level. \nLibraries are the most well-lit rooms in the stronghold, having enough torches to prevent mob spawning entirely within them.\nHistory.\n "}

After defeating the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, gateways to the outer islands are created.\nStructure-like features.\nThese worldgen features have similarities to structures but they are not true structures. Instead, they are coded and generated the same way as trees or ores. This is why they generate even when the \"Generate structures\" world option is disabled, and also cannot be located with the command.\nRemoved structures.\nThese are structures that have been removed or exist only in older versions of \"Minecraft\".\nTechnical details.\nStructures are generated for a given chunk after the terrain has been formed. The &lt;a href=\"chunk%20format\"&gt;chunk format&lt;/a&gt; includes a tag called that indicates whether structures whose \"point of origin\" is in that chunk have been generated. If it is false or missing, it generates again. Structure generation is based on what is already in the chunk, so (for example) flagging a chunk that has already been populated for repopulation approximately doubles the amount of ore in it. When structures are generated, they can spill over into neighboring chunks that have been previously generated.\nData values.\nID.\nThe following table lists configured structure features' IDs and structure features' IDs .

Sugar canes do not grow faster in swamps or deserts they only spawn a increased amount.\nSugar cane cannot generate in caves .\nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s can sell sugar cane for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nDue to its water-displacing properties, sugar cane can interestingly be used to create underwater paths, allowing &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s to move at normal speed and breathe if it is two blocks in height.\nSugar cane takes on a different shade of green depending on the biome in which it is placed.\nFarming.\nSugar cane can generate naturally up to any number of blocks tall, but \"grow\" only to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top sugar cane block has received 16 random &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Block%20tick\"&gt;block tick&lt;/a&gt;s (i.e. on average every 18 minutes on \"Java Edition\" or 54 minutes on Bedrock Edition, but the actual rate can vary widely). \nSugar cane must be planted on a &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20sand\"&gt;suspicious sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt; that is directly adjacent to &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"waterlogged\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; block, or &lt;a href=\"frosted%20ice\"&gt;frosted ice&lt;/a&gt; (not merely above or diagonal to water), or on top of another sugar cane block. The adjacent water block can be covered with another block, whether &lt;a href=\"opacity\"&gt;opaque or transparent&lt;/a&gt;, and sugar cane can still be placed and grow next to it. Sugar cane grows regardless of light level, even in complete darkness.\n, &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used to instantly grow sugar cane to three blocks. Only one bone meal is consumed. , bone meal cannot be used on sugar cane.\nOn average, it takes &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Sugar_cane_farming%23Mechanics\"&gt;18 minutes&lt;/a&gt; for a single block of sugar cane to grow 3 blocks tall.\nComposting.\nPlacing sugar cane into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nList of colors.\n\"Java Edition\".\nThese values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.

As time passes, it slowly moves across the sky. As the sun sets, the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; rises. Overall, &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle%23Daytime\"&gt;daytime&lt;/a&gt; lasts 10 minutes (in real-time).\nSunlight.\nSunlight refers to the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, particularly sky light, which illuminates all blocks directly below the &lt;a href=\"Air\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt;, and which do not have a shadow cast over them by an &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block or by &lt;a href=\"Weather\"&gt;inclement weather&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cloud\"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt;s themselves do not cast shadows; however, during inclement &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; (rain and snow), the sky darkens and reduces the amount of sunlight in the world. During these storms, the ambient light value during the day is reduced to 12 from the usual 15, and in thunderstorms the light level is reduced to 10 although treated as 5, allowing hostile mobs to spawn.\nWhen the sun rises and sets, blocks exposed to sunlight change their light level depending on the angle of the sun, giving the effect of gradually getting lighter at dawn and gradually getting darker at dusk. However, shadows of blocks are not affected by the position of the sun in the sky, making sundials impossible.\nIllumination decreases with depth underground until ultimately there is no illumination all. A gap or a vertical shaft in the ceiling of a &lt;a href=\"cavern\"&gt;cavern&lt;/a&gt; allows sunlight to filter in.\nSunlight can be used to turn &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; blocks into &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, as long as there is an illuminated grass block adjacent to the dirt. Grass blocks spread quickest when exposed to sunlight at the high-point of the day (time 6000).\nEffects on mobs.\nSunlight affects how certain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nExcept for &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, which require light level 4 or lower to spawn, passive mobs require a minimum light level of 9 () or 12 (mooshrooms, polar bears, and rabbits ) or 7 (all other land animals ) to spawn; therefore, they do not spawn at night.\nHostile mobs, in contrast, do not spawn in sky light level 8 or above (see &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Spawn_cycle\"&gt;Spawn#Spawn_cycle&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s are set on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; for 160 ticks upon entering an area fully illuminated by sunlight, and they try to avoid such areas. They do not burn while in water, in the rain, wearing a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;, or in the shade. &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s become neutral while in direct sunlight, until attacked by the player. &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; teleport away from players in sunlight. All other hostile mobs, such as &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, are completely unaffected by sunlight.\n&lt;a href=\"Boss\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; mobs do not take damage from sunlight; they spawn regardless of the light level."}

See also &lt;a href=\"Custom%20dimension\"&gt;Custom dimension&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Custom%20world%20preset\"&gt;Custom world preset&lt;/a&gt;.\nStructure.\nIn the default Superflat world, the terrain consists of one layer of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, two layers of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and one layer of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s. Because the entire world is a plains biome by default, , villages generate relatively frequently; &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s are also generated.

Because of the low &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; of the world, &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s spawn frequently.\nSuperflat worlds allow the player to access &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; in the usual ways, which generate as normal.\nMultiplayer.\n, in order to create a Superflat world in a &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;, the \"level-type\" flag in &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; must be codice_1, instead of codice_2. To alter the layers, biome and structures define \"generator-settings\", which is a string of a JSON object:\n, \"level-type\" in &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; must be \"FLAT\" to generate a flat world.\nCustomization.\n, superflat generator defaults to one layer of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, two layers of dirt, and one layer of bedrock, in \"plains\" biome and generating villages and strongholds. This content can be customized.\nUpon selecting \"Superflat\" in the \"World Type\" box, a new button becomes clickable labeled \"Customize\". In the customize menu, there are two buttons available to customize Superflat worlds, which include the \"Remove Layer\" button, used for removing unwanted types of layers, and the \"Presets\" button, used for preset code string or \"superflat level generation presets\". There are nine original presets, and you can also use data packs to customize presets, see &lt;a href=\"Custom%20world%20preset%23Superflat%20Level%20Generation%20Preset\"&gt;Custom world preset#Superflat Level Generation Preset&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that the default superflat is different from the \"Classic\" preset, where the default superflat (without using any preset) can generate &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s, while the \"Classic\" preset has no stronghold.\nIf the player can understand the &lt;a href=\"%23Preset%20code%20format\"&gt;preset code syntax&lt;/a&gt;, they can create presets of their own by entering valid information into the preset code box, where these changes can be previewed and applied. Preset code is shareable, which is highlightable and copyable. Similar to how new worlds are shared through &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, preset code can be entered into this box to use it.\nNote that the preset code currently cannot fully describe a superflat level generation preset. Settings related to features and structures are inaccessible in the preset code. Using the preset code and the \"Remove Layer\" function to recreate world can only ensure that the blocks on each layer are the same, but cannot guarantee the same settings of features or structures. When using preset code, the settings for features and structures are based on what preset is selected. If no preset is selected, only villages and strongholds are generated. For example, if typing preset code with the Classic Flat preset selected, only villages will be generated. If typing it with the Overworld preset selected, features in Plains biome (except monster rooms) and Pillager Outpost, Village, Stronghold, Mineshaft, Dungeon, and Ruined Portal are generated.\n there is no interface for customizing flat worlds. It always uses the default configuration (one layer of bedrock, two layers of dirt, and a layer of grass blocks) even when the Seed Picker is used. However, custom flat worlds are possible internally, and can be used by modifying codice_3 in the world's codice_4 file using an external editor. This was used for converting &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; custom superflat worlds over to \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\".\nPreset code format.\nThe preset code is a string of numbers, semicolons(;), colons(:), commas(,), and asterisks(*). Each code has three main parts, divided by semicolons. They are:\nFeature generation options.\nNote that several criteria must be satisfied before some features can appear:\nFor example, to have an 'End' superflat world with obsidian pillars, the biome ID must be codice_14, and the top surface block must be End Stone. In this particular case 'Structures' does not need to be turned on in the world options.\nAttempting to use an incorrectly formatted preset code causes the game to default to the Classic preset.\nPreset code example.\nConsider the following preset code: \nIt consists of the following elements:"}

If a player creates a world in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode and then loads it in Survival mode, the player cannot earn achievements in that world.\nGameplay.\nIn Survival, &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s have an &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; that consists of four rows of slots used to store &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, nine of which are found on the &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;hotbar&lt;/a&gt;. All &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s require a certain amount of time to break, unlike &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode where blocks can be instantly destroyed. These items can be used in &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s to create &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s and other items. This process is known as &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;. The recipes can also be accessed by clicking the &lt;a href=\"recipe%20book\"&gt;recipe book&lt;/a&gt; under the 2\u00d72 crafting grid. Most crafting recipes require a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;. Some items cannot be obtained by crafting normally and require a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;processing&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. glass requires sand for smelting). Various other crafting stations exist for other uses, such as &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;repairing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Survival mode, the player is able to receive &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from the environment (fall damage, suffocation, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and freezing) and from &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s (unless playing on &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt;, where hostile mobs are disabled). A player who receives enough damage &lt;a href=\"die\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;s and returns to the world spawn, or to a previously slept-in bed, or in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt; if the player set one.\nIf &lt;a href=\"cheats\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; are enabled, a player can switch to Survival mode by using the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; but cannot earn &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGoals.\nIn Survival, the main goal is to survive, build, explore, and have fun, but another optional goal in Survival is to defeat the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can \"beat the game\" in Survival mode by defeating the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, but this does not terminate play; it provides a trophy item (a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt;), a large amount of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, triggers the \"&lt;a href=\"End%20Poem\"&gt;End Poem&lt;/a&gt;\" and unlocks a gateway to allow easier access to the outer end islands; another common goal is to fulfill all the predefined &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;s. Oceans also invite exploration, as they have corals, monuments, and adapted creatures like &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;. The player can also optionally fight the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; boss in order to obtain a &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt; so that they can craft a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;, which also completes all of the in-game &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s. A player can search for an &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; and more after finding an &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt; in the End. After all, a player can't entirely beat the game.\nSurvival single-player (SSP).\nSurvival single-player is the default game mode of \"Minecraft\". Single-player may be played online or offline, as long as the player has played the game at least once in order to allow the &lt;a href=\".minecraft\"&gt;game files&lt;/a&gt; to be downloaded to their device.\nSurvival multiplayer (SMP).\nSurvival multiplayer allows players to connect to a central \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;. This enables them to interact with each other and work together (or &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;against each other&lt;/a&gt;) in order to achieve their goals. This is mostly used for friends to play on a private server together."}

The light block is also the only light-emitting block capable of producing light level 8.\nObtaining.\nLight blocks cannot be mined, similar to &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, and can be targeted only if the player is holding a Light item in the main hand. Light blocks with a light level of 0 are functionally identical to air.\nThey do not attach to any &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that breaking an adjacent block does not remove the light block. However, they can be broken by replacing them with another block. The exception is &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; (including, , flowing water), which can occupy the same space as a light block. See &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;Waterlogging&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\n, light blocks are available in the Creative &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Across both Java and Bedrock editions, they can also be obtained by using commands such as . , specifying the data value from 0 to 15 determines the block's &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level; if the data value is not specified, the light block emits a light level of 0. The command is: . , using can give a light block with a specific light level and corresponding texture. If the level is below 0, the non-bulb texture is used, and above 15 the level 15 texture.

In the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, light blocks display their light level in the top-left corner and appear \"brighter\" at higher light levels.\n, light blocks appear to be slippery, much like &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;. This can be seen by walking over the top of one with the help of another block.\nLight blocks have a hitbox only when a light block is selected in the main hand; the particle appears only when selected in the main hand in creative mode, similar to &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen pressing use on a light block while a light block is held in the main hand, the light level of the light block increases by one, if the light level is already 15, it resets to 0.\nLight blocks are detected by &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s and can be &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;.

Lightning rods that are the highest block in the column redirect lightning strikes within a spherical volume having a radius of 128 blocks in \"Java Edition\" and 64 blocks in Bedrock Edition. The block emits particles during thunderstorms as an indicator. If multiple lightning rods are in range, the closest to the original location of the strike is chosen.\nLightning can also strike a lightning rod hit by a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; during a thunderstorm or even a normal rainstorm [ , even if there are solid blocks above it blocking rainfall, as long as all the blocks are fully transparent (sky light level 15 at rod position).

A lily pad is broken and &lt;a href=\"Drops\"&gt;drops as an item&lt;/a&gt; when water flows on it.\nNormal blocks can be placed on the bottom side of lily pads (from below). This breaks the lily pad (dropping it as an item), but leaves the block in place. Blocks can also be placed on top of lily pads, though the placed block appears to hover over the pad rather than rest on it.\nA lily pad can be used as a starting point for construction on an ocean surface without having to build up from the ocean floor (see also &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose).\nPlacement.\nLily pads can be placed only on top of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"frosted%20ice\"&gt;frosted ice&lt;/a&gt;. Lily pads occupy the block above water and are not part of the water block itself.\nLily pads must be directly planted on the top of a water, ice or frosted ice block; unlike most blocks, targeting the side of a block that would result in it being placed on top of a valid block does not allow it to be placed. Similarly, targeting the sides or bottom of a block that can support a lily pad will place the lily pad on top. , lily pads can be placed on waterlogged blocks, including top half slabs.\nA lily pad faces a consistent direction that depends on its location; it is unaffected by the direction the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; faces. Replacing a lily pad does not change the direction.\n, unlike most blocks entities can collide with, lily pads can be placed directly inside players.\nComposting.\nPlacing a lily pad into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1."}

On impact they explode, creating a cloud. The cloud is made of the potion particles corresponding to the potion that was thrown. \nThe cloud starts with a radius of 3 blocks, decreasing to 0 over the course of 30 seconds. During the cloud's existence, any player or mob that walks into it after the first second gets the corresponding status effect; this decreases the radius by a block immediately, reducing the cloud's lifespan by 5 seconds.\nFor effects with duration, the duration applied by the cloud is that of the corresponding &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;. For effects without duration such as healing or harming, the potency of the effect is that of the corresponding potion.\nThe effect may be applied consecutively if the player or mob remains in the cloud. For example, a player throwing the Lingering Potion of Healing II straight down consumes the cloud within a few seconds while being healed 5 times for a total of health. As far as healing is concerned, this makes the lingering potion much more powerful than the regular or splash potion, provided that the player is away from other mobs or players.\nLingering potions can also be thrown out of &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s like splash potions.\nLingering water bottle.\nLike the &lt;a href=\"Splash%20potion%23Splash%20water%20bottles\"&gt;splash water bottle&lt;/a&gt;, a lingering water bottle puts out fire and damages endermen and blazes by . It creates no effect cloud.\nMud.\nLingering water bottles can be on &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt; to turn it into &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;.\nFilling cauldrons.\n, using a lingering potion on a cauldron adds one level of that potion to the cauldron. Attempting to add a lingering potion to a cauldron with water, dyed water or a non-matching potion empties the cauldron and creates an explosion sound (but no actual explosion).\nUncraftable lingering potion.\n, the uncraftable potion is a splash potion with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay. It is also available in potion and splash potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.\nIt can be obtained using the following command: . It is also obtained any time a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.\nCustom effects.\n, lingering potions can be obtained with any status effect using and the tag , which is an array of effects for the potion. See &lt;a href=\"Item%20format%23Potion%20Effects\"&gt;Item format#Potion Effects&lt;/a&gt; for more information, and &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; for a list of effects and IDs.\nSounds.\nLingering potions use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nThrown potion.\nEntity Data.\nLingering potions when thrown have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nArea Effect Cloud.\nEntity data.\nThe cloud that is created when: lingering potions are thrown; &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s with potion effects explode; &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon%23Dragon_Fireball\"&gt;dragon fireballs&lt;/a&gt; hit the ground, is an entity, which has entity data that defines the properties of the entity."}

If a siege is to occur, attempts are made each &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; to start the siege until either a siege is successfully started or the sun rises. Specifically, the siege attempt is abandoned when the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;sky light level&lt;/a&gt; reaches 12. However, &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;inclement weather&lt;/a&gt; can allow siege start attempts to continue well past dawn since it reduces the sky light level.\nSiege start checks.\nA player is a candidate for a siege if they are in a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; and that player is not in &lt;a href=\"spectator%20mode\"&gt;spectator mode&lt;/a&gt; or in a biome with the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;.\nTen attempts are made to choose a random siege starting point: first, a point 32 blocks away from the player in a random horizontal direction is chosen, and then a location is chosen (as described below) as if to spawn one zombie. If that succeeds in finding a valid zombie spawning point, the siege is started at the chosen starting point. If all ten attempts fail, the entire siege attempt fails, but another siege may be attempted on the next game tick.\nPlayers are always checked in order, so as long as one player remains a valid candidate later players will not be checked.\nZombie spawning.\nDuring a siege, 20 attempts are made to spawn a zombie over the course of 3 seconds. For each zombie, 10 attempts are made to randomly choose a valid spawning point on the surface (i.e. highest non-air block at given horizontal coordinates) within a 16\u00d716 horizontal distance around the chosen point. If a valid spawn point is found, a zombie is spawned.\nZombies spawned within a siege ignore player proximity and the presence of other mobs. Only the minimal spawning conditions are checked:\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie%20villagers\"&gt;Zombie villagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; are never spawned as part of a siege, but all other variations (e.g. baby, jockey, and equipment) are determined as for normal random spawns.\nThe zombies that spawn as part of a siege behave in the same manner as normally-spawned zombies; they attack all villagers within sight, and villagers and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golems\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt; react accordingly. The zombies despawn as usual if the player is far enough away.\nRecovery.\nIf at least two villagers survive the siege, the villagers can &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Breeding%20and%20population\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; and repopulate the village. Without player intervention, however, it is likely for villages to be wiped out by sieges and randomly-spawned zombies, and all the villagers would be either dead or zombified. \nEven if no villagers survive, a village may be repopulated by curing zombie villagers, or by luring in villagers from another village."}

Neither &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s nor lighting prevents this. \"Portal ticking\" can be used to increase the rate of zombified piglin spawning by repeatedly lighting and breaking a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nZombified piglin spawning via this process is completely independent of the &lt;a href=\"mob%20cap\"&gt;mob cap&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the spawning of &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s , which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world. \nZombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals.\nPigs.\nA zombified piglin spawns when &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes within 4 blocks of a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;. If the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin.\nPiglins.\nA &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt; that enters the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds. When piglins wielding &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attack like other zombified piglins. When baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn. When piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.\nThe newly zombified piglin gets the &lt;a href=\"Nausea\"&gt;Nausea&lt;/a&gt; effect for 10 seconds. This is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.\nA zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified.\nBaby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey.\nIf a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.\nBehavior.\nZombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle. They move at 2.28\u00a0m/s and are immune to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. When provoked, their speed increases to 3.38\u00a0m/s or faster for babies.\n, like &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, zombified piglins can attack wooden doors and may break them on Hard difficulty. \nIn Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55% or 25% of zombified piglins pick up any &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; pieces and &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed. This also prevents them from despawning. \nZombified piglins may pick up an &lt;a href=\"illager%20banner\"&gt;illager banner&lt;/a&gt; next to it as &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s do.\nZombified piglins try to destroy any &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically ), not counting the block they are standing in. When a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it. However, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it.\nZombified piglins avoid walking near &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high. If a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them. If a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.\nZombified piglins do not retreat from &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, soul torches/lanterns, soul fire or soul campfires. Zoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.\nZombified piglins are not distracted by gold, and cannot barter, unlike piglins. They also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.\n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to villagers and wandering traders. In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close. Zombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked, which can happen when a piglin with a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident. Zombified piglins will not become aggressive if a player attacks and/or kills a regular piglin.\nIron golems attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem. A zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.\nMob type.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;, they are:\nHostility.\nZombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area or a 20-block radius centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except &lt;a href=\"goats\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;ghasts&lt;/a&gt;) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit. They make an aggressive sound when angered. In addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked (&lt;a href=\"Zombie%23Reinforcements\"&gt;similar to zombies&lt;/a&gt; and which can rarely include actual zombies). This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, whether its accidentally or purposefully, which includes deflected &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; fireballs, &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sweep attacks&lt;/a&gt;, snowballs and eggs, &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s shot from &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s, TNT, or a skeleton arrow. Arrows shot from dispensers or &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; explosions don't provoke zombified piglins.\nDuration: A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks), and has a direct line of sight with the player. However, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return neutral after a \"forgiveness timer\" expires. , this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds, whereas it is always 25 seconds. The forgiveness timer does \"not\" advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks. Therefore, if the player enters a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded). A player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule codice_1 is true. \nA hostile zombified piglin can also \"sound an alarm\", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 67\u00d722\u00d767 to 111\u00d722\u00d7111 area or 20-block radius. A hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 4\u20136 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers. They pursue players even if they have the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; effect.\n, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.\nHostile zombified piglins have slightly different path finding than when they are neutral. For example, they would fall off edges that would cause them fall damage in attempt to reach the attacker where most other mobs would otherwise not do.\nWhen a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.\nUnlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack villagers and wandering traders.\nIf caught in the Nether with few items or no gold armor, staying near zombified piglins is a good strategy in Java edition. Aggravated piglins will be too afraid to approach the player, and any nearby skeletons shooting at the player will be quickly killed by the zombified piglins. They do not become angry at the player if a mob hits them while trying to attack the player, though they have done so in versions of Pocket Edition.\nSounds.\nZombified piglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nZombified piglins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Effects can be inflicted in various ways throughout the game, including consuming &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s and some &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; items, being in the range of &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;s, and being attacked by or close to certain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. There are otherwise special conditions that inflicts effects, such as killing a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt; which would give the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nThe &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; allows &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s to inflict effects upon themselves and other &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nAny &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; inflicted by an effect are affected in various ways for an amount of time. During the effect, spiral-shaped &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s emanate from the position of the inflicted entity. For most effects, higher levels increase the strength of the effect.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s can open their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; to see any current effects afflicted upon them, as well as the levels and duration of each. In , effects are displayed in a separate screen, which can be opened by pressing on a keyboard, pressing // on a controller, or tapping the effect icon when using touch controls.\nInternally, in the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;, and in potion Amplifier NBT tags, the game stores an \"amplifier\" value, which is one less than the displayed level. For example, Strength II has an amplifier value of 1.\nDue to the way this amplifier is stored in NBT, amplifiers of 128 to 255 (levels 129 to 256) in NBT tags (e.g. on potions) are treated as if they were \u2212128 to \u22121 (levels \u2212127 to 0) respectively. The &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; initially applies such amplifiers in their positive-valued sense but this is later converted to the negative-valued interpretation, leading to inconsistent results. In , amplifiers above 127 translate to positive levels, like other amplifiers.\nAny number of different effects, including opposing effects such as Strength and Weakness, can be simultaneously active on a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is not possible to apply the same effect multiple times, even if they are of different levels (e.g. Strength and Strength II). When applying an effect already active on the player, higher levels overwrite lower levels, and higher durations overwrite lower durations of the same level. \nIn , when the stronger effect overrides the weaker effect, the weaker effect remains, but is hidden. It returns after the stronger effect expires, if the weaker effect has a higher duration than the stronger effect. This change makes it impossible to create custom potion antidotes by applying an amplified effect with a one tick duration.\nIn , when a stronger effect overrides the weaker effect, the weaker effect is deleted and does not return.\nIn , players can use codice_1 to make effect last infinitely.\nWhen drinking from &lt;a href=\"Milk%20Bucket\"&gt;milk bucket&lt;/a&gt;, dying, being saved from death by a &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt;, or traveling through the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, all status effects are removed. Single-player users with cheats enabled and &lt;a href=\"operator\"&gt;operator&lt;/a&gt;s in multiplayer servers can use or to achieve the same goal. In , the command can be further specified to only remove one effect as such; .\n&lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; dealt by effects (a kind of \"magical damage\") completely bypasses &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, making it a good way to deal with highly-armored targets (&lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantments reduce damage taken from effects, however). &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es are the only mob to have natural protection against effects, taking 85% less or 95% less damage from effects.\nImmunity.\nEffects can only be applied to &lt;a href=\"Entity%23Types%20of%20entities\"&gt;living entities&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, certain entities are immune to some or all effects:\nEffect list.\n, positive effects have blue text in potion information and are displayed on the upper row of effects in the &lt;a href=\"heads%20up%20display\"&gt;heads up display&lt;/a&gt;, while negative effects have red potion text and are displayed in the bottom row. Neutral effects have the blue potion text and are listed with the negative effects in the bottom row in the &lt;a href=\"heads%20up%20display\"&gt;heads up display&lt;/a&gt;. , negative effect names in potion and tipped arrow tooltips are shown in red; positive and neutral effect names in these contexts, and all effect names in the \"Mob effects\" screen, are shown in white.\nJoke effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w14a\"&gt;Java Edition 15w14a&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese effects only exist in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w14a\"&gt;15w14a&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2023w13a_or_b\"&gt;Java Edition 23w13a_or_b&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese effects only exist in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2023w13a_or_b\"&gt;23w13a_or_b&lt;/a&gt;."}

It attacks the same way as a normal guardian, but also applies &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; in a large radius around itself. They are only found in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monuments&lt;/a&gt;; three of them generate in each one.\nSpawning.\nThree elder guardians spawn naturally during the generation of each &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;: one in the top room of the monument and the other two in each wing section of the monument. They do not respawn after their initial spawn, thus there are a limited number of them per world.\nDrops.\nElder guardians drop the following items:\nBehavior.\nElder guardians do not swim around as much as normal guardians. Elder guardians do not swim away when approached by a player it is targeting, unlike regular guardians. Like normal guardians, elder guardians attempt to attack both the player and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elder guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players, and always looks directly at its target. The eye still follows a player under the effects of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, but doesn't attack.\nElder guardian are considered &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Water-based%20mobs\"&gt;aquatic mobs&lt;/a&gt;, and thus are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. \nThe elder guardian has three methods of attacking, including firing its laser, inflicting &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and a defensive thorn-like attack. \nThe elder guardian pathfinds toward an ocean monument if it is not within one. \nAn elder guardian attacks &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s that are not playing dead. Otherwise, an elder guardian does not attack mobs (such as &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt;) that attack it, although the attacking mob takes damage from the elder guardian's natural spikes defense.\nLaser.\nThe laser takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage and allowing the player to move away in the meantime. As it charges it turns from purple to bright yellow (thus acting as a warning indicator). Once charged, the beam flashes green, abruptly ends, and deals damage on Hard difficulty. The elder guardian swims around for a few seconds before firing again. The beam cannot be dodged and has a maximum range of approximately 14 blocks. Once the player is out of range, if the beam is obstructed by solid blocks, or if the player has a shield, the guardian's beam disengages from the player and deals no damage.\nInflicting Mining Fatigue.\n, immediately after spawning and once each minute thereafter, the elder guardian searches for any player within a spherical radius of 50 blocks to afflict with &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; III. the elder guardian inflicts any unafflicted player within range immediately.\nWhen afflicted, the player sees a ghostly image of the elder guardian and hears a ghostly noise. The effect decreases a player's attack speed by 30% and decreases mining speed even more for 5 minutes. The attack targets players through blocks, even underground, and a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; offers no defense. This is not considered an attack in regards to the Thorns enchantment.\nThe image of the elder guardian is a particle effect that can be recreated by issuing the command .\nSpikes defense.\nAn elder guardian deals ( on Hard mode) of damage every time it is hit while its spikes are extended, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on armor. If cornered by a player or axolotl, the elder guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at point-blank range.\nElder Guardian Ghost.\nThe elder guardian ghost is an &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Unused%20mobs\"&gt;unused mob&lt;/a&gt; added in &lt;a href=\"beta%201.13.0.4\"&gt;beta 1.13.0.4&lt;/a&gt;. Its file isn't included in the behavior pack, and it can be spawned only by using the command . The elder guardian ghost has defensive spikes.\nThe elder guardian ghost has the same model and texture as the &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;, but uses the player hurt sound, has less health, and is missing the back tail model. When spawned outside of water, it floats upward until it despawns, similar to a mob tied to a balloon, or under a high level of levitation effect, but it passes through blocks. \nThe elder guardian ghost itself isn't immune to suffocation damage, and drops only &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. It behaves similar to custom mobs added in behavior packs with broken AI; the mobs float upward and pass through blocks when hit. \nIf an elder guardian ghost is spawned underwater, it slowly sinks downward, passing through all blocks (including bedrock), until it eventually it falls into the void and dies. When underwater, the elder guardian ghost can rotate its body, look at players, and swim while slowly sinking downward.\nSounds.\nElder guardians use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nElder guardians have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

{"id": "77148", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=77148", "title": "Elytra", "text": "Elytra () are rare wings found in &lt;a href=\"end%20ship\"&gt;end ship&lt;/a&gt;s that are a source of flight in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nObtaining.\nNatural generation.\nElytra are found only in &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s in the treasure room of the &lt;a href=\"end%20ship\"&gt;end ship&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt; guards the elytra and the ship's two loot chests.\nRepairing.\nElytra can be enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; so that they get &lt;a href=\"Item%20repair\"&gt;repaired&lt;/a&gt; as the player collects &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs while wearing/holding them.\nElytra can also be repaired in the player crafting grid, by combining two damaged pairs of elytra together. \nSimilarly, two damaged elytra pairs can be combined on a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nElytra can also be repaired at an anvil using &lt;a href=\"phantom%20membrane\"&gt;phantom membrane&lt;/a&gt;s, which has the advantage that it preserves &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; on elytra. Each phantom membrane restores 108 durability points, exactly 25% of the elytra's total durability. \nEach repair on the anvil, however, also increases the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics\"&gt;prior work&lt;/a&gt; penalty for the elytra, making every subsequent repair increasingly expensive and eventually reaching an upper limit where repairs are no longer allowed because they are \"too expensive\" (even if the player has many XP levels to spare). However, the prior work penalty can be reset to 0 for an enchanted elytra pair when it is disenchanted on a grindstone. Unenchanted elytra cannot be used on the grindstone alone.\nUsage.\nElytra are equipped in the &lt;a href=\"chestplate\"&gt;chestplate&lt;/a&gt; slot, either by placing the item directly in the slot, by pressing while &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;held in hand&lt;/a&gt;, or by firing a point-blank &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; at a target. They are gray in color by default, but they adopt the design of any &lt;a href=\"cape\"&gt;cape&lt;/a&gt; the player is wearing. They maintain their in-world texture design even when they're &lt;a href=\"%23Repair\"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"enchanted\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlying.\nTo fly, the player must press the key while falling, and the elytra spread apart like a beetle's elytra. The player can aim their view around to turn or adjust their pitch. Losing altitude increases speed, and gaining altitude decreases speed. &lt;a href=\"Firework%20rocket\"&gt;Firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to increase speed. Additionally, speed is quickly lost from sharp changes in direction.\nDirectly hitting any surface while gliding too fast causes damage to the player and their armor proportional to flight speed (although this may be calculated from another factor). When a player dies in this way, they receive the &lt;a href=\"death%20messages\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;player&gt; experienced kinetic energy\". The player does not take &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt; from colliding at a shallow angle or a low enough speed. The critical, damaging angle is about 50\u00b0 with the collision surface, and the calculation for damage seems to be as if the player had fallen from their maximum potential glide height to the height of the struck surface. \nA safe and simple cruise with the highest travel distance can be achieved by aiming directly at the horizon while at the glide's altitude limit. The player's speed is slow enough to allow them time to do other things during a long flight, like sort out their inventory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode or when the \"mayfly\" &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt; has been given, the player can alternatively hold the key to fly up, or double press the jump key to move around freely. \nFlight can be stopped by pressing the &lt;a href=\"jump\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt; key. \nSpeed and altitude.\nElytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30\u00b0). If the diver drops to 0 speed, they quickly get accelerated back up to at least this minimum. The diver can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they do not regain nearly as much altitude. In the real world, drag increases with speed, and drag, in turn, slows the aircraft; Minecraft mimics this. To glide from cliff to cliff, a player's best bet is to aim slightly above the horizon.\nSharp turns are a fast way to lose speed. Quicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects. Making a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops. The player aims to glide just above the target, then as they're right over it they immediately reverse directions, then they make readjustments as necessary.\nThe lowest rate of altitude loss is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12\u00b0 or 15\u00b0).\nTo get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude), the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon. This ratio is about 9.47 to 1.\n&lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their \"horizontal\" speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling). The net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without Unbreaking, etc.). Due to this combination, elytra plus Slow Falling is largely a novelty that most players won't use. The &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment does not affect elytra speed and does not reduce fall damage from hitting things with elytra.\nIt is possible to calculate the glide range by dividing the altitude by tan of the glide angle (altitude/tan(glide angle)). For example, if the player glides from an altitude of 64 blocks above ground with a glide angle of 15 degrees, they can glide for 237 blocks (assume that they are on superflat), since floor(64 / tan(15\u00b0)) is 237.\nStalling.\nTrying for too high a pitch reduces the player's lift. At a pitch of 30\u00b0 above the horizon, the player has the lowest possible airspeed of 7.2 m/sec. Above that, the player might be considered to be in a stall. Increasing the pitch gets closer to a free-fall, and stalled flight at 60\u00b0 is enough to cause fall damage. Stalling at 90\u00b0 is a true free-fall.\nRecovering from a stall is done by readjusting to any safe pitch as quickly as the player likes. This can be just changing to look at the horizon.\nPowered flight.\n&lt;a href=\"Firework%20rocket\"&gt;Firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s can be used for propulsion during flight by placing it in either hand and . Using a firework rocket while gliding quickly maximizes the player's speed for a time similar to the rocket's flight duration.\nIf the rocket is equipped with &lt;a href=\"firework%20star\"&gt;firework star&lt;/a&gt;s, it explodes at the end of its flight, inflicting damage based on the number of stars.\nIt is possible to gain altitude during powered flight. This makes it possible to glide for extreme distances and had been used extensively by &lt;a href=\"Far%20Lands\"&gt;Far Lands&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt; challenges.\nDurability and repair.\n&lt;a href=\"Durability\"&gt;Durability&lt;/a&gt; decreases by one point each second when gliding. A pair of elytra has 432 durability, allowing 7 minutes and 12 seconds of gliding time without enchantments, providing more than 10,000 blocks of transport distance. It is possible to apply the &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; enchantment using an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;, which affects the elytra, in the same way it does to &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s. Unbreaking III increases elytra's flight time to about four seconds per durability point, a total of 28 minutes and 44 seconds.\nWhen the durability reaches 1, elytra stop working until they are repaired, adopting a tattered texture in the inventory. The damage ends at durability 1, so they can never fully break. A pair may be repaired by either using the &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, combining two pairs in a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, or combining it in an anvil with &lt;a href=\"phantom%20membrane\"&gt;phantom membrane&lt;/a&gt;s. In an anvil, each piece of membrane repairs elytra by 108 durability points, requiring 4 pieces to fully repair them.\nEach repair on the anvil will also increase the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics\"&gt;prior work&lt;/a&gt; penalty for the Elytra, making every subsequent repair increasingly expensive, with an upper limit where repairs are no longer allowed because they are \"too expensive\". However, the prior work penalty can be reset to 0 for an enchanted elytra pair when it is disenchanted on a grindstone (by adding nothing to it). Unenchanted elytra cannot be used on the grindstone alone.\nEnchantments.\nElytra can receive the following &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; by combining in an anvil:\nGallery.\nDesigns when wearing capes.\nDesigns that are not listed here have default elytra texture or don't have any."}

Books have a decreased chance of getting multiple enchantments (specifically, if multiple enchantments would be added, then one is removed at random), and have a lower \"enchantability level\" than most other items. Treasure enchantments such as Mending cannot be obtained from an enchantment table.\nBartering.\nPlayers can barter with &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s by using or throwing &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, and doing so has a chance for piglins to give the player an enchanted book with any level of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt;. Soul Speed enchanted books are only obtainable through &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; loot inside a bastion remnant, and &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. They cannot be obtained through &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nIn Survival, enchanted books are the only method to obtain certain enchantments on certain tools, such as Unbreaking on &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s. Enchanted books have a shine effect on their sprite.\nTo use an enchanted book, the player must place an item in the first slot in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, and a book in the next. In order to complete the enchantment, the player must have the required amount of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. Note that using an enchanted book gets significant discounts at the anvil. Enchanted books themselves can be combined to create a single book with increased or multiple enchantments, similar to combining tools or weapons. \nWhen combining items, the compatible enchantments from the book in the second slot are transferred to the item from the first slot, keeping the highest level of any type. If two enchantments have the same level and a higher level is available, they combine into the next level. If a book is applied to an item that can't take all of its spells, the appropriate spells are transferred, while the unusable ones are lost. Enchanted books are single-use. \nEnchanted books do not exhibit their enchantment. For example, a book with Sharpness IV as an enchantment does no more damage than an un-enchanted book, or any non-weapon item, would when used as a weapon. An exception is the Fire Aspect book which can ignite TNT and light campfires and the Mending book if the block mined can be broken by fist.\nAvailable items.\nEnchanted books can enchant the usual items that can be enchanted at an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;, but \"unlike an enchanting table\", they are able to boost enchantments such as Sharpness or Thorns to their maximum power, and may apply the following enchantments to items (the table displays only netherite tools and armor, but any type can be enchanted):\nCreative mode.\nThe player can enchant any item with any enchantment in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, allowing any applied effects to exhibit themselves. For example, a &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt; can be enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; to allow the player to successfully dig &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s. The enchanted item can still be used in Survival mode without any loss of enchantments.\nEnchantments that are normally incompatible are still incompatible; for example, Piercing and Multishot cannot be both applied to the same item, even in Creative mode.\nIf a block is enchanted, it loses the enchantment upon being placed in the world.\nDisenchanting.\nDisenchanting an enchanted book at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; yields a normal &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; and some experience depending on the quality of the book.\nChiseled bookshelf.\n the &lt;a href=\"chiseled%20bookshelf\"&gt;chiseled bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; while having an enchanted book in the main hand will put the book inside the chiseled bookshelf.\nData values.\nItem data.\nEnchanted books use an NBT tag codice_1 to indicate the enchantment. \nThe allowed sub-tags are codice_2 and codice_3, equivalent to the format of the codice_4 tag that is used for enchantments applied to items.\n\"The following NBT structure is provided to show how the codice_1 tag is organized, and is not comprehensive above the codice_6 tag. The full NBT for an item can be found &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Items_and_XP_Orbs\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

A special \"glint\" animation appears on items that are enchanted.\nEnchanting methods.\nThere are four ways to enchant an item in Survival mode:\nA player may also obtain items already enchanted:\nServer operators and players in &lt;a href=\"singleplayer\"&gt;singleplayer&lt;/a&gt; worlds with &lt;a href=\"cheats\"&gt;cheats&lt;/a&gt; enabled can also enchant &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s using &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; such as . When enchanted with the command, the maximum enchantment level is 255 on Java Edition. In &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, items can be enchanted via an anvil and &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Book\"&gt;enchanted books&lt;/a&gt;, with no &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; points required. &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Book\"&gt;Enchanted books&lt;/a&gt; are available in the Creative mode inventory, with individual book displays for the highest level of each enchantment and other levels available via the \"Search\" tab.\nEnchanting table.\nAn item can be enchanted by an enchanting table and placing the item in the input slots and uses 1\u20133 &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; but can hold up to 64 &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;lapis&lt;/a&gt; in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The &lt;a href=\"Enchantment%20Table%23Standard%20Galactic%20Alphabet\"&gt;glyphs&lt;/a&gt;(Random galactic alphabet sentances) here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the \"Efficiency II\" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.\nAlthough the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, but pay only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.\nThe level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are \"maximum strength\" \u2014 a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. On the other hand, it is possible for multiple different enchantments to be given from one use of the enchanting table. For example, a level 30 enchantment applied to a pickaxe may yield both Efficiency IV and Unbreaking III.\nTo increase the enchantment level, &lt;a href=\"Bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; can be placed next to the &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt; while keeping one block of &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; between them. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a total of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the &lt;a href=\"Enchantment%20Mechanics\"&gt;Enchantment Mechanics&lt;/a&gt; page for more detailed information on this.\nEnchanting a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; produces an enchanted book, which does nothing on its own, but effectively \"saves\" the enchantment for later application to another item with an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike with an anvil, using the enchanting table while on Creative still costs experience. However, if the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero.\nAffecting offered enchantments.\nEnchanting any item at any enchantment level changes the player's enchantment seed, which changes the possible enchantments for every item at every enchantment level. Thus, if none of the available enchantments for a tool are desired, 1 lapis lazuli and 1 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; could be spent to enchant a book or a different &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; to refresh the list.\nThe possible enchantments depend on the player's enchantment seed, the item type, and material, and the enchantment level (1\u201330). The following actions do not affect the possible enchantments:\nChanging the enchantment levels offered by adding, removing, or blocking bookshelves alters the enchantments shown, but does not change possible enchantments; using another enchanting table with the previous bookshelf number still shows the previous enchantments. The enchantments for a particular enchantment level (with the same seed and item) do also differ depending on which row they appear in, but they are not \"better\" or \"worse\" based on the row despite the different resource costs.\nAnvil combinations.\nAn anvil can be used to combine the enchantments of two &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, sacrificing one of them and repairing the other. The items must be compatible; they must either be the same type and material (such as two iron swords) or an item and an enchanted book with an applicable enchantment (such as a bow and an &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; enchanted book).\nCombining two enchanted items, books or one of each with the same enchantment at the same level produces an item or book with the next higher level of that enchantment up to the maximum allowed in Survival mode; for example, a book with &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; I and &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; II combined with a book with &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; II produces a book with &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; I and &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; III.\nTo combine items, the player places the target item in the anvil's first slot and the sacrifice item in the second slot. If the combination is allowed, the resulting enchanted item appears in the anvil's output slot and an experience level cost, labeled \"Enchantment Cost\", appears below (green if the player has enough experience levels, red if they don't). To complete the enchanting, the player removes the enchanted item from the anvil's output slot, and their experience level is reduced accordingly.\nThe experience cost depends on the enchantments, with highly enchanted items costing more. If the target item is also being repaired, that costs more as well. The target item can also be renamed, at additional cost. There is also an accumulating surcharge for prior work done on anvils. In Survival mode, work that costs more than 39 levels of experience is refused although it may still be possible to perform the same work in steps. For example, a damaged enchanted bow may be repaired on an anvil with an ordinary bow, and then another enchanted bow may be used to combine enchantments with the repaired bow.\nEnchanted books.\nEnchanted books can be made by enchanting a book in an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt; at the cost of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; points. They can also be found in the chests of several structures, purchased with &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s from a librarian villager, or caught while fishing.\nEnchanted books can be applied to tools, weapons, and armor, or combined with other enchanted books in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;. In this way, some enchantments that cannot normally be obtained on an item through use of the enchanting table can still be applied to those items, such as applying &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; to boots.\nAlthough enchanted books can have multiple enchantments of any type, only enchantments appropriate to a given item type are applied to that item when combined in an anvil. For example, an enchanted book may have both the Respiration and Power enchantments, but the Respiration enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a helmet or a turtle shell. Likewise, the Power enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a bow.\nIn Creative mode, enchanted books can be used to apply any enchantment to any item, such as a stick having &lt;a href=\"Knockback\"&gt;Knockback&lt;/a&gt; II on Java Edition. However, mutually-exclusive enchantments, such as &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be applied this way or even via (though both enchantments function as normal when obtained on a bow through the command).\nThe experience costs for \"using\" books are considerably less than for combining items with similar enchantments since the books themselves cost levels to create. However, it's still an extra cost, and enchanting items directly has a chance to get multiple enchantments. The advantage of books is that they can be stockpiled for use on an item of choice and allow for \"controlled\" combinations. For example, a Silk Touch book can be used on an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;, and the player can decide which item receives which enchantment.\nBest Enchanting order.\nUse &lt;a href=\"https%3A//iamcal.github.io/enchant-order/\"&gt;Order Calculator&lt;/a&gt; to minimize experience loss when merging two items.\nDisenchanting.\nThe only way to disenchant items is via the &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; or by repairing the items via the crafting grid. Using the grindstone removes all enchantments (except &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Curse of Binding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Vanishing\"&gt;Curse of Vanishing&lt;/a&gt;, also known as curses) but gives some experience back based on the level of the enchantment(s) and their value.\nSummary of enchantments.\nEach enchantment in the table below includes attributes that are possible for the player to acquire legitimately in Survival mode.

Enchanting tables draw power from &lt;a href=\"Bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; placed around them, improving applied enchantments at the expense of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting/Levels\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; requirement.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\n, an enchanting table requires a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining is slower and it drops nothing. , a pickaxe is not required.\nUsage.\nAn item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item in the input slots and 1\u20133 &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;Lapis Lazuli&lt;/a&gt; in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The &lt;a href=\"Enchantment%20Table%23Standard%20Galactic%20Alphabet\"&gt;glyphs&lt;/a&gt; here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the Lapis Lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a Lapis Lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the \"Efficiency II\" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of Lapis Lazuli required have no effect.\nAlthough the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the Lapis Lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30-50 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, while paying only 3 levels and 3 Lapis Lazuli.\nThe level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are \"maximum strength\" \u2014 a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example.\nTo increase the enchantment level, &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; should be placed next to the &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt; while keeping one block of &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; between them. Placing any block between the enchantment table and the bookshelves - even a transparent one like a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; - prevents the table from connecting with the shelves. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a total of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20mechanics\"&gt;enchantment mechanics&lt;/a&gt; page for more detailed information on this.\nThe enchanting table is blocks high.\nIf an enchanting table is placed on &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, the player slides on it as though it is an ice block, just like with &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite comprising largely of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, they are not immune to destruction by the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchanting.\nThe enchanting table's main purpose is to enchant items. The table can enchant all tools, armor and gear except &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungus%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;warped fungus on a stick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"recovery%20compass\"&gt;recovery compass&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"horse%20armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt;; all of these (excluding leads and horse armor) can instead be enchanted using an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; and an appropriate &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; is placed next to an enchanting table (with one block of air in between) it increases the maximum enchantment level. There must be 15 bookshelves around the enchanting table in order to obtain the maximum enchantment level of 30.

The enchantment level is dependent upon the number of nearby &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; (capped at 15) and which slot position it is in.\nwhere \"b\" is the number of nearby bookshelves (maximum of 15) and \"x\"..\"y\" generates a uniformly distributed random integer between \"x\" and \"y\", inclusive. This is then modified according to the slot position:\nwhere max(x, y) returns the greater of two values x and y. \nNote that a higher experience cost for a specific slot does not necessarily mean that the enchantments from that slot are better than the others with less cost.\nIn Creative mode, no levels of experience are necessary for enchantments.\nBookshelf placement.\nNearby &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; raise the available enchantment levels; without any bookshelves, the &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;experience level&lt;/a&gt; requirement never exceeds 8.\nIn order to have an effect, a &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; must be placed exactly 2 blocks, laterally, off the enchanting table and be on the same level or one block height above the table. Additionally, the bookshelf must not be blocked. The meaning of \"blocked\" differs on Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.\nBedrock Edition.\nThe 2-high space between the bookshelf and table must be &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; (even a torch, snow cover or carpet blocks the effect), where \"between\" is as shown in the following diagrams (the white spaces are air, and the do not matter):\nJava Edition.\nThe space between the bookshelf and table, at the height of the bookshelf must be &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; or a replaceable block like snow or grass. For corner bookshelves, the space between is 1 block diagonal from the enchanting table; for all other bookshelves, the gap must be to the side of the enchanting table. This is illustrated in the following diagrams (the white spaces are air, and the do not matter):\nThe glyph particles, which fly from bookshelves, follow different rules and may appear even if the bookshelves are not enhancing the table.\nThere are many possible bookshelf arrangements that can reach the enchantment limit. A simple method is to surround the enchanting table with a 1-block high square of bookshelves with an empty space anywhere on the perimeter:\nAnother alternative that is now available is to build a 'library corner' where each bookshelf is two blocks high, as in the plan below. This arrangement gives space for 16 shelves, which is one more than needed, so if the corner bookshelf column cannot be seen, removing one of the two bookshelves in that does not have any effect, either technically or visually.\nSelecting an enchantment level.\nAs enchantments offered depend on the enchantment level and the enchantment level depends on the number of active bookshelves, an easy way to change the enchantments offered is to disable bookshelves by placing torches between them and the enchanting table. That way one can still have the entire 'ring' of bookshelves around the table but get lower-level enchantments. Breaking the torches restores the effect of the bookshelves.\nBedrock Edition.\nWith the layout shown here, enchantments with any number of bookshelves from 0 to 15 may be easily obtained:\nJava Edition.\nWith the layout shown here, enchantments with any number of bookshelves from 0 to 15 may be easily obtained:\nHow enchantments are chosen.\n\"Enchantment level\" is the required experience level (the green number on the bottom-right).\n\"Enchantment power\" is the strength of the particular enchantment. For example, \"Sharpness IV\" has a power of 4.\nThe enchantment algorithm uses a three-step process.\nStep one \u2013 Applying modifiers to the enchantment level.\nThe first thing that \"Minecraft\" does is apply two modifiers to the base enchantment level. Each modifier is restricted to a certain range, with numbers close to the middle of the range more common than those near the ends.\nThe first modifier is based on the item's \"enchantability,\" which depends on the material and the type of the item (see the table below). Other enchantable items such as books, bows, crossbows, tridents, and fishing rods have an enchantability of 1 for this purpose. \"Minecraft\" picks a number between 0 and \"half\" the enchantability, then adds that number plus one to the enchantment level. This random value follows a (like rolling a pair of dice and adding) so results close to a quarter of the enchantability are much more likely than results at the extremes.\nThe modified enchantment level is calculated with the following formula:\nWhere:\nEnchantability.\nNext, \"Minecraft\" picks a value between 0.85 and 1.15, again with a triangular distribution. The modified enchantment level is multiplied by this value (so it could increase or decrease by up to 15%) and then rounded to the nearest integer.\nStep 1 pseudocode.\nThe source is \"Minecraft\" 1.8 source code.\nStep two \u2013 Find possible enchantments.\nNow, based on the modified level, \"Minecraft\" makes a list of all enchantment types that can be applied to the target item along with the power that each enchantment has.\nThe power of each enchantment type is determined by the level and the values in the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting/Levels\"&gt;enchantments levels table&lt;/a&gt;. For each power value of an enchantment type, there is a minimum and maximum modified level that can produce the enchantment at that power. If the modified enchantment level (calculated at the first step) is within the range of an enchantment's possible power values, then the enchantment is assigned the modified enchantment level as power. If the modified level is within two overlapping ranges for the same enchantment type, the higher power value is used.\nTreasure.\nSome enchantments are \"treasure enchantments\" (shown in the table below), meaning they can never be created by an enchanting table, and can be discovered only in certain situations: when generating &lt;a href=\"chest%20loot\"&gt;chest loot&lt;/a&gt; (equipment and books), when &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, when generating enchanted book &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trades&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;, and when an enchanted book is dropped by a raiding &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;.\nStep three \u2013 Select a set of enchantments from the list.\nNow that it has a list of the possible enchantments for the item, \"Minecraft\" must pick some of them to apply. Each enchantment has a statistical \"weight\". Enchantments with higher weights have a higher chance of being selected.\n\"Minecraft\" uses the following weighted random selection algorithm:\nThis algorithm produces the same results as listing each enchantment the number of times given by its weight, then choosing a random entry from the combined list.\nSo, for each enchantment in the list, the probability of it being selected is:\nWhere:\nShields can be given the enchantments Unbreaking, Mending, Curse of Vanishing, and Curse of Binding by using Enchanted Books. \nThe player always gets at least one enchantment on an item, and there is a chance of receiving more. Additional enchantments are chosen by this algorithm:\nWhen enchanting books using an enchanting table, if multiple enchantments were generated, then one selected at random is removed from the final list. This does not apply to other sources of enchanted books that use enchantment mechanics, such as &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; or chests in generated structures.\nConflicting enchantments.\nSome enchantments conflict with other enchantments and thus both can't be enchanted into the same item, effectively taking down the possibility for one to get an overpowered weapon.\nThe rules for enchantment conflicts are:\nConflicting enchantments may appear on an item with specially-crafted commands. The behavior of such items should not be relied upon, but in general:"}

They are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s and hold &lt;a href=\"End%20city%23Loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; among the most valuable in the game.\nGeneration.\nEnd cities naturally generate all over the End's &lt;a href=\"The%20End%23Outer%20Islands\"&gt;outer islands&lt;/a&gt;. They can easily be accessed by entering the &lt;a href=\"End%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway portal&lt;/a&gt;, but it is possible to cross the gap between the islands in other ways. They generate on the large islands, where &lt;a href=\"Chorus%20plant\"&gt;chorus trees&lt;/a&gt; grow. If the end gateway portal teleports the player to a small island, the player can get to the nearest large island by building, using &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, or throwing &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEnd cities usually generate in flat areas, in \"midlands\" or \"highlands\" biomes, which are found on larger islands. One may find several cities clustered together, or travel for thousands of blocks before finding one. Unlike other structures, End cities are generated in a noticeable grid. They are located only in chunks numbered 0-8 \u00b1 a multiple of 20. For example one possible \"cell\" for an End city to be generated in is x_chunks=0-8 and z_chunks=80-88 which is equivalent to the coordinates x=0-128 and z=1280-1408. There can never be an End city at for example z=961-1279 or z=1409-1599 because it is outside any \"cell\".\nStructure.\nEnd cities consist of tall skyscraper-like towers constructed out of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone%20bricks\"&gt;end stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;s. An End city may generate as a single tower by itself, or as a sprawling complex of inter-connected towers and pathways branching from a main tower. &lt;a href=\"End%20rod\"&gt;End rod&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s are the only source of light. Many shulkers spawn around the city, and guard its various treasures. Decorative &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s hang at the tops of some towers.\nSeveral types of rooms can be found in an End city, and several different floors, including:\nThere are two types of towers:\nEnd Ship.\nAn end ship is a floating, boat-like structure found alongside End cities. It is relatively small, but holds even more valuable treasure than the city itself.\nGeneration.\nEach direction of every tower of the End city has a 50% chance of generating a bridge, and the bridge itself has a 12.5% chance to generate an end ship.\nWhen generated, the stern of the ship always faces toward the city and the bow always faces away. It generates in front of a bridge with a gated arch at the end, from which one can throw an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; to reach the ship, or build a bridge.\nStructure.\nThe end ship is made of &lt;a href=\"end%20stone%20bricks\"&gt;end stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;s, just like the city's main towers. Their design resembles that of European square rig sailing ships, commonly seen during the golden age of exploration. Three &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s spawn on the ship; one on the main deck, one behind the stern of the ship, and one in the treasure room.\nMain Deck.\nThe ship's main deck amounts to less than half of the walkable space on the ship. A &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; leads up the mast to an empty crow's nest, about 20 blocks high. There are no sails connected to the mast. \nA &lt;a href=\"dragon%20head\"&gt;dragon head&lt;/a&gt; sits at the bow of the ship, making this the only way to obtain the dragon head in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode. There are two small staircases on the outside; one that leads up to the empty upper deck, and one that leads to the cabin below.\nAftercastle.\nThe aftercastle contains a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a small table, with two &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Instant Health II potions&lt;/a&gt;. Another staircase leads below deck to the ship's \"hotspot\"; the treasure room.\nTreasure Room.\nThe floor of the treasure room is lined with &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. There are four small windows on the sides. It contains two &lt;a href=\"End%20city%23Loot\"&gt;loot chests&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt; holding a pair of &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; wings; this is the only way to obtain elytra in Survival mode.

It can only be placed on &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Explosion\"&gt;explodes&lt;/a&gt; instantly when attacked or damaged in most ways.\nSpawning.\nNatural generation.\nAn end crystal is found atop each &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20pillar\"&gt;obsidian pillar&lt;/a&gt; on the central island of the End, each on top of a piece of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. There are 10 end crystals in total, of which two are protected in \"cages\" of &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt;. All end crystals respawn one after another as the respawning process of the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; starts.\nUsage.\nHealing the ender dragon.\nTheir primary purpose is to recharge the health of the ender dragon, who gains a charge from the nearest crystal within a cuboid extending 32 blocks from the dragon in all directions. The dragon is healed each half-second. If multiple ender dragons are spawned, an end crystal can affect multiple dragons at the same time. The healing beam is neither obstructed nor is its power diminished by entities or blocks.\nRespawning the ender dragon.\nAs items, end crystals may be placed on bedrock and &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, if the two blocks above the bedrock or obsidian block are air or replaceable blocks and no other entities intersect the area. When an end crystal is placed in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; block is created at the end crystal location. If four are placed on the end &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt;, one on each of the flat sides, the crystals respawn the original end crystals on the obsidian pillars, as well as resurrect the dragon itself, before exploding. The top of each pillar also explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks. This happens even if TNT explosions are turned off in settings.\nIf the exit portal is ever broken for any reason, end crystals can still be placed on obsidian blocks with the same location as the exit portal.\nExplosions.\nEnd crystals explode when attacked or damaged in most ways, even by attacks that normally do zero damage. They are not affected by exploding fireworks, and if damaged by an explosion, they disappear instead of exploding. The end crystal's &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; has an &lt;a href=\"Explosion%23Explosion%20strength\"&gt;explosion strength&lt;/a&gt; of 6, the same as a &lt;a href=\"charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creeper&lt;/a&gt;. The end crystal's fire often remains after the crystal explodes. Any ender dragon charging from the crystal when it is destroyed takes damage.\n, an end crystal's explosion can be &lt;a href=\"blocking\"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough an ender dragon damages most blocks and entities in its path, it cannot destroy end crystals simply by going near them.\nPlacing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on the end crystal will neutralize the blast effect, but not the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; or knockback.\nEnd crystals with obsidian or bedrock below them will not damage blocks below them when they explode.\n, having the game rule to will prevent the End Crystal from destroying any blocks. While the same game rule will not prevent the End Crystal from destroying any blocks.\nBeams.\nThe end crystal naturally shoots a beam at the ender dragon and heals it when the dragon is within range. This beam can be manually created using the command }}. The beam can be pointed in any direction, allowing it to mark locations or objects.\nProperties.\nEnd crystals are of two kinds: the ones with a base beneath them are created either by game mechanism or by the command; while the base-less ones are created by players by manually placing the crystal items on top of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe base appears to be made of bedrock, with a crystal hovering over it. While in the End, a crystal continually generates fire at its current position, one block above the base (directly on top of the block the base is embedded in), replacing any other block at that location. This fire is capable of spreading.\nThe end crystal entity is not solid and can be walked through freely. End crystals can be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, but they explode if moved while on fire. Because fire is checked only when an entity moves, end crystals do not normally take damage from their own fire unless moved.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nEnd crystals have entity data that define various properties of the entity."}

Unlike the beam of a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;, this beam does not change color if the player puts &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; over it.\nIt is not possible to disable either of the beams entirely. However, it is possible to edit the age of the block to a negative value, effectively delaying beam-emitting properties of the end gateway.

These can send the player far away to the outer islands, each of which has a corresponding gateway that returns the player back to the central island. There are other randomly-generated gateways that always lead the player back to the &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;obsidian platform&lt;/a&gt;. They provide quick access to the different parts of the End dimension.\nGeneration.\nBy defeating the dragon.\nOn the central island.\nA group of 20 End gateways can be spawned around the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Terrain_features%23Central_island\"&gt;central island&lt;/a&gt;, one at a time by defeating the dragon. Their configuration resembles a perfect circle, equally distributed, surrounding the island at &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;Y-level&lt;/a&gt; 75, at a distance of 96 blocks (regardless of angle) away from the center (0,0) in random order.\nThese gateways are referred in the game as . They function by sending the player far away to the outer islands, in the exact direction that that gateway is located relatively to the island center (0,0).\nThey do not regenerate after the ender dragon has been defeated 20 times.\nThe position of these gateways are always fixed, as is shown below:\nThe order in which these gateways are created as dragons are killed depends on the &lt;a href=\"seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;world seed&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the outer islands.\nEach of the 20 gateways on the central island spawns an additional gateway that is connected to itself, after having been activated once. These gateways are located much further away, reaching out in all directions to the &lt;a href=\"Terrain_features%23Outer_island\"&gt;outer islands&lt;/a&gt; in the End dimension. They still arrange in a circular way, but the distances of them to the central island varies, depending on how far is the first land that they contact.\nTheir function is to send the player back to the original gateway in the central island that it links itself.\nThe game first draws a line with a length of 1024 blocks from the center (0,0) through the north-west corner of the activated gateway. If the chunk at the end of the line contains any blocks above Y=15, the line is progressively shortened by 16 blocks until a chunk is found with no such blocks or the line reaches a length of 768. Then, if the chunk at the end of the line has no blocks above Y=15, the line is progressively lengthened by 16 blocks until a chunk is found with any such block or the line reaches a length of 1280.\nOnce a chunk is selected, it is scanned for any End stone blocks at or above Y=30 that have two non-full blocks above. If such a block exists the south-east corner of the chunk is selected, or if no such block exists in the chunk then a &lt;a href=\"small%20island\"&gt;small island&lt;/a&gt; is generated at the end of the line at Y=75 and that position is selected. The position is then moved to the highest full block within \u00b116 on the X and Z axes (favoring the north and west in case of ties) and a gateway structure is generated 10 blocks above that position.\nKnowing this, the position of the exit gateway can be manipulated. However, once an End gateway on the central island has been activated, it is indefinitely linked to the position of the generated gateway on the outer island. Changing the position of the outer gateway is then no longer possible.\nBy natural generation.\nAnother group of gateways are generated randomly throughout the outer End islands (in the ), where there are an unlimited number of them. They are referred in the game as .\nTheir function is similar to the ones that teleport the player back to the central island, but instead they always send them back to the &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;obsidian platform&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for an easy and quick travel back to the central island. Unlike through &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;end portals&lt;/a&gt;, entities that teleport through end gateways in this fashion do not cause the obsidian platform to regenerate.\nConstruction.\nThe end gateway is composed of an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway%20%28block%29\"&gt;end gateway block&lt;/a&gt; confined within a vaguely octahedral formation made up of 12 &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nBehavior.\nA magenta beam shoots out vertically from the top and bottom of the gateway when it is generated. The beam disappears after 10 seconds. When an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; enters the gateway, the gateway emits a purple beam instead for 2 seconds. In addition, this purple beam also emits automatically every 2 minutes (2400 game ticks) if there is no entity being teleported.\nThe bedrock arrangement prevents the player from entering the gateway directly. Throwing an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; or flying with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; straight into the end gateway block teleports the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to the outer End islands. Players can also access the inside of an end gateway by constructing a water channel leading into it and &lt;a href=\"sprint-swimming\"&gt;sprint-swimming&lt;/a&gt; through the channel and into the gateway, or by &lt;a href=\"crawling\"&gt;crawling&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the gateway is activated, another end gateway generates in the outer end islands near to where the player is teleported; this gateway teleports the player back to the original gateway, providing a way to return to the main island. \n, the position where the player or entity lands after teleporting is determined by a systematic algorithm: the gateway searches for a full block that isn't bedrock, starting from the north-west corner at the topmost height (Y=255) within a 5 block radius around the gateway block (shown as the &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Gold\"&gt;gold block&lt;/a&gt; in the image on the right). If there is a block at that position, then the entity is teleported onto that block. If there is no block, then the next position along the Z-axis is searched (shown as the &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli%20block\"&gt;lapis lazuli block&lt;/a&gt; in the image on the right). This continues along each column in an 11\u00d711 area at the same Y-level with the exception of blocks above, below, or directly adjacent (including diagonals) to the gateway block. If there are no blocks, it moves one Y-level down and repeats the sequence from the north-west corner again. It continues doing this until every height is checked, and if there are no blocks within any of these points it always teleports the entity exactly two blocks above the gateway block.\n, end gateways teleport the player using a different algorithm, but the exact details are not known. A few notable differences are:\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;s, end gateways allow entities with passengers (e.g. a player in a boat, a shulker in a minecart) to go through it."}

It can only be found in the portal room of a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreation.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, the player must venture to a stronghold to activate a pre-existing end portal, as &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt; blocks cannot be obtained naturally. The portal is activated when an &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eye of ender&lt;/a&gt; has been placed in each of the end portal frame blocks, generating 9 &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20block\"&gt;end portal block&lt;/a&gt;s within the structure. Eyes of ender cannot be removed from end portal frames.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, the player can construct an end portal by placing 12 end portal blocks in a ring enclosing an open 3\u00d73 square and placing an eye of ender in each one. In order to activate, the end portal frames must be oriented correctly; the front face of each portal block must be pointed inward toward the 3\u00d73 portal area. This can be achieved by the player standing in the center of the portal area and rotating to place the frames in a ring around them.\nThe end portal blocks do not depend on the end portal frame to exist; thus, one may create standalone portals with commands or by breaking the frames.\nGeneration.\nEnd portals are found within the portal room of a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, hanging horizontally over a pool of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, with a staircase leading up to the portal. A &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; sits in the staircase. Each individual end portal frame block has a 10% chance of containing an eye of ender, as determined by the world seed. This means there is a one in 1 trillion chance for all 12 end portal frames to contain an eye of ender, activating the portal upon initial generation. The frame has the highest probability of generating with only one eye of ender (37.7%), with probabilities dropping to 28.2% for zero, 23.0% for two, 8.52% for three, 2.13% for four, and a total of 0.433% for five or more. Because of the massive amount of possible seeds, over 8 million seeds that generate portals with 12 eyes of ender are known.\nBehavior.\nStepping into an activated end portal immediately opens up a loading screen and transports the player to the End \u2014 this leaves no time to back out, like entering a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; in Creative mode. Upon entering the End, a 5\u00d75 horizontal &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;platform of obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is generated centered at block &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt; (100, 48, 0), and the player is placed on top of it (100, 49, 0, facing west).\nEntering an end portal does not reset &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Fall%20damage\"&gt;falling velocity&lt;/a&gt;. If the player had fallen far enough to die of fall damage before hitting the portal, the player dies upon arrival in the End.\nThe end portal blocks emit a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 15\u2014the brightest light level in game. Only one end portal block is needed to teleport to the End. End portal blocks can be placed anywhere with use of the and commands, and they function as if they were a complete portal.\nActivating the end portal destroys any blocks located in the center 3\u00d73 square, including &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; or another end portal frame. It destroys &lt;a href=\"fluid\"&gt;fluid&lt;/a&gt;s, although if the source block is not also removed, then it immediately flows back through. If an end portal is generated on a &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;, the fire particles remain. The destruction of the blocks does not make any sound, and applicable blocks do not drop as resources (except for the top part of a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; and the extended part of a vertical &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, which both destroy the whole object and drop them as resources). Events sometimes triggered by block destruction fail to occur; &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; simply disappears without detonating, and &lt;a href=\"infested%20block\"&gt;infested block&lt;/a&gt;s fail to spawn a silverfish. However, containers still drop their contents. Mobs (except for the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;) enter the portal similarly to the player. If the player rides a minecart into an active end portal, the player enters the End only after exiting the minecart.\nThe sound for the opening of the portal is a global sound event, meaning it can be heard by all players in all dimensions. This can be disabled by setting the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; to ."}

Otherwise, they drop nothing. Unless the pickaxe is enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the ender chest drops only 8 with no &lt;a href=\"eye%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;. Any pickaxe allows the ender chest to drop either itself or 8 obsidian, despite obsidian itself only being obtainable with a diamond or netherite pickaxe.\nNatural generation.\nEnder chests naturally generate alongside a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; in certain &lt;a href=\"End%20city\"&gt;End city&lt;/a&gt; treasure rooms.\nUsage.\nEnder chests can be opened by pressing the control. If a solid block is placed above an ender chest, it cannot open.\nEnder chests can be used like normal &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, except all ender chests in the world are interconnected, including in different dimensions. The ender chest's inventory is also separate for each player; consequently, items stored in an ender chest cannot be seen or taken by other players. Also, items stored inside of an ender chest can be retained even if the player dies. Even if every single ender chest is destroyed in the world, the items inside the ender chest are still secure, and can be retrieved by placing another ender chest. Because of this player-specific property, ender chests are extremely useful on &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; servers to secure a player's most valuable items.\nDonkeys, mules, and llamas cannot be equipped with ender chests; they support only normal chests.\nEnder chests contain 27 slots for storage and can be placed next to other ender chests without joining; they cannot be combined into double chests.\nEnder chests do not interact with &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite being comprised largely of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, they are not immune to destruction by the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to greatly increase the space of an ender chest by pairing it with &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es (i.e. filling the shulker boxes with desired items, then placing them inside the ender chest).\nLight source.\nEnder chests emit a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 7.\nNote Blocks.\nEnder chests can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nPiglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s become hostile toward players who open or mine an ender chest.\nPiston interactivity.\nEnder chests cannot be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nAn ender chest has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nInventory.\nThe contents of an ender chest are not stored in the block, but in the player-NBT under the tag /. Thus ender chests can be viewed as \"portals\" to a player's 27 additional slots of secure and exclusive inventory.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\""}

It is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game. It guards access to the &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;s that provide entry to the outer end islands in addition to the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; that allows return to the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; as well as access to the &lt;a href=\"End%20Poem\"&gt;end credits&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\". Because of this, it is known by most Minecraft fans as the 'final boss' of the game. Its attacks involve charging at the player and its unique dragon acid attacks.\nSpawning.\nInitial spawning.\nThe ender dragon spawns 20 &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt;s (1 second) after an entity first arrives in the End, along with the bedrock frame for the exit portal.\nRe-summoning.\nPlayers can re-summon the dragon by placing four &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on the edges of the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt;, one on each side. When it is re-summoned, the four end crystals point to the tops of each pillar setting off a series of explosions that resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and end crystals. The top of each pillar explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks. Eventually, all of the end crystals point at the &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt; of (0.0, 128, 0.0) and the ender dragon spawns there. The four crystals placed around the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; then explode. If the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears.\nIf the dragon goes through an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;, another immediately spawns at (0, 128, 0) while the other dragon flies to (0, 128, 0).\nDrops.\nAfter the ender dragon is slain for the first time, the following events take place:\nWhen a re-summoned ender dragon is slain, the same events occur except that only 500 experience points are dropped and no more than 20 gateway portals are generated. The dragon egg appears the first time the ender dragon is slain in \"Java Edition\", and the first and second time in Bedrock Edition; it does not appear after any subsequent dragon slaying.\nBehavior.\nDuring the battle with the ender dragon, unique music called \"&lt;a href=\"Music%23End%20music\"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;\" plays, the edges of the screen darkens and black &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; appears, and &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s around the exit portal are constantly loaded regardless of render distance. These happen as long as there is at least one player within a Euclidean distance of 192 blocks from (0.0, 128, 0.0).\nThe ender dragon has a light purple &lt;a href=\"boss%20bar\"&gt;health bar&lt;/a&gt; that appears at the top of the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s screen. Its health is frequently restored by nearby end crystals, indicated by a magical white beam connecting the dragon and the crystal. Destroying an end crystal that is actively healing the dragon causes damage to it. \nThe dragon can take damage only from explosions and player-based damage, and takes damage of ( \u00d7 normal damage + 1) when hit on any part that is not its head, making it the most resilient mob in the game. Suffocation is completely non-applicable, as it either phases through or immediately destroys any block it touches.\nThe dragon is immune to all &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBy using the shortcut, the dragon's bounding box appears. It cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub-&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Hitboxes\"&gt;hitboxes&lt;/a&gt; are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: The tail, body, head, and wings.\nMovement.\nThe ender dragon is a flying mob, which cannot actually stand on the ground. It flies around the end main island while fighting the player.\nThe dragon can pass through all &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s, destroying almost all types, but can still be affected by flowing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;. Blocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;s:\n, these blocks are marked under the &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as .\nDestroyed blocks are not dropped, although containers (such as chests and dispensers, but not shulker boxes) drop their contents.\nAttacking.\nThe dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile. Any entities hit by its wings are dealt damage (or damage if hit by its head), and in Java Edition, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or even off the island. Neither of these effects is applied for second after the dragon takes damage.\nThe ender dragon has four main states of behavior:\n, when the dragon finally takes a fatal blow, it flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless it cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.\nDragon Fireball.\nDragon fireballs are special &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;s that the ender dragon fires while strafing. They cannot be deflected unlike &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;ghast fireballs&lt;/a&gt;, and they do no impact &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, they deposit purple &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Potion%23Area%20Effect%20Cloud\"&gt;effect clouds&lt;/a&gt; across the ground that damages players the same way a &lt;a href=\"lingering%20potion\"&gt;lingering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Harming\"&gt;potion of Harming&lt;/a&gt; does. This means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction that comes from the player's armor. However its damage does get reduced by armor enchanted with the &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. The purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.\nAs with its close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the &lt;a href=\"dragon%27s%20breath\"&gt;dragon's breath&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.\nSounds.\nEnder dragons use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nDragon fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nEnder dragons have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nDragon fireballs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nCommand details.\nThe command, by default, summons a harmless ender dragon that hovers in place . Setting the codice_1 tag (by issuing either the or the commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself . If spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see &lt;a href=\"%23Behavior\"&gt;#Behavior&lt;/a&gt;).\nTarget selectors for the ender dragon target a total of 9 entities per dragon, as the ender dragon actually consists of 9 entities internally. So executing at a dragon to summon an arrow summons 9 arrows."}

The drop is increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, with a maximum of 4 with Looting III.\nChest loot.\nA &lt;a href=\"trapped%20chest\"&gt;trapped chest&lt;/a&gt; always containing 2 ender pearls can be found in the \"fake end portal\" room of &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTrading.\n, expert-level &lt;a href=\"Trading%23Cleric\"&gt;cleric villagers&lt;/a&gt; have a chance to sell an ender pearl for 5 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\n, expert-level cleric villagers sell one ender pearl for 5 emeralds.\nBartering.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s have a (4.27) chance to &lt;a href=\"barter\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; 3-4 ender pearls when given a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nEnder pearls can be thrown by pressing . After it is thrown, the ender pearl is consumed, and the player teleports to where it lands, taking &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing armor enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Feather%20Falling\"&gt;Feather Falling&lt;/a&gt; reduces the damage taken from the ender pearl. \nEnder pearls have a small cone of travel; they do not all follow the same path when thrown in the same direction. The direction and velocity of ender pearl throws is slightly randomized. They can travel about 30 blocks when thrown straight up, and up to 54 blocks forward when thrown at an optimum launch angle of ~35\u00b0 (on even ground).\nThe thrower's vertical velocity influences the throw. Hence timing a throw with a jump can increase the throwing range to 42 blocks when thrown straight up and 64 blocks forward at a 35\u00b0 angle. Throwing while falling significantly decreases the range. Ender pearls collide with all &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; types, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s, and travel through &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;s. Ender pearls that fall into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; disappear, and do not trigger the player to teleport. However, ender pearl entities (instead of dropped items) are \"not\" destroyed by lava and will teleport the player to the bottom of lava pools/lava oceans.\nEnder pearls have a cooldown of one second before they can be used again. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay on the ender pearl that shrinks and must disappear before the player can use it again. If there are other inventory or hotbar slots containing ender pearls, they are covered with the white overlay as well. \nEnder pearls can be thrown into &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;s to reach the outer islands of the End. They can also be thrown into the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; to reach the player's spawn point.\nEnder pearl teleportation makes no sound \"itself\", but does emit a \"small fall\" sound at the destination when applying teleportation damage to the player.\nStasis chamber.\nEnder pearls are affected by &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.\nSpawning endermites.\nAn ender pearl has a 10% chance to spawn an &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt; when it lands. This is the only way through which endermites can spawn, without using cheats. The endermite spawns at \"the player's position\" when the pearl lands, or at the pearl's landing site.\nSounds.\nThrown ender pearls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity Data.\nThrown ender pearls have entity data that define various properties of the entity."}

Although \"Minecraft\", which came out seven years later, bears little graphical similarity to \"Wurm Online\", \"Minecraft\" does share many conceptual similarities, making \"Wurm Online\" one of \"Minecraft's\" many precursors and inspirations.\nHistory.\nDevelopment of \"Wurm Online\" started in 2002. In June 2003, Jansson registered the website \"wurmonline.com\", and in August 2003 Notch registered the website \"mojang.com\". The two had founded the small private company \"&lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Specifications\"&gt;Mojang Specifications&lt;/a&gt;\" before \"Wurm Online\", and now used it as a publisher for their game.\nJansson originally wanted to develop a multiplayer online computer game in a Western setting, in which the player characters could determine their own destiny and change the economy and politics of the game. Notch, on the other hand, envisioned a fantasy world with huge forests (as seen in his later project \"&lt;a href=\"RubyDung\"&gt;RubyDung&lt;/a&gt;\") that the player could change every detail of. As a compromise, they agreed on a fantasy world in which the player characters could influence the economy and politics, as well as create buildings and modify terrain.\nWhile Jansson focused on the economy and politics elements, Notch programmed the world rendering and other game mechanics. Many ideas and concepts that Notch realized in this game from 2002 to 2007 reappeared in his later games as well, most significantly \"Minecraft\". For example:\nThe founders Notch and Rolf Jansson quickly found and hired some volunteers to assist development, particularly with the game's graphics. \"Wurm Online\" continued development and was officially released for PC in 2006. In April 2007, Notch left the team to pursue other projects. Notch asked Jansson for permission to keep the name \"Mojang Specifications\". Jansson agreed, and changed the name of the \"Wurm Online\" company to \"Onetoofree AB\". With a changing group of helpers, Jansson continued to develop the game in his free time, until he founded the company \"Code Club AB\" in 2011 and hired the first permanent employee. The game continues to receive updates."}

It never retreats or flees, and attacks &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt; and almost all non-zoglin &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; indiscriminately, using the same tusk attack as its non-zombified counterpart.\nSpawning.\nZoglins spawn when a &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt; has been in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or the End for . For their first 10 seconds after zombification, they get the &lt;a href=\"Nausea\"&gt;nausea&lt;/a&gt; effect. This nausea effect is cosmetic and does not affect its behavior.\nBehavior.\nZoglins are hostile toward &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s, players in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; mode (except in Peaceful difficulty), and all mobs except &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, and other zoglins. They even attack zombified piglins and hoglins.\nWhen an adult zoglin attacks, it flings its target into the air. &lt;a href=\"Blocking\"&gt;Blocking&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"shields\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt; does not mitigate this. When a baby zoglin attacks, they do not fling their target. Baby zoglins, unlike baby &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, never grow up. Any mob that can retaliate attacks a zoglin in return after being attacked.\nIn Java Edition adult zoglins attack once every two seconds and babies attack every second. In Bedrock Edition, both adults and babies attack once every second, making them more destructive compared to Java Edition, even on peaceful difficulty.\nWhen a zoglin attacks a &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;, the piglin either retreats or fights back. &lt;a href=\"Piglin%20Brute\"&gt;Piglin brutes&lt;/a&gt; attack zoglins if they are attacked first and never retreat. They also attack the zoglin if the zoglin attacks a piglin or another piglin brute.\nIf a zoglin is fed &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;crimson fungus&lt;/a&gt; before it is zombified, it does not despawn naturally and it doesn't count toward the mob cap.\nZoglins are incapable of &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; and do not flee from &lt;a href=\"Tag%23blocks%20hoglin%20repellents\"&gt;blocks that repel hoglins&lt;/a&gt;. Zoglins can be leashed. Unlike baby &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, baby zoglins attack baby &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s flee from zoglins if they are not engaged in combat.\nIn water, they sink to the bottom and wander about as if on dry land. They do not drown.\nBeing an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mob, they are:\nLike s, they are immune to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nZoglins use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nZoglins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

All zombies spawned in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; biomes and exposed to the sky have a likelihood of 80%/70% to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s. Zombies that are not husks or &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; have a 5% chance to spawn as &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nZombie variants have a 5% chance to spawn as babies. The baby zombies also have a chance of spawning as a &lt;a href=\"chicken%20jockey\"&gt;chicken jockey&lt;/a&gt; .\nAll zombie variants (including babies) require a 2-block tall space to spawn.\nZombies spawn with up to 5% of knockback resistance.\nWhen a zombie &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; is used on a zombie, it spawns a baby zombie.\nSieges.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is near a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; at midnight, up to 20 zombies may be spawned in the village in accordance with mob spawning rules. The spawning can even happen in &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; biome if the triggering player is in an adjacent biome. Zombies spawned as a part of a siege are always regular zombies; &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; never spawn as a part of a siege.\nMonster spawners.\nZombies spawned from a &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; are never zombie villagers , although zombie monster spawners are able to produce them. Zombies spawn from &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s inside 50% of &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Room\"&gt;monster rooms&lt;/a&gt;.\nHusks.\nWhen a husk's head is submerged in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; for over 30 seconds, the husk starts transforming into a zombie, with a new entity &lt;a href=\"UUID\"&gt;UUID&lt;/a&gt;. The husk's equipment remains on the zombie after conversion. The zombie transforms into a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; if its head remains submerged.\nVariants.\nBaby zombies.\nBehavior.\nBaby zombies make up 5% of zombie spawns. They behave similarly to regular zombies, with the following differences:\n, 10% of naturally spawned baby zombies can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking. The jockey mobs ridden by the baby zombie adapt the speed of its rider. , a baby zombie can ride:\nZombie villagers.\nZombie villagers have a 5% chance of spawning in place of zombies and may also spawn from a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; killed by a zombie. The chance of a villager turning into a zombie villager when killed by a zombie or zombie variant depends on the &lt;a href=\"Difficulty\"&gt;difficulty level&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers\u200c, or a single zombie villager.\u200c\nIf any type of zombie kills a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.\nAny villagers that get killed by a zombie have a chance to turn into a zombie villager with armor on normal or hard difficulties.\nZombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s) by first giving them the &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; effect, which can be applied by:\nThe weakened zombie villager must then be healed by using a (non-enchanted) &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; on them.\nHusks.\nHusks have an 80% chance to spawn in desert &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in place of zombies. They attack like regular zombies, but inflict &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28effect%29\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; for several seconds and do not burn in sunlight.\nDrowned.\nDrowned mobs spawn in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s, most parts of &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s or when a &lt;a href=\"%23Becoming_drowned\"&gt;normal zombie drowns&lt;/a&gt;. They are able to swim and breathe underwater as well as walk on land. Most drowned use melee attacks, but some spawn with &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s and throw them when attacking instead.\nZombies that are wearing armor and go underwater continue wearing the armor when converted to a drowned, although tools and weapons are lost.\nZombies that convert to drowned drop all worn or held equipment with full durability and preserving existing enchantments.\nGeared zombies.\nOn , zombies may spawn wearing a &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;. They do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\nSome zombies spawn wearing &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; or holding tools, both of which may be &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;ed. In addition, zombies may also spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. The chances of each of these events occurring are listed below. Zombie villagers can also spawn naturally with armor, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s. If a zombie spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material). Zombies cannot naturally spawn with &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; armor.\nIf a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:\nJava Edition:\nBedrock Edition:\nThe chances of it being of a particular material are:\nArmor worn by zombies is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot \"wear out\" the way player armor does. Helmets (not blocks like pumpkins) on zombies can eventually wear away and break if the zombie is exposed to daylight or has an anvil or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombies also have a natural armor rating of , giving 1.6 to 8% damage reduction from &lt;a href=\"Armor%23Effects\"&gt;most sources&lt;/a&gt;. Zombies can also wear mob &lt;a href=\"heads\"&gt;heads&lt;/a&gt;, although they need to be dropped by the player before the zombie can pick one up and put it on.\nDrops.\nCommon drops.\nA zombie drops up to two after dying. The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 0 to 5 with Looting III. A zombie also drops a when killed by a &lt;a href=\"charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nRare drops.\nZombies may also drop one of the following when killed by a player or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;:\nThis drop has a 2.5% chance of occurring, increasing by 1% per level of looting. Individual items have the following chances of dropping:\nTaken equipment.\nAny picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.\nNaturally-spawned equipment.\nZombies have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment and drop it with a random durability. Each level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). These items include:\nExperience.\nAny zombie that spawns with equipment gives extra experience points per item when killed. Adult zombies drop and baby zombies drop when they are killed by a player or a tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nAttacking the player.\nZombies hunt the player on sight from 35 blocks away in \"Java Edition\" or 16 blocks away in \"Bedrock Edition\", raising their arms up. The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a zombie &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;. If a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player first. A zombie already hunting a villager continues to do so even if the player is near, until the player attacks it.\nZombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away. Zombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magma%20blocks\"&gt;magma blocks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; and try to find the shortest path toward the player. Unlike &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.\nAttacking turtles.\nZombies attack baby &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and actively seek out and destroy &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.\nAttacking utility mobs.\nZombies hunt and attack golem &lt;a href=\"utility%20mob\"&gt;utility mob&lt;/a&gt;s within 42 blocks. Iron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.\nAttacking villagers.\nZombies target and hunt &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s within a 35\u2013 to 52.5\u2013block radius (depending on &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;) or a 16-block radius and they can always see &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s through walls. If a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it. Once a zombie has targeted a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, the zombie ignores any other &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, until its target is dead or the zombie is attacked.\nAny zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager. The probability depends on the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;:\nAttacking wandering traders.\nZombies target and hunt &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls. The zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nBurning under daylight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; is 15 degrees or more above the ground, zombies burn once exposed to direct sunlight. Burning is suppressed when the zombie is:\nTransparent and translucent blocks, including &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, do not prevent them from burning..\nIf they attack an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; while burning, they may set it on fire, with a (30\u00d7&lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;)% chance and with a 2\u00d7floor (&lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;) second duration. If wearing armor enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; while burning, they may set players attacking them on fire with thorns damage alone.\nUndead.\nZombies are undead mobs, harmed by the status effect &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt;, healed by the status effect &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Instant Damage&lt;/a&gt; and are unaffected by &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; does not attack zombies. Zombies are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nPicking up items.\nSome zombies are capable of automatically picking up dropped items that they come across. &lt;a href=\"Mob%20head\"&gt;Mob head&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s are automatically worn on their heads. Zombies can equip &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s. If a zombie encounters another similar &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one, if:\nItems dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA zombie holding a picked-up &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; does not despawn when left alone, similar to being &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;ged.\nZombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nPicked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.\nBreaking doors.\nUp to 10% of zombies (depending on &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;) in pursuit of a target bang on closed &lt;a href=\"wooden%20door\"&gt;wooden door&lt;/a&gt;s and on Hard (and &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down. Otherwise, the door cracks but does not break.\nThe zombie also breaks down the door if the door is blocking its way. Zombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.\nReinforcements.\nOn all difficulty levels, damaged zombie mobs (including husks, drowned and even &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s) call all other zombies within a 67\u00d721\u00d767 to 111\u00d721\u00d7111 area centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker.\nIn Hard difficulty, zombies can spawn additional zombies to \"help\" when damaged. Each zombie has a \"likeliness to call reinforcements\" statistic ranging from 0\u201310%, and \"leader\" zombies (0\u20135% depending on &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;) get a bonus of 50\u201375 percentage points to the stat. When the zombie is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location (0 or \u00b17\u201340 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks, and has no colliding entities or blocks at which to spawn the reinforcement. Both the damaged zombie and the new zombie has a 5 percentage point penalty to their \"likeliness to call reinforcement\" stat, preventing infinite zombies from spawning this way. Zombie reinforcements can spawn even in locations where naturally spawned zombies can't spawn, like &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, although they still cannot spawn on blocks where other items like redstone dust or pressure plates are placed.\nThese effects can be negated by killing the zombie in as few hits as possible, by using environmental damage such as cactus or lava, or by avoiding them completely. That is, if the zombified &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; drops experience, it has a chance to spawn reinforcements. Additionally, reinforcements do not spawn at all, even on Hard difficulty, if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to codice_1.\nLeader zombies are a special type of zombie that spawn with an added 50-75% chance to spawn reinforcements. The chance of a leader zombie spawning increases with clamped regional difficulty, up to a 5% chance of spawning.\nReinforcements zombies spawn regardless of the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Java%20Edition%20mob%20cap\"&gt;hostile mob cap&lt;/a&gt;. They also spawn on the north-west corner of the designated block, instead of the center of the block like natural mob spawning does. Zombies spawned as reinforcements cannot be zombie villagers, but they can be babies, including chicken jockeys.\nBecoming drowned.\nIf a zombie's head is submerged in water for 30 seconds, it begins converting into a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;. The zombie shakes, similar to a zombie villager being cured and, after 15 seconds, the zombie becomes drowned. Once this process starts, it cannot be stopped even if the zombie leaves water. This time is not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; enchantment or the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; status effect. \nA newly-converted drowned always has full health even if converted from a damaged zombie.\nAn item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability.\nOnly normal zombies can become drowned; &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be converted. &lt;a href=\"Husk\"&gt;Husk&lt;/a&gt;s, however, convert into zombies if they drown, and then this zombie converts into a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; as does a normal zombie.\nAny husks that convert into zombies also have full health, even if the drowned husk is damaged.\nSounds.\nZombies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nZombies have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

Zombie horses appear to be the horse equivalent of &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. Like zombies, zombie horses are green-skinned and their eyes are completely black.\nSpawning.\nZombie horses may be created by the command or with their spawn egg. When using a spawn egg, 20% spawn as foals.\nDrops.\nUpon death, zombie horses drop:\nIf saddled, they drop their saddle.\nFoals yield neither items nor experience.\nUsage.\nTamed and &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;d zombie horses can be used as one of the fastest means of &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; in the game. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences.\n, they cannot be ridden.\nEquipment.\nZombie horses have a lone equipment slot.\n, they have no slot.\nRiding.\nOnce a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with directional controls, , and the mouse. The player dismounts using the control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; while on a horse.\nA ridden horse automatically runs up any one-block-high slope. The horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\nRidden saddled zombie horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\". When the player rides them, the experience bar on &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled zombie horses can be made to and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Zombie horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\nBehavior.\nThe zombie horse is an undead mob that is completely passive. Zombie horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Zombie horses can breathe in water.\nUnlike other passive mobs, zombie horses slowly regenerate health. , zombie horses will be killed by the &lt;a href=\"Conduit\"&gt;Conduit&lt;/a&gt; like any regular hostile mob, despite being passive.\nZombie horses, in common with other undead mobs, take damage when affected by a &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; of Healing and are healed by a Potion of Harming. They are also affected by the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nTaming.\nZombie horses cannot be tamed. However, a tamed zombie horse can be summoned using .\n, technically all zombie horses are always regarded as tamed.\nStatistics.\nZombie horses are spawned with constant health of 15, speed of 0.2, and have a jump strength ranging from 0.4\u20131.0, tending toward the average 0.7.\nSounds.\nZombie horses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nZombie horses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nIssues.\nZombie Horses are an unsupported mob and as such issues relating to them may not be fixed."}

The game's characters were adopted as the &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;default player skin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;another project&lt;/a&gt; Notch would work on a few months later.\nHistory.\nBefore Notch started to work on \"Minecraft\", he took part in various editions of the Java 4k Game Programming Contest from 2005 to 2009. This competition, initiated by Java programmers, was about writing the best possible computer game with a maximum size of 4 kibibytes (4096 bytes). Notch submitted the following games:\nDue to the nature of the contest, these games were extremely simple. In \"Left 4k Dead\", the character walks through a labyrinth of corridors and rooms that are sparsely illuminated by the player's flashlight. Zombies frequently attack and have to be shot, and there are red powerups that restore health and yellow powerups that restore ammo randomly distributed throughout the increasingly hard levels. Notch also made a sequel called \"Left 4k Dead 2\" with slightly different graphics, as a joke on the recently released \"Left 4 Dead 2\" having most of the same content as the original.\nThe zombie theme appeared to be prevalent throughout Notch's games, and he was planning an improved sequel to the \"Left 4k Dead\" series, which he called \"Zombie Town\". Notch wanted three-dimensional pawns, inspired by . For the first time in his life, he programmed a completely three-dimensional representation of figure textures from scratch.\nIn May of 2009, Notch started developing \"Minecraft\". Notch realized that the blocky design of the \"Zombie Town\" characters would fit well into \"Minecraft\", and that the low texture resolution meant that every player could have a totally unique skin. Three days into \"Minecraft\"'s development, he added \"Zombie Town\"'s characters into \"Minecraft\" as &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;. They were the first tests for the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; character, which was necessary for the later introduced &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nNotch mentioned the game on his blog, &lt;a href=\"The%20Word%20of%20Notch\"&gt;The Word of Notch&lt;/a&gt;, that same day. Several months later, in a blog entry titled \"The Origins of \"Minecraft\"\", he talked about it some more, revealing the name and also uploading a video of it to his YouTube channel &lt;a href=\"Nizzotch\"&gt;Nizzotch&lt;/a&gt;."}

If the zombie villager picks up any item however, it remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap. all zombified villagers are persistent.\nA zombie villager appears alongside a &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; villager in every &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basement (a normal zombie villager in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; and a cleric zombie villager in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\"). One of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron). They also generate as part of &lt;a href=\"abandoned%20village\"&gt;abandoned village&lt;/a&gt;s. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.\nVariants.\nBaby zombies.\nBaby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers. They behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences:\nBaby zombie villagers are spawned when a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; kills a baby &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers. Baby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers \u00d7 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.\nArmed zombie villagers.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and regular &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. These zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, as these are worn on their heads), and use any &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s picked up. If they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item:\n&lt;a href=\"Item\"&gt;Item&lt;/a&gt;s dropped by &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in exchange for another cannot be picked up by &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot \"wear out\" the way &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; armor does. &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;s (not &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of , which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from &lt;a href=\"Armor%23Effects\"&gt;most sources&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome zombie villagers that are capable of picking up &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;ed. The chances of that event are listed below. If a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material).\nIf a zombie does spawn with armor, the chances of specific armor are as follows:\nThe chances of it being of a particular material are:\nAny zombie villager that spawns with equipment (picked-up items don't count) &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; 1\u20133 extra &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; per &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nVillager variants.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", a zombie villager retains its biome and profession after conversion from a villager. They also retain their trades. Below is a table of the variant and what workstation it required before zombification. The zombie villager \"cannot\" work at a job site block. , zombie villagers do not display their professions, but they still have the same profession after curing as before zombification. They use the texture of an unemployed &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; from their corresponding biome.\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager/Professions\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; requires:\nDrops.\nWhen they &lt;a href=\"die\"&gt;die&lt;/a&gt;, zombie villagers drop 0\u20132 . The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\nThey can also drop an &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt; when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This drop has a 2.5% chance of occurring, increasing by 1% per level of looting. Individual items have the following chances of dropping:\nAny picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.\nExperience.\nAdult zombie villagers drop and an additional per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby zombie villagers drop experience.\nBehavior.\nZombie villagers behave as ordinary &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, except that they do not convert to &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; when submerged.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", zombie villagers that were converted from villagers retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance. Naturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that is not retained upon being cured; instead, they become unemployed and may gain a new profession if a job site block is nearby. Zombie villagers can also spawn with the unemployed or &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Nitwit\"&gt;Nitwit&lt;/a&gt; outfits. Zombified nitwits remain nitwits after being cured.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, all zombie villagers have the same appearance, which looks like an unemployed zombie villager. Naturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession that \"is\" retained upon being cured. However, the profession is not locked and the cured villager may gain a new profession if in a village with an available job site block. Zombie villagers can be unemployed, but they cannot be &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Nitwit\"&gt;nitwits&lt;/a&gt; (zombified nitwit villagers become unemployed zombie villagers). Baby zombie villagers are always unemployed. \nCuring.\nZombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal villagers) by first giving them the &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; effect, which can be applied by:\nThe weakened zombie villager must then be healed by a (non-enchanted) &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; on them. The zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress. Also, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; for the duration of the curing process. An internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.\nTime to cure is initially 2000 ticks (nominally, 100 seconds or 1m 40s) or a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3\u20145 minutes) . On each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants. It checks each block within a 9\u00d79\u00d79 cube centered on the villager for either an &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bar&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; (either half: they're detected separately). For each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick. Therefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.\nDuring the curing process the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; (with a potency that doesn't depend on the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; level). Thus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.\nAt the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; and gains the &lt;a href=\"Nausea\"&gt;Nausea&lt;/a&gt; effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior). If it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Curse of Binding&lt;/a&gt;, in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and will not be dropped if the villager is killed). If it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure. If it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades. Otherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.\nA newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure. These discounts are permanent. If a villager is cured more than once, the discounts get deeper until the price reaches the minimum of one emerald. Villagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.\nZombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is changed to Peaceful.\nSounds.\nZombie villagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nZombie villagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Note that the majority of these are just for decoration, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; blocks (bookshelves enhance enchanting tables in the vicinity). This tutorial is merely decorative and will enhance the look of your house. You can make it more functional. For example, a fridge could hold food in a way so the block holding the food is accessible. Or, a fireplace can be used as an item incinerator. Try coming up with ways to incorporate uses into furniture.\nBedroom furniture.\nThe most essential piece to a bedroom is the bed. Once you've placed a bed, you can start decorating your bedroom with furniture. Dressers, desks, and bookshelves are the basic furniture you can put in your bedroom.\nTo make a barricaded door or window, use signs and put them against doors or windows as pieces of wood then type dashes on.\nDressers.\nA dresser is a stack of double chests. An idea for a more interesting home is to have themed chests with only certain things (e.x. Only store armor in the dresser). You can place &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s next to the dressers to show the items inside. Craftable clothing isn't available in Vanilla Minecraft, so most players put armor in their dressers. If this is the case, place a few &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s down to show off your newly crafted armor. \nIf you don't want to waste wood on chests/need dressers for a real purpose, but still want them for decoration, you can make a dresser that looks like real life, but is not functional in Minecraft, and does not cost much wood, as it is made of &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt;. Place two wood planks next to each other on the floor, and place two above that. Then, put &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s with the letter O on all 4 blocks.\nClosets.\nHere is a design for a cool and interactive closet that is simple to make. \nYou will need: \nPlace the blocks like this (the grid is from the side view):\nThen, place the doors over it so they look like the double doors, with the handles closest to each other. You could also add trapdoors either side of the stairs.\nCabinets.\nHere is how to make a simple cabinet.\nPlace the block against a wall. Then, place one trapdoor on top of the block and one on the front side. If desired, place multiple blocks with trapdoors next to each other, for a bigger cabinet.\nBunk Bed.\nFor the bunk bed, you need a wall that has at least a width of 4 and a height of 4. \nGet &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s and place them each on the outer rim of the wall, and then place wood planks in the wall spaces on the bottom only. Place a bed on top of the two blocks. Next, get rid of the blocks under the bed and then place a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; where those blocks were. However, note that the top bed will not change your spawn point unless there is a solid block with two empty blocks above it one block below the bed and directly adjacent and you will wake up on top of the bed, so there needs to be more than one block of space above the bed.\nYou can also make a bunk bed with two &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s and two beds. Put two blocks of any type in a row, and then place a bed on top. Break the two blocks. Then, place a bed under the top bed. Finally, put the two doors on the side.\nThis final design for a bunk bed requires a wall that is 3x3, and you will need 6 fences and 2 beds. First, place two stacks of fences, 3 blocks high each, with 2 blocks in between them. Then, place the first bed on the floor, the second on the 3rd fence, and you're finished!\nBookshelves.\nTo make a &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt;, stack as many bookshelf blocks as you desire. You can also use slabs and stairs stacked on top of each other to simulate normal shelves. The back of looms can be used to look like empty shelves amongst the books. This design is simple, but pretty!\nIf you want it to be really simple:\nShelves.\nTo make a shelf, place a row of 4 wood planks on the ground, and add a stack of 3 wood planks at each end. Close off the space at the top with 2 more planks. Finally, add &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s in the middle of all of the wood planks to simulate shelves.\nYou can make a modern shelf by placing carpet on top of one another.\nPotted plant.\nNote: As of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, there are now &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;s made out of three bricks crafted the same way as a &lt;a href=\"Bucket\"&gt;Bucket&lt;/a&gt;, making this method not quite as useful. However, this method still remains useful for 2-block high plants, as they can't be placed into flower pots.\nIf you don't want to use a flower pot, either for the reason that you want to have a 2-block high plant in your pot or just a different type of flower pot, read on.\nPlace a grass block. You may also get a long grass, a rose, a yellow flower, or any of the other new 1-block-high plants. \nNext, dig out the blocks around it on the floor.\nAbove each hole, place a trapdoor. Then make them all in the closed position, with its flat side against the side of the dirt block. After that, fill in the holes. Then put dirt or a stone block, tall grass piece, or fern on top of the dirt block and you're done!\nAnother way to make potted plants is to put signs around a block of dirt as the pot and then put a plant on top of it.\nYou can also do this:\nDesks.\nTo make a desk, take your choice of support, (Fence or fence gate look the best) and place 2 of them for a freestanding desk, 1 for a desk attached to the wall. Then make a surface (wooden slabs work well). Pressure plates or carpets can be also placed on fences, creating a much flatter surface. Additionally, if three fence blocks are placed in a row, two could be covered in pressure plates, and one with glowstone or a redstone lamp on top, making a \"lamp\".\nAnother neat way of making easy and simple desks is to have a set of pistons lined up in patterns in rectangular shapes or lines. Simply place redstone blocks in the shape of your desk one block beneath your floor. Then place pistons atop the blocks for a permanent desk/table. Another way to make a desk is after the pistons are placed, put a single redstone torch under each one of them, causing the pistons to activate, and thus making a quick and simple table. An adaptation of this is to put a piston in the ground facing up and put pressure plates around it. When you walk up to it, the table/desk pops up.\nA different way of making desks is to make a huge table out of blocks. There should be four \"leg\" blocks, acting as the \"legs\" of your table. On top of the \"legs\" you can put slabs or blocks, making a simple table. This form of table is one of the easiest to make.\nThe last type of table is the \"Block-by-block\" table. It consists of a simple arrangement of multiple blocks. By putting many blocks in a rectangular, square, or straight pattern, you can make a simple table useful for keeping things on. This form of table is mostly built with white, plain wool, because it causes the table to look like the table is covered with a clean, white tablecloth.\nAnother way to make a good looking desk is to place two upside down stairs on the ends with slabs between them, the stairs act as the legs. And if you want to have a top table cloth but still a wood table then put white carpet on top of the wood blocks.\nComputers.\nPlace an &lt;a href=\"iron%20block\"&gt;iron block&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; on the side, and a \"keyboard\" in front of it. Some people use a powered &lt;a href=\"Rail\"&gt;minecart rail&lt;/a&gt;, mostly because it looks like there's buttons on it in the original resource pack. Best use with a desk. Some people put an item frame with an apple on the back to brand it as an Apple iMac! You can use 3\u00d72\u00d71 logs and put the \"computer\" in the middle. Alternatively, there are several mods that can provide you with computers. A good example is ComputerCraft or the Mr. Crayfish's furniture mod. \nAnother way is to place a painting on the wall in front of a block of wood and place a &lt;a href=\"Rail\"&gt;minecart rail&lt;/a&gt; or another object that looks like a computer keyboard and you can use that as a computer. When you want to 'change the display' just put a new picture in place. A really good way of making a keyboard is digging a one block deep hole, and then putting a carpet on it. Then, put two armor stands facing forward on the left and right side of the hole. Using pistons, push the armor stands into the hole. Now push a quartz block downward repeatedly (again, using a piston) until it reaches ground level. There you have it, a keyboard.\nAnother way to make a computer is by placing a wooden or stone &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. From the outside (or rear of the 'desk'), place a sign on the edge of the pressure plate (check for the black outline showing the plate as selected). This sign can be decorated with common logos, like real monitors. Now, move to the front of the 'desk' (or back of the sign, which is now floating) and place a picture. An optional button can be placed on the left or right as a mouse. Two of these screens can be setup (the pressure plate is required to hold the sign) for dual monitor configurations.\nAlternatively, you can use the item frame method to set up a computer. Place an oak wood block next to the wall. Above it on the wall put an item frame. On the wood block, put a stone pressure plate and there you have it! You can put a map or an item (heads are good ones) inside to make it look like you are running a program. You can also expand by putting another block of wood on one side of the first one and placing a empty flower pot on one and a button of any type on the other. You now have a laptop with some coffee and a mouse!\nTo make a disk drive, place a jukebox close to a wall and place a stone or wooden pressure plate on the jukebox. Add a picture on the wall and then place any block beside the jukebox and place a lever on it. Now you have a computer that can play music!\nGriefer's trick: Add a TNT trap with a dropper and a wooden pressure plate hidden and a trapdoor to open the computer system and add a book to the dropper. You can use them as 'viruses' to wreck their computer. Add a button next to the dropper to turn it 'on'. Add a command block next to the pressure plate \u201chidden\u201d and set the command to: codice_1. When a player has turned 'on' their computer, the ERROR! alert will make the player think there is a virus and then the computer will explode! \nOne way is to put a block of any kind with a painting on. Underneath put a pressure plate as a keyboard and use stairs as a desk chair. There are many other ways that you can make them please comment below to help other players! :)\nLamps or light sources.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest way to create a toggle-able light source. Alternatively, you can use one of the following methods:\nTo make a lamp, place a fence block and put a torch (or some glowstone) on top. it can also work with a cobblestone wall or end rod.\nOne method to create a side table-looking light is placing a &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt; or other full-block light source on your floor, and put a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; on each side. Or you could put lights behind paintings as well.\nAnother method is making an invisible lamp, by placing your preferred &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; source in your floor and cover it with a &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn't block the light.\nOr, to make a different kind of lamp, build up three blocks from your original ceiling, place &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; where the original ceiling was and leave one block open for an escape hatch and start placing &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. This would be best used in creative mode in a &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; structure (creative mode because depending on how big your house is it might take a lot of lava to cover the ceiling!)\nMood lighting can be made by placing a glowstone block and shield it on all sides but one. Next, place a &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; in the remaining spot. The result is a small patch of slightly whiter light. This will not create a radius of light however, so it's solely for the effect.\nA modern/futuristic style light can be made by placing down any block and then a stone slab (or any half-step) on top. Then remove the bottom block and put another half step in its place. Put a glowstone block on top of all of it. It should look like the glowstone hovers above the stone slabs.\nAnother modern way is to have a wall with stairs on all of the bottom row of blocks but the corners, and place glowstone in the corners. Then place one more stair piece next to the glowstone to make an 8\u00d78 pixel square of glowstone. Lastly, place a half slab of the same type of the stair (wood plank, cobblestone, stone brick, sandstone) on the glowstone. There you have a modern 'glowing' couch piece. I recommend either stone brick (modern) or sandstone (blends in with glowstone).\nUsing lava as lighting can create a cool effect. Place a non-flammable block on the ground. Place a block next to that, and place glass on there, before removing the second block you placed. Do this on all sides, before placing any amount of layers of glass on top of the glass. Pour lava down the resulting tube, and place a non-flammable block on the top. Another way (This is best for dungeons) is to place lava and put iron bars in front of the lava (This may not work in 1.13 because of updated water physics).\nNote: This is dangerous if anything within four blocks of your lava lamp is flammable. Not recommended for houses with lots of wood/wool.\nCurtains.\nCurtains can be useful for the sides of bathtubs, or just as decoration anywhere. Attach a row of blocks under your ceiling, and then attach vines to the sides. The vines will grow hanging down, and create curtains for you. \nAnother alternative is to use wool. Just make a small wall of wool in front of your window or open space, and privacy is perfect!\nAlso, as of version 1.8, you can use &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s as curtains. First, make a banner. The color and design are up to you, but a plain white banner is good with many homes. Next, you must put up the banner. For one block high windows, place the banner on the block above it. If the window is two blocks high, place the banner on the higher glass block of the two. For three or more, place banners on every row except the bottom one. This design makes a nice hanging curtain that lets light in and can easily be removed.\nLadders and or trapdoors could also be used as open window shutters.\nOther furniture.\nIt's a good idea to add a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; to your bedroom, and possibly a &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt;. Crafting tables and jukeboxes already exist in the game, so there is no need to build them differently. You can also make mini-tree from a leaf block on a fence block.\nClosets.\nTo make a closet, first, dig two blocks tall and one block wide into a wall. If you want to make it wider, dig in deeper and start to dig spreading out. Then, go outside of the little \"room\" you've made and put a door at the entrance. You can make a four by four entrance but you will have to put double doors.\nSince you cannot really \"place\" armor in the game (except in 1.8, if you use an armor stand), you must use a chest and put the chest into the closet, or if you still want to be able to see the armor put up a row of item frames with the armor inside.\nLiving room furniture.\nThe living room is your house's heart, where you can gather with friends (if you're on a server) and spend your time, if you want to.\nTables.\nTables are an essential furniture item in every living room. Read on to find out how to make many different table designs!\nCoffee table.\nTo create a coffee table, use any type of slab and place them near your sofas, chairs, etc. To make a mug, try a flower pot with nothing in it. As part of the new 1.13 update, sea pickles will work as mugs too. You can also place multiple sea pickles on one block.\nCorner table.\nBuild a fence and add a wooden pressure plate, carpet/rug or trapdoor on top for a good looking table. Another option is to place a piston in the ground with a redstone torch or block below it. The piston will activate, and will create a nice, one block table.\nModern table.\nPlace two &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; blocks where you want the center of your table to be, then surround the glowstone blocks with glass panes for a cake and coffee table that will light up your living room! You can also make some more rings of glowstone around the middle glowstone block. \nYou can also make a modern table with some carpet, stairs and fences by placing the carpet on top of a fence and then putting the stairs of your choice down in the places you would like it for the seats.\nPiston table.\nExtended pistons are usually more aesthetically pleasing than fences with pressure plates, as they form a solid top, rather than one with gaps. You need 6 pistons and 6 redstone torches. Dig the floor 3\u00d72\u00d72 and then fill just one layer of the hole with redstone torches. \nSide view\nOverhead view\nThen just cover the hole with pistons (or you could place a sticky piston at random to make it look as though someone spilled) facing upward. The piston table is completed.\nSimple table.\nPlace 2 blocks above where you want your table, now create a 2 block deep hole below the blocks above your table (3 if you include the gap for the table which should already be there), get into the hole, look up and place 2 stairs facing each other on the bottom of them, get out the hole and fill it in, now remove the 2 blocks above the table, you now have a nice simple table.\nNote: Remember to fill the hole.\nTablecloths.\nUsing carpet blocks, you can replace the pressure plates on tables with carpet, or perhaps top your piston arms with the aforementioned block. This will create a nice-looking tablecloth. Use it anywhere, from fancy restaurants to cave homes!\nStone age table.\nThis table is simple, yet looks glorious on medieval structures or mansions. Start by putting a cobblestone slab at the top, and surround it with upside-down cobblestone stairs- don't forget to destroy the corners after. in the middle, put a flower pot and plant it with your favorite flower (&lt;a href=\"Allium\"&gt;Allium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Azure%20bluet\"&gt;Azure bluet&lt;/a&gt; recommended). Make chairs and put iron pressure plates on top of cobblestone stairs. Enjoy!\nTV.\nThere are two main designs for televisions in Minecraft. You can make a decorative TV that is really just coal blocks, black wool, or obsidian decoratively in or on the wall or floor. You could also just use a 2\u00d71 painting starting from left to right to imitate a flat-screen TV. You can also put two blocks of any material, two fences up top and a 2\u00d71 painting on the fence.\nAnother possible design is using a 4x2x1 space. The TV is made by placing 4 blocks of &lt;a href=\"Concrete\"&gt;Black Concrete&lt;/a&gt;, Coal Blocks, Obsidian, or another black block in a 2 blocks high, 2 blocks tall shape and putting 2 note blocks or jukeboxes on either side of it.\nA more expensive method is by putting a redstone lamp in the wall with a lever next to it, and a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; over the lamp. When the lever is pulled, light will shine through the painting.\nAnother design is to place two furnaces at the bottom, two obsidian on top, and a 2\u00d71 painting in front where you want the screen, then place two iron blocks vertically across the sides and place a button on each one.\nSofa and chairs.\nA sofa can be made using 2-4 stair blocks, with a sign attached to either side as \"arms\". Also, as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, one could use stairs facing inward to create \"arms\". An alternate type of sofa can be made by placing 2 or more slabs in a row and surround the sides and back with blank signs. To make a 'leather' sofa, use slabs surrounded by wool blocks.\nAnother way to make a nice couch is to place four wood planks in a row, with wood slabs on top. Then, put two wood planks on the ends and two rails in the middle. Place minecarts on the rails, and there! You have a couch you can actually sit on!\nChairs can be made similarly to sofas, but the 'sitting' area is only 1 block wide. There are many variations of the chair listed below.\nYou could just place 1 stair block for a simple chair.\nYou could also put 1 stair block down, and put blank signs on the side for an armchair.\nYou could also put down 1 slab, with blank signs on the sides and the back for a cool-looking armchair.\nIf you have a dog (tamed wolf), you may also want a dog bed in your house for it to sit on. You can make one using 2 wood slabs in a row, with signs attached on the sides, front and back. Also, since the 1.6.1 update, place 2 carpet color of choice on the ground.\nA throne can be made by placing a minecart track on the ground with a block (stone, cobblestone, or iron blocks are best) on one end and a staircase on the other end. placing another block on top of the first and one on either side of it. Then, four stairs are placed to the sides of the minecart track and the original staircase. Then, place two stairs on the two side blocks. Put a minecart on the track and enjoy the throne you can sit on.\nA step up into the modern world of interior design is the \"lounge bench\". Make an extra-long \"sofa\" with a 90-degree angle in it somewhere, no sign \"arms\", and possibly using slabs and blocks, instead of stair pieces. If in a corner, a bookshelf looks appealing in the corner, and blends in with the wood's texture. You can also place any type of stairs (oak wood stairs are recommended) and place blocks on the sides.\nAnother model looks like a sofa from a TV show. You are required to have 3 height, 2 length and 6 width. You can use spruce wood or brown wool to make it look like that TV show sofa, but you have to have 26 blocks of that material. Any material is okay, but otherwise, it will not look like the prototype. First, lay 12 blocks of your material in a 2\u00d76 rectangle. Then add your material to \u00bd of your sofa (width). Then, on the ends of where there is 1 layer of material, add 1 block to each end. Now just add 6 blocks on top of the 2 block height area (other than the ends and add 1 block on each. Never set near fires, as the sofa will burn up.\nYou can also make a working chair, using a minecart, rail, stair, 2 signs, any full block, a piston, and a lever. First place a piston 2 blocks above where you want your chair to be (facing down) and place a lever on the side of it, next place a full block with a rail on it where you want your chair to be, then place a minecart on the rail and break the block below the rail, after that place a stair where the rail was, finally activate the lever, it should push the stair block into the minecart, now break the piston and lever and place signs on the sides of the chair. To make a cool desk chair you could use a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Nether%20Brick%20Slab\"&gt;Red Nether Brick Slab&lt;/a&gt; instead of a stair, spruce or dark oak trapdoors instead of signs and 2 more trapdoors behind the chair as the back, and a red banner on the top back trapdoor hanging into the seat (you could also make a working a couch using this method). IMPORTANT: if you touch the chair while moving, it could mess up the minecart. there are 2 ways to fix this, the first is taking apart the chair and repeating these steps, the second can also also prevent this but requires cheats, for the second one you can either enter the command: , or place a repeating command block under the chair set to 600 ticks in delay and always active with the same command as before. Ex. if your chair is at coordinates 176 85 293 and facing north then the command is: (Note: the last number could be 294 or 292). \nFireplace.\nFireplaces give your living room a more \"homey\" feel. A fireplace can literally be a little hole in the wall with netherrack in it. Or it can be a sleek, ultra-modern piece of contemporary Minecraft art. \nFor the actual fire, the simplest option is to simply use a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;. This has the right appearance and has the useful function of cooking food without fuel, while also not igniting nearby blocks. Campfires can still damage mobs that touch them, so make sure that nothing can get to them. The alternatives are burning netherrack, lava or even an operating furnace.\nA nice design is a brick outline in the wall and floor (slabs can make the area around it on the floor elevated). Then make a 1\u00d72\u00d71 hole in the wall inside the brick outline and put in a campfire/netherrack. Light the netherrack (if going with this option), and add a chimney for all the smoke to go out through (and it's also an outside decoration!) A more contemporary and \"sleek\" design is to make the same brick outline but with lava inside, and put glass in front of the lava, making for an ultra-modern, \"artificial fireplace\" feel. Iron bars can be added around the fire to look like a fire guard for a more realistic look.\nFor an alternate fireplace design, pick a spot away from any flammable material. Next, dig a 1 block deep hole (2 blocks if using netherrack) and put the fire in it. Next, you should place a glass block on top of the fire so you won't burn yourself (you will have to put a block adjacent to the hole to place the glass block then later remove it). Put chairs and/or couches surrounding this and you have yourself a fire pit and lounge.\nTo build an old-style brick built fireplace, you will want this next to a wall. First, dig a 3 block deep hole. After that, add netherrack at the bottom and light it up. Third, place netherrack on the top of the hole. Next, place a brick on both sides of the fire and put another brick on top of those and in the middle of the ones in the top. Repeat in front of the bricks so you cannot throw things in the fire. This part is optional. If you want to add a chimney, add bricks on the top to the sides and the front of the fire. Keep adding until you reach your roof and then break the area where the fire is. Add 2 - 3 more levels of the chimney on the roof. Finally, add netherrack on your roof level and light it up!\nAlternatively, you can build a traditional style fireplace, which is similar to the old-style fireplace but more elaborate. Simply make a 5\u00d72 floorspace from cobblestone, and replace the center-back block with netherrack (or put a campfire on top of this block). Next, place a 3-high column of stone bricks on each side of the netherrack/campfire, and place stone brick stairs on each side (place them so that the steps go toward the center). Add a stone brick between the two stairs, and attach an additional stone brick below. Build up a column of stone bricks upward from the center brick, until it exits the house, placing a torch on top to imitate a chimney stoke. Finally, ignite the netherrack and add nether-brick fences around the opening. You could also add stone stairs to the underside of the opening. See the image for reference.\nIMPORTANT: If you're not using a campfire, wood blocks and stairs will ignite if they are less than 4 blocks above the fire or any adjacent blocks. You can turn off fire spreading with the command: , but if fire is ignited (by player, lighting etc.) on a flammable object, it will burn forever unless you stop it. However, the rest of your house will be fine.\nMake a huge fireplace 3\u00d73 with a campfire/netherrack, and then add a fence at the side (it'll need to be a nether brick fence if you're using netherrack) and progress it to the center. It should be 3 blocks from the ground. Now, descend it to almost the fire level (2 blocks away) and add a cauldron to the nether brick fence. Add water in and it's done! Fun if making witch houses.\nAutomatic fireplaces activate at the push of a button or the pull of a lever. There is a glitch that lets fire charges go through a 1-meter wide wall when shot out of a dispenser. Make a wall out of non-flammable material. Leave a 3 space gap. Then make another wall. In the gap, put a single block located right beside where you want the dispenser. Place a dispenser so it is facing the inside wall and there is no space between the dispenser and the wall. Place redstone on the block that leads to the dispenser [you have to use a repeater]. Start building the inside. You need to surround a piece of netherrack with iron bars. Make sure the floor is not made out of any wooden materials, wool or carpets as they will burn. You may decorate this any other way but place a button where the redstone signal would receive the input. Then, place multiple fire charges in the dispenser [they don't have any other important use]. You will have to kill blazes and creepers/ghasts and mine coal or kill wither skeletons to make them so they are hard to make but are worth the trouble.\nFor a more effective fireplace, place a sticky piston that is activated by a NOT gate. Replace the button with the lever. You may need to use repeaters to delay the dispenser. When you switch the fireplace off, a piston pops out and burns out the fire. You may want to make a fake chimney to hide the piston.\nFor a unique look to your fireplace, use a dispenser to dispense burning arrows to make the fire look better. You will need some redstone skills to make this.\nThis shoots flaming arrows to give a multilayered experience.\nShelves.\nBuilding a shelf is simple. all you need to do is place a trap door where you want your shelf to go, and you're finished!\nYou could also place slabs on a wall. That way you can put things on them, such as a cake.\nPlacing stairs upside down allows functional stair shelves.\nBlocks are split into two halves (thus two slabs of the same material make 1 block) so point your cursor at the TOP HALF of the block you want your shelf against and place your stair; if you aim lower it will be right-side-up and you have to replace it. If you aimed for the top half of the placement block it will become upside-down and you can make non-floating cake holders. This way you can skip the trouble of placing a block and your stair and removing the reference block. Place them outside under a window for a windowsill, or maybe even use several with crafting tables mixed in for a cat tree.\nCeiling fan.\nPlace any block on the ceiling, then put 4 trapdoors on each side of the block to give it the look of a ceiling fan.\nPiano.\nNeed some &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; in your house? Here's how to make a piano that plays music or just notes.\nAll you need is:\nNow to the building:\nConcert piano.\nor\nor\nThe Grand Piano (By Sky_Ninja99)\nNorth\nNotes for the below diagram:\nNorth\nCool fences.\nTo make a \"cool\" fence, place a stair where you want your fence to go, then place a slab block on top of each stair. &lt;a href=\"Glass%20pane\"&gt;Glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20bar\"&gt;iron bar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone%20wall\"&gt;cobblestone wall&lt;/a&gt;s with slabs on top will also work.\nKitchen.\nA kitchen may consist of a small chest with food products, such as meats, &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, or raw ingredients. You may wish to add a crafting table as well as a few furnaces, to simulate a working area and an oven. Counters are made by placing the stone, stone brick, or wood plank blocks in any manner a real-world kitchen would be placed in. Also, the kitchen should be placed on cobblestone or stone brick floors, rather than wood plank floors. For a more fancy floor, use polished andesite and polished granite, or black and white wool.\nYou may also make a fridge by placing a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; on the floor, an iron block on top, and an iron door in front. Then just place a button next to the dispenser, and when you press it, the iron door will open, and the dispenser will dispense your food! If you have a slanted roof put a 2\u00d71 hole in the ceiling near the wall and over the counter and put two stair blocks there and make it look like there are just two solid blocks there. Then, put a large chest underneath it and you got yourself a cabinet!\nSink.\nA sink allows you to have a water supply right in your kitchen. Many sinks use a 2\u00d72 square. You could also create a 1\u00d71 block sink just for show, or a flowing sink. You can use a cauldron filled with water (or alternatively a hopper) and then, a lever (or tripwire hook) above it representing the tap. Putting iron blocks below or surrounding your sink would look cool, or gold or diamond blocks if you have the resources.\nMaterials Needed:\n1. Place the cauldron or hopper against the wall.\n2. Place the lever or tripwire hook above the cauldron.\n(Optional) Last, fill the cauldron with water from your bucket.\nCleaning sink\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, Minecraft added the ability where one could use the water-filled cauldron to remove any kind of dye from any kind of dyed leather armor. Right after &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, in which &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s were added, &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s got another use of removing the last pattern on a banner. Thus, this design is now useful.\nFridge.\nYou can make a refrigerator for a nice finish, and to make your kitchen more distinguished. Many fridge designs allow you to store food inside them, making them functional as well as decorative.\nDesign 1\nMaterials: \nThis fridge will look fancy and you will have the ability to store items. Firstly dig a block where you want to put your fridge, then put in there a chest, leave the above block blank. Put above the blank space an Iron/Quartz/Snow Block, then put an iron door and a lever above or next to it.\nDesign 2\nMaterials:\nThis fridge will give you food when you need some.\nPlace a dispenser on the ground with an iron block on it (you could also place the dispenser on top of the iron block).\nPlace an iron door in front of those and place a button on the iron block. When you press the button, the door will open and the dispenser will drop the food you stored. You can also use a dropper instead of a dispenser.\nDesign 3\nMaterials:\nThis fridge needs to be built on a wall. To build it, dig one block into the wall. Place a dispenser in the wall, and from inside fill it with food. Place two iron blocks in a stack in front of it. Place a button on either side of the bottom block.\nWhen you press the button, instant food! Perfect if you need some food in a hurry.\nDesign 4\nMaterials:\nPlace a dispenser and on top, put an iron block. Then, place an iron door in front of it, and put a button or lever on the iron block. Then just fill the dispenser.\nDesign 5\nMaterials:\nTo set up this fridge, make 2 wide and 3 tall rectangles out of the iron. Make sure it is against a wall and in a corner. On the side facing into the corner, cut out the walls and place the sticky pistons, setting up Redstone torches appropriately as inverters to the pistons. Then, attach the lever to the 2nd block up on the non-piston-attached side. Wire this lever into the piston inverters, and voila, a working fridge. inside the fridge, place an iron block in the middle, a stone slab as the roof, and put a chest in the top space. At the bottom, put a block of ice in as a sort of \"freezer.\"\nDesign 6\nMaterials:\nThis is a good fridge that can make a tower, three blocks high, of any solid block. Now add another solid block in front of the three high stacks. Add a rail to it. Put a storage minecart on top of the rail. Destroy the block with the rail on it so that the minecart fawn.\nAdd a piston on the top of the 'tower', facing down. Now, put the block underneath the piston that you want your fridge to be made out of (I.E- if you want an iron fridge, the block underneath the piston would be iron). Now put a Redstone torch/block on top of the tower. This will force the piston down. Destroy the piston, the tower, and the Redstone torch/block. You should be left with a block with a shading error. Add blocks around it so that you can't see the black\u2026 stuff. You now have a fridge!\nDesign 7\nby -metalmanII- \nMaterials:\nInstructions: place 2 dispensers one on top of the other, then fill with food.\nJump on top and place an iron door so it is touching the dispensers.\nOn either side place your 2 blocks, one on top of the other.\nAdd buttons to these blocks.\nResult: a nice compact fridge! When you press one of the buttons, the door opens and one of the dispensers launches food out, then the door closes.\nDesign 8\nMaterials:\nOnce you pick a spot along a wall where the fridge is going to go, dig a two-block deep hole and place one iron block at the bottom of it. Next, put the chest inside that hole, then destroy the three blocks behind, left, and right of the chest. replace those blocks with iron blocks. Next, place an iron block two spaces up (if you place a solid block directly on top of the chest it won't open, therefore, make one space between the chest and the iron block). Optional: At this point, you can place an upside-down quartz stair on the iron block. Since the quartz stair is not a solid block, the chest can still be accessed. However, the quartz stair will not match the iron blocks, so they may need to be replaced by quartz blocks, but they will still not match the iron door. If you do not plan to use the quartz stair, place an iron block on top of the iron block behind the chest. \nNext, jump on top of the iron block (which should only be two spaces above ground) and place the iron door in front of the iron block, making the door and the block touch. Jump down and place the pressure plate in front of the door, or place the lever on the side of the iron block. You will notice that on each side of the fridge there are holes, just places things next to it (i.e. walls, wood planks, crafting tables, etc.). Now you are done, you can put perishable foods in the chest like milk or eggs. \nDesign 9\nMaterials:\nPlace the iron into a 1\u00d72 rectangle, then put the button on the top block. There you have it. A simple and pretty decorative fridge. It looks chunky, but it's still pretty cool.\nDesign 10\nMaterials:\nDepending on where you want your fridge, place the first iron door on the inner side of a block to the left or right of where you want your fridge. Then place the other iron door on the other side, leaving one blank block in between. Third, place your chest, and the last door in front of the chest. On top, place the stone slab. Finally place the button so you can open one of the 3 doors, whichever works for your room layout. \nTo make a corner fridge with this method, you will only need 2 iron doors, with the layout like so:\n * S *\n * C D\n BD *\nDesign 11\nMaterials:\nFind a place in your wall where you would like to put your fridge (NOTE: this must be at least 2 blocks away from anything you don't want to dig into). \nDig into your wall 3 at eye level and 2 deep on the bottom.\nDig behind your wall 2 wide.\nAfter following these instructions, your wall should look like this from overhead:\nNext, you will start placing your blocks.\nPlace two-high iron blocks in all of your empty spaces minus the two in the middle.\nIt should look like this now.\nNow, place a block in the middle of all of your iron blocks (note that the one in the middle is lower than the others).\n \nFinally, put a daylight sensor on top of that block, a door in front, and a lever on the wall next to that.\nTip: The daylight sensor can be clicked once to make it look like a freezer pack. Or, if you want to leave your fridge door open and click it again, it will look like you're letting the cold air out and you need to refreeze your freezer packs. \n Design 12 \nMaterials:\nFirst, place the iron block on the wall 2 blocks above the floor.\nPlace the rail under the iron block, then put the minecart on the rail back into the fridge. \nLook down, place the door, then place the lever next to it.\nNow, you have a nice looking fridge!\nSo functional due to minecarts with chests not needing a free space above it to open it. \nNote: this looks best with counters on the sides.\nDesign 13\nMaterials\nWherever you want a fridge, dig a 2-block-across hole (1 block down). On the far end of the hole, put a dispenser/dropper facing you. On the inside of the hole, put a hopper that goes into the dispenser/dropper. Next, put 2 blocks of iron on top of the dispenser/dropper and put a button on the lower iron block. The finished fridge should look like this:\nTo get some food from the fridge, press the button and the dispenser/dropper will drop food at your feet.\nTo put food in your fridge, put the food in the hopper using whatever method.\nDesign 14, made by Logan5123\nFirst, place your two dispensers on top of each other. Fill the dispensers with food, Then, to the exact left/right block depending on where you are placing it, put the Redstone. Then, in front of the Redstone, stack the blocks and put a button on the bottom block. Place the iron door in front of the dispensers. If you click the button, food comes out and the door closes.\n\u2019\u2019\u2019 Design 15, made by Mimiengland\u2019\u2019\u2019\nPlace one dispenser on the floor and the second one on top, place the trapdoors on the dispenser.\nPlace both buttons on both dispensers. Now you have a freezer and a refrigerator.\nCupboards.\nAll you need is a bookshelf and trapdoor.\nPlace down a bookshelf (preferably next to a fridge or furnace) and on the side of the bookshelf facing you place a trapdoor and close it. Now it looks like a bunch of boxes of food or colored cups in a cupboard when you open the trapdoor.\nYou can also do it this way:\nYou Need:\n2 stairs\n2 trap doors\nPlace the 2 stairs inward so it looks like a U. Then place a trapdoor in front of each of the stairs.\nNow you have a simple but cute looking cabinet.\nThe method from RastaPastaWolf:\nUse a shulker box in any color. Place on the wall so it opens out toward you. Place a trap door so when closed it covers the box. The boxes can then only be opened when the trap door is open, and you can store items in the boxes. So real cupboards!\nYou could also put barrels horizontally. This frees up space AND allows you to put stuff like item frames (plates) or sea pickles (cups) for washing on top!\nStove.\ntake two smokers/furnaces and put them side-by-side. Then, in front of each, put any trapdoor (preferably spruce) and close them. Last, put a carpet (aesthetic) or a campfire (functional) on top of both. A campfire functions!\nPlace the furnace at a 2 by 2 arrangement. Crouch down and place iron pressure plates on top of all furnaces.\nAgain two smokers/furnaces side-by-side. then on top, shift place detector rails as burners, for a gas stove. \nBathroom.\nMost nicely built bathrooms have some kind of tiles for the floor. Slabs can help you save time and resources if you're in survival. Quartz looks attractive in bathrooms as they add a clean, polished feel and can be chiseled into different styles. You can even make bathrooms with running water, but these would mainly serve as decorations since you (hopefully) can't actually take a bath or use the toilet. Technically, any small room with an infinite water source and a door, qualifies as a \"water closet\". However, here are some ways to build fixtures that can be used for disposal and/or decoration. \nToilet.\nPlace a hopper then put a trapdoor on it, then you put a lever by the side. Now you have a realistic toilet! Or, take a cauldron, place it, then take an iron trapdoor, put that on top of the cauldron, and then place a button near the trapdoor.\nShower.\nYou can place slabs on the ground to mark off the edges of the shower. This should usually be built in a corner. Then place a piston in the ceiling or wall and place water behind it. You can use a lever to turn the shower on and off.\nAnother version is that if you make a wall around 3\u00d73 blocks and put holes in the roof and cover them with glass or trapdoors and then every time it rains if you open them you can have a nice shower.\nAnother option is to do what it says in the paragraph above this one but don't make holes in the ceiling. This is the easiest and quickest option but you won't have a functional, water-spewing shower. The reason for this option is purely for decoration and you would not be able to use it. \nHowever, placing a water source above the ceiling (with particles on) will solve the above problem, because the water will make little blue drops (purely for decoration) that fall from the ceiling, making the shower actually \"work\" in all weathers and without one huge torrent of water that looks pretty unrealistic (have you ever seen a shower that looks like a waterfall?).\nAnother design involves using a dispenser filled with splash water bottles and a clock circuit to create a more advanced shower which will spray water when turned on. For aesthetic purposes, you can also place a tripwire hook or lever on top of the dispenser's opening.\nYou can also use a repeating command block with the command \"/summon splash_potion shower x, shower y, shower z.\" You then will need to place a lever on the block adjacent to the command block. Flicking the lever will create a large current of &lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion\"&gt;Splash Water Bottles&lt;/a&gt;, and the particles produced will create a rain-like effect.\nBath.\nUse a fence, wall or block and surround a 2\u00d71 area near a wall. Get a dispenser and place it in the wall near a button (or lever if you want it to look more like a tap) and place a water bucket into the dispenser, when you hit the button/lever the water will come out and if you hit again it will clear the water out.\nRepeat the 1st sentence of Design 1, then fill the space with water, add lever or tripwire hook for a tap. Feel free to change the size of the space where the water is but this size is suitable for an average-sized bathroom.\nYou can simply place a minecart down and sit in it to save time.\nDesign 4\nDig a 2\u00d72 hole and fill it with water. Surround the water with iron blocks, quartz blocks or white wool.\nIf in Creative, you can use lingering splash potions for the effect of bath scents.\nDesign 5 make a border for the bath dig down so it is 2 blocks deep place soul sand on the bottom layer, add water to make a nice bubble bath\nYou could also combine most of these with a birch boat in the middle to be able to sit in it!\nSink and mirror.\nFor the sink, you can use a hopper, a cauldron (full or empty), or a minecart (try the rail removal trick from above).\nFor a tap, you can use an item frame and place it above the cauldron. Then place a piece of blue concrete in the item frame. It may not seem like much but now you can turn the \"tap\".\nYou can make an acceptable looking sink and mirror combination by making a section at least 3 blocks wide of your floor material. In the middle block place your chosen sink. Surround the left and right sides of the sink with your wall material as well as the back at least 2 blocks high. Replace the block that is behind and above the sink with your \"mirror\". If you have it, you can use ice, otherwise use a glass pane and completely surround it with wall blocks to make it a full pane. You might put a water block behind the glass, just for \"atmosphere\".\nA lever or trip-wire hook can be added above the cauldron sink, as a faucet. Also, for an extra touch, you can put up a banner next to your sink to create a towel! (Plain white banners work best, though patterned ones look nice, too.)\nAn alternate mirror is an item frame with the Steve mob head in it, or you can mine a 2 block deep hole in the wall, place a Steve mob head, then place a glass block at the front. (This is only an accurate reflection if you're using the default Steve skin, but if you use the command , you can get a head with your skin to use.) You can also use a banner, which the pattern follows:\nGames room.\nChessboard or checkerboard.\nSimple (recommended) design.\nTo make a chess/checkerboard, place a &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt; anywhere to form the table and board. You can build any type of chairs you like for the table. Notice how the note block looks a lot like a chess/checkerboard. You can cover up the sides with trapdoors for a table effect.\nNote: This may not work with alternate &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDesign 2.\nNote: Make this in a snowy biome.\nDig a 1 deep hole in the ground. Add two layers of snow. Put an armor stand there (preferable to make next to a wall). Put a chainmail helmet on the stand. Then, using a piston, push a block of quartz down until it reaches ground level. It should now look like a chessboard.\nAlternate (overkill) design.\nIf you are a perfectionist and have the time and resources, you could also do this: \nYou can then clone the map to simplify the process and skip to step 9.\nNotes: To fill the entire map, you will need 64 16x16 squares, 32 white and 32 black.\nThis process can be made much easier with &lt;a href=\"Structure%20Block\"&gt;Structure Block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPool table.\nPut down 3\u00d76 dark green wool blocks, with closed trapdoors for sides. Or, you can put down wood planks and cover them with green or lime carpet. Use fence posts to 'suspend' three jack o'lanterns in a row a single space above the table (will require temporary blocks to sit them on, then destroy them after the pumpkins are placed). Ideally, have faces turned in against each other. Then use string to draw a balking line across the second row of green blocks. Nearby you can have a chest with sticks, eggs and the oblong dyes (e.g.: lime, pink and purple).\nPing pong table.\nLay down 5\u00d73 wooden slabs. At the two long ends, make a 3\u00d71 fence. Cover the whole lot in green carpet/rug. In the middle of the long sides and at the side, place 3 high wooden blocks, with tripwire hooks on the inside of the top blocks, connected by string for the net. Cobwebs might work here as well. But you may not be able to get the green carpet in that case just use green wool.\nPac-Man arcade cabinet.\nA simple way is to place two stairs, one on the ground, and one on top of it, upside down. Another way is to put 2 yellow wool (gold blocks work as well), one on the ground, put glass on top of it, and the other wool block on top. Put a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; (or an item frame map) on the glass, and you're done! You can also put two gold blocks on the ground, next to each other, put black wool on one of the blocks, put another gold block on top of it, and put white wool in front of it. Put a lever on the gold block on the ground to act as a joystick (Rails and crafting /tic-tac-toe tables work too) and you have a decent looking Pac-Man machine!\nMiscellaneous.\nThis section is for pieces of furniture that really don't fit in any categories listed above.\nWater spigot.\nUse this if you're making an outside enclosure for your farm animals. It looks nice and is refillable with rain water.\nFirst put a 3\u00d73 base of cobblestone. Then place a cobblestone wall on top of the middle cobblestone. Then place a lever and Tripwire Hook on opposite sides of a chiseled stone block. Add a Cauldron under the Tripwire Hook, and there you go a sort of working water spigot!\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20190710094205/http%3A//i.imgur.com/a7lKEKd.png\"&gt;Water Spigot&lt;/a&gt;\nPet door.\nA pet door is actually quite simple to create and will save you the trouble of having to keep the door open for your pets, such as &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolve&lt;/a&gt;s. To make a pet door make a 1\u00d71 hole in the wall then put pressure plates on both sides of the hole. Inside the hole, put in a fence gate. Now your pets can come in with ease and most monsters won't be able to get in (except for &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, and the small &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s)!\nRadio.\nBasically, all you need are 2 note blocks and an Iron block. First, place the note blocks. Make sure you have a 1 block gap between them. Then, place the iron block in the gap.\nYou could even place buttons or redstone torches on the blocks to give the feel of having knobs and an antenna or replace one block with a jukebox to play music.\nFancy jukebox.\nFor this, you will need 4 stair blocks, a jukebox, and a redstone lamp. Optional items are a chest, 2 more stair blocks, a slab, and maybe a few buttons for decoration. First, place the redstone lamp on the floor with the jukebox on top. Then, place two stairs next to the redstone lamp, then place the other two stairs on top of the stairs so it makes a [ shape. If you have buttons, add them where you would like, then place the music disk inside the jukebox! If you are using the chest, place the chest on top of it and add on the other two stair blocks next to the chest on top of the previously placed stairs. Then, put the slab right above the chest (don't worry, the chest will still open).\nRedstone.\nTry using Redstone to \"deploy\" furniture. You can even try to make a barren room with everything hidden, with a lever that reveals or creates furniture. This may sound weird, however, it has a cool effect when you actually use it. To do this, you use pistons along the walls, and pull them back with the flick of a lever to reveal your furniture!\nPut furniture where the wood slabs are.\nMaps.\nMaps can be useful, or merely decorative.\nWall clock.\nAll you really have to do is place a clock into an item frame and hang it up. Now you can have a wall clock in your house or anywhere you'd like to place it!\nClassical clock.\nTake two of any block you want (you must be able to put an item frame on it!), place one of the blocks on the floor, and then place the other one on top of the block. Add an item frame with a clock on the top block and you're done! Something optional you could do is to add an item frame on the bottom block with a spade/shovel in it, rotated to be the pendulum.\nGrill.\nTo make a barbecue on the patio or outside of your house, you can craft an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; and place it where you want on your outdoor space."}
{"id": "190410", "revid": "48384975", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=190410", "title": "Tutorials/Game progression in survival mode", "text": "Here everything related to the organic development of the player within their respective game in vanilla survival will be exposed.\nIntroduction.\nHere we will deal with the issue of the different levels of play that a player can reach in the survival game mode, referring to the capabilities, amount of resources and facilities that the player acquires the further his game progresses, since it depends on the stone and bonfires until he's done with a full set of netherite armor, of course. an attempt will be made to collect, differentiate and categorize all these existing \"phases\" throughout a game.\nLet's say that, with survival mode of course we mean the vanilla version of the game, without external modifiers that alter the conventional relationship between available resources and resources that the player acquires, with this we do not want to demerit those players who carry their survival worlds with mods, it is a matter of simple reduction of the terms to be able to carry out this article, it is also desired to exclude any technique such as the duplication of objects as an item (not as a block or entity) within what concerns the natural development of a game, but taking into account the use of mechanics and certain bugs that, as said before, do not encourage the duplication of objects as long as they are items, finally, we will take the difficulties of normal and difficult as the main point of reference, since they offer the experience more genuine and \"complete\".\nIt should also be clarified that there are many rhythms and game modes internal to the survival game itself, with this we will mention that we will not touch the issue of speedruns, since their modes defy too many normal growth parameters within the game.\nEveryone is free to play as they wish, this is not a normative list, it is simply mentioned that there are some relatively \"conventional\" modes where the gaming experience is more natural and authentic, in which each player advances, explores and Expand your capabilities at your own pace.\nPreamble.\nMinecraft is a game that in its survival mode is characterized precisely because the player must get all the materials and tools that he needs, when we appear in the world (with some minor exceptions between versions) we are usually devoid of any material goods, while the more we explore and experiment with the game, our experience of it will grow and with it our material capacities within it, we learn that we must safeguard ourselves from enemies, that we must feed ourselves, that we need some shelter, whether permanent or temporary, this among several other things .\nThe natural vulnerability of the player will force him to satisfy his needs and vulnerabilities, as long as he is exposed he will create shelter, as long as he is weaker than his adversaries he will create weapons and armor, as long as he suffers need he will create farms to supply them, for darkness he will create sources of light etc\nWhere do you want to go?\nWhen a game starts, you only have access to the most superficial resources, generally, woods, stones and superficial ores, adding to this food from wild animal and vegetable sources (unless you find a village), in short, at your disposal will be all the ore, vegetable and animal resources of the surface world.\nMines.\nInitially, depending on experience and ability, the player will be able to access the vast majority of cavernous spaces arranged throughout the world, but we must emphasize that some of these spaces considerably increase the danger of the circumstances, things like dark spaces and with many enemies, abundant lava and falls, this ignoring structures that really represent a new risk for players, such as abandoned mines and ancient cities, in short, it is quite different to manage between the surface and the surface layers of the subsoil and the venturing to the most risky and deepest regions, with this is also considered the vast oceans that divide the continents.\nThe lower world.\nWhen the player has mastered the vast majority of threats in his own world, when he has the most durable ore in that dimension, he can get the obsidian block (if not, when he has an iron bucket and a lighter) it will be possible for you to take the next great step and access the nether through a portal, either building it from scratch or taking advantage of the many that are in ruins, this is a total paradigm shift, it is a new environment full of threats, almost any being The hostile creatures are more dangerous than those existing in the upper world, in the same way, passive creatures are scarce, in short, we will not delve into all the details, let's just say that here you will find the blaze rods, a useful element not only for the alchemy, but to get the keys for the next challenge.\nThe End?\nThe last dimension existing in the game, with somewhat more limited attractions except for some items and the final battle against the dragon, to overcome the last challenge and free the end you must take advantage of everything learned and achieved in your game, there are various methods to destroying the crystals and defeating the beast will depend on your wits, but in usual terms, you will want to be well equipped and stocked with passions and food, your ranged weapon should have the best al enchantments, the same for your combat weapon melee, once you get the victory, it's up to you if you continue your growth as a player in that world...\nExplorer or sedentary?\nDue to the way in which the game allows us to access resources, due to the size of the world, among other factors, the players could essentially be divided into two categories, the explorers and the sedentary, just as in the real world, human beings They were divided long ago between those who settled in groups to exploit a territory and those who dedicated themselves to hunting and gathering at their leisure.\nExplorer players are all those who only settle temporarily, live off immediately available resources, constantly advance through their world hunting, obtaining resources from villages, entering temples and ruins just to take out everything that is useful to them and moving forward, these players never settle to establish permanent residences, consequently they do not acquire very advanced production processes related to farms for example, this does not prevent them from getting good materials, weapons and tools, but it does limit the availability of their resources and the abundance of them in relation to those who if they settle, these players usually cover a greater extension of the worlds and can be interdimensional travelers, bone, that their expeditions also extend to the nether, some go on foot, others get a horse, the most advanced are ready to fly around the world with their elytra.\nOn the other hand, sedentary players are all those who at some point in their game establish a permanent base, on which they undertake all their other activities, usually this is their favorite point of appearance in case of death, on many occasions, it is there same where they build their warehouses, where they establish their crops or their animal pens, in theory, the player can settle in the vast majority of biomes, the player can have different bases and production and operation stations throughout the world, the question is that these must be linked to certain states of permanence, the number of strategies for a player in relation to the way in which he conceives his bases is infinite, but we can highlight some generalities:\nLive in fortresses.\nTo defend their properties from external threats, be they players or monsters, many players fortify their players in one way or another, usually applying some kind of wall around the land they want to defend.\nIn the open field.\nOther players simply leave their buildings exposed, the common thing is to surround everything with a light source to prevent mobs from appearing nearby, otherwise, there is not much else to highlight.\nUnderground.\nSome players start and finish their bases under the ground, either in the superficial layers or in the deepest caves, many of their activities are carried out under the ground, this protects them from the vast majority of mobs and players on the surface, in some cases the accesses to the bases are hidden for greater security, but in others they are visible.\nIn the skies.\nFor some reason certain players take advantage of the game's flimsy gravity and undertake their homes high above sea level, first creating a base pillar or ladder and then creating floating surfaces on which to finish their builds, many of their farms and systems may follow operating even arranged at such a height.\nUnderwater.\nSome others specialize in inhabiting bodies of water, whether they are deep lakes, rivers or the ocean itself, the facilities to do so depend on the player's resources and skill, from creating air bubbles underwater to placing catalysts, this strategy isolates them from many mobs but exposes them to many others.\nIn multiplayer.\nEverything said above applies perfectly to a survival game in multiplayer mode, as long as said game persists within the guidelines given above, it can be considered within those described in this article.\nWe can mention one of the great novelties when entering the multiplayer section and it is the insertion of the element of conflict or cooperation between the players.\nMany players will remain solitary, but many others will strive to organize themselves in groups, regardless of the number of members and the complexity of the group, it can be said that the latter is the most common behavior, here the product processes are amplified and improved, either because one of the players can implement some more effective method at the service of all, or because as a whole the relationship of consumption and production is inclined towards production, (that is, five players harvesting wheat will produce more even though they consume more wheat in total), the Players in a group will decide the mode of their settlement, and depending on the organization they will be in charge of activities, such as the cultivation of the land, defense, construction, among many others, the important thing is to understand that the usual thing is the construction of small or large societies within the game.\nWhat can happen next depends on a series of factors implicit in the server, from the number of players to the class of players, sometimes large groups form factions and these come into conflict, regarding this the community has done all kinds of conflict exercises, confronting groups, civilizations among a long etcetera.\nPlayers together will be able to progress through the game more easily, from the mines to the End dimension.\nGrowth outlook in relation to ores.\nIt is natural to relate the level of a player within his world from his tools and personal items, our materials can be made up of two types of material, vegetable and ore, the only useful vegetable material for the tools crafting is the wood, after this comes the ore category, where we find the stone, from here we only find metals and a precious stone, on the armor, the player must discard the first type of material mentioned here (the vegetable) .\nAlthough leather armor exists as a first level, the vast majority tend to jump to metal pieces, moving on to diamond and in many cases ending in netherite, which in theory is the best material available.\nNaturally, it is intuited that the level of progression is accompanied by one of these pieces of armor or with their respective material in the tools, which is true to a certain extent, even so, there are better prospects for establishing levels in terms of capacity and progress of the player.\nPerspective of growth in relation to the use of mechanics.\nIt can be said that there really is a relationship between the level of the player and the ability to exploit or take advantage of certain game mechanics, this point is especially related to the more technical section of the game, being that the more farms of high cost level and complexity you show, the higher the level of development of your game, let's take it with an example, speaking of obtaining food, many players opt for choosing a particular crop or taking advantage of as many as they can, in short, players usually seek to amplify their food production.\nIf you have enough stored food to save yourself the time of constantly hunting or getting it, then let's say a player learns how to harvest, they know they need water to keep their crops healthy, but then they learn that the water block hydration reaches four blocks from the point of origin, he learns that villagers can also gather, he learns that water can remove crops without ruining arable land, etc, as he further extends his understanding he can develop new methods (original or borrowed from other players). The player goes from cultivating manually to taking advantage of mechanisms with water currents, then integrates automatic warehouses or villagers to harvest for him, in short, he learns to take advantage of the game's mechanics, consequently the player creates more complex systems but that give higher productivity.\nEntonces, podemos afirmar que para generar una respuesta debemos comparar y contrastar las diferencias entre distintas partidas, reconociendo con ello que unas traen consigo mayor avance tecnol\u00f3gico mientras otras se encuentran en niveles iniciales.\nSera mayor el progreso de una partida, de un jugador o grupo de jugadores si estos disponen de una mayor capacidad para salvaguardasen de la muerte, junto a esto, tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 un gran indicador la capacidad potencial que posean para desarrollar tecnolog\u00edas y t\u00e9cnicas a\u00fan mas complejas a partir de lo que materialmente ya poseen.\nCapabilities to evade death.\nPlayers, groups of players or games will determine their progression (up to a certain point) in relation to how capable they are in reducing their chances of dying, below we will present a list of aspects that must be mastered, depending on how many have already been covered will be able to better determine the progress of the game, this implies that the more of the following points a player has covered, the higher his level of progress will be:\nMastery over enemies:.\nThis point refers to the fact that your material advantages must prevent you from becoming a victim of other entities, this does not imply that other players or hostile mobs can never kill you, it means that the probability of getting out of any encounter alive must be high Thanks to the material elements that you have acquired, such as enchanted armor, weapons or immortality totems, all those tools that can make your escape easier are also included here.\nAbundance:.\nAnother great factor linked to this point is how capable you are to generate resources that keep you alive, in this case the great example is food, although there are relatively simple techniques to obtain a good supply of food, it should also be considered how adequate they are such foods, it is very different to have to hunt constantly to survive to be able to enjoy a good supply of cooked potatoes or golden carrots.\nClassification by stages.\nThe following classification method based on the work of Lewis Henry not only gives us some dividing principles to try to accommodate a series of principles to classify a game, it directly gives us a series of labels in which the players and their players can be placed. respective items based on their demonstrable provisions.\nThe three main states; barbarism savagery and civilization are subdivided into seven categories:\nAll these adapted to the terms of the game would end up being as follows:"}

{"id": "93687", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93687", "title": "Tutorials/Gathering resources on peaceful difficulty", "text": "This tutorial is about how to gather resources that are usually dropped from either hostile or neutral mobs. \nBecause most hostile or neutral mobs do not spawn in Peaceful, sometimes it is hard to gather these resources. Also, this page may be helpful when playing any Survival world, if you do not like to fight monsters, but want to get the items that they drop. Another use of this page would be if you want to play Minecraft without any &lt;a href=\"data%20packs\"&gt;data packs&lt;/a&gt;, as this will disable mob drops. However, it will also disable loot in chests, so trading with &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s is one of the few ways you can acquire these items.\nObtainable in Peaceful.\nThese materials are usually mob drops, but can be obtained by other means when a world is on Peaceful difficulty.\nBones.\n&lt;a href=\"Bone\"&gt;Bone&lt;/a&gt;s are commonly dropped from &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, which because they are hostile, do not spawn in Peaceful. However, there are other methods of obtaining bones.\nBones can be found naturally occurring in the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. Unless you happen to have a jungle near your &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;point, or if you're very lucky a &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt; with a woodland mansion in it, your best bet would be to find a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; or a dungeon. It's best to find a dungeon in &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, but if you don't have many caves nearby, you can just mine underground. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s can't spawn mobs on Peaceful difficulty, so in Peaceful, you can't listen to the sounds of &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, skeletons, or &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s to find dungeons. To find a desert temple, you will need to find a desert first, and then explore around the desert. The advantage of desert temples is they can be seen from a long way away. However, when finding structures with chests that could potentially hold bones, remember that a desert temple chest does not always have a bone in it.\nThere are 2 more ways to find bones. One of them is through &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. If you fish with a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; without a Luck of the Sea enchantment, you will have a 1.1% chance of getting a bone. However, the disadvantages of this method are that a fishing rod requires &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, which is most commonly obtained from spiders, which don't spawn in Peaceful, and that you will only have a small chance of getting a bone when fishing. \n, all &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; mobs have a 25% chance of dropping 1\u20132 bone. As at least one fish variety can spawn in every single type of ocean, and salmon spawn in rivers as well. This actually makes bones quite easy to obtain. It is also used to tame wolves.\nBone meal.\nA common way to obtain &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; is by crafting it from bones, but there are several ways to obtain it without using bones. However, no skeletons spawn to drop bones to craft bone meal\nThe first method is by finding &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, which contain &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;s. This will be useful if you need a massive amount of &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. The advantage of this method is that 1 bone block = 9 bone meal, and fossils usually have many bone blocks within them. However, fossils are rare, and only generate in deserts and swamp &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. The best way to find bone blocks is to first find a swamp or desert, and then either find caves, or &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s, or try using &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining/Fossils\"&gt;this method&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, fossils generate around 15\u201324 blocks under surface (around altitude 40\u201349), so if you are on desert hills or swamp hills, fossils generate higher. Another way to find a massive amount of bone blocks in 1.16 and above is to find a &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt; where small fossils generate very commonly, and due to being in peaceful mode, you will not need to worry about the &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s and skeletons.\n, you can buy 3 bone meal for one emerald from the &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;, but wandering traders do not always offer bone meal.\n, all 4 types of fish mob have a 5% chance to drop bone meal. Salmon is especially convenient because it can be found in rivers, and rivers are one of the most common biomes in the game, so you don't need to go to the ocean.\nThe easiest way to get bone meal is by using a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;, usually using items from a farm. For example, if you have too much cactus from a cactus farm, or excess seeds from a wheat farm, just put them into the composter and you will get bone meal after composting it several times. This is the best way to get bone meal without traveling to the nether, as you just need a composter to transform plant-related items or blocks into bone meal. Although not very efficiently, the composter can be used in conjunction with roses dropped from iron golems to automatically create bone meal from an iron farm.\nEnder pearls.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; don't spawn on Peaceful, &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s can be obtained by 3 other means. Ender pearls can be found in the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"strongholds\"&gt;strongholds&lt;/a&gt; and woodland mansions. Both of these structures are very rare, and often far from spawn. The former cannot be located any means and must be found by pure luck, the later can be located with a &lt;a href=\"Explorer%20Map\"&gt;woodland explorer map&lt;/a&gt;. Two ender pearls always generate in the fake end portal room chest, but not every woodland mansion generates a fake end portal room. \nThe best way to obtain ender pearls it by trading 5 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s with a cleric &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; . If you have a farmer and a large &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt; farm, you can gain lots of emeralds by trading these items with the farmer, and thus gain lots of ender pearls. You can also get ender pearls by bartering with &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite the fact that ender pearls can't be used to make &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt; because of the lack of &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s, ender pearls can be used to teleport, which can be very useful at times.\nGunpowder.\n&lt;a href=\"Gunpowder\"&gt;Gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; is most easily obtaining as a drop from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and is also a drop from &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es. However, neither of the 3 mobs spawn on Peaceful difficulty, so alternative ways of obtaining gunpowder are important.\nGunpowder, can be found in &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt; chests, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; chests, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt; chests and &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; chests. See the previous section, \"Bones,\" for how to find these structures. Gunpowder can be found in shipwrecks which can generate in any ocean biome, and rarely e on land.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s will also trade one gunpowder for one emerald. \nGunpowder is not necessary for completing anything major, but it is fun and in many circumstances, helpful to use, as it can be used to create &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Gunpowder can also be used to make splash potions. However, no &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; can be made on Peaceful, because brewing requires &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; as fuel, which is not achievable as &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s don't spawn.\nIf you want to use the gunpowder to make TNT, you can also acquire TNT in a desert temple trap and a trap in a woodland mansion secret room. Be careful, though; they are called traps for a reason! TNT can also be found in &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; chests and &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; chests. Buried treasure can be located using &lt;a href=\"treasure%20map\"&gt;treasure map&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMagma creams.\nMagma creams can not be obtained as a drop from &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, or by crafting a slimeball and a blaze powder, as magma cubes and blazes do not spawn. The only way to obtain it in Peaceful is by looting bastion remnants. However, magma cream is practically useless in peaceful mode, as their only use in peaceful mode is to craft &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s, which are common in everywhere in the Nether. It can't be used as a brewing ingredient, as blaze powder and blaze rods are unobtainable.\nPhantom membranes.\n&lt;a href=\"Phantom%20membrane\"&gt;Phantom membrane&lt;/a&gt;s can not be obtained as a drop from &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s as they do not spawn. The only way to get it is to receive a gift from a &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;. Although phantom membrane only has a 3% chance to be gifted from a cat, it's practically useless in peaceful difficulty, because it's only use is to repair &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, which even if you have elytra, it's better to repair using &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;. It can't be used as a brewing ingredient, as blaze rods are unobtainable.\nPrismarine crystals.\n&lt;a href=\"Prismarine%20crystals\"&gt;Prismarine crystals&lt;/a&gt; can not be obtained as a drop from &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and elder guardians as they do not spawn. Instead it must be obtained by breaking a &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;, or by finding &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; chests. Sea lanterns can be found in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;. An ocean explorer map is useful, but not required, to find ocean monuments. Ocean ruins, on the other hand, are much more common. However, prismarine crystals are completely useless in peaceful as their only use is to craft sea lanterns, which requires prismarine shards, a resource only obtainable by killing guardians. The only way to get a sea lantern while on Peaceful difficulty is by using a Silk Touch &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nRotten flesh.\nFortunately, &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; is not very useful \u2013 you will be fine if you never acquire it in a \"Minecraft\" world. However, if you do have a certain purpose for rotten flesh, such as to feed your &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, it can be obtained in a few ways without killing any hostile monsters. Like &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s, rotten flesh can be found in desert temple &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, jungle temple chests, dungeon chests, and woodland mansion chests. Rotten flesh can also be obtained from &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basement chests, which is useful if you have a snowy tundra or snowy taiga &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; near spawn. Unfortunately, not all igloos have basements, so you may have to go through many igloos to find rotten flesh by that method. Rotten flesh is also found in Shipwreck supply chests, but again, not every shipwreck generates a supply room (this part is usually broken). Rotten flesh can also be found in village temples, however, only the desert village temple has a chest, so it's better to look for desert villages when searching for rotten flesh. Additionally, rotten flesh can also be found in ocean ruins chests. Rotten flesh is also given by a tamed &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; as a gift, but only with a 16.13% chance. You can find stray cats in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, and tame them using any raw fish. Lastly, Rotten flesh also has a 1.2% chance of being obtained when &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. However, like for bones, a fishing rod requires string, which is rather expensive when on Peaceful difficulty. Note that rotten flesh and &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; are often found together.\nSlimeballs.\n&lt;a href=\"Slimeball\"&gt;Slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s are usually obtained by killing &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s. However, slimes don't spawn in peaceful difficulty. Instead slimeballs can be obtainable by trading with &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s and can be dropped by baby &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s when they sneeze. \nOne of the most important crafting products are &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s. Three &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;s. However, jungle temples are very rare, so make sure that when you're looting a jungle temple in Peaceful difficulty, grab all 3 sticky pistons. &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20piston\"&gt;Sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s also generate in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpider eyes.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider%20eye\"&gt;Spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s are usually obtained by killing &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, which don't spawn in peaceful mode. The only place they can be found is in the chests of &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s. Although desert temple chests only have a 29% chance of having spider eyes, desert temples have 4 chests in them, so it is likely that one of them will have some number of spider eyes. However, spider eyes are practically useless on Peaceful difficulty, because they can only be eaten giving poison or as a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; ingredient, the later being impossible in Peaceful.\nSponges.\nWet &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s can be obtained as a drop from elder guardians on Easy, Normal, or Hard, or in the sponge room(s) in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s in all difficulties, including Peaceful. Although wet sponges are technically not renewable, the primary use of sponges is to soak of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, and when they are broken, the water is still drained. Because of this and the fact that wet sponges can be placed in the nether or cooked in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; to become a dry sponge all over again, sponges, despite being non-renewable, can be used an infinite number of times.\nOcean monuments can be rather difficult to find, but they are easier than some other structures, like &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. There are two methods of finding ocean monuments. The cheaper but more time-consuming way is to keep looking around &lt;a href=\"deep%20ocean\"&gt;deep ocean&lt;/a&gt; biome variants, until you find one. The more expensive but less time-consuming way is to acquire an ocean explorer map from a cartographer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, and use that to locate an ocean monument. However, in addition to having to gather enough materials to trade with a cartographer villager to get the explorer map, you will have to trade all the villager's other trade options, before the ocean explorer map trade will unlock. , cartographers have a chance to offer an ocean explorer map.\nString.\n&lt;a href=\"String\"&gt;String&lt;/a&gt; has many uses in Survival mode \u2013 it can be used to make a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"candle\"&gt;candle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, or be used in a &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt; circuit. Although having no &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s makes it harder to acquire string, there are still many ways to get some. String can be obtained by breaking &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. , cobwebs can also be crafted to produce 9 strings, making it better to break cobweb using &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;. If you happen upon a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; library, zombie village, or woodland mansion with a spider room near spawn, this would probably be the easiest way to acquire string. String can also be gifted by a &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;, and is dropped by them upon death. You can also obtain string from bartering with piglins and killing &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nString also generates as part of tripwire traps in &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;s, generating a total of 5 string per jungle temple. Additionally, string can be found in the chests of &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s. Finally, string has a 0.6% chance of being obtained through &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. The next paragraph shows how to acquire a fishing rod without string:\nAll of the crafting recipes of string can be obtained in some other way besides getting string. Wool, of course, can be obtained by killing or shearing &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lead\"&gt;Lead&lt;/a&gt;s are dropped by &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s or found in woodland mansions, dungeons, ancient cities, or buried treasure chests. &lt;a href=\"Loom\"&gt;Loom&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; shepherd houses. Both unenchanted and enchanted &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s can be bought from &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Fletcher villagers&lt;/a&gt; for 2 emeralds and 8 or 17\u201322 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s respectively, as part of their &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;s at apprentice and expert-level, while &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s or bought enchanted or unenchanted from a fletcher villager for 3 emeralds and 8 or 7\u201322. A bow by itself isn't extremely useful when in Peaceful, but it can be used to make a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; which can be used for many purposes. Also, 2 dispensers naturally generate in every jungle temple. Finally, an enchanted &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; can be bought from Fishermen villagers for 6 emeralds, as part of their trades at journeyman level. Enchanted fishing rods can also be found in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;, which you can find more easily by following dolphin fed by &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt;. The primary use of fishing rods is to fish. Actual &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; aren't useful on Peaceful difficulty (other than for trading to fisherman villagers), unless you want to tame a &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; or feed &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, but fishing has a chance of giving the player an &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, and more. In addition, fishing can even give you an enchanted bow, or another fishing rod.\nSugar.\n&lt;a href=\"Sugar\"&gt;Sugar&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained either by crafting with &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, or crafting with &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;, but not by killing &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es as they do not spawn in peaceful difficulty. Simply put 1 sugar cane in the crafting area in your inventory or on a crafting table, and you will get 1 sugar. Put 1 honey bottle in a crafting table, in order to receive 3 sugar and an empty glass bottle.\nSugar can use to craft &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt;. Both are sold by farmer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNot obtainable in Peaceful.\nThese materials, sadly, can only be obtained as hostile monster drops, and have no alternative method of collection.\nBlaze rods.\n&lt;a href=\"Blaze%20rod\"&gt;Blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s can only be obtained by killing &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, which is impossible on Peaceful difficulty. Unfortunately, blaze rods are essential to going to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, because there is only a 1 in a trillion chance that an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; will generate with all &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt; in it, and eyes of ender require blaze powder. However, &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;s, which usually need a blaze rod to craft, can be found in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt; basements and &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; temples, but no &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s can be brewed because they require &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; as fuel. Even though the player may not be able to go to the End on Peaceful difficulty, there are plenty of other things available to do in the \"Minecraft\" world.\nFroglight.\n&lt;a href=\"Froglight\"&gt;Froglight&lt;/a&gt;s drop when tiny &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s be eaten by &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, magma cubes don't spawn on peaceful and they are the only way to obtain froglight.\nGhast tears.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghast%20tear\"&gt;Ghast tear&lt;/a&gt;s, which drop from &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, are used to make &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s of Regeneration and &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s. Although both of these are helpful in \"Minecraft\", neither of them could be made even if ghast tears could be obtained in some other way. This is because potions of Regeneration require &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; to make, and end crystals require &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can't be obtained on Peaceful difficulty because of the lack of &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPrismarine shards.\n&lt;a href=\"Prismarine%20shard\"&gt;Prismarine shard&lt;/a&gt;s, unfortunately, can only be obtained by killing &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. However, all of the crafting recipes with prismarine shards: &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dark%20prismarine\"&gt;dark prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20bricks\"&gt;prismarine bricks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, make up entire &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s, and prismarine and sea lantern also generate in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;. If you are planning on getting a sea lantern, make sure you mine it with a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, because otherwise, it will drop only &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20crystal\"&gt;prismarine crystal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShulker shell.\n&lt;a href=\"Shulker\"&gt;Shulker&lt;/a&gt;s have a 50% chance of dropping a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt; upon death. Despite the fact that shulkers actually do spawn on Peaceful difficulty, unlike most other mobs, &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; can only in ridiculously rare cases (one in every 128/1,000,000,000,000 worlds, which contains an already-lit end portal) be accessed in Peaceful; therefore, shulker shells cannot be obtained on Peaceful. Shulker shells can be used to make a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;, which, although it isn't necessary for anything in \"Minecraft\", can be very helpful at times.\nThere is a very, very small chance that the End will be available on a \"Minecraft\" world from an already-finished end portal frame in a stronghold, making shulkers accessible (see &lt;a href=\"%23Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;#Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;)\nTide armor trim.\nElder guardians have a 20% to drop a &lt;a href=\"tide%20armor%20trim\"&gt;tide armor trim&lt;/a&gt; upon their death. Unfortunately, elder guardians don't spawn on peaceful, and there are the only way to obtain this smithing template.\nTrident.\n&lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt; can spawn holding &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; which sometimes drops when they get killed, which can be used as both a melee and a ranged weapon. Unfortunately, drowned don't spawn on peaceful and they are the only way to obtain tridents.\nWither skeleton skull.\n&lt;a href=\"Wither%20skeleton\"&gt;Wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, when killed, rarely drop a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton%20skull\"&gt;wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to make the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; boss. Unfortunately, wither skeletons don't spawn on Peaceful, and they are the only way to obtain wither skeleton skulls. The only use of wither skeleton skulls is to create the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; which doesn't spawn in peaceful difficulty, or as a helmet. The wither drops a &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt;, which can be crafted into a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;. This means that beacons are one of the items that cannot be obtained on Peaceful difficulty. However, &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;s, a similar block, are obtainable and constructive on Peaceful. A conduit requires a &lt;a href=\"heart%20of%20the%20sea\"&gt;heart of the sea&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; and 8 &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s from fishing or bought from wandering traders, as well as prismarine block variants or sea lanterns to active it.\nSpawnable on Peaceful.\nThese mobs are the few neutral/hostile mobs that can spawn on Peaceful difficulty. However, none of them, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, they can accidentally attack players when a piglin is about to shoot at a &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt; and the player blocks its way.\nBee.\n&lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;s are the only arthropod mobs that don't despawn in peaceful. Bees only drop experience when killed, so it's better to farm them to produce &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s. These items can be used as food (honey bottles also remove poison), to craft &lt;a href=\"honeycomb%20block\"&gt;honeycomb block&lt;/a&gt;s, sugar, &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s (a sticky block similar to slime block but different), or to craft beehives.\nEnder dragon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; is the boss mob of &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; dimension. It will drop tons of &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; upon death. Dragon eggs cannot be used to craft anything, but they serve as a trophy, showing that the ender dragon has been defeated. The End cannot be reached in Peaceful difficulty since eyes of ender require blaze powder to craft, which is unobtainable. Eyes of ender were formerly obtainable via villager trading, but now it is impossible. However, if one is super lucky, (literally one in a trillion) they can find a stronghold with all end portal frames already filled; this way, they can access the End in Peaceful, one such seed is 153528141396417860.\nWhen you enter the End, the ender dragon will spawn. It cannot do damage to you but it will still knock you back, so the only things to worry about are taking damage from destroying the end crystals, taking fall damage after being launched by the ender dragon, or falling into the void after being launched by the end dragon. Apart from that, the fight should be easy. You can also use the end gateway portal and you will be able to access the End as much as you want. Keep in mind that the end crystals cannot be obtained in Peaceful, because ghast tears are unobtainable, so you cannot respawn the dragon.\nEvoker.\n&lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;s live in woodland mansions, which are very rare. Due to their ability to summon &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es and their fang attack, they are very dangerous in Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties. However, they cannot deal any damage if the player is on Peaceful difficulty (although the player may still incidentally receive damage from an evoker fang if an evoker is trying to attack a villager). Evokers drop very rare items upon death: 0\u20131 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, and even more useful, a &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt;. If the player dies while holding a totem of undying, that player will not die, but instead, have , and quickly regenerate to full health.\nHoglin.\n&lt;a href=\"Hoglin\"&gt;Hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s naturally spawn in the Nether, specifically in &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt;s on all difficulties. They become passive in peaceful mode and won't attack the player. They drop raw porkchops and leather upon death, which can be used as a source of leather, though killing cows is a much easier alternative.\nLlama.\n&lt;a href=\"Llama\"&gt;Llama&lt;/a&gt;s are technically tamable mobs, but they are also neutral mobs, as they will spit at the player, dealing damage, if attacked by the player. They are the only mob in the game that will do damage to the player on Peaceful difficulty. But there is almost no need to harm llamas as they only drop &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; upon death, which is also obtainable from &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s. Llamas can be equipped with a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; for storage, and they can be equipped with a &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt; for decoration. Llamas will only spawn in savanna and mountains &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. Trader llamas also spawn anywhere with wandering traders, even underground or in &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; biomes.\nPiglin.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s naturally spawn in the Nether, specifically in crimson forest and nether wastes in all difficulties. They become passive in peaceful mode and won't attack the player, though they'll still hunt hoglins occasionally (thus, they may accidentally hit the player if they use a crossbow to hunt hoglins). While piglins drop nothing upon death, they can be bartered with, which can be used to obtain several normally unobtainable things in peaceful or in the nether such as fire resistance potions.\nPolar bear.\n&lt;a href=\"Polar%20bear\"&gt;Polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s are neutral mobs that spawn on Peaceful difficulty. However, polar bears will not attack the player on Peaceful. Polar bears drop &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; and raw salmon when killed, as well as experience. You can also obtain fish by &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, and experience by killing nearly any mob.\nShulker.\n&lt;a href=\"Shulker\"&gt;Shulker&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; on all difficulties, but will not inflict damage on Peaceful difficulty. Shulkers will drop &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt;s upon death, which is very useful for making &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es.\nVindicator.\nOn high difficulty levels, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s deal the second most melee damage of any mob(first being iron golem). However, like &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, they do not attack players when on Peaceful difficulty, but they will still be hostile towards &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, just like they are on other difficulties. Vindicators have a high chance of dropping an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; upon death, and they also have a lesser chance of dropping their iron &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; which can be enchanted.\nWolf.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; usually just ignore the player, unless attacked, in which they will become hostile towards whoever attacked them. On Peaceful difficulty, they will not attack players, or will attack but deal no damage[Bedrock Edition only]. Wolves only drop experience upon death, but they can also be tamed with &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s. Tamed wolves will follow the player unless told to sit, and will attack any mobs that attack the player, or if the player attacks them, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s."}
{"id": "191799", "revid": "44196195", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=191799", "title": "Tutorials/Getting max gear", "text": "Getting max gear is incredibly important especially when you're on a war-type server. Here are the methods that can be used to get max gear.\nUsing a village.\nVillages are one of the most important structures in the game as they contain villagers. Villagers can trade many items, ranging from enchanted books to Ender Pearls and even diamond gear. \nWhen we spawn in the world, we can go to a random direction and just wait until we find a village. If you're on a semi-anarchy server though, it's better if you set your camp more than 2,000 blocks away from spawn to prevent other players from griefing your base and steal some valuables. While we go to our village, there are some things that we need, sugarcane, leather, wool and food. Pick up sugarcane when you find them and kill cows, donkeys, mules, horses and llamas on sight. Another method is take the world seed, scout out the world and once we pick a suitable location, go there and while on our journey, loot structures that you might come across while also getting wool, leather, food and sugarcane. Also if you come across either a Taiga, Dark Oak or Jungle biome, take 4 of those saplings as the 2x2 trees give the most wood out of any tree in the game.\nOnce we got to our village, we need to herd villagers in one area. To do this, break all the beds and put them in your desired area. The villagers will go to the beds when it's night time. After that's done, we need to farm carrots/potatoes, sugarcane and breed villagers (can be done by placing more beds and giving each villager at least 3 bread loaves or 12 vegetables). We can turn some of them into librarians or fletchers. \nIf you still don't have diamond gear at this point, we can either mine for them or trade with the villagers. For the villager method, trade with the weaponsmiths, toolsmiths and armourers until you max them out and buy the diamond equipment they sell. For the mining method, we need a villager that sells Fortune II or III (we can just combine the level 2 to get level 3) and once we got the book, put it on an anvil and apply it on a pickaxe and we can mine for those either by strip mining or caving. While caving, also mine Redstone, Gold, Lapis Lazuli and Iron ores. \nIf you now have the diamond gear, we needed this librarians with the following enchantments, Protection IV, Unbreaking III, Mending, Feather Falling IV, Sharpness V, Looting III, Fire Aspect II, Efficiency V and Silk Touch. For our armour, we needed Protection, Unbreaking and Mending on them (Feather Falling IV on the boots to reduce fall damage), Sharpness, Looting, Unbreaking, Mending and Fire Aspect for the sword, Efficiency, Unbreaking, Mending and either Silk Touch or Fortune for your shovels, pickaxes and hoes and Efficiency, Sharpness, Unbreaking and Mending for your axe. Aside librarians, we also needed some clerics for either Ender Pearls or Bottles o' Enchanting. \nOnce we have the gear, we're gonna go to the nether and we're there for 3 things, Nether Wart, Blaze Rods and Ancient Debris. For the first two, they can be found on one structure (the nether wart can also be found on Bastion Remnants \"Housing Units type\"). The nether wart and blaze rods are gonna be used for potion brewing. When we're going back to the portal, it's also the perfect time to get Ancient Debris. There are 2 ways to get the debris without using TNT, by simply strip-mining at y= 15 along a chunk border or by using beds while being on the same level.\nOnce we return to our camp, we can finally start brewing potions which will greatly help in a fight. The most important potions in PVP are Strength II, Swiftness II and Fire Resistance (8:00 minutes). However, we are still missing one thing and that is the Totem of Undying and to get those, we can either raid a Woodland Mansion or start a Raid. Starting a Raid is much easier than raiding a mansion due to the fact that mansions are the rarest structure in the game. Once we start a raid, we can get the totems by killing an Evoker. The number of totems we can obtain depends on the difficulty, you cannot get totems on Easy, you can only get 1 on Normal and at least 4 totems on Hard mode. When we acquire the totems we are officially PVP ready.\nWithout using a village.\nUnlike the aforementioned method, this one doesn't use a village, but instead uses a Gold XP Farm to get good enchants. To get the Mending books, we'll need to cure an Infected Villager first to make the prices lower while to get Soul Speed III, we'll need to either raid Bastions or barter with Piglins. This method isn't really efficient in large servers as other players will fill up the mob cap instead, rendering the farm useless.\nWhen we spawn in the world, we can go right into caving. And then we need 3 things, leather, sugarcane and food. The fastest way to get leather and sugarcane is just kill the naturally-generating cows, donkeys, horses, mules and llamas while picking up sugarcane near rivers. We'll need around 90 leather while we'll need approximately 7 stacks of sugarcane so it'll require some farming.\nAt night, we can hunt some mobs, specifically Creepers and Endermen. We'll need 1 pearl and 10 gunpowder to craft 2 TNT (you can craft extra in case you made a mistake later on). We'll also need to go in the caves to acquire some materials, including building blocks, Lapis Lazuli to enchant, some diamonds and most importantly 2-3 stacks of Iron. To be as efficient as possible, you'd want to do this:\nWhen we have the materials, we can craft a Diamond Pickaxe and an Enchanting Table (save up the others for later use), enchant the pickaxe with Unbreaking I and smelt the iron for something else (don't craft it for gear). We then need to get obsidian to make a portal and chop around 4 stacks of wood for our build. After getting the rest of the materials, break the sugarcane and go to the nether. Once at the nether, break the portal, go to the Nether Wastes biome and erect a temporary camp for we'd need around 29 stacks of Magma Blocks and this is why we'd need an Unbreaking I pickaxe. The easiest way to get those magma blocks is at the nether sea level and they're found in huge clumps.\nOnce we have the required materials, go to the nether roof, teleport there using an ender pearl (make sure you have a Flint and Steel, 10 pieces of obsidian, the pistons, TNT, a trapdoor and a lever). Once above the nether roof, break the piece of bedrock you teleported from using a glitched exploit (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5Edj0RYts, NOTE: Custom server software such as Paper, Spigot and Purpur patches bedrock breaking exploits so check if your server has a custom software installed, to know, press F3 and it'll show you on the top left if you're either on \"Integrated Server\" or other custom server).\nOnce there, we can finally start on the construction of the Gold Farm (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXKLMYXbxYY&amp;t=211s). This XP farm however only uses 1 layer as opposed to the usual 2 or 3 layers. To start the farm, hurt one of the Zombified Piglins so that the others will try to kill you. Go back to the centre and the 24 minecarts will kill the piglins for XP (in vanilla Minecraft, the default number of entity cramming is 24 and custom software can alter this mechanics). First thing to do with the XP is to enchant a Fortune III pickaxe and if the Diamond pickaxe from earlier is almost broken, just enchant an Iron one but if you pick up extra diamonds earlier, craft a new pickaxe and enchant it with Fortune.\nOnce we have Fortune, we'd need to return to the Overworld, find a cave and acquire the remaining diamonds. We'd also need some more Lapis and more Iron for anvils and for hoppers to collect drops from the farm. Once we have the equipment, we then need to enchant it and it's pretty simple. For the armour, get at least Protection IV and Unbreaking III (boots must also have Feather Falling IV as a bonus to reduce fall damage). For the tools, get at least 2-3 essential enchantments such as Sharpness, Efficiency and Unbreaking. The rest of the enchantments are applied with books.\nOnce all are enchanted, we still needed some things, most importantly, we needed Blaze Rods, Nether Wart, Ancient Debris, Soul Speed 3 and Mending. First, go to the fortress, kill the Blazes and get the nether wart (not all nether fortresses have nether wart gardens though, there are some alternatives, loot the fortress chests or loot a Bastion Housing Unit type). While going back to our hole, it's the perfect time to look for Ancient Debris, go to y= 15 along a chunk border and strip-mine there but you can also use beds if you have some wool.\nOnce we get back to our hole in the nether, wait for some piglins to spawn and try to barter with them for Soul Speed III, this might take some time depending on your RNG so be patient.\nOnce we've acquired our Soul Speed III, get a brown mushroom, go back to our portal and go to the Overworld. Plant sugarcane until we have enough paper to trade with our future villager. The brew a Splash Potion of Weakness, craft a Golden Apple and it's now based on luck. Zombie Villagers have a 5% chance of spawning in substitute of a regular zombie. If you're on a server, tell the other online players to not sleep. Once we have the villager, cure him, craft a lectern and once cured, put it near him (put a bed near him if he doesn't accept his new job). Then reroll his trades until we have a Mending book, trade with him, craft some books to get the mending book and there. \nAfter that, smelt the debris and apply the mending books on our gear. And once our debris is smelted, craft the ingots and there we go, we're finally ready.\nMix of both methods.\nA mix of both methods is also a good strategy to get good gear, here is the way.\nWhen we spawn in the world, we'd need to go to a village that's quite far away from spawn and while travelling, loot shipwrecks, buried treasures and any village we can ransack. Once at our destination, we'll then trade with the villagers for a Fortune 3 book, apply it on our pickaxe (preferably a diamond one) and mine for the diamonds. You can either strip-mine for them or find huge caves that go below y= 0 to get the full diamond gear. Strip-mining has huge ore veins and gives you a ton of building blocks (very important later on) while caving is more reliable, gives more ores but diamond ores only has veins of one and two and doesn't really give you as much building blocks.\nOnce we have the full gear, we can then start construction of the farm. In Java, make a new diamond pickaxe, enchant it with Unbreaking I and mine for the magma blocks we're gonna need and build the farm. Once finished, we can then gather the lapis and books we need and start enchanting our items. Then go to a fortress, get the nether wart and the blaze rod we need, collect the ancient debris, smelt them, brew some pots for PVP and convert our diamond gear into netherite, get a mending villager and get 9 mending books and apply them to our gear. Then start a raid and we're officially PVP ready. In Bedrock, however, since we can't build above the nether roof, we'll make this design instead by navynexus (Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuG6rhaTtxg). If you don't have a trident yet, download an autoclicker and use your sword to attack the zombified piglins. You can then start enchanting your gear, get mending, apply them on our gear, go to the nether, find a fortress, get the blaze rods and nether wart, go back to the overworld, brew pots, start mining for the ancient debris, smelt it, convert our gear to netherite grade, start a raid, collect a totem and we're now ready to fight."}

In vanilla Minecraft, the world border is situated 30,000,000 blocks from the world &lt;a href=\"spawn%20point\"&gt;spawn point&lt;/a&gt; in each direction. There are numerous methods to help the player get there, for example, using the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; to divide the distance needed to be covered by 8.\nSprinting.\nSprinting to the world border is a very tedious task. The average speed you can go is 5.6 blocks per second so it would take around 62 days to go to the world border assuming you go non-stop and you encounter flat terrain for the entirety of your journey. However, walking does have its perks, as you can gain recognition for manually walking such a large distance. An example is Fig's journey to the border.\nUsing the nether.\nIn Minecraft, 1 block in the nether is equal to travelling 8 overworld blocks. This meant that you travel 8x faster in the nether than in the overworld. You only need to travel X/Z: 3,749,998.\nLate game method.\n[Can only be applied on the late game where you have nothing much to do]\nBefore starting the operation, we need to collect all the materials. The essential materials are:\nThe first phase of Operation World Border is we need to go to the nether roof. This is because below the roof is a lot of disruptions, such as landmasses.\nThe second phase is fly up high. This is what SB737 did. By flying up super high, you'll soon passively fall and reach the border in 3 days.\nWhen you finally reached X/Z: 3,750,000, make a nether portal and you will find the world border. \nGlitched method.\nWhen you go to the nether roof and make a portal and right before entering the overworld and throw a pearl and get out of the portal, the game will get confused and multiply your distance. This is an incredibly powerful glitch that allows you to reach the border in under a minute.\nBoat on ice method.\nSince boats travel faster when on ice and you have a silk touch pickaxe and an ice farm, you can make an ice road and reach the border in around 15 hours if you don't stop.\nSoul speed tunnel.\nSoul speed comes in 3 different enchantment values, I, II, and III, with speeds of 7.9, 8.5, and 9.1 blocks per second respectively. With these enchantments, it would take around 44, 41, and 38 days respectively. This is remarkably faster than just sprinting.\nAutomatic flying machine.\nThe fastest flying machine record travelled at a speed of 4.4 blocks per second. With this speed, it would take around 79 days to reach the world border. No input would be required after the making of the flying machine. See this &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmwvYgn-s740\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on how to build the machine.\nMetword's strategy.\nMetword made a video about his speedrun to the world border. His technique consists of a redstone TNT machine and 5 elytras, with the TNT serving as his rockets to boost him up.\nWhat Metword did is beat the game, collect 5 elytra and trade with his villagers for 10 stacks of XP bottles. While he wait for his villagers to restock, he collected the required materials to construct this machine.\nWhen he was ready to go to the world border, he constructed the machine near a chunk border, set his difficulty to peaceful and put his render distance to the lowest, threw an ender pearl and started the machine. The reason for this is because the machine is constructed near a chunk border and the machine started producing multiple copies of TNT, the TNT gets pushed outside the chunk border and is considered by the game as \"frozen\". Due to this, the TNT isn't exploding, the same with the ender pearl, as it was outside the chunk border and hit a cobweb which was one of the materials of the machine.\nThe more TNT produced, the farther you'll get thrown at. Metword always wait for around 10,000 TNT (can be determined using the entity counter) to be produced before he get set off to air. You would need around 25 machines to build and this technique requires constant player checking, as you can die from fall damage and have to restart all over again.\nMinecart.\nThe classic minecart railway technique is not too efficient in going to the world border, as you'd need a ton of wood, iron and gold to acquire the necessary materials, not counting the axes and pickaxes you must consume. This is fairly an expensive process and you'd need to constantly build the railway to go to the world border."}

This will also cover how you can make it easier to share your patterns such that other people can easily recreate them.\nMaking Patterns.\nThese suggestions are based on opinion.\nMatching the Corners.\nTo start off, place one block of terracotta on its own, and pay attention to the corner designs. When putting together patterns, the corners take center stage, with different combinations of corner textures being the main factor in what is aesthetically pleasing. If you see a corner part you like, place more blocks as the player spins around that corner, revealing the design that comes out when they are put together.\nMost terracotta blocks have a \"centerpiece\" in one of the corners. This could be anything that stands out from the rest of the block, such as the flower petals on the orange and white terracotta, the rings on the green terracotta, and the creeper face on the cyan terracotta. Generally, the prettiest 2x2 patterns come from either putting these \"centerpieces\" on the inside, thus creating a flower in the middle for orange and white terracotta, or putting the \"centerpieces\" on the outside corners.\nWhen making a design larger than 2x2, keep in mind that there will end up being two patterns that repeat and are merged by the corner textures.\nCombining Different Colors.\nWhen putting together designs with multiple colors of terracotta, keep in mind that the \"centerpieces\" of each color matter a lot. For example, wide curves (seen on the lime and light gray terracottas) tend to go well next to other wide curves. Light gray terracotta makes a nice corner design. Flower-y designs (seen on the white, orange, pink, and light blue terracottas) complete each other well and are often put in the center of the design. Brown terracotta is a nice way to subtly guide the viewer's eye. Putting brighter colors together also makes for aesthetically pleasing patterns. Magenta terracotta sticks out like a sore thumb and should not be used for aesthetically pleasing patterns. Its role is limited to non-decoration functions.\nSharing the Patterns.\nMagenta glazed terracotta has an arrow that points in the direction the player was facing when it was placed. This can be used to share the different rotations of terracotta pattern. There is a single-color and multi-color example below. On one layer, there is the pattern, and the second layer has the magenta terracotta \"key,\" which tells the player which direction they should face when placing the terracotta blocks.\nSingle-Color:\nMulti-Color:\nIf the design is vertical, then the magenta terracotta \"key\" will have to be given to you in layers. For some people, it actually makes it easier to recreate the design. The key will be next to the design on each layer. This design is the same as the single-color example above."}

You can use the mechanic that allows you to produce more by applying bone meal, or you wait for it to grow and then harvest it. The first method requires you to have some bone meal and at least one glow berry. Just place a glow berry and keep right clicking or tapping on the berry while holding bone meal, which will make it produce a glow berry in its bushes, then when you tap on it again it will eject the berry which you can then pick up. The second method is basically like an upside down bamboo farm. Just wait for the glow berry to grow and then harvest it."}

The drops can then be collected by a &lt;a href=\"hopper%20minecart\"&gt;hopper minecart&lt;/a&gt; below the block that the harvested plant is on."}

There are eight types of goat horns, each with a unique sound, four of them are exclusive to screaming goats, which are a rare variant of goats.

Popularized in \"Minecraft\" by teams, griefing has become a serious problem for &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"administrator\"&gt;administrator&lt;/a&gt;s who wish to foster building and protect builders. Most players tend to dislike and frown upon griefing, while others feel it adds a certain degree of drama to the game.\nThe purpose of this page is to instruct players on how to prevent griefing, whether you're just a normal player or a server administrator/owner.\nGriefing methods and prevention.\nThere are many other forms of griefing, many of them are variations of the ones listed above. Essentially, if moderators are attentive and the server is equipped with the necessary plugins, a server can be very secure from griefing and spamming.\nGriefing clients.\nWhile modifications to \"Minecraft\" clients are fairly popular with &lt;a href=\"Mods\"&gt;legitimate mods&lt;/a&gt;, griefers also often employ &lt;a href=\"Mods/Cheating\"&gt;client modifications&lt;/a&gt; to aid their efforts. Apart from the mods below, griefing clients often include an in-game GUI to display enabled mods, as well as things such as chat commands (\".commands\") and keybinds to easily turn hacks on and off.\nWarning: It is not recommended to purchase paid hacked clients, as the people behind them can never be trusted (whether they are bad programmers, scammers, untrustworthy, etc.). Hacked clients also never last forever; various paid hacked clients have been discontinued. Thus, if you pay money for a hacked client, you'll only be getting some months of usage until the hacked client gets discontinued. It will be a huge risk and a waste of your time. Never use cracked paid clients, they can ruin your computer with malware.\nAnti-griefing tips.\nHow to prevent griefing as a player.\nGriefing is difficult to prevent and virtually impossible to avoid on anarchy servers, but as a normal player, you can take steps to make your base harder to find, and ultimately, harder to grief.\nHow to prevent griefing as a server owner.\nWhile there is not much that can stop a determined griefer, there are ways for a server to mitigate the risks of being griefed. The following is a list of steps server owners can take to try to keep their server protected:\nFor a much more in-depth (and anti-grief biased) analysis, see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/jee69/preventing_griefers_how_to_be_an_effective/\"&gt;Crayboff's thread on the topic.&lt;/a&gt; You can also watch who you let on your server or realm\nServer modifications.\nWhile there are many people creating grief-friendly client modifications, there are equally dedicated programmers creating server plugins to foil their attempts. Using the popular and extensible server software and other &lt;a href=\"Mods%23Server%20Mods\"&gt;Server Mods&lt;/a&gt;, programmers have made numerous add-ons to enforce correct client behavior. There are plugins that allow administrators to log and rollback all edits done on an individual basis, employ jails to trap griefers, and even protect certain blocks or entire chunks.\nHistory.\nGriefing is far from a new phenomenon in video games. It dates to the late 1990s, when it was used to describe the willfully antisocial behaviors seen in early massively multiplayer online games like \"Ultima Online\" and first-person shooters like \"Counter-Strike\". Frustrated users or mal-intentioned gamers have oftentimes tried to cause grief among other players in multiplayer servers they join, but many griefers just \"do it for the lulz\", or just out of plain boredom. An increase in organized griefing occurred with the creation of teams producing their own videos which popularized Minecraft griefing. Fortunately for server administrators, the increase in griefing has pushed the creation of numerous &lt;a href=\"%23Anti-Griefing\"&gt;anti-griefing tools and techniques&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "57425", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=57425", "title": "Tutorials/Guardian farming", "text": "Guardian farming is a method of obtaining &lt;a href=\"prismarine%20shards\"&gt;prismarine shards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prismarine%20Crystals\"&gt;crystals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhy bother?\nGuardians drop more XP than a usual mob, making it faster than an enderman or a pigman farm. A fully-optimized guardian farm produces 180,000 XP per hour, making it one of the fastest XP farms in existence. However, the difficulty of making such farms is one of the major reasons why the average player tend to not build one, as well as the fact that guardians drop prismarine shards, crystals and cod which produce almost no value, although prismarine and sea lanterns are beautiful blocks, not all are builders so they tend to avoid building these massive farms.\nSpawning.\nGuardians only spawn in &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s, which themselves only spawn in &lt;a href=\"deep%20ocean\"&gt;deep ocean&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Guardians spawn in water blocks within a 58\u00d724\u00d758 volume defined horizontally by the base of the monument and vertically from the floor level of the monument (usually, if not always Y=39) up to just above the decorative structure at the top (usually, if not always Y=61).\nPreparing the monument.\nBefore creating a farm, the player may need to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20an%20ocean%20monument\"&gt;conquer&lt;/a&gt; an ocean monument, depending on the farm design.\nTo force guardians to spawn within the farm itself, it may be helpful to remove all other water from the spawning zone. Keep in mind that this is a tedious job and may take many resources and a lot of time to accomplish, as well as guardians being present throughout the process, making this job difficult without good armor. Invisibility potions work against the guardians if the user isn't wearing any armor, but guardians will notice them if they get very close.\nIf the design is to kill guardians with fall damage or to have the player AFK near the bottom of the farm, all undersea caves (and any nearby islands) within a 128-block radius will need to be lit, slabbed, or flooded to prevent other hostile mobs from filling the mob cap. Alternatively, an AFK spot high above the monument (Y=160 to Y=170) may be used so only the monument is within the 128-block-radius sphere.\nFarming.\nA basic guardian farm design usually involves a spawning area, a killing area, a method for transporting the mobs from the spawning area to the killing area, an item collection system, and a place for the player to wait.\nSpawning area.\nAs guardians spawn underwater, the spawning area must be flooded. The simplest designs involve simply placing a layer of signs under a pool of water a few blocks deep (either existing ocean or a pool newly constructed) and relying on the Guardians swimming or sinking too low and falling out of the water.\nAs guardians can spawn in flowing water, more active designs have downward-flowing water to push the Guardians more quickly out of the spawning area. As downward-flowing water requires an adjacent wall to exert force on mobs, these designs will typically have either a series of 2-block-wide pools or blocks placed within the spawning area.\nDownwards bubble columns may also be used to drag the spawned guardians down. However, if you're playing a version prior to 1.15.2, the magma blocks will not do any actual damage to the guardians, as they were immune to this type of damage up until that version.\nBecause guardian spawning is severely inhibited when the water block selected for a spawning attempt has a view of the sky, putting a roof over the water spawning area will increase the spawning rate.\nTransport and killing.\nThe simplest design is to leave a large room below the spawning pool. Guardians cannot also be easily transported by flowing water, so the usual canal or flowing-pool designs will not be ideal to collect them into a central area for more concentrated killing. They have pathing that allows them to swim against the flow of water.\nWhile manual kill designs are possible, keep in mind that the Guardians' natural thorns damage will damage players using swords rather than arrows or damaging potions, and that guardians can fit through 1-block holes (thus attacking from above or around a slab or other small gap is needed to prevent escapees). A manual-kill Guardian farm should thus provide for healing, either a beacon providing regeneration or potions. Having a health of , Guardians will require a 34-block drop to kill. Lava over a 12-block drop is sufficient to kill with a combination of fall, lava, and fire damage.\nIron golem kill designs do work, but are limited in usefulness as the guardians' thorns effect will eventually kill the golems, requiring regular replacements. This makes such a method very difficult to maintain without an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron farm&lt;/a&gt;. \nSuffocation traps are possible, however, guardians may phase out through corners. To prevent this, add extra blocks to the corner.\nIt is possible to use full-stand &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;s to kill guardians, however, the guardian must be 8 blocks from the conduit itself, and the conduit must be in the water, making it possibly hard to collect drops.\nLit campfires can also be used to kill guardians, with hoppers placed under them to collect the dropped items.\nItem collection and waiting.\nGuardian farms present few unique issues concerning item collection and player waiting areas: hoppers or hopper minecart systems work well for collection, and except for manual-kill concerns mentioned above nothing special is required for a player waiting area.\nDesigns.\nManual farms.\nGuardian Chamber.\nThis design transports guardians to a collection pit, where they are then damaged with splash poison and instant damage potions.\nYou can then collect the drops, either by hand or hopper.\nGuardian Drop.\nGuardians get transported up with soulsand in 2 boxes of 9 by 12 blocks 10 blocks apart to a general drop which drops them down. \nIt can be automatic so they die of fall damage or you can flick a lever so they get captured by the water and can get killed by hand for xp. \nAutomatic farms.\nNo Drain Guardian Farms\nMany farms Pre-Update Aquatic require you to drain the monument before making your farm.\nSince 1.13 you can now avoid draining. An example is here:\nThese No Drain Guardian farms are time efficient as they use the new 1.13 mechanics of soul sand to launch guardians upwards into a chamber that then directs them in various ways to a kill chamber, often using both lava and gravity. The size of the soul sand section can vary from just a small square to the full 56x56 area of the monument, with the bigger area giving greater drops and yields. The area from the monument floor to the surface must be completely clear to avoid any blocking of the guardians' ascent to the chamber which is often situated at the ocean surface. Note that large blocks of bubble columns can massively lower your FPS unless particles are set to minimal.\nIron Golems.\nOne of them is the iron golem method, where guardians spawn and are funneled using water currents to a trench filled with &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s. As the iron golems attack the guardians, the drops are collected using hoppers and deposited in &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. This method is fairly iron-heavy, due to all of the iron golems, which will need to be periodically replaced due to the guardian's spike damage, and a large number of hoppers used.\nSuper-efficient farm.\nAnother farm is the 'OP', or super-efficient farm. This farm is very expensive to build in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, due to the number of materials used, but produces over 100,000 items per hour.\nMinecarts.\nSimilar to the iron golem-based farm, except there is a drop down to bedrock instead of hoppers, some lava near the bottom to ensure no guardians are still alive, and a hopper minecart to collect the drops. An estimated raw resource count is:\nConduits.\nA simple farm that uses a conduit to kill guardians, which allows spawning and killing to be done in the same room.\nNether Portal.\nA rather simple guardian drop/XP farm design that places the AFK spot in the sky such that the despawn sphere around the player controls the mob spawn location to one corner of the temple, and the player won't suffer the effects of mining fatigue. Therefore, this design has no requirements to drain, remove, or conquer the monument. Due to the timed gatekeeping system in the Nether, the mobs are brought back to the Overworld, so the player is not required to be in the Nether at any time to use this farm. Scaffolding is used to both elevate the mobs and ignore the entity cramming limit."}

It is a custom difficulty which has all the hardcore and ultra hardcore restrictions, but you are stuck on half a heart and cannot regenerate at all.

You also need to bear in mind that even if you do meet these requirements, you need to accept the fact that it is extremely easy to lose your world, even if you have the strongest armor and buffs possible. All of the rules for hardcore and ultra hardcore still apply, so read them first.\nSetting up the world.\nCreating a Half Hearted Hardcore (HHH) world requires cheat permissions, which are impossible to enable when creating a new hardcore world. To work around this, you can create a normal hardcore world, and then open it to LAN with cheats enabled.\nNotes and tips.\nHHH is nearly impossible to survive when playing, and if you take any damage, you die, and you can only spectate the world. Therefore, it's important to know how NOT to take damage. Here are some tips:\nBeginning.\nHalf hearted hardcore can take people weeks of creating and trying worlds to get to the credit titles, and very few people have actually beaten it, but if you really want to prove yourself as a Minecraft master, here is the recommended way on how to do it.\nThe Overworld.\nWhen you start, gather only 3 logs. Make a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe, and mine 3 stone from a nearby hill or underground. Craft a stone pickaxe and use that pickaxe to gather 23 stone, which is enough for the rest of the stone tools set and also 2 furnaces. Now gather about 20 logs using the stone axe and turn a furnace into a smoker. Then you will need to try to find some surface coal and iron and mine any you see, and also kill every mob you come across. Remember not to explore any caves. If you see any grass then you need to mine it and get as many wheat seeds as you can, gather any sugarcane you see, and also pick up any dandelions and destroy any huge mushrooms using the axe. This will be useful for saturation suspicious stew. Once you get enough coal and iron, cook the food, smelt the iron and try to make a stack of torches. Then make a bucket and fill it up with water, and make a shield, flint and steel and shears, and keep the shield in your offhand. You can now kill animals with fire (be VERY CAREFUL not to burn yourself as you will immediately die if you do get caught on fire) and continue gather resources until the sun sets, but make sure to shear sheep so that you have at least 3 wool to make a bed when dusk strikes. You HAVE TO have a bed, so prioritise finding sheep to shear. As soon as the sun begins to set place the bed and immediately start spamclicking/tapping on the bed until it lets you sleep, because that is for safety. Congratulations, you survived your first day!\nWhen you wake up, you can start building a house out of any easily obtainable material. It is not recommend you make it look pretty because you might get attached to it, and you will probably lose it at some point. Also, safety is a priority, so make sure you light up the house and make sure it is 100% mob-proof and sealed with an iron door. It is recommended you build a wall around the house and light up the area inside and around the wall to keep the mobs out. You will also need to set up a crop and animal farm (if you have mushrooms, then a manual mushroom farm as well), so hunger will cease to be a threat. And make sure to skip the nights, and try not to gather wood from forests (because mobs can spawn in the day), but from the surrounding areas instead. After you're done, you should have an outdoor crop farm, sugarcane farm, animal farm, manual sheep farm, chest room, smelting room, optionally bedroom, and some spare rooms you will need to use later, preferably for brewing or nether wart farming.\nAfter you finish your house, you need to go mining. It is pretty obvious that you can barely go caving in this world, so instead buy Fortune 3 from a librarian villager and anvil that to a pickaxe. If you don't have an anvil, you can mine until you have enough iron and then add Fortune 3 to the pickaxe. The natural cost of Fortune 3 is in between 11 and 45 emeralds, so try to get it for as cheap as possible. Now, strip mine with unenchanted pickaxes, and block off and go in a different direction if you hit any caves. Remember, better be safe than sorry. Only use the Fortune 3 if you find an ore that can be fortuned, like coal ore, copper ore, iron ore, redstone ore, gold ore, lapis lazuli ore. If you are lucky enough and you find diamond ore, mine that as well. If you find a lava lake, immediately pour water over it and optionally pick up a bucket of lava for lava, and then obsidian farming later. If you find dripstone, mine it and all of the dripstone blocks for dripstone farming, but be careful not to jump on it otherwise you will take exactly half a heart of damage and die. After you run out of torches or unenchanted pickaxes, or are simply just satisfied with the amount of ores you have obtained, go back up to your base of operations and use multiple furnaces/blast furnaces to smelt the iron and gold mined. Then, hopefully you will have enough iron for a full set of iron armor, or maybe even enough diamonds for a full set of diamond armor! A full set of diamond armor is recommended, but you can also buy it from master level armorers. Also make a sword and then a pickaxe, and use that to mine obsidian and make an enchanting table. Once you have enough sugarcane, leather and wood, you can surround it with 15 bookshelves to get level 30 enchants (or you can buy them from librarians), and enchant your gear and a bow with maxed out enchants. You will need a lot of XP, which you can get from trading with villagers, or by building a mob grinder. While you are trading with villagers, try to buy enough ender pearls from a cleric to be able to beat the game with (16 should be more than enough), since gold is more useful for the absorption hearts from gapples and for golden carrots and potion ingredients. You can also try to level up a farmer to sell you apples and golden carrots/glistering melons, a shepherd to sell you beds which you can use to mine for ancient debris, an armorer/toolsmith to sell you diamond armor/tools if you don't have enough diamonds, a butcher to sell you cooked meat, and a librarian to buy enchanted books/bookshelves, glass and also name tags if you don't want to fish. If you choose to fish, you can also level up a fishermen to sell fish to get emeralds. It is recommended that you transport 2 villagers to your base of operations and then breed them to get the desired amount of villagers, and then make a trading hall, and if wanted an iron farm to not worry about iron again.\nThen get more dandelions, both types of mushrooms, and a bowl to make suspicious stew for saturation. Once you have enough resources, make a few golden apples, keep them in your hotbar, and never remove it. It will save your life at some point. Then you can enchant armor and tools with the best enchants possible.\nAfter you're done enchanting, you should either gather more resources and work on the base, or go to the Nether.\nThe Nether.\nThe Nether is the most dangerous part of this challenge and this is where nearly everybody dies and loses their world. If you want to continue, you will need to go to the Nether to make progress. Read the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20survival\"&gt;Nether survival guide&lt;/a&gt; first. As usual, you can't take damage, so you need to be extremely cautious and alert due to the dangers of the Nether.\nVideos.\nThese 2 videos are of SB737 in half hearted hardcore. The first one is him killing the ender dragon, the second is him killing all 3 bosses.\nBear in mind that in both these videos he was speedrunning.\nPixlriffs attempts to beat the game in half hearted hardcore."}

The rules are simple, you must start yourself in the nether, you should be in hardcore, and you can never go back to the overworld.\nGetting Started.\nFinding a nether forest and obtaining wood.\nA easy enough task in the latest versions. There are two &lt;a href=\"Biome\"&gt;biomes&lt;/a&gt; you can get wood from, either the &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Forest\"&gt;Warped Forest&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;. These biomes have some specific spawns and materials that we'll need. Depending on which biome you find first, you'll need to take necessary precautions, if you find a crimson forest then you'll need to pick up and stay around &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;warped fungi&lt;/a&gt; these can be used to discourage the &lt;a href=\"Hoglin\"&gt;Hoglins&lt;/a&gt; from attacking you when they are near you. Another precaution to take while in the crimson forest are the &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglins&lt;/a&gt; make sure to avoid or hide away from them until you get gold armour. If you find a &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Forest\"&gt;Warped Forest&lt;/a&gt; make sure you are looking towards the ground to not mistakenly look at an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;. After taking these precautions, go ahead and grab some of the logs from the trees, and make some wooden tools (pickaxe and axe).\nObtaining Armour and Cobblestone substitute.\nGetting Cobble.\nAfter going through the nether forest, you should have enough wood to go off and explore. Keep your eyes out for blackstone, this acts exactly like cobblestone, it spawns in basalt deltas biomes and bastion remnants. Once you get blackstone upgrade your tools to stone and make a furnace allowing to cook food like porkchops. You can also get blackstone from piglin bartering.\nGetting Armour.\nLook out for nether gold while you walk around the nether. This ore will drop gold nuggets when mined with a wooden pickaxe or higher. You can make gold nuggets into gold ingots allowing you to craft your very first piece of armour. Try not to mine nether gold while around piglins as this will aggro them even while wearing gold armour.\nSurvival Tricks.\nThese are different from your average tips and will explain creative methods that'll make your life easier\nVillager Trading.\nOne of, if not the most important task in the entire progression. But of course, its luck base. It opens basically to almost all vanilla items and allows you to progress much easier."}

It can take many attempts before actually reaching the credits, which can be very frustrating. This article focuses on Singleplayer Hardcore strategies, many, but not all, of which can apply to other game modes.\nBefore beginning a Hardcore world, it is advisable to beat the game on Hard a few times. Learn to act quickly and effectively. After starting a Hardcore world, it may be helpful to practice on other non-Hardcore worlds, especially to prepare for fighting the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHardcore mode is worth copying the world before you take the risk.\nTips.\nSettings and options.\nThere are many ways, in-game and otherwise, to alter aspects of Hardcore mode.\nShelters.\nShelters are very important, especially on hardcore. Building a proper shelter will make hardcore mode slightly less difficult. Shelters are never optional for night-time, although they may be temporary.\nHotbar.\nIf you have thumb buttons, assign them to your weapon and water bucket. If a bucket is not available or you are in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, equip a solid block instead. If you do not have a shield, it is best to put torches or &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; in your off-hand, as they can be used while having an equipped sword.\nStep by Step Guide to Hardcore.\nAbove-ground Preparations.\nDuration: 5\u201320 minutes\nFirm Footing.\nDuration: 15\u201360 minutes\nAt this point, either find a cave or create a mine (such as a branched mine). While it is usually safer to create a mine, using existing caves is often quicker.\nWhile descending to the depths, avoid risks. At first, it may be very dark so watch carefully for &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s. Be sure to light everything in reach, and don't get lost. It is often very helpful to use signs or another distinguishable block to mark the path. Right-hand rule for torches is recommended.\n&lt;a href=\"Coal\"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt; is the first resource to find. Since inventory management will become a problem, try to keep a stack of coal as close to 64 as possible, but not above it, while keeping a similar number of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es in hand. If necessary, craft &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20coal\"&gt;blocks of coal&lt;/a&gt; to store extra.\nThe next important resource is &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;. 64 ingots will probably be enough; piling up stacks and stacks is not necessary except for longer games. When equipment is nearly used up, or you just have enough iron, find a safe area(preferably beautiful) and set up a few &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s to smelt/cook items quickly. Make, in this order: an iron sword, a shield, a pair of &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s (filling one with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;), iron &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, an iron pickaxe, and an iron &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;. Also, toss any wood tools and store your stone tools.\nOnce fully equipped, go further down and collect &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s. Only seven are necessary, although more is better (2 for a sword, 3 for a pickaxe and 2 for an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;. These and full armor total up to 31 diamonds.) Use the diamond pickaxe to mine at least 14 pieces of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt; and an enchantment table (4 are enough if the player builds the portal using a bucket).\nIn the meantime, try and avoid lush caves and dripstone caves. They do not offer many useful items that cannot already be found in regular caves, and are usually dangerous to explore without the help of advanced gear.\nIt is hard to have too much gold because it is good for making &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Netherite%20ingots\"&gt;Netherite ingots&lt;/a&gt;. 8 ingots are required for a normal golden apple, and since the 1.9 update, &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s aren't craftable. Be sure to grab some &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; for brewing potions.\n&lt;a href=\"Lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;Lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt; is required to make enchantments, so don't forget to mine it if you find some.\nThe 1.17 update introduces a new item called a &lt;a href=\"Spyglass\"&gt;Spyglass&lt;/a&gt;. If you can find an amethyst &lt;a href=\"geode\"&gt;geode&lt;/a&gt;, grab some amethyst, gather some copper, and make a spyglass. This simple but useful investment will allow you to zoom in on your surroundings, which is a very useful thing to be able to do.\nThis sums up all mining you will need to do in the hardcore mode. If you gathered, at any point, enough &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; to make a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, do not hesitate to craft it and use it with whatever arrows skeletons dropped. If you come across a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;, be careful. Avoid &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, but loot any chests.\nWhen you get home, make an infinite water spring, then build farms for wheat, carrots and perhaps potatoes. If you've gotten seeds for pumpkins, cocoa beans, and/or melons, farm those too. Sugar cane is \"very\" important (for bookshelves), so spread and harvest up to 3 stacks of that.\nWheat, seeds, and carrots can be used to lure and breed animals, leading to large supplies of meat and resources over time, so it is worthwhile. You will need chickens (arrows) and cows (bookshelves). It is a good idea to tame &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s to repel creepers, and &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; to fight.\nMany resources (including bookshelves and enchanted diamond gear) can be gathered by trading though leveling up villagers can be a somewhat long process.\nThe Nether.\nDuration: 30 minutes\u20132 hours\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; can be very dangerous, so be prepared and try to bring:\nSome dangerous aspects of the Nether are:\nThe Nether contains four things that might be crucial for your adventure:\nNether Survival: If there are no &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es nearby, you may be forced to spend a lot of time in the Nether. Food supplies can be easily replenished, using very abundant &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, or killing &lt;a href=\"Hoglins\"&gt;Hoglins&lt;/a&gt; which drop &lt;a href=\"porkchops\"&gt;porkchops&lt;/a&gt;. Use &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or distinctive nonflammable blocks, like cobblestone, dirt or crafting tables to mark the path back to the portal. \nFirst find a fortress. Gather the blaze rods that you need, then head off to find a warped forest to kill endermen and get your pearls.\nTry to avoid &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnants&lt;/a&gt;. It may sound like a good idea to trade with piglins in a bastion remnant (although you need gold armor), as there are plenty of them and there is tons of gold to be found. However, after version 1.16.1, piglin brutes spawn in every bastion and pearl luck is severely nerfed. Treasure bastions are especially dangerous due to the high amounts of lava and magma cube spawner, and stables bastions due to the high concentration of hoglins. If you do decide to head to a bastion remnant, be careful about mining the gold or opening chests around them, as they will become angry and try to kill you, and watch out for piglin brutes. If you decide to not risk it, head to a warped forest and kill endermen.\nAfter getting all the ender pearls you need, relocate your nether portal and return to the Overworld.\nOverworld Exploration.\nDuration: 1\u20138 hours\nAt this point, most of the necessary supplies should already be acquired, including 15 bookshelves. Pick a direction and set off. &lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are often worth the &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s, so recruit any that are nearby.\nRemember, villages will provide good combat and survival supplies. Loot one if possible, but finding them can be somewhat difficult. Trading with the villagers can provide very powerful item, even enchanted diamond armor and weapons.\nAt this point there are two main goals: &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it is very helpful to have a chicken farm at this point, because &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s are needed to make arrows. Also, stay stocked on &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;. In the night, be constantly on the move. Search for &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; while killing any threatening mobs or a safer alternative would be to trade ender pearls with cleric villagers. Also, kill as many phantoms as you can and make at least 6 extended slow falling potions. After accumulating levels, enchant weapons and tools:\nPlan to collect 16-20 ender pearls and turn them into &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to be conservative while using them, as sometimes they will break when thrown and sometimes they won't. After locating the &lt;a href=\"End%20portal\"&gt;End portal&lt;/a&gt;, dig a staircase carefully downwards. Once inside the &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, break the &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; spawner and get any loot you can find. Secure a shelter near the portal to prepare for the End. Linking nether portals to the stronghold can be helpful, so you can get quick access from your base.\nThe End.\nDuration: 10\u201340 minutes\nNote: If you run out of anything necessary to kill the dragon, it is essentially game over as there is no way to enter the overworld without dying. You can never over-prepare, since you only get one life.\nThese items are recommended for the End:\nOnce you gather yourself and organize your inventory, jump into the portal and be ready for battle.\nUpon entering the End, the first task is to take out &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s, because they will heal the dragon. Use arrows (or snowballs) to remove all the towers, while avoiding the Ender Dragon. If you can't avoid her\nbefore taking out the crystals, don't hesitate to attack to prevent being blown or knocked off the island.\nTry and use your beds and respawn anchors to your advantage. When you see the dragon perch, let it perch, then rush in and hit the dragon. The dragon will take 50 damage before it flies off, so deal just enough damage so that the dragon won't fly off. Then, trigger your explosives to kill or weaken the dragon.\nWhile doing all this, make sure not to look at any endermen. It is much harder to fight the Ender Dragon whilst endermen are also attacking. If you have trouble looking at endermen, wear a pumpkin head and use a texture pack to remove the pumpkin head overlay.\nOnce all the end crystals are destroyed, take aim at the Ender Dragon, once again avoiding looking at the endermen. If the dragon knocks you into the air, quickly drink a slow falling potion. Keep moving until the Ender Dragon is defeated. Gather the experience orbs, and enter the portal to see the credits, then return to the Overworld.\nCongratulations! You beat hardcore!"}

Removing the head involves carefully manipulated explosions and perfect timing.\nIn order to remove the head, the player must set up a mechanism in which the piston extends at exactly the same time an explosion occurs. When using TNT, this can be done with 10 repeaters set to four ticks. The power of the explosion must also be manipulated, which can be done using other blocks between the explosion and the piston, such as cobblestone walls.\nOnce the piston is headless, powering it will ensure that it stays headless. Once unpowered, it will retract, gain its head back - however, anything placed where the head would be before it is retracted is immediately destroyed, due to how pistons are coded.\nUses.\nThe best use of a headless piston is to destroy blocks, including bedrock. When a headless sticky piston gains its head back, it acts like any normal sticky piston: it retracts the block two blocks in front of it. In order to retract, it must have a piston head, so it will briefly show an extended piston head before retracting.\nA property only found in headless pistons is that if there is a block where the head would be, the block is destroyed and replaced with the piston head and the piston arm blocks.\nThis technique can even be used to break bedrock or other unmovable blocks. This includes barrier blocks, which can make it difficult to make retaining walls for players on vanilla servers. First, place a sticky piston adjacent to the block you want to break, with the head end facing it. Next, place any movable block on the other side of said block. Finally, unpower the piston. The block on the other side replaces the target block and the headless piston gets its head back, as normal.\nNon Survival Friendly design (1.13+).\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Debug%20Stick\"&gt;Debug Stick&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Redstone\"&gt;Block of Redstone&lt;/a&gt;, the player can place down the piston, then power it with the redstone block.\nThe player can then set the piston\u2019s \u201cextended\u201d state to true using the debug stick, then do the usual procedures with headless pistons.\nHow to Take the piston off the head (not survival friendly).\nRun command: , then run command: . Place the command block on the ground. Set the command block mode to repeating. Set the command to \nplace the Redstone block next to the command block\n4 blocks away from the command block, you have your piston head!\nNote: put the command block on the ground for the best result. make sure you placed this on a 5x5 flat plane.\nAlso, do not remove the Redstone block."}

If you are on a PvP &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;, you will find that this is very useful.\nIntroduction.\nIf your chests are in plain view when you're in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;, everything you have may be stolen, and you may never see it again. &lt;a href=\"Ender%20chests\"&gt;Ender chests&lt;/a&gt; are useful, but in many circumstances, you will have more items than the ender chest can fit, especially in servers where the ender chest space is made smaller. &lt;a href=\"Shulker%20box\"&gt;Shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es are very helpful, because full shulker boxes can be carried around in your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, but shulker boxes are very expensive and require rare items to craft. Also, if you carry an ender chest or shulker box far from your house, you would lose it if you die. Therefore, it's very beneficial to know ways to hide &lt;a href=\"chests\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;, to protect your most prized possessions.\nHiding chests only have a practical use in multiplayer, because &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; and other entities don't have the AI to steal from players' chests. However, some players enjoy the secrecy of their valuable chests, even in &lt;a href=\"singleplayer\"&gt;singleplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nHere is a secured vault tutorial for all your needs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2tZ4WKs_Y0\nWays To Hide Chests.\nSimple Ways.\nHere is a list of simple ways to hide chests, which only require a few blocks and don't include any redstone wiring.\nChest under chest.\nThis is a simple way to hide your stuff. All you have to do is dig a place on the ground, and place a chest there. Then, on top of that, add another chest, in which you will put only junk. When another player enters your house, they will see the top chest full of junk, and likely fail to see the chest underneath that (where you hide your stuff!).\nBarrel under chest.\nThis is essentially the same as Chest under chest, but you place your items in a barrel instead of another chest underneath the junk chest. This makes it slightly easier to open and slightly harder to detect.\nDoor hideout.\nIn the corner of your house, add a door. Be sure the handle faces AWAY from the corner, so when you open the door, the side where the door opens to is blocked. On that side, add your secret chest! You may want to make the doorway look like, for example, a furnace room, so when another player raids your house, they will open the door only to be faced with a stack of furnaces. As the door to the furnace room is opened, the chest will be hidden from view by the door itself!\nDoor hideout v2.\nSome people, however, might know about the above door hideout trick and close the door. BOOM, Loot! Just to make sure they don't find it that way, you can try the above Chest-under-Chest trick or place your chest in the ground and put a wall for the door to block. Now, when they shut the door, they see a plain wall. If you still aren't feeling safe, place it a block under with dirt on top. \nDouble-bluff.\nA &lt;a href=\"trapped%20chest\"&gt;trapped chest&lt;/a&gt; could easily be a decoy, hooked up to &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; or some other kind of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Traps\"&gt;deadly trap&lt;/a&gt;. If this tactic is common knowledge on your server, placing your valuables in a trapped chest might be enough to dissuade potential thieves. The good part of this double-bluff is that it is relatively cheap and can be combined with any other hiding method. The bad part is that it relies on the thief noticing that the chest is trapped before they try opening it.\nMinecart Corner.\nAgain in the corner, this is a great way to hide your stuff. Just right behind the corner on the other side, dig one block down, and add a chest minecart. From the corner, you can click on the minecart chest to open it. Be sure people don't see the chest from the outside! (does not work in 1.13)\nUnder Dirt.\nPerhaps the simplest way to hide a chest. Put a large chest under two &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s. Make sure that it's in a spot that nobody would want to mine in, like next to a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; lake or under a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;'s crater. If the &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; has a plugin, set a home there; otherwise, put something there to help you remember where it is.\nUnder the Rug.\nBasically \"Under Dirt\", but instead with &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; placed on the floor with the chest underneath it. Be careful however, as this method is not as safe as using dirt (or other blocks) as carpet and wool are both fragile.\nBeneath a Lava Pool.\nHiding a chest beneath a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pool is a great way to easily access a chest without having to break any blocks, and few players would be smart enough to figure out this trick because of how dangerous lava is. The best way is to find a lava pool or create your own, making sure that it is irregular in shape, so that it doesn't look man-made. If you found one in nature, it's easiest to empty all the lava off it and put everything back in after you put the chests in. Find a part of the hole that is 2 or 3 blocks deep, or just dig down on the parts that are 1 block deep. Place all of your chests in here. Then, pour the &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Bucket\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; on top of that. You are done! The only disadvantage of this method is that if a player happens to accidentally right-click on the lava pool, they will find your loot.\nFive Grass blocks and a hoe.\n\"Note that this will only work in one-block chests.\"\nFirst, surround your chest with grass blocks (like this):\nNow, put a grass block on top of the chest. This will make the chest inaccessible and invisible. However, if you hoe one of the grass blocks on the side, The grass block will become farmland. This will make the block 1 pixel lower, which allows you to carefully locate your crosshair on a tiny hole, making the chest open.\nMore Complex Ways.\nThis section has more complex ways to hide chests, using some redstone.\nMinecart Trick.\nFirst of all, you might want to consider trying out the minecart trick. It is simple to build and very well hidden. In fact, others can't see it if you cover it up! It involves putting a chest in a minecart and pushing another block into it with a piston. This trick was invented by the youtuber Simply Sarc. First, you dig a hole, and fill it with 3 snow layers. Then, force a minecart with chest to fall in the hole. Now, with pistons, make a tree over the minecart chest. Now, test it- right-click the bottom of your tree. Voila, a chest interface will appear.\nDungeon Protection.\nFind a dungeon and hide it (&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Secret%20door\"&gt;Tutorials/Secret door&lt;/a&gt;). Attach a redstone lamp to the &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; and set up the redstone so that the lamp is on when the door is closed and off when the door is open. This ensures that no mob noises can be heard while a thief is searching, and that they will guard if they find the dungeon. Hide important items in here, and they will be safe.\nShell Game.\nBuild a room or a house full of &lt;a href=\"trapped%20chest\"&gt;trapped chest&lt;/a&gt;s, all hooked up to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Traps\"&gt;deadly traps&lt;/a&gt;. You could then memorize the location of the \"real\" chest, which contains all your goodies and won't brutally murder you -- or you could do like a real shell game, make \"all\" of the choices the \"wrong\" one, and hide your valuables somewhere else entirely. Make sure to surround the chests with wooden &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s, so nobody thinks they'll get away with just breaking the chests instead of opening them (as breaking the chest will cause all items inside it to drop as items and trigger the pressure plates). Another way to ensure that players don't just break the chests is to put observers observing all the chest blocks, and connect them to a deadly trap. That way, if the chest block is broken, the trap will trigger and the player trying to steal your stuff will fall into the deadly trap. \nHipster Door Closet.\nA \"hipster door\" (youtube/X3LbkSTjR7I?t=10m3s) is a door that can be disguised as part of the wall and be opened via slime blocks and two sticky pistons. Chests are perfect in this situation because they are non-movable blocks, so they will not be pulled down by the slime blocks. (Java edition only)\nIt's a Trick.\nFor this method of hiding chests, make a room containing the chest with your valuables. Make the chest a &lt;a href=\"trapped%20chest\"&gt;trapped chest&lt;/a&gt;, and have &lt;a href=\"signs\"&gt;signs&lt;/a&gt; all around it saying things like, \"Danger: Something terrible will happen the moment you open the chest, and running away will not help! You must find some other way of stealing my valuables! Mwah ha ha ha!\" This will hopefully convince players that something terrible will happen if they open the chest. They may run away, but if they're smart they might try to break the chest.\nTo prevent this from happening, this is where the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuits\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; comes in. Put an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; observing the trapped chest, and connect it to a deadly trap, so if a smarter player tries to break the chest, they will not be happy with the results. The only disadvantage of this method is that if a player decides that they want to open the trapped chest despite the warning signs, they will be able to get all the loot in it without any consequences (this can be remedied by hiding the valuables somewhere else and turning the aforementioned chest into a mere decoy).\nTake your pick/Guess which one.\nA somewhat more unorthodox method for hiding chests is to construct a large storage room or warehouse filled with hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of chests (empty or filled with junk, the more chests the better) and then hide the valuable chest somewhere amongst them, in a more discreet location. Chests can be placed next to Trapped Chests without needing a block between them and both types can be placed on top of one another. While this is not guaranteed to protect the chest from looters it will definitely delay them for a good while, as every additional chest added will increase the amount of time it takes to search through them all and every passing minute increases the odds of the looter getting caught red-handed by the chest owner. Few players are willing to risk that by spending more than a few minutes rummaging through all the chests. And if anyone, despite that, IS crazy enough to actually start looking through all the chests, even if it takes them the whole day, the trap can be further augmented by mixing in some trapped chests (linked to redstone and/or traps) among the real chests, forcing the thief to waste even more time trying to tell the two types of chests apart from one another to avoid a nasty surprise.\nFinally, if you really want to ruin the thief's day, hide the valuable chest somewhere completely elsewhere; once the looter finishes rummaging through all the tens of thousands of chests (trapped or not), they will have to face the cruel reality that all their efforts were wasted for nothing as the valuable chest was nowhere to be found within the ridiculously huge chest heap.\nWARNING! If you decide to hide your valuables within the chest heap, make sure you know where you place them as forgetting which chest holds the valuables means you have a really huge job in front of you to find the valuables again. Do not mark the valuable chest or make it look different from the others in any way as that renders the whole contraption pointless; this whole concept relies on hiding the valuable chest amongst countless identical ones."}

{"id": "89055", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=89055", "title": "Tutorials/Hitboxes", "text": "This tutorial seeks to teach you how to make use of &lt;a href=\"Hitbox\"&gt;hitboxes&lt;/a&gt;.\nHitboxes.\nHitboxes are regions that describe how much space an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; takes up, which can be shown by pressing the keys. When they are shown, a white outline will be seen showing the location of the entity and the space it takes up. There is also a flat red rectangle near its \"eyes\". This is the \"line of sight\", which is where its in-game eyes are, which could be independent of where they appear to be. Notice how the line of sight wraps all the way around the entity. This explains how it is impossible to sneak up behind a mob without it seeing the player. There is also a straight blue line that extends away from the line of sight. This line points in the direction the mob is facing.\nUsage.\nThey are crucially important for a lot of purposes.\nDamage.\nHitboxes are areas where the mob can be damaged. This includes all types of damage, except for void, fall, and effect-related damage. It is important because it can help the player shoot a mob such as &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;. The hitbox of a ghast does not include the tentacles, so shooting one in its tentacles does nothing.\nEnder Dragon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; has a unique hitbox. It has green boxes around its different body parts, but there is also a giant white box and the line of sight lines. The green boxes are places where you can deal damage to the dragon.\nSuffocation.\nThe mechanics of suffocation is best explained using hitboxes. If a solid block enters the \"head\" of the mob, then it begins to suffocate. The location of the \"head\" is marked with an extremely thin red box, so that is where a mob can be suffocated. If the mob does not have a separate outline for its head, such as a ghast, then it is assumed that the entire mob is a head. Therefore, a player can easily suffocate a ghast by pushing a block anywhere into its hitbox.\nFarms.\nSizes of hitboxes can be used for farms. For example, the hitbox of a baby &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt; is shorter than the hitbox of an adult chicken. If you wanted to build an automatic chicken farm, you must ensure that only the adult chicken will be killed, since baby chickens don't drop anything.\nBlocks that are shorter than a full block are best to use for building a farm. These include enchanting tables, slabs, daylight sensors, and snow layers. These can be used to manipulate the line of sight, as was used in a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt; farm shown in the video:\nThey can also be used to manipulate when mobs can see other mobs, which can help make &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;-powered passive mob farms:\nEjecting Mobs.\nSince every entity has a visible hitbox, it can be used to more easily break a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; that is carrying another mob. By making hitboxes appear, you can see where the mob's hitbox starts. So, you can break a minecart or boat with a passenger without harming the passenger.\nLine of Sight.\nHave you ever heard somebody telling you to \"break line of sight\"? They are referring to making it so the mob can no longer see the player. The player has their own line of sight (red rectangle). The \"line of sight\" between mobs exists when the red rectangle of the player is visible from the red rectangle of the mob, and they are in range. This range varies from 20 blocks for most hostile mobs to a hundred blocks for ghasts and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, and is affected by factors like Blindness &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt; and wearing skulls.\nLine of sight affects how mobs attack the player. If a hostile mob has a line of sight, it will begin attacking. For &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, the player must maintain a line of sight for the entire charge-up of the attacking beam for it to do any damage. If the player's blue line is aiming towards an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;'s red rectangle and not wearing a &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;, the enderman will get angry at the player.\nBreaking Line of Sight.\nBreaking this line of sight can be done in a variety of ways. The first way is to place blocks between the player and the mob, thus preventing you from seeing the other mob's red rectangle. Most mobs cannot see through &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, so it can be used for these purposes. Another solution is to get out of range of the mob, so that it does not attack you. This is difficult to do for long-distance attackers, such as Blazes. Another solution is to kill the mob or unload the chunks that contain it."}
