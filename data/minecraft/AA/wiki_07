It is usually considered the first boss of the game, even though it was added more recently and its &lt;a href=\"advancements\"&gt;advancements&lt;/a&gt; are unlocked after defeating the dragon.\nDefeating the wither drops the key to a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt;. The fight can also be used to help blow up areas for future building projects.\nSpawning the wither.\nCollecting wither skulls.\nIn order to spawn the Wither, you need to acquire three Wither skulls. Wither Skulls are acquired by killing &lt;a href=\"Wither%20Skeleton\"&gt;Wither Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. In order to maximize your chances of acquiring wither skulls, it's recommended that you carry a sword with &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; on it. Even though the maximum drop chance is 5.5% (with &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting III&lt;/a&gt;), it is best to get the highest possible drop chance. The wither requires three skulls to build, so you may have to kill hundreds of wither skeletons to get them. However, the only other ingredient needed to build the wither is &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;, which is extremely common in the Nether.\nAlternatively, charged creepers can be used to kill a wither skeleton and recover their skull 100% of the time. During a thunderstorm, with a trident enchanted with Channeling, charged creepers can be made by striking the creeper with the trident. Unless the creeper is charged in water it will become ignited and will almost always need to be extinguished with a bucket of water placed or they will die to the fire damage. During a thunderstorm, using nether portals, the player can lead a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt; from a nether fortress into the Overworld, charge a creeper, and have the charged creepers detonation kill the &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of the number of skeletons gathered in the detonation only one skull ever drops. A charged creeper's detonation creates quite a hole in the ground so this farming strategy should be done away from frequently traveled land. The damage done to the ground can be nullified if the charged creeper is floating in water upon detonation. A well armored player (&lt;a href=\"blast%20protection\"&gt;blast protection&lt;/a&gt; juggernaut style) can walk up to the creeper and dump a bucket of water at its feet. If the creeper detonates floating in the water it will do no damage to the ground but will still do damage to the player and local mobs in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;. A creeper's detonation can be forced with flint &amp; steel. The average storm lasts 0.5 \u2013 1 Minecraft day (5-10 min), and there is a 0.5 to 7.5 Minecraft day delay between thunderstorms (5 min - 2.5hrs). A thunderstorm can be forced with console syntax: 'weather thunder &lt;duration of storm in seconds&gt;'. After the storm duration the normal weather cycle resumes.\nIf you are fighting the wither on Bedrock Edition, the Wither will summon Wither Skeletons when it is below half health. If you are lucky enough, the spawned Wither Skeletons may drop their skulls, making it easier to summon another Wither.\nSpawning the wither.\nThe Wither is built using 4 blocks of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; and 3 Wither skulls. Soul sand and soul soil can be easily acquired in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;, specifically in &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand%20Valley\"&gt;soul sand valleys.&lt;/a&gt; In order to spawn the wither, build a T-shape using your four blocks of soul sand, and place a wither skull on top of each soul sand. This configuration is pictured to the left. NOTE: There can be no blocks adjacent to the soul sand/soil or wither skulls, except underneath.\nStrategies.\nTraditional combat.\nThis method is the most common way to fight the Wither. While this way isn't recommended due to its difficulty, this method is common among players who don't know about more advanced strategies for killing the Wither - or want more of a challenge. It involves preparing a lot of late-game gear and materials in order to beat the wither in a fair fight.\nWither fight checklist.\nThere are \"many\" ways to fight the wither. The preparation you need to do to fight the wither depends largely on player skill and what equipment the player has. Here's a list of equipment a player may choose to bring to the fight:\nNote that if you are playing in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, this may not be enough, as the wither has double the health, spawns wither skeletons on half health and can use the deadly Dash Attack.\nChoosing a battleground.\nOnce you have obtained the skulls and prepared your other equipment, the next step is to choose a place to fight. There are many possible fight locations, but each place has its risks and disadvantages. It is recommended to find a completely enclosed place so the wither doesn't destroy any of your buildings.\nDimension.\nYou can fight in any of the dimensions in the game. Since there are only three, the choice is not very difficult. However, the most ideal dimension to fight in is the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, because the &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt; are very dangerous places. The Overworld has many different environments, so there are many different possible battle sites. However, the Nether is mostly made of lava and rocky cliffs, so it is possible to die in lava, and all of your gear would burn up. The End is most like outer space, so it is possible to die in the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, and all of your equipment will disappear. Not only that, if the wither dies above lava or in the void, you would also lose the nether star that it drops. This means that the Overworld is the best place to fight the wither. However, the End has no lack of endermen, who the wither will anger, allowing you to kill it more quickly from half health. In addition, you can \"jam\" the wither under the bedrock portal, which would neutralize its maneuverability. If you do choose the End, make sure to battle on a large island so you don't fall off. This method of \"jamming\" the wither under bedrock can also be performed using the ceiling of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;, making the Nether a feasible place to fight the Wither for players who haven't yet killed the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. (Jamming doesn't work on Bedrock Edition, so beware.)\nLocation.\nThere are many places in the Overworld, but some places are better than others for the wither fight. You can either fight underground or on the surface. It is best to fight underground, because on the surface, the wither can easily fly away from you and dodge your attacks, and would also attack other mobs nearby. It would also blow up huge craters in the surface, or may even destroy your buildings. Therefore, it is best to fight underground, so that it is in a confined space. However, the biome in which the cave is in may make a difference. If the cave is in the &lt;a href=\"mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt;, there may be &lt;a href=\"infested%20block\"&gt;infested block&lt;/a&gt;s hidden among the rocks. If these are blown up by the wither, they would release the &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; trapped inside, which would also attack you. Therefore, don't pick a cave in the mountains. Make sure the cave isn't too far away from your base, in case you die, but also don't spawn it to close to your base because there is a good chance it will get destroyed.\nBase.\nOnce you pick a spot to fight, you should build a small base. You should build the base out of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the wither can sometimes break obsidian, it can do so only with its blue skull and by dashing. The common black skulls cannot break obsidian, so it is the best block to use. Build the base in an open area, so that you can hide behind it if needed. Make the only entrance to the base narrow enough so that the wither cannot enter it. Make it one block wide and two blocks tall, just enough for you to fit through. A narrower entrance may also prevent the wither from shooting you through the door. In case the wither fires a blue skull at your base, build at least three layers of obsidian for extra insurance.\nArmor setup.\nNotes:\nHit and run.\nSpawn the wither, and quickly run away as far as possible, putting a large distance between the player and the wither. Do not stand near the wither when it is growing into its normal size. It will create a massive explosion when it is finished, larger than that of TNT or a charged creeper. \nWhen it is finished, walk back and shoot at the wither, and occasionally use the Instant Health II splash potions and at some point, eat the golden apples. When the wither drops to 50% health, use the strength II potion and hit the wither with a diamond sword until the wither is defeated. This is a very effective way to beat the wither, defeating it in less than five minutes with not too much struggle.\n, you want to be careful once the wither drops down to half health; it makes a charged-creeper-like shield and summons 1-3 wither skeletons. You also want to avoid getting directly hit by skulls as much as possible as the &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment does not protect against &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28effect%29\"&gt;Wither (effect)&lt;/a&gt; making it much more deadly. \nEnchanted brute force.\nAn easy way of killing the wither on Hard difficulty without armor is to have an enchanted diamond sword (Smite V), a potion of Strength II, a potion of night vision (optional), an enchanted golden apple, a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, and a bucket of milk. Go underground at least 20 blocks below surface and dig a room 3 blocks high by 4 wide and 10 long, build a 2\u00d72 stone wall about 5 blocks away from one end. Drink a Strength II potion and spawn the wither at one end then hide behind the 2\u00d72 wall. When the wither is nearly spawned, eat an enchanted golden apple and switch the hotbar selection to sword and block with a shield for the initial explosion. Run at the wither and hack it to death; it should die in about 10 hits (20 hits for Bedrock Edition) if the player gets some critical hits. Make sure the player kills the wither within the 30 seconds of regeneration from the apple. As soon as the wither is dead, drink the milk to cure the wither effect.\nHave some cobblestone in your hotbar so the player can pillar upward if the wither gets out reach.\nYou can also bring to battle a power IV or V bow to attack it until it activates its wither armor.\nSnow golems.\nTo use snow golems most effectively to beat the wither, dig out a 10\u00d710\u00d73 tall room with walls from obsidian and spawn 30 or more snow golems. The golems act as a target for the wither, as well as knocking it back. Accompany this with the best sword, preferably with the Smite enchantment, armor, and potions, and the player can kill it in under a minute while taking little or no damage. Keep in mind that this will not work in the Nether, because the snow golems will melt.\nThis also does not seem to be an effective strategy in Bedrock Edition.\nDeep tunnel.\nA tactic that is relatively easy to pull off is to dig down near bedrock, and dig a long 1\u00d72 tunnel (longer than 30 blocks). At the end of the tunnel, construct a small room. Spawn the wither in this room, then run back into the tunnel. Occasionally pop out and shoot an arrow or two at the Wither. As the Wither crunches its way toward the player, just walk backward through the tunnel. Once the wither has reached its \"armor\" stage, jump out and begin hitting it with a diamond sword. As long as the player frequently throws down splash potions of instant healing, the player should be able to survive even with iron armor.\nA somewhat more complicated yet very enjoyable variant of this tunnel strategy is to rig the tunnel the player have constructed with &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. The player could, for instance, build a tunnel as illustrated by the figure above; the idea behind this is that the player can anticipate when the boss will crunch his way to a point sufficiently close to a pair of TNT blocks the player has placed, and if they are accurate, they can have the TNT explode at that very instant, dealing a lot of damage. Be sure not to place the first pair of TNT right next to the room in which the player will spawn the Wither, as the initial explosion would just destroy these. The drawbacks of this strategy are that it can be difficult to tell when to ignite the TNT; if the player is too fast, the TNT will not have the desired effect. If the player is too slow, the wither will simply destroy the TNT prior to its detonation. In addition, the player might need a lot of TNT to completely kill the Wither, and thus they will have to dig out a long tunnel. Therefore, it is strongly advised that the player to use a bow and a sword when the \"armor\" stage has been reached in the sections of the tunnel where there's no TNT to do the hard work. Also, if the player doesn't have enough TNT, be sure to dig out an extra tunnel as an extension of the TNT-triggered one, so as to finish the wither off with arrows or swords should needs be.\nBedrock suffocation.\nA very easy method is to spawn the wither, push its head in a &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; ceiling in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, then kill it. The player needs only an axe, lever, and piston.\nNote: This technique along with others in this wiki are shown in this video for Java 1.16\nThe best way to find this situation is getting to the top of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, but is dangerous as the Nether has random lava source blocks scattered in the netherrack. More information can be found in this video:\nAnother alternative is to use the end &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; to trap the wither: \nNote: More information can be found in this video:\nCobblestone generator suffocation.\nA more advanced tactic that is very rewarding would be to construct a cobblestone generator-powered grid above the player, spawn the Wither about 15 blocks away, and stand under the grid. The wither will fly toward the player, but it would be kept at the edge of the grid, constantly being pushed back by the cobblestone which is generating faster than what the wither can break. This allows the player to stand still and shoot the wither without retaliation, until the Wither is at half health, where it will fly toward the player through the grid, allowing the player to easily kill the Wither with a sword. In addition to that, the player can rig dispensers about 15 blocks away to periodically shoot splash potions of health, which heal the player and damage the wither. \nObsidian containment.\nIt is also possible to kill the wither by summoning it in a small obsidian chamber. When it escapes, have several people fire bows at it from all directions. This negates its explosion and forces it to attack one target at a time.\nBedrock ceiling containment.\nThis method is easy to pull off in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, where the withers can't be immobilized by pushing it into &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. It works by getting the wither up into an uneven bedrock ceiling, where it cannot hit the player, but they can hit the Wither. This method is much easier than a regular wither fight, and they can do it without potions or apples.\nTo pull this off, go to the Nether and dig up into &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; until they start seeing bedrock. The player want to be 2 levels down from the first layer that has bedrock blocks (Y level 121). Dig out a 3\u00d73\u00d73 room for the Wither to spawn in, as well as a 1-block wide 2-block high tunnel for them to hide in while waiting for the Wither to grow. A tunnel of about 40 blocks deep should do. Now, spawn the Wither in the 3\u00d73 room, and run into the tunnel until the player is 15 blocks away. After the explosion, it is likely that the Wither will be floating up into the uneven bedrock ceiling. The player should be able to get a vantage point where they can shoot it with arrows until it drops to half health. At this point, it is possible that the Wither may hit the player occasionally with a skull, but ideally it is trying to fire them through bedrock blocks and thus not able to get the player. If they get hit, retreat a little and heal. Most importantly, try to stay on the same level that they started out with, because if they have descent too far, the Wither will do so as well and there will be no more bedrock blocks to block the skulls it fires.\nOnce the wither has dropped to half health, try to get close enough such that the player can sneak in hits with a sword. Here too the Wither should be trying to fire directly at the player, with bedrock blocks between them and the Wither. Try to hit its tail. This will trigger an animation where the Wither won't shoot, and the tail ends up being in the same location again. They can hit it over and over until it's dead.\nNaturally generated Wither Killers.\nDuring world generation, after bedrock is generated, a pool of water is sometimes formed at bedrock level and removes large amounts of bedrock. This can form additional naturally generated wither killer locations, allowing a player to spawn a wither in a location with enough bedrock so that the wither suffocates.\nThese wither killer locations can be found manually by mining at bedrock level. They can also be found using analysis scripts, as explained in more detail in the following video.\nEnd city gateway suffocation.\nThis method allows for suffocation of Withers without actually using any weapons. It does require that the player have defeated the Ender Dragon, and have access to an outer End City island with an alternate way back to the main End Island. \nPreviously, the player could destroy the end gateway using a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;, but the player now needs to summon a non-trapped wither. In addition, the player no longer obtains the end gateway block.\nEnd portal suffocation.\nThis method utilizes the underside of the main end portal in the End to suffocate the wither. It requires that the player has killed the ender dragon.\nDig out a 5x5x2 hole underneath the bedrock of the end portal. Make sure to leave a staircase to exit easily. Replace the exact center 3x3 area 3 blocks underneath the bedrock with obsidian. This is very important, as if it is not the exact center of where the portal is, the wither can escape the portal and start blasting the endermen. Place soul sand on top of the center obsidian block, and place three more soul sand on any side of the obsidian. Place three wither skulls on the side of the 3 soul sand, and the wither will spawn. Run away to avoid the explosion. After the explosion, you can simply run back and hit the wither with your sword. The wither will be unable to hit you back.\nPlayer strategies.\nThese are strategies made by the community that are shared in this wiki:\nEventlesstew\u2019s Strategy.\nWhat you will need is the following items:\nWhen the wither is created, run away from it to avoid the explosion, then wait until the wither pursues you, then you can just sit where you are eating golden apples to stop the wither effect and your netherite armor can almost nullify wither damage as the skulls will damage the wither itself. If you want to make quicker work of it, then you can use a sword to kill the wither while it has a shield, you should hopefully be able to effortlessly kill the wither in 2 minutes.\nNoob Plays Games's Strategy.\nYou will need 64 iron blocks, 16 pumpkins, and a pickaxe (no armor or weapon needed)\nYou need to find a cave, preferably with a dead end, spawn lots of iron golems, then spawn the Wither inside of the iron golems. After that you need to run away as to not get killed by the explosions and wait, this method is pretty much risk free, but requires lots of iron. The Wither is killed in about 15 seconds using this method.\nCubeKat9555's option.\nYou will need at least enchanted iron armor, preferably diamond. A diamond or netherite sword. A bow, and a stack of arrows (unless you have infinity). A pickaxe for getting underground. And a shield for blocking attacks.\nTunnel down to where stone starts to give way to deepslate, tunnel at least 20 blocks from where you land and carve out a 6*6*6 chamber, here you will spawn the wither. Build the soulsand structure and place two of the skulls. Turn the difficulty to \"Easy\". Then place the last skull, when the wither is charging, run back to the end of the tunnel, if you cannot get far enough, use the shield to lessen the damage. After it explodes, move towards the wither until you see its tail. Shoot at the wither's tail with your bow as you maintain careful distance, move back in the tunnel if you can. When it has half health, charge at it with your sword and strafe hit so the skulls will not hit you. When the wither's last damage point is depleted, it will explode after several seconds. Move back into your tunnel to avoid this, possibly using your shield if you are too close. Gather the nether star and return above ground.\nSince this involves changing difficulty, this may be frowned upon or not possible on other players servers. But if you want a nether star on single player without much risk, especially on bedrock, or if you have no prior experience, then this is a considerable option.\nBee Strategy.\nNote: This strategy may only be feasible in Bedrock. In Java, it is extremely difficult or impossible for the bees to pack in close enough and attack fast enough to overcome the wither's regeneration abilities. In one test (playing Java 1.20.1 on easy difficulty), it required over 4,500 bees and about an hour (game running at 500-1000 MSPT the entire time) to defeat the wither while contained in a 30x30x30 enclosure of unbreakable bedrock (which would not be available in survival). In another test, nearly 5,000 bees failed to to kill the wither when it was able to move freely. "}

{"id": "15491", "revid": "50562575", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15491", "title": "Tutorials/Defense", "text": "Some of the best defense measures are those that prevent hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s from spawning entirely or at least prevent hostile mobs from ever getting close to the protected area or defense mechanism. As such, integral to all Minecraft defense systems:\nPassive Defenses.\nPassive defenses prevent hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s from entering the protected area without any input or sensory devices. The most common example is walls - they do not have to sense a mob coming or sense its position to prevent it from entering a walled off area. The following sections discuss various types of passive defenses, their construction, maintenance, and applicability.\nPassive defenses generally fall into one or more categories, sorted by their impact on an aggressive force. \nIt is important to note that each &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; type will treat each defense differently; for example, a ring of burning &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; does damage to most mobs but is not at all effective against &lt;a href=\"zombie%20pigmen\"&gt;zombie pigmen&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, a wall is an obstacle to a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;, but is only a delayer to a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; (and not a very effective one at that).\nWalls.\nWalls are simple vertical barriers and are the most common means of stopping &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; from entering an area. They can be constructed of just about any material, with varying advantages and disadvantages.\nThese are simple to make, just make sure to:\nMaterials.\n&lt;a href=\"Cobblestone\"&gt;Cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; are the most common materials for making walls, due to their abundance and ease of obtaining. Walls made in desert biomes may also be made of sand or sandstone.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; does not resist explosions well, it is suitable for most purposes. Both dirt and &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; walls are frequently used to surround \"first night\" shelters. \n&lt;a href=\"Cobblestone\"&gt;Cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; are the preferred materials for established miners. They have respectable blast resistance, while being plentiful. \n&lt;a href=\"Sandstone\"&gt;Sandstone&lt;/a&gt; is only marginally better than sand, and should be avoided except for aesthetic reasons.\n&lt;a href=\"Glass\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"iron%20bar\"&gt;iron bar&lt;/a&gt;s are useful as they can be seen through, revealing threats on the other side without exposure. These blocks can also be used to view &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; without attracting their aggression. However, these blocks are vulnerable to damage by &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; explosions. \nThe ultimate in wall construction without cheats or ops privileges is obsidian. When constructing, it is faster to position &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and cool them with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; than it is to cool a pool of lava and mine it. \nAlthough walls are not necessary in creative mode, an indestructible wall would be made mostly or entirely out of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Barrier\"&gt;Barrier&lt;/a&gt; blocks are useful when commands are allowed.\nIf the player spawns near a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, it is quite easy to make a wall of &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, provided the rules for cactus placement are followed. One cactus block will be required on each sand block, which will then grow to be 3 blocks tall, and damaging to mobs which run into it.\n&lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;Fence&lt;/a&gt;s are also good for a wall, as even though they appear to be 1 block tall, their collision box is 1.5 blocks tall, making it impossible for mobs to jump over them.\nWalls are not effective against &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, as they can move vertically. However, the addition of protrusions and overhangs on the wall will prevent the spiders from climbing further. A &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; as the center block of a wall also prevents spiders while providing no shade for &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undead mobs&lt;/a&gt;. Make this high enough for the fall to deal damage on the spider, unless if low on resources.\nLiquid Walls.\nLiquid walls are walls, which are coated on the outside with a layer of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. While they can allow &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s to enter the liquid and float over the top (undead mobs will sink), they can be used as a damage dealer by drowning or burning them. They can also prevent &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s and player-made TNT cannons outside the walls from breaking the wall, and water also prevents &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; from taking blocks out of the wall. While liquid walls are much harder to break than regular walls, though, it is still recommended to build an overhang structure to prevent climbing mobs.\nWalls on demand.\nThe following video shows how to make a large &lt;a href=\"cobblestone%20wall\"&gt;cobblestone wall&lt;/a&gt; semi-automatically, using &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;:\nYou can see more designs for similar defenses at &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Shelters%23Defense\"&gt;Tutorials/Shelters#Defense&lt;/a&gt;.\nCheap mob proof doorway.\nHere is a cheap mob proof door that can double as a mob trap. However, be careful when using this if you have pets, as it will kill any pets that are sitting.\nThis method doesn't work in versions 1.13 and later of Java Edition.\nPufferfish.\nDig a block two blocks deep, fill the bottom block with water, and insert a pufferfish into the water block. Fill the top block with the block of the surrounding or a block of your choice. Any mob (including the player) that comes over it will get poisoned by the pufferfish's defense.\nMoats and Ditches.\nThese obstacles, like walls, present a vertical barrier to incoming (and outgoing) &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s and players. The difference between a moat and a ditch is that a moat usually has &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom.\nDry ditches, like walls, should be at least three blocks tall on the inside edge, with an overhang or protrusions to prevent &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s from climbing them. They should also be at least three blocks wide at their narrowest point in order to prevent spiders from jumping over them. It is recommended that players leave a means of escaping the ditch to the outside (not the inside, which would defeat the purpose of a ditch), in the event that they are knocked into it by injuries, explosions or simple mistakes. \nMoats are constructed identically to ditches, but they are additionally filled with either &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, with the specific liquid depending on whether harming the mobs or obtaining their drops is required. A water-filled moat, if constructed correctly, can be built into a drowning tank to kill mobs. The down side to this is that a player needs to be nearby to lure mobs into the water, and the AI for mobs makes it hard to do this. On another note, water-filled moats will still slow mobs down allowing them to be easily picked off with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, after which the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; out and pick them up, or have water currents deliver them to a pick-up point. \nMoats can also be made so that water currents push mobs away; while this makes the moat ill-suited for drop collection, any mob which lands in it will be directed away from the wall, since mobs do not resist water currents, unless they are trying to attack the player.\nWith the introduction of the new water mechanics in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt;, moats can be mixed with magma blocks to create an effective mob killing system, as bottom of the &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt; will create whirlpool bubble columns that pull a mob to the bottom and then proceed to both pin them at the bottom and deal damage. If you wish to collect any drops created, use a hopper minecart on a powered rail one directly underneath the magma block to collect the drops and deposit them into a storage system.\nA &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;-filled moat, on the other hand, will kill any mobs in short order by itself, but also destroy any drops. Lava-moats have the additional benefit of producing light, stopping mobs from spawning nearby without torches. However, it can be laborious to collect large quantities of lava, which requires at minimum &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s and the discovery of a sizable source of lava. Structures over a lava moat (bridges, overhanging walls, etc.) should have &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s or a raised edge to stop players from falling or being knocked in. Lava should not be used where there are flammable blocks nearby, especially trees, &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; blocks, or &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; (among others).\n&lt;a href=\"Cobweb\"&gt;Cobweb&lt;/a&gt; ditches are more compact than regular ones. They are one block deep and one block wide ditches filled with cobwebs. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s get stuck in the cobwebs, immobilizing them to be killed. They can be easily jumped over. This ditch is useful for making a border for your safe area, the outside of which does not need lit up. Cobwebs are found in &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; library, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; rooms of &lt;a href=\"Woodland%20Mansion\"&gt;Woodland Mansion&lt;/a&gt;s, and zombie villages.\nNote: spiders and cave spiders can move freely in cobwebs without being stuck, also some mobs capable of ranged attack can still attack player even though they are stuck in a cobweb.\nFire.\nWalls and ditches of all types can be enhanced with burning &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. The base and/or top of walls can be lined with the burning block. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s running into the wall stand in the flames, while those that make it over the wall must pass through flames on the way. \nA ditch is easily enhanced in the same way, with the row of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; placed either before the ditch, so that burning mobs fall into the ditch and cannot escape (leaving drops to be collected later), or in the base of the ditch itself, where drops may be destroyed by the fire.\nTake note that by itself burning netherrack is not an effective barrier, as many mobs that have more health points can run through the flames and attack the player before burning to death. Combining &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; with netherrack is rather effective. Another option would be to put multiple rows of netherrack with fire, allowing mobs to burn for a longer period of time.\nMagma blocks also work, as it can hurt mobs that step on it plus fire will burn indefinitely on magma block, similar to netherrack.\nCactus.\nCreating a ditch filled with &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom can be deadly, as the cacti will deal damage and the rugged terrain will severely hinder any mobs that attempt to cross the ditch. A well-crafted cactus ditch can also double as a cactus farm or a cactus wall when the cacti grow.\nTNT.\n&lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; is a very effective way to kill mobs. Try making a field system in where blocks of TNT pop-up to deal area damage to only mobs. However, TNT is rather expensive to make, as although &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; is renewable, the only way to make sand renewable is to buy some from &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;, so when making this, it's recommended to have a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; nearby. However, one disadvantage is that TNT can quickly ruin the landscape unless it is exploded in water.\nMob Navigation Trick.\nInstead of a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, a useful trick is to make a 3 block high entrance, then cover the top and the bottom with any sort of &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;. The mob's navigation system tells them that they cannot go through the opening. Beware though, as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s can still shoot you and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s can still explode. Planting &lt;a href=\"vine\"&gt;vine&lt;/a&gt;s in front of the entrance will cut their vision. Bamboo can also do the same thing as slabs, while skeletons can still shoot through.\nLight.\nLight, in the form of evenly dispersed source blocks, should not be underestimated. Even without any physical defensive measures, a wide ring of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es prevents most hostile mobs from spawning. Additionally, if the area is large enough, their random wanderings will not bring them within attack range of the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nTorches are by far the most commonly used light source for this purpose. Moats of &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lantern\"&gt;lantern&lt;/a&gt; can also be used, though the scarcity of glowstone and sea lantern in singleplayer is a limiting factor, and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used to make jack-o-lanterns, are rather hard to find. Lava is sometimes problematic to use because it ignites flammable materials that are within four blocks.\nSoul sand.\nA ring of &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; can be a highly effective delaying mechanism, useful for keeping &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s within range of an active defense or just away from a structure. Keep in mind that a player could use the soul speed enchantment on their boots to go a lot faster. A strip three blocks wide is the minimum for an effective delayer.\nSoul sand also makes an excellent bottom for a ditch, although it is worth noting that soul sand also prevents zombies and skeletons from burning.\nWaterfall.\nWaterfalls are an effective way to protect your doorway as a last line of defense. By using an overhang, a player can run a waterfall down and over the entrance to their home. A one block deep ditch as wide as the waterfall will prevent the water from flowing in unwanted directions. If a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; walks into the waterfall, they will be pushed down into the ditch, effectively stopping them. Though the ditch can be made deeper, it is inadvisable since the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; may accidentally fall into the ditch themselves. The downward pressure of the waterfall will cause the player to swim upwards much more slowly than usual, so one block deep is recommended. To enter their home, a player must jump into the waterfall and keep moving forward. This will deposit the player safely on the other side of the waterfall.\nCovered Hole.\nA &lt;a href=\"Carpet\"&gt;Carpet&lt;/a&gt; on top of a &lt;a href=\"String\"&gt;String&lt;/a&gt; will be invisible to mobs; therefore, mining a hole deep enough to cause damage when you fall through and placing the &lt;a href=\"Carpet\"&gt;Carpet&lt;/a&gt; over it will stop mobs from pathfinding over. This is useful for mapmakers who want a hidden way to keep mobs from reaching certain areas.\nCombination Defenses.\nLike historical defensive formations, the most secure perimeters are based around multiple concentric systems used in synergistic combination. A classic example is a moat surrounding a walled compound - creatures which might reach and breach the wall (e.g., &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;) are delayed or killed before they can reach the wall by the moat (&lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;). \nAny and all of the aforementioned passive defensive measures can be used to make an area secure; the only limit is the amount of time the player is willing to put into it at the expense of other goals and the amount of space and time available.\nShelter Defenses.\nEvery shelter needs good defenses, and here are some tips to avoid trouble.\nExplosion resistant houses.\nExplosion resistant houses are fairly easy to build, and aren't extremely expensive. Use the \"Materials\" section above to assist you in choosing explosive resistant materials.\nTips.\nYou should have many windows, so as to be aware of any &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; around. Make sure to light your house and surrounding area well. It is suggested to have an automatic &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; and protect the surrounding area with a minefield, trap(s), or some sort of defense.\nTry making multiple panic rooms or bunkers, preferably for different situations (i.e. &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; in front of your house, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; stalking you etc.). Another good idea is to make an emergency exit- this is a deep hole with water at the bottom and some supplies; only use this in an emergency.\nAnother idea is make a way to get behind, under, or above a hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; around your house. This could include a tunnel, a water slide or even a roller coaster. However, this can be rather difficult to make.\nTry putting a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; filled with &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s in front of your door(s). This way, if there are dangerous mobs in front of your house, you can just press a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; and activate the dispenser. You could also use &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s and other blocks to block the entrance. However, this requires you to stay inside or make a second exit.\nSecurity.\nThis can come in handy if you have some security systems up. Here are some ideas:\nAn alarm can be very useful for security. Here's what you will need to make one:\nPlace &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s around an area you would like to protect, or your entrance(s); try to keep them separated as much as possible (optional). Then, attach the &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;(s) to the pressure plates with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; wire. From now on, whenever a mob or a player walks on a pressure plate, the note blocks will generate a sound notifying you. If you mine often, put a note block(s) in your &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; or along a &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; road.\n\u2022 A self-destruct system might be useful, to prevent others in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; from stealing your belongings. For this to work, the &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; has to be concealed in a wall, and there should be &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; (that is concealed) attached to a button to activate the TNT. It is also recommended that you have a blast-proof room where you store or hide in before you activate the self-destruct. The &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; should also be in this room.\n\u2022 If you have a lot of &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, then you can make the perfect defense. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s have 50 hearts and can kill most &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in 1-2 hits. Make sure to keep them near your house though; as they may wander away. To prevent this, put the iron golems inside of a trench surrounding your house. The trench should be 2 wide and at least 4 deep, otherwise the golems will fling mobs back out of the trench. An alternative is to leash them to a fence using &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s.\nYou could try &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s to defend your home entrance, but you would need a lot of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Another idea is to push the mob or player in a moat to it a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, activating a dispenser. It works better with multiple dispensers, all with &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, you could use &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s as flares. These can be used when you have a large perimeter wall and a few of your friends as sentries. The sentries can raise the alarm by firing the fireworks. You can also attach the fireworks to redstone circuits. However, note that fireworks are expensive to acquire.\nActive Defenses.\nMaterially Inexpensive.\nOverall.\nIf you have a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, this is a good way to kill &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (and perhaps players) that get within range is murder holes. Often incorrectly described as \"holes in the ground\", the actual term is a hole in a ceiling or gateway, in which defenders can fire at enemies. To make one, extend an overhang over your walls to 5-6 blocks outward. Be sure to add battlements. After you've done that, dig a 1-block hole in the floor every little bit, so no bit of ground is uncovered. You can optionally add &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s. Make sure to build it off the ground so that &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s cannot blow up while you are looking through a murder hole. This also adds to the overall safety, as you do not have to lean over the walls and subject yourself to &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; fire when you're sniping a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you make a pit with &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s and then &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on top of it, you can hold space to swim over it, where as mobs will fall.\nCreepers.\nA simple way to protect yourself against &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s (or any other 1x1x2 &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s) is a four &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; trap. Place four doors with \"left\" hinges around a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. Then, place a block above the pressure plate to prevent the mob from jumping free.\nAdding a waterfall layer around your wall will stop any explosions from damaging your wall.\n --\n |PP|\nZombies / Zombified Piglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s are well-known of being easy to deal with, and should only cause concern to the inexperienced player or in the presence of other mobs. Zombified Piglins, on the other hand, are peaceful by default and usually only serve as a nuisance within your Overworld base, but could become a problem in your Underworld (or &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;) base. Zombies can only break down wooden doors, and therefore the best defense against these mobs is always a passive defense. However, protecting your base can be done in multiple other ways which are more effective:\n 1 2 3 D=door T= Tunnel wall\n S S=sand W= Water\n S L= Lava\n TDT TDT WDL \n TDT WDT TDT\nSkeletons.\nSince &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s attack from a distance, the best defense is a good offense. You may need to try and out-range them with a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; trap, or simply just &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; to kill from a distance. Skeletons will only chase the player if within 16 blocks, so if you are further than 16 blocks from a skeleton, you should be able to kill it pretty easily with a bow and arrow.\nSpiders.\nA clever way to fight &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s is to dig a one wide two deep ditch. Spiders cannot pass through it, but players and another mobs that are 1x2, can. This way, you can simply hit the underbelly of the spider. Spiders also can climb walls, but adding an outcropping or overhang prevents them from getting over since they can't wall-climb on ceilings.\nSpider Jockeys.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider%20jockey\"&gt;Spider jockey&lt;/a&gt;s have the dangerous qualities of both &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s; they are fast, they can climb walls, and can shoot &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Therefore, the best course of action when you are facing one is to kill it off with arrows. Like when fighting skeletons, try to stay at least 16 blocks from the jockey.\nSlimes.\n&lt;a href=\"Slime\"&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn above ground during the day. Unfortunately, drowning traps are rather hard to make for slimes, because of the fact that they swim in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; instead of sink. However, slimes can be easily defeated using &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their melee only attack, they can also be defeated by sword easily. Tiny slimes will not hurt you, though they will push you around. &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; is also very effective against slimes, though it's also quite expensive.\nTo protect against them if they spawn underground, simply wait and see if any spawn. If they don't, you're fine. If not, try to find where in your mine they are spawning. It's recommended to block off cave systems and noting and cutting off slime chunks, if this happens.\nRemember, slimes are also able to spawn in lit up areas.\nGhasts.\nBuilding a base around your Portal in the Nether is essential to protect from ghasts. Keep in mind that ghast fireballs have low blast penetration, so many materials are ghast-proof (&lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; being the best known). This doesn't apply to &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; (which is extremely weak). It is traditional (due to Mojang suggesting it to players constantly on the Xbox version) to build a cobblestone room around the &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; to protect it. Also, since ghast fireballs can put out an unprotected portal, always bring a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; with you. Note that a ghast fireball can also relight an unlit portal, but only if the fireball itself lands in the frame (rather than with its area effect).\nPlayers.\n&lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt; turrets are one way to defend yourself against other players.\nThey consist of any number of dispensers attached to a rapid pulsar &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; alternater. Simply add a lever to the side of the pulsar, and switch it on or off at will. Make sure the &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s are loaded with something that will damage the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA good, fast machine gun requires one &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;, four &lt;a href=\"redstone%20block\"&gt;redstone block&lt;/a&gt;s, one &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;, and four &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s. Place the sticky piston horizontally and the slime block on the head. Take the redstone blocks and place them on the sides, top, and bottom of the slime block, but not the front. Then go one block forward and place your dispensers. Activating the piston causes a redstone update, causing the piston to go to and fro VERY quickly due to &lt;a href=\"quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity&lt;/a&gt;. It fires off a stack of ammo in less than a minute. Please note that you cannot turn it off, unless you keep it constantly on by placing a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; on the back.\nPlayers with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; can raid from the sky, making walls useless (unless it's seriously tall). This causes the need for air defenses. As of recent updates, &lt;a href=\"dispensers\"&gt;dispensers&lt;/a&gt; shoot &lt;a href=\"fireworks\"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt; in the direction they're facing, instead of just up. One can build a missile launcher this way, using the quasi-connectivity method stated above, or with a rapid pulsar. The fireworks will explode in the aerial attacker's face and hopefully kill them. However, flying attacks makes the defensive area a 3D space, so multiple launchers may be needed in multiple directions. Range can be altered with the firework's flight duration. This can be used for intimidation purposes rather than actually defending.\nThese will give any player trying to grief, or steal from, one of your structures, a nice shock. This turret is fully automatic, and as long as you have the arrows to support it, it will demolish anything in front of it. Fire charges can also be used if you have the resources. However, these are not recommended if your structure is made out of a flammable material, as it could set it on fire and burn it down. An easier (and lower resource cost) way to make the turrets more damaging is to put a lava curtain in front of them. This will set the arrows passing through on fire so they cause more damage.\nMaterially Expensive.\nThe following methods require more materials but are much more effective\nCreepers.\n&lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s have an explosion nearly as powerful as &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, so they can easily blow through a wall made of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;; if this happens, it can break a hole in the wall, so that other uninvited mobs can enter your protected area. The only true wall that will protect against creepers is a wall made of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, although the former can only be used on a multiplayer server with item spawning enabled, with a mod, or via creative mode. A self-repairing wall can also be created using a &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; generator. Place &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and air alternating and also place waters diagonal to the lava. Note that you have to have the lava as source blocks. See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Cobblestone farming&lt;/a&gt; for more information about different designs of cobblestone generators.\nZombies and Zombified Piglins.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s are difficult creatures to face when in a claustrophobic area, such as a cave. They can only attack when they are near you which gives you an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that you can take them from a distance and be safe. However, this method gives the zombified piglins an upper hand when there are multiple of either one and they surround you. This leaves you unable to escape. If building a defensive structure to prioritize against zombies, you should try and stay away from them, but in the case that you cannot make sure you have an open area both inside and outside of your defensive structure such as a courtyard, so that you have alternatives of escape. The best defense from piglins and the zombified versions of them is not to attack them. This is because unless you damage them somehow, they will not attack you.\nIf you have a supply of villagers, you can make an automatic zombie killing machine. There are many ways to do this but the cheapest and most compact is a 1x1, 3 deep pit. Put the villager in the pit, cover it with netherrack and ignite the netherrack. Zombies will walk towards the villager and get set on fire.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider%20jockey\"&gt;Spider jockey&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCreate a 1 (or more) block wide hole in your wall and shoot the &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; (or attack with your sword). When the spider gets killed, shoot the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. You can also try an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; trap instead of shooting them yourself.\nSlimes.\nYou may defend against &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s by simply creating a long 1 block wide, 2 block tall corridor as an entrance to a walled-off area. Place &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s loaded with &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s on the bottom row of each side, and any solid block on the top. The floor can be made with any material, but cover it with &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe said slime will travel through the corridor, and every time it lands on a pressure plate, it will be struck by two arrows, and if or when it splits, the process will simply repeat itself. To collect the drops, simply remove the pressure plates, stroll on through (reloading as you go if needed) and then when you are done, simply replace the pressure plates on the way out. to help prevent mobs entering while you do this, it may be useful to place a door at the entrance or exit in the wall, so you may close it when you are in the corridor and open it to begin the executions. This also works for most other &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that will fit through the corridor.\nGhasts.\nThere is no particularly expensive way to defend against &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Glass\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; (which ghasts cannot damage) will do just fine, but you could also use an expensive material like &lt;a href=\"iron%20block\"&gt;iron block&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. However, while &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s protect you from being noticed and fired on by ghasts, they are shattered in the event a stray fireball explodes near the panes. &lt;a href=\"Glass\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt; blocks, on the other hand, do not shatter even when hit directly. To fully ghast-proof a Nether fort, use only glass blocks, and use iron bars or &lt;a href=\"nether%20brick%20fence\"&gt;nether brick fence&lt;/a&gt;s for windows.\nGhasts are easy to kill if you can hit them or reflect their fireball at them. Two well-charged arrows or hits with an iron sword will take one down.\nEndermen.\nSince &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; can move blocks, but are hurt by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, make a moat instead of a wall. Also, it's better if it flows through a 1x1 block hole in your house, so you get the drops. However, note that endermen can teleport onto the other side of the moat, making this method not as effective.\nPlayers.\nA drawbridge is a very effective entrance mechanism for a multiplayer base. It works better if within faction land so that it can't be destroyed.\nPull the lever to open the drawbridge, not letting anything in; or close it so you and your faction can get out.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s can't jump the bridge, players will fall in the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s cannot cross it, unless it is left closed. So, it pretty much keeps everything out, as long as it is built on faction land.\nAnother effective trap against enemy players is sometimes known as the \"KILL\" land mine. Place an upwards-facing dispenser, filled with &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt; of Harming VII, surrounded by &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s. This is most effective if there is a ceiling above, so that the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can't run or walk out of range as easily. However, note that splash potion of Harming VII cannot be obtained without item spawning (in multiplayer) or mods. What you can do is use a lower Harming potion that is obtainable in survival, but it won't kill the player instantly.\nOne of the most cost-effective ways of base protection, especially against players, is camouflaging. Build your base under the ground or high up in the sky, so that it would be hard for players to find it.\nA more advanced defense mechanisms is to make a fake base to mislead players. See the following steps for how to make one:\nThough it is best on faction servers, cannons loaded with &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s are very fun to use and can do a lot of damage. Keep in mind that TNT will damage terrain, and that an incorrectly-built TNT cannon(s) may blow up your house. There are many designs of TNT cannons you can use. Plus, with &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, you can make them cheaper than ever.\nOptional features:\nLastly, if your real base is found as well, you do not want to be lost completely. That is why you should always have both a regular storage room as well as a secret one. In the regular one, put items such as &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, food, &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, and building blocks. You could also put a little &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; stuff to stop the attackers from getting suspicious. Then, also build a secret room, with sticky pistons and only open or closable from the inside of it, where you put your really valuable stuff (diamond armor, &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, diamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, enchanted &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.)\nNEVER allow any member of your faction (provided that you are playing on a faction server) to see this secret room unless you really trust and/or know them. This is because most of the PvP (player vs player) servers with griefing allowed are riddled with traitors and disloyal people who will take your valuables the moment you turn your back on them.\nA useful way to protect your valuable items can be found on &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Traps\"&gt;Tutorials/Traps&lt;/a&gt;.\nMob Defenses.\nMob defenses can be effective, when using the right mobs. The mobs you can use for this are &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s, tamed &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, or tamed &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, the fact that these do not affect the player (with the exception of an annoyed iron golem or wolves turning on you, if you manage to attack yourself) makes these defenses a little more useful.\nThe best way to use these is keep them in an enclosed space with a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; operable by &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;. If invading &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s get too close for comfort, you can flick the lever and release the golems to clear the area. Alternatively, you can simply leave them wandering free in a walled-off area.\nThe most efficient way to use &lt;a href=\"snow%20golems\"&gt;snow golems&lt;/a&gt; is in a one block wide tunnel. The snowballs from the golems cause no damage (except to &lt;a href=\"blazes\"&gt;blazes&lt;/a&gt;), but push mobs back. This can be used to push &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or something else that damages them, such as cactus. It can also simply be used to delay hostiles.\nPlacing snow golems in fenced-off \"watch towers\" may help protect you from hostile mobs as, the mobs will then attack the snow golems, and snow golems snow balls push away hostile mobs.\nWhen using snow golems, make sure you protect the golems from the &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; or they will die. Also, as mentioned on the &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; page, they will take damage in a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biome, so defenses utilizing them cannot be used in these biomes.\nFor more information on utilizing snow golems for defense, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Snow%20golems\"&gt;Tutorials/Snow golems&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe easiest way to use cats is to build a fence around them or just let it simply wander around a closed off area. This way, once a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; comes, the cat will scare the creeper away.\nTamed wolves will kill all hostile things except creepers. If they are in sit mode will not attack if chasing a skeleton. The skeleton will not fight back it will only run away. If you are too far away from your wolf it will teleport to you so keep it on a lead attached to a fence.\nTNT Defenses.\n&lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, although dangerous and lag intensive, is very effective when killing mobs. &lt;a href=\"Obsidian\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; or self repairing land is useful in an area of little or no use to minimize damage. If you use more than 1 TNT, most drops will also be destroyed.\nIt can be useful to place the TNT trap above sand or gravel so that a player will be trapped with the charge and a mob won't be able to wander away.\nTNT Cannons.\n&lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; cannons are one of the best weapons to use. These should be put outside your perimeter. Go to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/TNT%20Cannons\"&gt;Tutorials/TNT Cannons&lt;/a&gt; to find steps to build these.\nTNT Self Destructing Systems.\nWhen you are on &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; server, and you don't want your enemies taking your loot. To prevent this, you can make &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; SDS (Self Destruct System) under your base. You need the following to build SDS:\nTo make a TNT SDS, first dig 3 blocks under your base. Fill it with TNT on 3 blocks under your base. On top of the TNTs, put your normal blocks. On top of that, fill the 3rd floor with redstone. Now put repeaters on the 3rd floor (right-bottom of the real base's floor) and make a road to where you want activator be. Put a lever in the activating zone, and connect your SDS to the lever lever using redstone and repeaters. When your base is in danger and lots of enemies in your base, take as much loot of yours as you can and run. When you are near the Activating Zone, you can now pull the lever and kill all the enemies. One SDS looks like this: \nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nLand Mines.\nTo create a land mine, you'll need:\nTo make a landmine, you need to dig a two-block deep hole. At the bottom of this hole, place a single block of TNT. Next, place any block on top of the TNT. Lastly, place a pressure plate on top of the block that was placed on the TNT. Once an entity steps on the plate, the TNT will explode, thus causing damage to the entity and the terrain.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nTo prevent terrain or structures from being destroyed, place water on a side of the TNT. This trap will still damage mobs, but the surrounding blocks will not be destroyed. However, the trap won't be as effective. You can also put blocks that have tough blast resistance like &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; around TNT landmine.\nIf you want to make sure that the mob is killed in the explosion and that your base won't blow up, dig a deep hole (break the block NEXT to the one that you're standing on). Jump in, then replace the bottom block(s) with &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and pillar back up. Break the blocks again, and put a TNT block two blocks down, followed by a gravity affected block (either &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;). Finally, put a pressure plate on top.\nInstant Land Mine.\nRegular land mines take a couple seconds to detonate, allowing players to run away from the blast. You could always add more &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; to make the blast too big to run away from, but that is a lot more expensive than an instant land mine, which explodes as soon as a player touches the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; and can be made to do more damage than normally.\nTutorial\nYou will need the following to make one land mine:\nTo make it, dig a 1x1 hole 2 blocks deep where you want the mine the pressure plate to be located. At the bottom, put the powered rail on one of the blocks. Then, place the regular rail like this:\n[] = Normal blocks\n__ = Regular rail\n== = Powered rail\n = Pressure pla.\n __\n [][]==[][]\nPlace a minecart with TnT on the regular rail and push it off the ledge onto the powered rail. Repeat this with the other minecart(s) with TNT. Once you are done with that, remove the rail and a block next to the powered rail. The block you remove has to be one of the blocks that the powered rail is facing. When you are done, it will look like this:\n [][]== []\nNext, replace the block above the powered rail (and minecarts with TNT) and put the pressure plate on it. The finished product is this:\n [][][][][]\n [][][][][]\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; is pressed down, the powered rail will activate, moving the minecarts with TNT off the rail. They will then detonate, blowing the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; into the sky. If the explosion does not kill the player, the fall into the newly formed crater will kill them, or if it doesn't it will severely damage them.\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nDefense on the Move.\nIf stuck out on an expedition, always bring a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy quickly digging 3x3x3 cube into the ground, jumping in, and covering the top layer you've created a little burrow.\nAdd a torch and a bed and you've got a very quick home.\nA variation uses the giant &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s. All you need is &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt; and a mushroom and you can grow a pretty good shelter near instantly. Bring some blocks to fill out gaps (You should always carry some anyway) and maybe some &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s. Fill with &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and your home is finished.\nAnother option is to simply build a 1x2 wall around a space of any desired size, and add some torches and a bed. This is another way to have an instant, quick shelter. However, if you want visibility and have &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s with you, there is a variation. Make the wall, but only 1x1, and add slabs on top of the wall.\nIf you happen to be stuck in a dense forest and cannot make a wall shelter or hole easily, here are some tips on how to make a shelter. Either pillar jump or use &lt;a href=\"ladders\"&gt;ladders&lt;/a&gt; to get to the top of a tree. Then, make a platform on top of the tree. You can add walls if you don't have a bed, although it is recommended to have a bed. Once the platform is made, add torches (or a bed) and either wait or sleep the night away.\nTips &amp; Tricks.\n1#&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, even leather armor, is very helpful for defense and could potentially save a player's life. If you are going to hunt for &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, looking for &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s or underground &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;s, or just going for a nighttime stroll, armor will be very handy.\n2#Always have &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; with you, as a sword is your main source of offense. It's strongly recommended to have at least 2 swords, and swords can break fairly quickly.\n3#In the Nether, it is useful to carry a bow and a stack of arrows to defend yourself from &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s. Additionally, snowballs will deal points of damage to &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, making snowballs and snow golems useful in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;, assuming you kept the &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; alive using &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\n4#Make a hole on one side of your house that is 2 high and 1 wide. Leave the top block open, and for the bottom block, place a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; facing outwards, stacked with &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Place a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; directly in front of the dispenser, so that you can stand at your window at night, draw a monster's attention, and lure it onto the pressure plate. This will activate the dispenser and effectively kill the offending mob. One will regularly find &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s underneath. The arrows can be used to replenish your dispenser. Make sure your pressure plate is made of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, because otherwise, the drops of the dead mobs will keep activating the plate, causing the plate to be disabled for 5 minutes after every use, or until the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; picks the items up.\n5#Though many players like to use &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for its color and value, it is inadvisable to use gold in armor. It is only a little bit better than leather and is expensive to acquire. It's much more efficient to use iron.\n6#Placing a door from the outside is reliable for killing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s at your &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, such as zombie sieges. You can attack mobs from the outside without breaking or opening the door. However, if the door is placed from the inside, you will only open the door, instead of attacking mobs outside.\nInnovative Defenses.\nThese defense tactics are usually only used to impress others in multiplayer, but may also be used as an overly expensive way to secure a shelter. \nTrapdoor Floating Island.\nOn the surface, where you enter looks like a 5x5x4 block high house that floats, but on the inside, basically your main house is above the surface, your ditch would be one block out but 3 blocks down so that the basement of your float monstrosity can be a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; farm. It is 5x5 as &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s can jump, so you have 8 opportunities to escape from the spiders and have murder hole on the higher level to kill those spiders.\nTrapdoor Drawbridge.\nThis is a bridge that can be toggled to let the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; in and to keep hostiles out. You will need a standard ditch or moat, a half stack or so of any opaque block, and enough &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s to cross over your ditch twice. The blocks should be placed like so:\nT=trapdoor&lt;br&gt;B=opaque block\n&lt;br&gt;A=air\n&lt;br&gt;Layer 1\n&lt;br&gt;BBBB&lt;br&gt;TTTT&lt;br&gt;TTTT&lt;br&gt;BBBB\n&lt;br&gt;Layers 2 and 3\n&lt;br&gt;BBBB\n&lt;br&gt;AAAA&lt;br&gt;AAAA\n&lt;br&gt;BBBB\n&lt;br&gt;It's optional to add an overhang to defend from &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, to prevent &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s from walking on the side of the trapdoors, place blocks like &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s. This will make sure that the mobs go through the middle.\nLAYER 1\nLAYER 2\nLAYER 3\nJumping Puzzle Entrance.\nFor people who do rather well with jumping puzzles, implement a course that leads to your &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s can't solve jumping puzzles, so your house is safe.\nFloating Island.\nMake a floating island house and parkour on from a nearby mountain. This is highly inconvenient, but almost completely immune to &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; invasion. You must also make a separate shelter for a &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire Mine.\nPlace a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; facing upwards in the ground. Place a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; on the outside edge of the dispenser. Put a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; in the dispenser. Now, when something tries to walk past it, they will trigger the pressure plate. This will cause the dispenser to use the flint and steel, lighting the entity walking past it on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. The fire will go out shortly, but it will cause massive damage to most &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThis defense is best used as a ring around an area you want to defend. Anything steps on the line of pressure plates and it goes up in flames.\nAuto-Refilling Arrow Rapidfire Dispenser.\nPlace an observer. Put a dirt block on the input side of the observer. Put two dispensers, one on top of the observer, on the same level facing outwards in opposite directions. Connect the two dispensers with redstone and fill the one on top of the observer with one bucket of water and fill the other dispenser with arrows. \nNow connect the arrow dispenser to a redstone comparator which is the input of a redstone torch NOT circuit which then connects to a command block with the /replaceitem command, which finally replaces more arrows in the arrow dispenser. \nTo activate the contraption, break the dirt block. The dispenser will rapidly fire arrows in the corresponding direction until it runs out. When it does, the command block will automatically refill the dispenser with arrows. To deactivate the contraption, replace the dirt block in front of the observer.\nblast-proof stone wall.\nposition stairs so it looks like a wall from the outside, then water-log them.\nTroubleshooting.\nMost problems in your defense will likely stem from a poor light net around your base. Changing the &lt;a href=\"settings\"&gt;settings&lt;/a&gt; to the classic lighting engine can help you find holes in your light pattern.\nIn the end, a good defensive strategy is only as good as the people that run it. Remember a strategy requires discipline. If you plan on running out for a midnight stroll every night, then don't build a defense, it won't make you any safer."}

{"id": "94863", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=94863", "title": "Tutorials/Desert survival", "text": "The desert biome is one of the most difficult to survive and prosper in. If you spawn in a desert biome, you will most likely want to leave that area and relocate to a more hospitable and productive biome.\nFor basic survival steps, so that you can live long enough to attempt to explore your way out of the desert, refer to the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Survival%20in%20an%20infinite%20desert%23Immediate%20Survival\"&gt;Immediate Survival section&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Survival%20in%20an%20infinite%20desert\"&gt;this Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. That tutorial is about the voluntary challenge of playing in an endless desert, but the immediate survival tips apply equally to a player who has been unlucky enough to spawn in a desert, and just wants to survive and leave. However, if you are looking toward the challenge, then just keep on reading!\nWhere to Start.\nFirst of all, dig up a lot of sand to craft into sandstone, as that is the best material available for the moment. Focus on building a more secure house than you normally would, as it will take a long time to find enough wool for a bed. Prepare for the possibility of an emergency shelter on your first night. The two best are the Three-Down-One-Up and a jump pillar. Food may not be an issue if you can effectively hunt &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s. Otherwise, look for any naturally &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt; that may contain a chest. They may contain useful materials. Deadbush is quite a common item in desert biomes. Use them to craft sticks. Then, if you find a desert village and it has a blacksmith, check the loot. You might find some iron. If you find 3 ingots, craft a pickaxe and mine some stone later on. Then, load up on cooked rabbit and then you can go mine and proceed with your game.\nSetting Up Shop.\n&lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt; will not be available for a while. You may have possibly found dirt underground mining. Keep some of that. &lt;a href=\"Carrot\"&gt;Carrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es can be rarely dropped by &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. Desert temples generally contain &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, or you may find some mining. &lt;a href=\"Stick\"&gt;Stick&lt;/a&gt;s are dropped from &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es. This eliminates the tool issue. Once you have a steady supply of food, you can now focus on more challenging tasks.\nCombat.\nFighting mobs in the desert is a little challenging, as the lack of cover leaves you exposed to &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and other ranged attackers. The lack of cover counter-intuitively makes it easier to find a target, and kill it. &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s will be easy to kill in the open terrain. &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;s are good weapons in the flat, unhindered terrain. &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt;, one of the more important mobs to kill, will be difficult, due to the fact that flat areas will leave them plenty of room to teleport. If you have the wonderful liberty of being near a desert pool, jump in and attack him from the middle. Husks can also be a problem due to the fact that they give you food poisoning.\nFinishing the Game.\nOnce you have everything you need, you can go and complete the game. Once you locate the &lt;a href=\"End%20portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;, you can pretty much just beat it like any other game."}
{"id": "23964", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23964", "title": "Tutorials/Diamonds", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;s are one of the most sought-after items in Minecraft, due to their use in crafting diamond and netherite tools, weapons, and armor. Diamonds are also one of the rarest ores in Minecraft along with &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;. This makes diamonds extremely difficult to find and severely limits a player's supply of diamonds. This tutorial is intended to help players who want to obtain, maintain, and expand their diamond supply.\nObtaining diamonds.\nDiamonds can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt;, a rare find found in about ~0.0846% (~1 in 1200) of blocks in levels 5-16. Diamonds can be found anywhere beneath layer 16, but is most common in layers 5-12 in version 1.17.1 and below; in versions 1.18 and later they are expected to be most common between layers -50 to -64. Most players find it through caving or mining. Most advice seems to suggest using starting at -58 for 1.18 or later and 11 for earlier versions as your starting point.\nThe player needs an iron, diamond, or netherite pickaxe to mine diamonds (and any &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; they find, as well). Although it may be tempting to use stone tools for digging to save the durability of iron tools, remember that diamond ore does \"not\" drop diamonds when mined with a wood, stone, or gold pickaxe. Use an iron pickaxe (or better) at these low levels for anything that looks unusual. A pickaxe with the &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; enchantment increases the average number of diamonds obtained depending on the level, with Fortune III pickaxe harvesting an average of 2.2 (maximum 4) diamonds per ore.\nAn example of what a player should bring are:\nOptionally, you can also bring potions of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; just in case you accidentally expose yourself to lava.\nPlayers can use a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; to store lava or from nearby lava pools for some good &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, but if the bucket contains water, remember to store the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in a hole before starting the smelt. Water Buckets are also good for mining a lava pool.\nDiamonds can sometimes be found in naturally-generated chests and structures.\nBy spelunking.\nSpelunking (exploring &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s) takes less time and tool-usage than mining, but is more dangerous since there could be &lt;a href=\"monsters\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt; within.\nTo locate diamond ore by caving, simply explore any cave, either by locating surface entrances or digging and working down to level 15 or lower. , pressing (the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;) helps check depth. , there is a \"show coordinates\" game setting that doesn't count as a cheat. It is best to mine at level 11 or 12 because lava beds mainly spawn at level 10. A bucket of water can be useful to stop lava flows. For versions after &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.17.1\"&gt;1.17.1&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" and version &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.17.41\"&gt;1.17.41&lt;/a&gt; for \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", mining in Deepslate Level (starting from Y=8), especially very deep in the Caves (Y=-40 or deeper) have the best yield of Diamonds, but you must be careful since the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dark\"&gt;Deep Dark&lt;/a&gt; almost always generate at these levels. Avoid any &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor\"&gt;Sculk Sensors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Shrieker\"&gt;Sculk Shriekers&lt;/a&gt; (for versions after &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.18.2\"&gt;1.18.2&lt;/a&gt; for Java and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.18.32\"&gt;1.18.32&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.18.33\"&gt;1.18.33&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo Switch players) for Bedrock) as those can spawn the &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; after several activations of the Shrieker (made by generating noise picked up by the Sculk Sensors or throwing projectiles at the Shrieker). The Warden is a very strong mob that tracks you down with hearing and can bring even the best armored players to critical health, and can one shot you if you're at the stage of finding Diamonds this way.\nRavines and shafts can provide shortcuts to the depths; creating a waterfall can help players get down and back up safely. Finding underground &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pools is a good indication of the proper depth range, but may not be the best place to find diamonds. Lava may have replaced part of the ore pocket, leaving fewer diamonds to mine.\nIf a player does see diamond-ore blobs exposed near a lava pool, use a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; bucket to convert the surface of the pool into obsidian or cobblestone, then \"leave the area flooded\" while mining. That way, if there's more lava \"under\" the diamond ore, the water can quench it before the lava can destroy the newly mined diamond(s).\nIf no diamonds are revealed after spending some time searching, don't give up - diamonds are considered rare for good reason. Search for more caves at similar levels, or switch to the next method: mining or searching for village chests.\nBy Ocean.\nTo do this, the player must have many potions of water breathing and night vision. Oceans have many ravines which can contain many caves for searching and may contain diamonds at the bottom. It is a profitable way to find diamonds as many ores are already unearthed for you.\nBy TNT.\nBlowing up &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; is one of the fastest ways to mine, but it does require a player to kill a large number of creepers for &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt; and obtain lots of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;. Given a generous amount of TNT, a player can blow up one at a time, detonate a large clump, or place a block every five meters. TNT drops 100% of exploded items if game rule codice_1 is set to codice_2 (setting it to codice_3 will cause blocks drop randomly upon explosion). However, this game rule exists only in Java Edition, so this method is less viable and not recommended to use in Bedrock Edition.\nBy branch mining.\nBranch mining is safer and more reliable than caving but consumes more tool-crafting resources. It also generates a lot of spare &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, which, depending on the player, may be viewed as a downside or a benefit. It is advisable to use a silk touch pickaxe for stone as the stone items can be traded for emeralds. Players should prepare 6 or more &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s (pickaxe type dependent on current resources) before starting, carry a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;, full set of &lt;a href=\"iron%20armor\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt;, 3 stacks of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, an &lt;a href=\"iron%20sword\"&gt;iron sword&lt;/a&gt;, some quality food, a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; (for clearing dirt and gravel), a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; to block &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; arrows, and a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;. Players can use their bucket to store lava from nearby lava pools for some good smelting. Enchant equipment if possible, as even the weakest enchantments make a large difference.\nTo create a diamond mine, first, get down to the diamond layers. Besides following existing caves, players can just dig a vertical shaft, quarry, or staircase down to the diamond-containing layers (but remember the cardinal rule: don't dig straight down). Most players prefer level 11 because that puts the \"lava flood\" at foot level. Deeper tunnels are likely to expose lava at head level or from above, but at level 11, lava is likely to be exposed in the floor. This may block further progress, but probably won't flood down the tunnel, and a player cannot fall down a pit into the lava. For Bedrock edition, level 11 also has the biggest chance of finding diamonds. Once at the chosen level, begin &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Branch%20mining\"&gt;branch mining&lt;/a&gt; or mining long, level hallways two blocks high and one block wide. Sooner or later (often later), mining exposes a diamond ore blob. Sometimes, the player can find two or more diamond blobs intersecting together while branch mining. Remember that in 1.18+ level mining at level -59, right above bedrock, gives you good odds of getting diamond.\nAfter finding the first diamonds and graduating to enchanting, a player should make and carry one &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; III &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; to multiply the diamonds mined in the future. At this point, &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; the player's new diamond &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; with Fortune \"seems\" obvious; however, there is a better way: Enchant the diamond &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, and keep a separate &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; III &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; (which can be left home instead of risked on trips) for valuable ores. If possible, add &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; to the Fortune &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's likely for a mine to intersect several caves. Since any cave located while mining for diamonds is naturally at the right level for diamonds, it's a good idea to explore (and light) the cave before proceeding with the mine. A cave is likely to have hostile mobs inside.\nVillager trading.\nAlthough diamonds themselves are nonrenewable, diamond tools and armor can be renewably obtained via villager trading.\nThe following diamond items can be renewably obtained via villager trading:\nVideo tutorials.\nThis video shows how to find diamonds mathematically by looking for patches of similarly generated, but visible things.\nMining diamonds.\nUpon finding a block or blob of diamond ore, a player must mine it to get the diamond it contains. Before doing this, though, make sure the area is safe: after all, players don't want to lose any diamonds.\nFirst, if the player has located the diamond ore by caving, then the player should light up or block off any nearby dark areas to avoid getting blown up or shot while attempting to mine. Flood any lava nearby, turning it into obsidian (then go back and light up any areas which are now dark).\nNext, dig away all blocks touching the blob, both to expose the whole blob and to make sure the diamonds don't drop into lava and burn. Any lava found should be flooded with water. If this results in obsidian next to the diamonds that cannot be mined away, the area should be flooded and \"then\" the diamonds can be mined, to quench any newly-exposed lava while mining.\nNow that it's safe to mine, use an iron, diamond, or netherite &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; to break the blocks. The blocks drop one gem each, unless mined with a pickaxe enchanted with the &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Fortune III, the highest level, causes as many as four diamonds to drop, and on average doubles the yield of a diamond blob. Remember to dig around diamond blobs, as diamonds can form diagonally in the same blob.\nIf a player does not have a &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; but has a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, then the player can mine the block using a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe to obtain the &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt; can then be stored elsewhere until obtaining a &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe to mine the &lt;a href=\"diamond%20ore\"&gt;diamond ore&lt;/a&gt; with a higher yield.\nOnce in possession of diamonds, it's best to proceed directly to a safe place to stash them in a chest; this could be a home base or a secure mining outpost. Be careful to make the chest secure from attacks by creepers, or the precious new-found wealth could go up in smoke.\nUsing the diamonds.\nWith diamonds, a player can craft some of the best items the game has to offer:\nIn total to make one of every single diamond related item you need 38 diamonds.\nDiamond tools.\nDiamonds can be used to make &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;s that work almost as fast as gold and last significantly longer than almost any other tool. Most players use their first three diamonds to make a diamond pickaxe, the only tool in the game that can harvest &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; blocks, except for the extremely late-game &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Although a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20hoe\"&gt;diamond hoe&lt;/a&gt; lasts longer than any other hoe, with the exception of a &lt;a href=\"Hoe\"&gt;netherite hoe&lt;/a&gt;, it grants no speed boost and is generally considered a waste of diamonds, as any hoe is sufficient to till farmland. &lt;a href=\"Hoe\"&gt;Hoe&lt;/a&gt;s are more useful in the 1.16 nether update, as they are the quickest tools for breaking leaves, hay bales, sponges, and many other blocks. They can also receive &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;. So, the player might want to spend some diamonds on a diamond &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; or purchase one from a toolsmith.\nDiamond weapons and armor.\nDiamond &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s deal the second most damage of any sword - seven points - although both iron and diamond swords kill most enemies with 3 hits, making iron swords preferable to diamond swords which are not enchanted as they are cheaper and about just as useful. Diamond &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; protects the wearer better than any other armor aside from netherite. Diamond armor and swords both have the advantage of greater durability than armor and swords of any other material aside from netherite. A full set of diamond &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; requires 24 diamonds, and 9 diamonds more to make a full set of tools, which contains a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther diamond items.\nAfter making a diamond pickaxe, it is usual to mine some obsidian and use the next two diamonds for an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;. This allows players to convert &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; into valuable enchantments to improve weapons, armor, and tools.\nDiamonds are also required to make &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt;es, and can be used in decorative &lt;a href=\"diamond%20block\"&gt;diamond block&lt;/a&gt;s, though players would only want to make diamond blocks really late-game.\nAlso, diamond can be used to trade with villagers. One emerald can be obtained from one diamond, although this is a waste, unless a player has created a good trading farm and has lots of diamonds.\nMaintaining and expanding the supply.\nOnce players have realized how useful their first diamonds are, they probably want more. To this end, they need to continue mining. If they want to become truly diamond-rich, though, they need to do a few other things first.\nGetting a Fortune III pickaxe.\nThe player should mine with the &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on a pickaxe, preferably level III, for the next diamond blob, to significantly improve the number of diamonds they get. Also, this is not something they can rely on, but they can try. If they find a large diamond blob, they have an enchanting table, and are confident they can get a Fortune III, it might be worth waiting and acquiring the diamonds later or mining it with a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; pickaxe and harvesting the ore when they acquire Fortune III. If they see the hint on the table say Fortune III, immediately enchant a diamond pickaxe with it.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat complex, but here is how to bootstrap the equipment needed: Start with at least 5 diamonds. Use the first three for a diamond &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; to mine obsidian. Four obsidian blocks plus the other two diamonds and one &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; are used to craft an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, one needs a \"lot\" of books, but one is necessary to craft the table.\nObtaining books and bookshelves.\nFor the books, a player needs &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s, or even from &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. Leather can also be obtained by bartering with piglins in the Nether. The first book requires just one piece of leather and three pieces of paper (from three pieces of sugar cane), which can be obtained from a &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;cow farm&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Cane%23Farming\"&gt;sugar cane farm&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Crop%20farming\"&gt;wheat farm&lt;/a&gt; is useful for breeding the cows. To reach the maximum amount of enchanting, players need 46 leather, one for the book to craft the table and the rest for the bookshelves.\nIf the player can manage to get a tool with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, this can significantly reduce the difficulty of obtaining bookshelves. If they find a village, they often contain a house with a number of bookshelves. Bookshelves can also be found in stronghold libraries. If they have Silk Touch, they can simply steal the bookshelves whole. Even without Silk Touch, they can still get the books by mining the bookshelves but must provide wood to re-craft the bookshelves.\nAfter crafting the enchanting table, small enchantments are possible, but to get Fortune, let alone Fortune III \u2014 the table's power must be boosted with &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt;. 15 bookshelves are needed, requiring 45 books, in turn requiring 45 leather, 135 paper, and 90 planks, so having a tree farm is handy. See the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; article for details of how to arrange those.\nHigh Level Enchanting.\nIn order to get Fortune III on an iron or diamond pickaxe the player need to consume much experience points per attempt, so a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20farm\"&gt;mob farm&lt;/a&gt; is handy for accumulating XP. While advanced methods are possible, it's fairly easy to build the experience by simply camping at a suitably modified &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that other things give players experience too; between mining, breeding animals, and fishing, a player might well get to level 30 or higher by the time they've built a table. The player also needs a fair bit of &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, 3 pieces for the \"final\" attempt, and from 1 to 3 pieces for each try at resetting the enchanting table.\nAlternatively, a player can \"build\" a Fortune III pick on an anvil by combining two items with the more common lesser enchantment Fortune II. Fortune II can itself be obtained by combining two items with Fortune I, which can sometimes be found for sale from a Librarian. While this method costs more experience to obtain Fortune III than simply enchanting a pickaxe at level 30 and hoping for the best, it is more reliable with less risk and/or waste. Also, the Fortune I or II pickaxes can be used to obtain more coal, redstone, and lapis lazuli while waiting to level up again. However, due to the limitations on the number of times a tool can be worked on an anvil, combining Fortune I and II pickaxes leads to a Fortune III pickaxe with less overall longevity. A master or journeyman villager could sell the player an enchanted iron or diamond pickaxe with Fortune I or II though the chances of getting such\na pickaxe are low and could take a while.\nEven after all this building and grinding, it's by no means guaranteed to get the desired enchantment. If &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; is obtained instead, that can be used to collect diamond ore instead of gems. When a few diamonds (say, for a diamond sword) are required, the player can always place that many blocks and use another pickaxe to mine them, but save the rest of the ore for when a Fortune pickaxe is available.\nThe player can see the enchantment to be granted, and more enchantments may be granted on that pick, so if it says Fortune III, enchant it as soon as possible. Players don't need to worry if they don't have enough levels, the enchantment stays the same until it is used. Remember, the player needs thirty levels for a 30-level enchantment, but it costs only three. Choosing one of the lower tiers, it costs only 1 or 2 levels.\nIf the table doesn't offer any of the desired enchantments, the player must enchant \"something\" to get a new selection. If one of the enchantments on offer is halfway interesting (that is, it might be useful later), players might then enchant it onto an iron pick or a book. Alternatively, players can do a one-level (minimum) enchantment on a junk item like a wooden shovel. They can then use a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim some of the experience used for the enchantment.\nEventually, the player should have up to 3 main pickaxes, which can be created with a combination of enchanting table, enchanted books, and anvil:\nRepairing tools.\nRepairing two tools doesn't just add their durability up \u2014 it adds some extra uses as well (5% bonus for grindstone and 12% for anvils). That can help extend mining trips with non-enchanted tools. An &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; combines two identical equipment and their enchantments together, while doing it in a crafting menu loses all enchantments. (Durability also combined, enchanted or not) And depending on the target's enchantment level, it can get very expensive. An anvil can also repair equipment if so needed by sacrificing &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and equipment material. However, if a piece of equipment is repaired too many times with its material, it gets ridiculously expensive. To resolve this simply combine the target equipment with a piece of enchanted identical equipment, in which the enchant level should be as low as possible, in order to lower the experience needed. The dupe equipment could come from the player or from villager trading. A crafting-grid repair wipes enchantments, making way for a higher enchantment if the player needs it, but it is recommended to use a grindstone to gain some &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; back. Repairing armor on an anvil with regular diamonds also uses fewer diamonds, but costs experience.\nA more permanent, less experience intensive method of repairing tools is to use the &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; enchantment on a pickaxe to repair it with experience points, which can be gained from an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20grinder\"&gt;experience farm&lt;/a&gt;. A Mending enchantment can be applied to the pickaxe by acquiring a Mending book from trading, fishing, or by looting End City chests, which has a chance of containing a pickaxe already enchanted with Mending."}

After that, the method of breaking the podzol is up to you.\nThis method is very similar to the azalea method but with larger results and a different core strategy."}

{"id": "39571", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39571", "title": "Tutorials/Door-based iron golem farming", "text": "This tutorial describes iron golem farming as it works in the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; (and as it formerly worked prior to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;Java Edition 1.14&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.11\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.11&lt;/a&gt;). These farms are based on the number and arrangement of &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s and number of villagers, taking advantage of the fact that if a player creates enough \"houses,\" which can be made with just a door and a block, iron golems can spawn. This tutorial describes door-based farms. For iron golem farming , see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Iron golem farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nAn iron golem farm is commonly a player-made &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; (or several of them, spaced far enough apart to remain separate) in which golems are spawned and then either killed immediately, or moved to a holding cell (outside the village boundary, so that new ones can spawn in their place) for later killing. If you opt for the first method, you will either need to go AFK while camping out at the collection point, have a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; collecting your items, or else check back periodically to collect your items before they despawn. This necessity can be avoided by using the holding cell method, which allows the golems to collect while you are working nearby, and then you can harvest them all at once when you are ready so that you don't miss any drops. \nIf the farm is built inside the spawn chunk and fully automatic, it will operate at any time, making it highly efficient. Iron farms also work in Minecraft Bedrock Edition.\nGeneral requirements.\nIron golems spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s (natural or player-made), provided there are 10 &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s and at least 21 houses (counted as doors). The chance of spawning is 1 in 7000 per &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;, which averages around one every six minutes. \nThere are several approaches to building an iron farm, but efficient farms tend to use two floors in the golem-spawning zone (16 blocks\u00d76 blocks\u00d716 blocks) and keep all doors and villagers outside the zone, either above and below the center or in an outer \"ring\" on the same level. This is in order to maximize the number of available spaces for the golems to spawn in, which in turn will reduce the number of failed attempts, and keep the spawning rate as high as possible. This is much more effective than simply increasing the villager count to raise the golem cap, which only matters for the few seconds between the time when a golem spawns and when it is flushed out and killed. To further increase your output rate, you can build several separate iron farms as long as they are more than 64 blocks apart, and bring the golems or their drops to a central collection area. The most powerful iron farms are ones that overlap many villages. Since golems are immune to falling or drowning damage, the available killing methods are lava, magma blocks, suffocation, or a combination of these. As a more convoluted option, you can position a group of &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the golems in a holding chamber.\nOdds of a missed spawn occurring:\nThere are 512 valid spawn points in the 16\u00d76\u00d716 block spawn area. Making a farm with only \u00bd of the valid spawn points (256) does not reduce your chance of spawn by \u00bd. This is because the game randomly \"tries\" to find a valid place to put a golem 10 times each time an opportunity to spawn a golem comes up. So, your chances become 0.5 for each of the ten tries. Missing a spawn in this case is equivalent to flipping a coin ten times and have all ten come out tails. It is .5^10 or .00098 which is just about one in a thousand odds. A better suggestion would be to use some of the area of the zone to rapidly move golems out of the interference zone so they do not halt further spawning. This is a much more likely occurrence than missed spawns if the golems can't move out of the area quickly. This is not as rare of an occurrence as has been suggested.\nChances of a missed spawn are calculated as follows:\nSo with 256 valid spawn points you will miss 16.2% of the spawns whereas 512 valid spawn points will only result in a loss of 1.7%.\nAdditionally, console players should note the 50 villager spawn limit, which will make difficult, though not impossible, the full population of certain farm designs. Also, due to changes 4J Studios made to door detection and addition in the December 2015 update that brought MCCE to approximate parity with PC 1.8.8 no stacked or chained village iron farms from the PC community will work on console. Console players should avoid using anything but single village designs at this point. 4J Studios has remained silent as to whether or not the change was intentional or if they plan to fix it. All bug report tickets on MCCE bug tracker have gone unassigned.\nNo designs are guaranteed to work with modded servers including bukkit/spigot/paper/sponge/etc. due to possible changes in mechanics.\nIron golem farm designs.\nEasy 2-tier build.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 40\nScalable: yes\nDesigned by: trunkz\nThis is an older design by trunkz and one of the earliest to feature two spawning floors for greater efficiency. It uses several villager baskets and door pads and is a little outdated, but quite a good and efficient design for the time it takes to build.\nThis farm has been tested in Spigot 1.8. Extra care must be taken with breeding villagers as they no longer breed as easily as they did in earlier version. For testing in 1.8 the villagers were bred to a population of 20 on the ground before being transported to their cells (the individual villagers were transported to their cell by minecart, the other 18 went to their cell on a dirt ramp). The method given in the video will probably work if the breeding villagers are provided an ample supply of suitable food, e.g. carrots, potatoes or bread.\nSurvival mode build: Iron golem village.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 30-40, plus occasional loot from other mobs\nScalable: No\nDesign by: Amatulic\nThis is a simple but flexible design that can be built fairly easily in survival mode, without the need to transport villagers. The villagers can multiply and roam freely, allowing you to trade with them. The farm will occasionally capture other mobs and their loot. Multiple tiers can be built to target more golems or different mobs.\nYou will need to gather sufficient resources: enough wood to craft a bunch of doors and fencing, optionally enough sand to smelt 40 glass blocks, and some iron to craft a bucket. You may need wool to craft a bed to sleep on before you start, to move your spawn point to the village in case you die and respawn while you work \u2014 some of the work is best done at night while the villagers are indoors and not getting in your way.\nFind a village near a source of lava. Some villages have a blacksmith shop with a pool of lava, others have a lava source nearby.\nIf buildings in the village are missing any doors, give them doors, but keep the total under 21 for now. This encourages villagers to multiply and gives them a place to go at night while you work. Clear a flat 16\u00d716 area in the village; some villages have an empty quadrant that is useful for clearing. You can use existing building walls as boundaries for the 16\u00d716 area. Fence off the area, preferably at night after the villagers have scurried indoors, and install a gate to enter and exit the area. Villagers are curious; don't open the gate if villagers are near it, or they will go through.\nThe design is a 16\u00d716 pit 2 blocks below the base of the doors, with a 2\u00d72 hole in the middle, buildings on each side of the pit, and fencing all around. It doesn't matter how you design the buildings as long as the door arrangement is symmetric from the center of the hole. Each building shown here has at least 5 doors facing the pit. Doors on the edge of the pit should be barred from opening using glass blocks if the doors are against the edge of the pit. If the pit is completely fenced, the doors will be set back a block and need not be barred by glass. Also there are doors on other walls; placement doesn't matter as long as it's all symmetrical; an imaginary line from any door through the central hole should intersect another door an equal distance on the other side of the hole.\nIf your doors are on the pit's edge, then avoid placing the doors during the day! Otherwise villagers might fall into your pit. Place them and block them with glass before daylight. Once you have placed all your doors, destroy any remaining doors in other buildings that aren't part of the symmetry of the farm. Also destroy beds in any building that isn't part of your farm, and put them in your new buildings, preferably in a symmetric arrangement. Your buildings around the pit should have doors (symmetrically placed) on the side walls to allow villagers to use the buildings.\nBefore placing your doors, you should first complete the trap. To sweep the iron golems from the pit into the hole, it's best to cover the whole area with running water, otherwise the iron golems will try to stick to the dry spots. The design shown here has a 1 block undercut around the pit's edge, with water sources along two parallel sides, 2 water source blocks at the middle of the other two sides for the final sweep. This design uses &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Monster%20spawner%20traps%23Lava%20blade%20traps\"&gt;lava blades&lt;/a&gt; across the top and middle of a 2-wide by 3-high tunnel leading from the hole. At the bottom of the hole is a river that sweeps the mobs into the blades, and sweeps the loot toward the end of the tunnel.\nAt the end of the tunnel, build some access to the surface (shown in the first image on the lower right). Villagers are free to go in and out, but make a barrier in the tunnel to keep them from reaching the lava.\nYou don't need a hopper or chest at first \u2014 just watch your farm and when an iron golem falls through the hole, go into your tunnel and collect the iron that drifts toward you. After you have five iron ingots, you can craft a hopper and put it at the end of the water stream in the tunnel, to deposit the ingots into a chest.\n4 spawn modules 2-level.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 160\nScalable: yes\nDesign by: JL2579 (tutorial by docm77)\nThis design, originally created by JL2579, uses 4 spawning modules, with 2 modules per level, with doors surrounding the modules. This pattern could be repeated to fill a very large area with iron farms. The farm also features a lava system to damage the iron golems so that the piston suffocator works more quickly. Youtuber docm77 made this tutorial for the design.\nSimpler JL2579 design.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 30\nScalable: yes (you can build a second farm 80 blocks overhead to increase the spawning rates)\nDesign by: Nims\nThis design, by NimsTV, is less efficient than JL2579's design. However, it is much simpler and easier to build, because the water streams are easier to configure and there is only one villager basket. The golem spawning area is larger than the farm, which is why JL2579 did not build his farm in this way. You have to block spawning anywhere outside the farm, if you intend to build several duplicate farms in an array.\nThe Iron Stream.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 640\nScalable: no\nDesign by: Eta740\nThis design is a 16 Village Iron Farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. The village rebuild process takes 24 minutes and it will produce 640 ingots per hour when running at full speed. \nThe Iron Head, a 100% Efficient Iron Farm.\nRequires spawn chunks: no but you will get more regular iron if you do build them there\nIron per hour: 41+\nScalable: yes (you can build a second farm 65 blocks away from the village center). Possible to fit 36 within the spawn chunks (though not easily).\nDesign by: GruvaGuy\nThis is a single village iron farm designed by GruvaGuy in 1.9 using Golem spawn mechanics to achieve a 100% efficient iron farm. Very different to most designs and can be placed flush on the ground without any digging required. Though this is as efficient as possible it is also expensive in resources. The mechanics show in the video can be applied to most other iron farms. \nComet 107's 30 Village Iron Farm.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 1200\nScalable: No\nDesign by: Comet 107\nThis design is a 30 village iron farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. The village rebuild process takes just over 40 minutes and it will produce 1200 ingots per hour when running at full speed. \nThe Iron Casster.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 640-3800\nScalable: no\nDesign by: GruvaGuy\nThis design is an expandable 16-96 village iron farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. The village rebuild process takes up to 106 minutes for 96 villages and it will produce 3800 ingots per hour when running at full speed.\nComet 107's Double Stacking 168 Village Iron Farm.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 6700\nScalable: no\nDesign by: Comet 107\nThis design is a 168 village iron farm that can be rebuilt on demand if not built in the spawn chunks and the chunk it is in has been unloaded. This iron farm resets 2 villages at the same time giving it a faster reset speed than most other designs. The village rebuild process takes 96 minutes and it will produce 6700 ingots per hour when running at full speed.\nTutorial:\nThe Iron Bakery.\nRequires spawn chunks: yes\nIron per hour: 500 each layer with 10 rows of doors\nScalable: yes\nDesign by: Emonadeo\nA great advantage to this design is the customization. You can decide how big and efficient it gets by changing the number of the rings of doors and/or layers. It uses a similar door placement to the Iron Titan by Tango Tek. It is also efficient on smaller multiplayer servers.\nEmonadeo has since released a video on how to fix it for 1.9/1.10\nIron Processing Unit (IPU-128).\nDesign by: Panda\nThe most important part of any farm is its spawning floor, both in regards to maximising spawning area and the speed at which it can remove spawned entities to be replaced. In the following video, Panda describes a unique spawn floor design that drastically increases both of these. Combine this spawn floor with any of the other designs to improve its output. (Spawnpads still work in 1.8). \nIron Nucleus.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 1000+\nScalable: yes\nDesign by: SwoodyCraft\nThis design uses offset stacks of villages allowing players to compress a large number into a relatively small space (27 villages in less than 150 sq blocks). It is highly efficient and requires relatively low amount of resources to build. It does not require any redstone to build nor does it have to be built at spawn. The only limiting factor (as with any iron farm) is that it must be built at least 64 blocks from any other village. \nFlexible design.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 30 - 40 (depending on configuration)\nScalable: yes (As long as the second farm is constructed 70 blocks away)\nDesign by: MCinstructabuilds\nThis design is not as efficient as some other designs. However, it is simple to build and lends itself to variation and disguise. The spawning area for the golems is 16x16, but can be made smaller by digging 8 blocks down around the edges if desired. The doors are placed equally around the spawning area, but specific placement can be varied. It is this varied door placement that allows the farm to be easily camouflaged. MCinstructabuilds provides three example disguises, a fort, a town, and a mining camp / Furnace. Unlike other designs the villagers are not kept contained. The Farm can be constructed easily and at ground level.\nThe Iron Paradise.\nRequires spawn chunks: no\nIron per hour: 500+ (Depending on server lag)\nScalable: yes (64 blocks horizontally and 100 blocks vertically)\nDesign by: TheBurntPhoenix\nDescription: Although this design consists of multiple regular Iron Golem spawning platforms, the way that each of these spawning platforms is arranged makes the design as efficient as possible. This design is best suited for laggy multiplayer servers or servers that have the mobstack plugin. In TheBurntPhoenix's video, he has built a total of 12 spawning platforms separated into 3 layers, with 4 on each layer. Each platform on a single layer is 64 blocks away from each other, and is vertically 100 blocks away from each layer in order to optimize the rate that iron golems are spawned on slower servers. The bridges sends the newly spawned iron golems away from the spawning area, which allows more iron golems to be spawned without the issue of them being stacked together on servers with Mobstack. This way, the killing process will be much more efficient, allowing more iron to be obtained.\nTower design.\nThis design can be built in survival mode. It will yields 30-40 iron per hour. It's suggested to use one of the above for better efficiency with the same effort. \nTo build an iron golem farm, you should have a fair amount of resources, such as cobblestone and wood, as well as a way to get villagers into it.\nYou will need: \nTo build the Iron Golem farm you should:\nThis is how wide each of the holes in the wall should be: \nNow the top part is finished, the golems will spawn once there are 3 villagers in each of the holding cups.The next step is to build the golem grinder.\nSince villagers will turn into witches when struck by lightning (albeit it happens very rarely), it is sometimes needed to refill the villagers into the farm after a thunderstorm. But if the farm is not built inside the spawn chunk, you can just move away from the farm to let the chunk unload during a thunderstorm. Villagers bred inside the farm will also occasionally spawn outside of the containers."}

Instead, set your render distance to the lowest, go around 200 blocks away from spawn and then downgrade your world to a version after 1.8 but before the latest version (for example, 1.13-1.15). This is required so that the world shows up on the 1.8 world selection menu.

Items in your inventory and chests that don't exist yet will not appear, and blocks from newer versions will be replaced with air.

Dripstone is used to farm lava, and can also be used as fall damage traps for mob farms or for pranking, as it quadruples the amount of fall damage you take.\nManual farming.\nTo be able to manually farm dripstone, all you will need is some dripstone blocks, an equal amount of pointed dripstone and 2 water buckets. First you will need to place the amount of dripstone blocks you want dripstones to grow from, and water sources a layer above that. Now plant pointed dripstones on the dripstone blocks, and the farm is done. To harvest it, every 20 minutes or Minecraft day, check on the dripstone and harvest the second parts of the ones that are 2+ high and also the stalagmites on the floor.\nAutomatic farming.\nAutomating the farming process of dripstone is necessary for any large scale project including them, like a shop or trap in an SMP, or a big-scale lava farm.

{"id": "100984", "revid": "5290187", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=100984", "title": "Tutorials/Drowned farming", "text": "Drowned farming is a way to harvest &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s and loot dropped by both &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; mobs. In addition to explaining general mechanics of drowned farming, this tutorial describes two basic drowned farms that are easy to construct in &lt;a href=\"survival%20mode\"&gt;survival mode&lt;/a&gt;, without needing a villager as bait.\nIn all editions, the simple flooded-dungeon farm described first produces &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, gold and chainmail &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and weapons dropped by zombies, as well as &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"copper%20ingot\"&gt;copper ingot&lt;/a&gt;s dropped by drowned, but not nautilus shells or tridents. this farm also produces &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s, but not tridents.\nThe aerial farm (described second) produces \"only\" drowned drops including tridents, but not zombie drops. While the aerial farm doesn't require exotic materials, it does require large amounts of materials and is more time-consuming to build.\nMore complex farms are possible, particularly underwater farms for naturally-spawned drowned, which also yield tridents and nautilus shells. The simple survival-mode flooded-dungeon farm described here is still useful for gaining a quick and easy way to harvest experience and &lt;a href=\"Zombie%23Drops\"&gt;zombie drops&lt;/a&gt; without requiring significant construction or materials.\nMechanics.\nThere are three main ways to farm &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the Edition and which drops you desire most. In most cases, it's a good idea to kill the drowned manually to obtain the more valuable loot.\nFlooded dungeon.\nThe detailed instructions in this tutorial explain how to use a flooded &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; that converts &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;. This is the easiest method to implement in survival mode.\n, this farm produces the usual &lt;a href=\"Zombie%23Drops\"&gt;zombie drops&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; (XP), but it doesn't produce the &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s specific to drowned. In \"Bedrock Edition\", this farm does produce nautilus shells but not tridents (zombies converted to drowned no longer drop tridents as of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.16.0&lt;/a&gt;).\nA flooded dungeon works by spawning zombies from the &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; in the dungeon. The zombies are funneled into an underwater chamber where they drown. Once converted to drowned, the player can manually kill them for their loot and experience.\nThe advantage to the flooded dungeon farm is that it produces potentially valuable zombie drops, such as iron swords and shovels, chainmail armor, and gold armor \u2014 any of which may have valuable enchantments. The disadvantage is that it does not produce tridents in any edition, and does not produce nautilus shells in \"Java Edition\". However, it does produce &lt;a href=\"copper%20ingot\"&gt;copper ingot&lt;/a&gt;s in both editions, as well as &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s in Bedrock Edition.\nAerial.\nAn aerial farm is probably the most practical way to farm tridents. It works by spawning drowned naturally on an aerial platform at least 24 blocks above the player, with the player being beyond the maximum spawning range of any other spawnable surface in the world. The drowned spawn naturally under the correct conditions of being underwater at light level zero, and they are funneled first into an intermediate area to prevent lethal fall damage, before dropping into the killing chamber where the player waits. The farm described here takes advantage of a mechanic whereby a single layer of water causes an increasing reduction of light level with depth below that layer; the drowned spawn on a wet platform some distance under a glass-bottomed pool of water. , two layers of water may be needed for the platform to spawn drowned.\nThe disadvantage to the aerial farm is that it produces \"only\" drowned drops, but not zombie drops. As such, it is a good source of nautilus shells, tridents, and copper ingots, but \"not\" the valuable zombie drops such as enchanted items and armor made from iron or gold.\nUnderwater.\nAn underwater farm is another way to farm tridents. Drowned farms in a body of water are more complicated because they function similar to a dry-land mob farm.\nIn an underwater farm, naturally-spawned drowned are attracted to a location and funneled into one area where the player can kill them. A &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; is typically used as bait to attract drowned, and the funneling can be accomplished with &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s. Transporting a villager to an undersea room in survival mode is a complex undertaking that requires much forethought, preparation, implementation time, and risk.\nInstead of a villager, a &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt; might also work as bait, although this is less reliable because drowned don't detect eggs as they do villagers; they must first happen to look in the egg's direction, then have a clear path to the egg, and the egg must have sufficient space above to allow trampling on it.\nLike an aerial farm, an underwater farm does not produce zombie drops, only drowned drops.\nSurvival-mode build: Flooded dungeon.\nLocation.\nThe simplest way to start a survival-mode drowned and zombie farm is to locate a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; room that contains a zombie &lt;a href=\"mob%20spawner\"&gt;mob spawner&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally the room should be reasonably close to the overworld surface, but can be any depth that allows for digging 5 blocks or so underneath the floor. Sometimes a dungeon is found a short distance inside a cave entrance. Unlike an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Beating%20a%20challenge%20map%23Monster%20XP%20farm\"&gt;XP farm&lt;/a&gt; that generally requires a long falling distance from the dungeon to bring the mobs to near death, no deep excavation is required for a drowned farm.\nPreparation.\nTo construct a survival-mode drowned farm, you need a conveniently located &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; with a zombie &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a good weapon to clear out the dungeon, a cheap weapon to harvest drowned, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;, and a few &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s. Optionally, &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; blocks are helpful for viewing when a zombie becomes drowned. &lt;a href=\"Hopper\"&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt;s and a couple of &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s also aid collection but are not necessary.\nFor convenience, it is nice to have nearby (outside the dungeon room), a source of water to scoop with the bucket, gates or doors to keep mobs from wandering into your cave while you work, and a home base or temporary base with your bed, crafting table, and other helpful items a short walk away.\nConstruction.\nThe illustration on the right shows a side view of a basic survival-mode drowned farm, showing the dungeon above and the trap / collection room below.\nPrepare the dungeon.\nUpon locating a dungeon and breaking into it:\nTake note of the coordinate location of the center block along the wall with your opening. This floor block is in line with the mob spawner. In the last step, you flood the dungeon with water and dig a hole in this location for the mobs to fall through.\nAfter preparation, exit through your opening. Don't close it off yet.\nPrepare the trap.\nNext, underneath the dungeon, excavate the trap room. The room should be large enough to move around in, and contain the trap described below.\nAt the most basic level, the trap consists of a single water block that the zombie falls through from above, landing on a block (or a hopper) so the zombie's head remains in the water and drowns it. A sign on the wall holds up the bottom of the water block, and solid blocks enclose the water on all sides. The enclosing blocks may be glass to aid your identification of drowned zombies versus non-drowned zombies.\nWith a one-water-block trap, zombies just crowd into that one-block space, making it difficult to target the drowned zombies with your weapon. Allow the zombies to spread out as they drown by extending the trap to multiple blocks. In practice, a trap using a two-block water channel held up with two signs, with two landing blocks (or hoppers) below the channel, works sufficiently well. The illustration shows a design using a three-block water channel, three signs, and three hoppers.\nStart the farm.\nFinally, go back into the dungeon above.\nOperation.\nGo down into your collection room. As zombies fall into the water-trap channel, they wander back and forth across the tops of the hoppers with their heads in the water channel. After 30 seconds of having its head submerged, a zombie starts to drown, quivering visibly for 15 seconds, and then changes color. Its pants turn from blue to greenish. Its eyes, visible through the glass blocks, also change to a blue glow.\nThe legs of the mobs are exposed to you. With your cheap weapon, or even bare hands, whack at the legs of a drowned. Four hits with a stone sword can kill it. &lt;a href=\"Experience%20orb\"&gt;Experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s float toward you, and the drowned's possessions drop into the hoppers and end up in the chest (or if you didn't use hoppers, the drops come to you if you get close enough). Eventually &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"copper%20ingots\"&gt;copper ingots&lt;/a&gt;, armor (leather, gold, and chainmail, often &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;) appear in the collection chest along with &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; and miscellaneous other items.\nThe chest fills quickly because weapons and armor each occupy their own inventory slots. You may find it useful to have a garbage disposal hole in the ground somewhere in the room in which to throw unwanted items, which despawn after a few minutes in the hole. You can combine unenchanted armor and weapons in a grindstone to repair them, thereby saving space in your chest.\nBaby zombies occasionally spawn, but they don't drown because they're too short. Simply kill these when they appear. The slabs under the glass blocks prevent them from escaping, and also prevent them from attacking you (although they can still hit downward if you get too close). Zombie villagers also spawn occasionally, and can be killed immediately because they don't drown.\nTo bypass the mob cap, make sure that part of the drowning platform is outside the 9\u00d79\u00d79 volume (in \"Java Edition\") or the 16\u00d710\u00d716 volume (in Bedrock Edition) centered on the lower northwest corner of the spawner. This is easily accomplished by expanding the dungeon to 9\u00d79, lowering the floor two blocks below the spawner, and building the killing platform so that it extends away from the spawner. When a zombie or drowned wanders outside that volume, it is no longer counted in the mob cap and the spawner keeps producing more zombies. This way it is possible to have over 100 zombies and drowned crowded into your farm.\nIron, gold, and copper farming.\nIf you are in a situation where there isn't any way to build an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt; for iron (say you are playing an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Island%20survival\"&gt;island survival&lt;/a&gt; game and there is no village within thousands of blocks), or a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Zombified%20piglin%20farming\"&gt;gold farm&lt;/a&gt; for gold, you feel like you've mined out your area, and you no longer need drops from drowned, you can use a flooded dungeon farm to harvest iron and gold from the zombies, and copper from drowned. It's a slow but effective way to get iron and gold ingots. Gold ingots (mostly from gold armor smelted into nuggets) accumulate faster than iron ingots. The accumulation rate of copper ingots is in between gold and iron.\nThe flooded dungeon farm simply needs some minor modifications in your killing room:\nBring plenty of food, stock your furnace with fuel, craft a few stone swords, and do the following:\nYou can collect gold ingots rather quickly this way. Iron is much slower. With luck, you can collect enough iron nuggets to make about 5 ingots per hour. It's a grind, but depending on your situation, this may be a viable option to obtain iron. As a bonus, you accumulate a lot of experience while doing this.\nSurvival mode build: Aerial platform.\nAn aerial spawning platform offers a way to farm naturally-spawned drowned, which can drop tridents when killed by the player, and . Like the flooded dungeon above, the most basic survival-mode aerial drowned farm doesn't require exotic materials, but it requires a large quantity of common materials such as cobblestone, water, and glass. You'll also need some slabs, wooden buttons or signs to control water flow, as well as a hopper and a chest.\nThis farm relies on light attenuation by water to create sufficient darkness in a spawning room with flowing water to sweep the drowned into a killing area.\nComponents.\nThe main components of an aerial drowned farm are (from lowest to highest elevation):\nPreparation.\nBefore starting, you need to collect:\nBuilding from the bottom up.\nThe climbing tower is your access to the killing platform in the sky. In survival mode, building over the ocean offers safety in falling, unlike building over land. If you fall, you just have the inconvenience of climbing back up.\nThe most efficient way to start the tower over the ocean is to row a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; out to a deep spot with &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; growing near the water surface, allowing you to build from the top of the kelp without needing to build your tower all the way from the ocean floor, and without needing to swim. You can also put a &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt; on the water to start building from. Or, with a bit more materials and time, you can build a sea-level path from your land base out to your build location, and start building a tower out of any material, as high as you need. If you forget some materials, simply jump into the ocean and replenish. You can build a ladder up one side as you build the tower, or if you have enough material and time on your hands, your tower can be a staircase.\nThe first platform you build from this tower is the killing platform, and this is where you wait for the drowned to fall from above, so the minimum altitude must be out of the spawning range to the ocean floor or nearby land.\n, mobs spawn in the range of 24-44 blocks from the player. , mobs spawn in the range of 24-128 blocks from the player. Building over deep ocean far from land allows for somewhat lower altitude. The killing platform where you wait for the drowned must be more than the maximum spawning range from any possible spawning location on land or in the ocean.\nThe basic killing platform has:\nThe drop shaft is a vertical tunnel through which mobs fall onto the killing platform. The walls of the shaft need not be solid for the whole distance, it's enough to close off the sides of the shaft and leave 6 blocks of space open in the front, if you want to view the drowned falling. Drowned can drift while falling, so an open drop with no walls might prevent the drowned from falling onto the killing platform at the bottom.\nThe shaft doesn't have to be tall, but if you want to kill the drowned with one hit from your sword, ideally the drowned should fall 21 blocks before landing on the hopper in your killing platform. Make it too tall, and the drowned die from the fall, and you don't get any experience or tridents or other drops. If you make the shaft shorter, you just have to hit the drowned more times to kill them \u2014 up to four hits with a stone sword, which is also required from the flooded dungeon farm described above. One hit with a stone sword is sufficient to kill a mob that fell 21 blocks.\nThis is needed only if you are using the glass-roof darkness mechanic in Bedrock Edition.\nThis is a small room at the top of the drop shaft. The drowned fall into this room from the spawning platform above it. The purpose of this room is to create a measured distance for the drowned to fall, because the spawning platform is by necessity a lethal fall distance higher than the killing platform, and you don't want the drowned to die except by your own hand! So you must build a small platform covered with flowing water for the drowned to fall into safely, and be swept by the water into a 1\u00d71 hole in the corner of the room, which is the top of your drop shaft.\nOne water source block diagonally across from the exit hole is sufficient. Place a wooden button or a sign on the wall just above the hole to keep the water from flowing into it.\nThe water in the spawning platform must be at least 24 blocks from the killing platform, because mobs don't spawn nearer than 24 blocks from the player. Make it as large as you want. it can be as small as 2\u00d72 but larger means more drowned. Flowing water is used to sweep mobs into a hole. A small spawning room can sweep the mobs to a hole in the side or corner of the room. A large spawning room, say with at least a 16\u00d716 surface, would have water sweeping the mobs into a hole in the center.\nYour spawning platform should be completely covered with flowing water to sweep the drowned into the drop platform room below. Ideally the water should just reach the edge of the hole, but if water flows into the hole, you can stop the flow with a sign or button. Your drop room below the spawn chamber should be configured so that drowned are swept into the drop shaft.\nThe walls around the spawning platform should be tall enough to provide sufficient darkness on the spawning floor. In Bedrock Edition, it should be 8 or 9 blocks tall to guarantee sufficient darkness on the floor after the transparent roof is in place. In \"Java Edition\", you will need the wall to be at least 9 blocks high to accommodate a layer of signs and several layers of water (17 layers of water guarantees total darkness on the spawn surface). Place slabs on the top of the wall to prevent mobs from spawning on it.\nOne layer above the flowing water on the spawn platform floor, you need a layer of signs covering the area, to hold up columns of water above.\nOn top of the signs, place 18 or more layers of water to make the light level zero at the bottom. Drowned spawn in this water and drop through the signs onto the spawn platform. The deeper you make it, the more opportunities drowned have to spawn, especially in the daytime during which the top 17 layers of water are not dark enough for spawning drowned.\nThis alternative requires a layer of glass blocks and only one layer of water, instead of several layers of water. It works only in Bedrock Edition.\nMake the ceiling completely from glass blocks, with at least six blocks between the floor and bottom of the glass. 1 block of stone wall (excluding the slabs on the top edge of the wall) should extend above the top of the glass, to form a shallow pool that you must fill completely with water source blocks (no flowing water). You can build a temporary infinite water source off to the side to work with as you fill the pool.\nUsing a glass-bottomed pool for the ceiling takes advantage of the fact that drowned spawn under water but not on transparent surfaces, so they end up spawning on the platform under the glass. The water attenuates the sky light by 2, and each block of space under the glass causes further attenuation. One needs at 13 blocks of space (including the glass) under the water for the light level to be zero on the platform to let drowned spawn during the daytime. Drowned also cannot spawn on bottom slabs, but using bottom slabs instead of glass for the bottom of the pool makes the farm inoperable. The bottom of the pool must be glass.\nOperation.\nThe farm becomes operational as soon as the glass-bottomed pool is filled and you descend to the killing platform. Whack at the drowned legs with your sword (or your fist), and start collecting loot and experience. Fish also spawn in this farm and mostly swim upstream avoiding the fall, but once in a while they fall through and die. This does not affect drowned spawning, but expect to see an occasional raw cod or salmon appear in your chest.\nTo increase the farm performance, stand on your killing platform and clear all the hostile mobs from the world by temporarily switching the game to peaceful difficulty and then back. Then the only available location where mobs can spawn is your spawning platform. Switching the difficulty to \"hard\" yields better loot in the collection chest.\nImprovements.\nThe aerial farm described here is slow, although it does produce tridents and nautilus shells. This is the most basic farm, needing only basic materials that are readily available in survival mode.\nOne reason for the slow yield is due to the mob cap. For example, , only five naturally spawned drowned can exist at any given time. The drowned try to resist the water flow in the spawn platform; therefore they spend much time facing upstream inside the platform before eventually falling through the hole.\nTo speed things up, the drowned need to face the hole. One way to do accomplish this is to find a turtle egg. Unfortunately, once you find a turtle egg, retrieving it requires a pickaxe enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, which may not be available easily in survival. If you can get a turtle egg, your spawning platform should have a 3\u00d73 hole in the center with a block suspended in the middle, connected to the edge of the hole by trapdoors in the open position so that drowned are fooled into thinking they can pathfind to the egg to trample on it. Instead, they fall through the trapdoors. The turtle egg doesn't hatch unless it's on sand. Drowned are not automatically attracted to turtle eggs; they must happen to look in the right direction first, but once a drowned sees it and can find a path to it, the drowned goes for it and falls through the hole.\nThe best bait is a villager, but in a survival build, it is impractical to transport a villager high in the sky to the spawn platform. Also, if playing an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Island%20survival\"&gt;island survival&lt;/a&gt; game with few resources, there may not be any villages available to poach. This gets into more exotic farms. The purpose of this tutorial is to teach the basics of drowned farming in survival mode.\nTo bypass the mob cap and dramatically increase the production rate, you can have the drowned be swept into a Nether portal, so the drowned disappear from the Overworld and drop onto a killing platform in the Nether. This works fine if you are the only player in the world, but if there are other players in the Nether, they need to be within the despawning radius of the killing platform to prevent the drowned from despawning in the Nether.\nComplex variations.\nThe basic flooded-dungeon drowned farm described in this tutorial is quick and simple to construct in survival mode. It isn't automatic, however. It requires your involvement to harvest items from the drowned. While it doesn't yield tridents (and doesn't yield nautilus shells ), that farm is still useful for a survival-mode zombie loot farm to get &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, tools, armor, and weapons with occasional interesting enchantments, as well as other items \u2014 without needing to build a deep falling pit or a tall structure in the sky.\nDrowned farms on the ocean floor are more complicated because they function similarly to a mob farm, capturing naturally-spawned drowned. First, the drowned should be attracted to one location. Once they are attracted, they need to be funneled into one area where the player can easily kill them. The attracting is often done with villager bait and the funneling is often accomplished with bubble columns.\nFancier variations.\nSome farms incorporate innovative ideas such as bubble-column elevators to bring items to surface level, and devices to sort items. The player can circumvent the hostile mob cap (but not the maxEntityCramming gamerule) by pushing the attracted drowned into the Nether dimension. If the Nether dimension is unusable for this purpose, then the bubble columns can transport the drowned up to the player's AFK spot, typically high in the sky.\nYouTube examples.\n\"Java Edition\".\nA river biome converted to an aerial drowned farm (1.17 and lower):\nA river biome converted to an aerial drowned farm that takes advantage of terrain generation changes (1.18+):\nThis river biome farm uses a flying machine to place over a million water blocks quickly. The depicted method of harvesting the drowned from this farm, however, is dangerous in survival as it involves swimming after trident-throwing drowned in a crowd of other drowned.\nBasic underwater farm:\nAdvanced river farm (fastest design):\nThis design relies on the &lt;a href=\"Zombie%23Reinforcements\"&gt;zombie reinforcement&lt;/a&gt; mechanic to allow new zombies to spawn regardless of the mob cap, and converts the zombies into drowned. It does not yield any tridents, but allows for the farming of copper at rates much higher than natural spawning-based drowned farms.\nA slightly easier design:\nBedrock Edition.\nThe user can also go fully AFK during the use of this Overworld only farm.\nThe following farm utilizes Nether Portals to increase the spawn rate of Drowned, thus increasing the rates of this farm. AFK can only persist for a short period as the Drowned teleported to the Nether might cause serious lag."}

{"id": "75359", "revid": "54957964", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=75359", "title": "Tutorials/Dual wielding", "text": "This tutorial will help you become familiar with &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;ing, a mechanic added in the &lt;a href=\"Combat%20Update\"&gt;Combat Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that dual-wielding in Bedrock Edition is much more limited. Most items cannot be put into the off-hand slot.\nMain hand &amp; Off-hand.\nBefore we begin the tutorial, it is important to recognize these two terms: main hand and off-hand. By default, the main hand is the player's right hand. Respectively, the player's off-hand is their left hand. Keep in mind that there is an option located in &lt;a href=\"Options%23Skin%20Customization\"&gt;Skin Customization&lt;/a&gt; labeled \"Main Hand\" to swap the main hand and off-hand. This option may be helpful for players that are left-handed.\nWhat is it?\n is when you hold two &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, one in each hand, during &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that dual wielding is not widely practiced in real life, it is used in various action and role-playing games, and is generally designed to provide the player more effectiveness or convenience in battle. Dual wielding in \"Minecraft\" can be used in combat, but it also can be used in other everyday activities, such as building, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;eating&lt;/a&gt;. It does have a few major limits, but learning through them and applying dual wielding to practical use can give players a large boost in productivity and a greater advantage above other players in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat in-game.\nHow to equip something to your off-hand.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, there is a slot in the bottom-right side of the player avatar that looks like an outline of a shield. This is called the off-hand, hand slot. When you put something in it, you should see it being held on your off-hand (your left hand on default). Your other hand should also appear on the screen in first person view (you should see two hands on the screen). You should also see an extra slot with the off-hand item appear beside your &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; hotbar; this should be on the opposite side of your main hand.\nFor easy equipping to the off-hand slot, press by default in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;. This is configurable in the &lt;a href=\"Controls\"&gt;Controls&lt;/a&gt; settings. Using this, you can quickly equip something into your off-hand slot in your inventory and switch between the items in your hotbar and off-hand.\nHow the off-hand is used.\nThe off-hand can the item it holds when there are no items in the main hand, or the item held on the main hand is not usable, e.g. swords and pickaxes.\n&lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s that are held on the off-hand take priority over arrows in any other slot when you shoot a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to fire a specific arrow by selecting it using your off-hand. Conveniently, you can do vice-versa and hold the bow on the off-hand with arrows selected on your main hand. This also allows you to fire a specific arrow by selecting it using your main hand.\nIf you have a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s, though, you can put the latter in the off-hand slot and (even if you have normal arrows) fire just that.\nLimitations.\nThough putting two weapons into your main and offhand is pretty useless as stated, the Mending effect is still used, meaning you can grind XP and repair tools.\nPlayers cannot use both hands at the same time, and there is always a slight delay between using the main hand and off-hand. Thus you cannot instantly perform two actions together, such as placing and breaking blocks simultaneously or shooting two bows at once.\n\"The main hand always takes priority when trying to an item.\" For example, if you had stone in your main hand and dirt in your off-hand, you will always place the stone. The item in the off-hand will only be used if the item in the main hand lacks a use, or if it's holding nothing. If the item in the main hand cannot be used due to certain circumstances, then the off-hand is used. For example, if you have a block equipped on the main hand and a snowball on the off-hand, face anywhere you cannot reach a block (e.g. into the sky), and then press , the snowball will be thrown instead of placing the block. This is because the block cannot be placed anywhere, and so your off-hand is used instead.\nThe main hand is also the only hand that can or , even if there are no items in the main hand. This means that items in the off-hand lose their left-click function, making most weapons and tools unusable in the off-hand, with the exception of ones that have a function.\nWeapons that can be used on the off-hand in Java Edition:\nTools that can be used on the off-hand in Java Edition:\nTools that can be used on the off-hand in Bedrock Edition:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nautilus%20Shell\"&gt;Nautilus Shell&lt;/a&gt; can also be put in the off-hand slot in Bedrock Edition. This is most likely a bug and serves no purpose.\nSummary.\nFinal note.\nDual wielding is a useful addition to the game with many applications. It is entirely optional for players whether or not they want to utilize dual wielding; players can completely ignore the off-hand slot and, with few exceptions aside, continue to play like it was before 1.9. Some players who use dual wielding may experience efficiency and relief, but others may just experience more setbacks. Some may only use dual wielding to its minimal extent. Ultimately it is up to each player and their own style of playing to employ this mechanic into their gameplay.\nUses.\nBelow is a list of practical dual wielding uses."}

{"id": "17670", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17670", "title": "Tutorials/Egg farming", "text": "Egg farming is the process of collecting a large number of &lt;a href=\"Egg\"&gt;chicken egg&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s. From an automated source of eggs, a &lt;a href=\"%23chicken%20farm\"&gt;chicken farm&lt;/a&gt; which produces additional end products like &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"cooked%20chicken\"&gt;cooked chicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt; can be constructed with the addition of egg-dispensing and chicken-killing systems.\nThe chicken is the most farmable animal in Minecraft. Unlike &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, it does not require any food to grow up or to reproduce. No matter where the chicken is kept, everything just happens automatically. In addition, cooked chicken is almost as good as other cooked meats for restoring hunger.\nCatching or hatching a chicken.\nIn general, you'll want to first build a pen to hold them. Single-height wooden &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s (or a small cave) will suffice, but either way it's best to add an \"entry lock\": a fenced space with &lt;a href=\"Fence%20Gate\"&gt;gates&lt;/a&gt; leading both to the pen and to outside. This will help prevent escapees - if one of the gates is always closed, the chickens' pathfinding will never see an escape route to the outside.\nThe usual way to capture chickens is to hold &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; of any kind, which will make any chickens nearby follow you across the landscape and right into the pen. Alternatively, if you already have &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, you can use &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s to drag them along; this will mostly keep them from wandering away. You will need a separate lead for each chicken. With care, chickens can even be led across water, as they will follow your &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother option is to collect &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;s and throw the eggs into your closed pen. There is only a 1 in 8 chance of spawning a chicken when you throw an Egg, so you should try to collect at least one stack. They will take some time to grow to adulthood but once you have at least one adult chicken it will start producing eggs and with two or more adults you can breed them with any seeds. Each adult chicken will lay an average of 8 eggs per hour.\nWhen hatching large numbers of chickens, a good rule of thumb is that the chickens will need well over a real-time hour to replace the eggs used to hatch them. Nights skipped in a bed do \"not\" count toward this time, and the &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;(s) containing the chicken must remain loaded (that is, near a player or in the spawn chunks). This also assumes you are collecting all the eggs -- remember, loose items like eggs despawn after 5 minutes.\nSetting up the farm.\nYou can farm chicken eggs the traditional way, where you have to run around and collect chicken eggs all the time.\nAlternatively, you can follow one of the tutorials below, to create a farm that channels eggs to a single point. Most such will do the same for chicken meat, feathers, and even experience orbs as well.\n3x3x4 Automatic Farm.\nThis is a minimal egg farm consisting of 8 blocks, a hopper and chest: it's incredibly efficient in versions prior to 1.11, when it could house hundreds of chickens in an 1x1 area. Since version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.11\"&gt;Java Edition 1.11&lt;/a&gt;'s introduction of the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"Commands/gamerule\"&gt;gamerule&lt;/a&gt;, the number has reduced to 24. Check your servers settings on cramming before settling on this farm solution (this is not a problem on bedrock edition). Alternatively, you can place a single vines block in the space that the chickens occupy, and they will not suffer from entity cramming damage.\nThe opening at the top can either be used as a one-way entrance or simply sealed. Bait a chicken in or throw some eggs at the interior walls to start the system.\nBuilding up.\nThis system may be extended with a larger living area with all hoppers eventually pointing to one that goes to a chest. At a certain point, the system becomes prone to mob spawns, and slabs can be laid over hoppers to deter mobs spawning. (Hoppers can fetch dropped eggs through a slab.) As using many hoppers becomes too expensive, water flow is used instead of the initial collection in the following version.\n11x11x6 Automatic farm.\nThe hopper egg farm is a relatively simple contraption, which does not require access to &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;: On the main floor, chickens are contained by water while they grow and lay eggs, which also wash the eggs into a hopper; from there the eggs go back into the system's supply chest. This chest feeds an automatic hatcher, which can refill the main floor after a harvest. The hatcher is controlled through a despawn timer, which prevents the system from spawning chickens \"ad infinitum\" (or at least until the server crashes).\nThis farm will be surrounded on the surface by an 11\u00d711 fence or wall, with doors or gates at or near the middle of a side. There is a pillar and (at least a) partial roof in the center, and an \"egg room\" dug 3 blocks deep beneath that. The egg room and its pillar can be adapted to other farm layouts. You will also want a tunnel leading to the egg room, with space to get at the chest and other devices to retrieve meat and feathers), and the switches to trigger or disable the hatcher. The chickens are contained primarily by water, so the farm partly resists any problems with chickens walking through walls and fences. The schematics are below. The gold and stone-brick blocks represent \"any full block\", but the blocks shown as gold must also be &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt;, while stone-brick blocks can be opaque, transparent, or in some cases air.\n \nBuilding it.\nOnce the walls are set up, it is easiest to build the egg room from above. Make sure to offset the room so the input hopper is in the center of the floor, and light the egg room properly. When orienting the room, think about where you want the access tunnel to go. As shown, an access corridor leading to the lower left of the diagram allows getting at all the containers and both switches.\nThe hatcher consists of two droppers facing up, with a dispenser facing up on top of them. These are fed by the hoppers, with the chest providing extra storage, and driven by a 3-clock. The clock is on the right edge of the diagram, from the block with the lever southwards and downwards. That lever lets you disable the hatcher completely\u2014place it and turn it on as soon as the clock is built, so you can build the rest without clicking noises.\nThe despawn timer (upper edge of diagram) is a dropper facing down over pressure plate. It works by dropping an item onto the pressure plate, which will turn off the torch and enable the clock until the item despawns. The block in front of the pressure plate helps avoid accidentally picking up the item as you pass near, but if you go close enough you can still pick it up and cut off the timer. Once you've built and connected the despawn timer, you can turn the lever back off, as the inactive timer will keep the clock disabled. The despawn timer's dropper can be loaded with any disposable item, such as surplus seeds or eggs. The block in front of the pressure plate is just to make it a little harder to accidentally pick up the item\u2014glass will let you see if the item is on target, or has missed the pressure plate.\nOnce the egg room is built and closed over, continue with the central pillar: Above the hopper, place a top slab, then two blocks above that. You can make the lower one a jack-o-lantern, for simple lighting. From the top block of the pillar, extend a roof out over the dispenser and at least one square around it in every direction. Put a torch on the roof to avoid unfortunate monster spawns. Note that if you use slabs, you may get chicks on top of the roof. If you have the minimum roof, they'll just fall into the water, but if you want to extend the roof to the edges, use non-&lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; blocks to avoid escapees.\nNote that the dispenser is purposely separated from the collection hopper/central pillar, to allow for the dispenser's variable aim. The slab (or other transparent block) between them is only needed if you add the optional chest, but if you do, an opaque block there will prevent the chest from being opened. Note that as of version 1.14, you can place the optional chest without connecting it to the main chest. It will still feed into the egger, but may be useful for stashing extra eggs, especially when you are about to harvest and want space in the main chest for feathers and meat.\nLast of all, place buckets of water in each corner; they will flow to the central pillar. Load up your chest with eggs and/or lead in some chickens, and just hit the button. Then let the eggs accumulate until you have enough for a full run (at least a dozen stacks in the chest). (If you are starting with just a few chickens and/or eggs, an early run with just a few stacks can get you a few more chickens to fill the system more quickly.) If you have \"many\" eggs, you might want to do a longer run by disabling the despawn timer (add a lever to the block for its output torch), or just do a second run immediately when the first finishes.\nIf you have glowstone and nether quartz, you can optionally add a couple of top slabs on level one, next to the hoppers. Atop these you'll want a comparator facing out from the main chest, and next to it something to provide a comparison signal of 8. This corresponds to 13 stacks in the chest, which is enough for a full run. A cake with three slices eaten will do fine. You can then run a redstone trail from the comparator to a redstone lamp. Embedding the lamp in the ground near the entrance can let you reach it with 8 or less dust; any further, and you'll need a repeater in there too. This is not shown in the schematic, because without it this build does not need Nether materials.\nRunning the farm.\nThe clock is normally disabled by either the inactive timer, or by the lever, either of which will disable the clock. With the clock disabled, the incoming eggs will fill first the bottom dropper, then the bottom hoppers, then the chest, and finally the intake hopper. This gives a total of 52 stacks storage, or 79 with the optional second chest. \nNow, 79 stacks of eggs would produce an average of 163 chickens, which may be enough to seriously lag the game when you are nearby. Worse, they will take over 15 minutes to feed through, because the hoppers are slower than the clock. If you leave the hatcher running much longer than that, the first chickens will grow up and start laying eggs! At that point, you'll be facing , limited only by the speed of the hoppers. If the hatcher is left running after the first generation grows up, the system will be producing 2.6 chickens a minute at first, but if the game doesn't crash, it will eventually peak at 18 per minute, 363 per game day. In such numbers, the chickens will overflow any enclosure, and the huge numbers will cause the game to lag badly. However, if you don't mind risking \"Chickmageddon\", you can skip the despawn timer forming the top two rows of the egg room. In more recent versions of \"Minecraft\", the crowding will eventually cause chickens to start suffocating, but for this design that may not be enough to prevent problems.\nThis despawn timer and inverter will enable the clock for 5 minutes only, letting you hatch 500 eggs at a time (about 31 stacks, producing an average of 64 chickens). There is a bit of a trick here: Since the clock has a period of 0.6 seconds, 300 seconds gets you 500 cycles, but the clock and dispenser are faster than the hoppers feeding the dispenser. The hoppers alone could deliver less than 375 eggs to the dispenser, but the eggs in the bottom dropper give just enough of a head start to cover a batch of 500. As noted above, the chickens will need a bit over a real-time hour to replenish the eggs used; if you don't want to wait for that, you can harvest the chickens as soon as they're mature, then run the egger again and let the second batch refill the chests while you do other things.\nJoghurts Design.\nJust dig a square hole 11 by 11 blocks and one block deep, then dig one more layer in a circle shape. You'll need an additional one-block-hole in the center where the water and the eggs will flush out.\nNow you need to build the \u201cisle\" to prevent the chicken from also being flushed out and to give them some ground to lay eggs that can hatch to slowly expand the total population of chickens on your farm.\nConnect the center drain hole to your system from below, place water in the corners, and you're good to go.\nTrench Farm.\nThe \"14 Second Compact Egg Farm\" is a farm designed by Minecraftmaximizer for the Minecraft 1.5 release which takes only 14 seconds to build. It costs 8 logs of wood, 10 ingots of iron, two arbitrary blocks, and an optional ladder. It is essentially the 3x3x4 farm put in a pit.\nThis farm is begun by digging a hole 3 deep, by 4 long, by one wide hole. The chests and hoppers are placed on the bottom (a double chest on one side, two hoppers feeding into it on the other). The ladder can go over the chests. Two blocks then go over the hopper next to the chest, to keep the chickens in place. Then you can hatch chickens over the exposed hopper, and eventually collect eggs from the chest.\nBecause it has a volume of only twelve blocks, this farm is one of the most compact farms possible, especially with the inclusion of hoppers. A video demonstrating it and a schematic:\nWater Egg farms.\nMost current egg farms have the chickens supported by water, with their eggs falling through the water into a collection area below. The water can be supported by signs or ladders, which will keep it from flowing into the collection area.\nFor a fairly space efficient design, build walls around a 2x2x2 column. The bottom two spaces are the collection area (make sure to leave a door), and the upper of those has 4 signs to support the water. The next two layers are a water pool with no flow, especially not downwards. It's probably best to make the whole pool of source blocks. The chickens will go in and above the water\u2014there should be a 1 or 2 tall gap above the water for the chickens to breathe in. The walls around and above the water should be glass blocks, to keep the chickens from suffocating each other against the walls.\nAfter this is constructed, eggs can be thrown directly up from the collection area. The chickens will float on the water and their eggs will drop to the floor for easy collection, where they can be thrown back to hatch more chickens. When meat or feathers are needed, a sword can be used to pick off chickens from below. A water flow can be placed in the collection area to bring the eggs to one block, but this makes throwing eggs and collecting meat or feathers more difficult.\nThe static water of the design above lets some eggs get stuck on signs. Expanding the pool area (the \"Flowing Egg Farm\") allows a water current to gather eggs to the center, and the inward flowing current helps prevent chickens from \"phasing\" through the walls, allowing far more chickens to be kept. This design can be \"squared off\", flowing to a central 2x2 hole, or it can simply be extended horizontally, perhaps with another water current carrying eggs down the \"collection corridor\". It need not be the full 18 blocks wide, either, as long as the collection area is under where the currents meet.\nAnother large egg farm:\nRealistic Chicken Coop.\nPut a &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt; on top of each &lt;a href=\"Hopper\"&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt;. Each coop can house 6 &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;s. You can also switch the &lt;a href=\"oak%20wood%20planks\"&gt;oak wood planks&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; for a nicer look depending on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; or just your choice.\nChicken farming and cooking.\nA chicken farm produces chicken products including &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cooked%20chicken\"&gt;cooked chicken&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s. Generally speaking, such farms combine a source of eggs, a dispenser to generate chickens, and a killing mechanism to obtain the loot from the mature chickens.\nExtending the 3\u00d73\u00d74 farm.\nA simple modification with the egg/feather hopper can be a dropper/hopper path pointing back to an egg dispenser under &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt; pulses. As the dispenser creates chicks by re-throwing the eggs into the chicken area, a closed cycle for generating more and more eggs and chickens form. If left unmanaged, it's likely that the game would lag with a huge number of chickens, possibly before the maxEntityCramming gamerule kicks in.\nA block of water laid on top of the air block controlled by air, controlled by a dispenser with a bucket can be used as a \"kill switch\" for obtaining cooked chicken. The down-flowing water stops the chickens from swimming up, and a top lid made of trapdoor would guarantee suffocation. Replace the block of water with a block of lava to get a cooked-chicken farm.\nFiltering out immature chicks.\nTo filter out immature chicks which produce no loot, lay a block of lower-half slab over the hopper. This slab would stop water or lava from invading, while still allowing taller, grown-up chicken to suffocate or burn.\nFull automation.\nAn obvious first modification of the full automation step is replacing the kill-switch mechanism with a mostly persistent source of death. Therefore, one should use the slab construction to wait for the immature ones to grow. However, this is not enough as this system kills mature chicken instantly and provides no chance of replenishing the egg supply.\nThe fix involves adding another dedicated egg farm. Just replace the input for the closed-cycle egg dispenser with a collecting hopper of an independent, normal egg farm, and you are ready to go. You may use a large chest to equally divide eggs produced from the extra farm for egg collection and chicken farming. You can control the generation rate by controlling the egg input. The point of the farm is that adult chicken in an egg farm will provide an endless supply of eggs. We can send these eggs to a dispenser in another farm where they get killed and turned into meat.\nExample farm with 1/2 of the egg output used for making lava-roasted chicken:\nDispensers are connected to &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTiming: a baby chicken takes 20 minutes to grow up; a chicken 5\u201310 minutes to lay an egg; an egg has some 1/8 chance to spawn a baby chicken. Some redstone controls on the egg-feeding hopper can be used to limit the amount of eggs put into the system in each cycle."}

{"id": "32256", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=32256", "title": "Tutorials/Elevators", "text": "This page lists ideas for elevators. An elevator, or lift, in Minecraft is a vertical transport system for carrying &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, and items between the floors of a structure. Some simpler designs require the player to walk or swim, while in other more complex designs, the player can be transported hundreds of blocks higher with just the click of a button or the flick of a lever.\nThis page deals with contraptions; however, it is worth noting that recent game versions offer considerable competition from basic blocks and plants: &lt;a href=\"Ladder\"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt;s can be placed along the side of a column; regular, crimson, or twisted &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt; can be seeded on the side, bottom, or top of a block and grow from there. Underwater or underground, &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s provide an even faster option. They do require a column of source blocks, but planting &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; can turn falling water into water sources easily. A simple fall can be cushioned by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, or a brush with &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;S, or any other blocks that would break your fall.\nPiston elevator.\nThere are many designs of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; elevators. They all essentially use pistons to move the players either up or down.\nTNT cannon.\nThis extremely fast elevator uses gravity and water to compress primed &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; into a small area, creating a powerful explosion force. It is hard to use effectively in that TNT is expensive and hard to produce in large quantities, and is dangerous in Survival. \nMulti-floor elevator.\nThese elevators can ascend and descend and can stop and start at desired floors, but can be complicated and require more resources. These elevators often use characteristics of other designs and apply multi-floor circuitry to make them. They can be practical but can take a very long while to make, and not that useful. Have patience when creating this strenuous build.\nUp and down elevator.\nThe up and down elevator has a maximum height of 12 units due to the limited amount of blocks a piston can move. This design is also relatively slow, but thanks to its small form factor and simple &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuits\"&gt;redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt; this can be suited for buildings.\nThis elevator provides an unlimited blocks piston-elevator but is a bit more complicated.\nFast.\nFast piston elevators are quicker than more traditional ways of gaining height, like &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"powered%20minecart\"&gt;powered minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. They are designed to be practical.\nZipper.\nZipper elevators feature pairs of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s stacked vertically. The &lt;a href=\"stair\"&gt;stair&lt;/a&gt;s version can be open on two opposite sides and is useful for giving views above ground. The no-stair version can be open only on one side. They have one major drawback, as multiplayer can cause a malfunction in the timing and cause the elevator to cease function. Also, adding a 1\u00d72 piston on the top to push you onto a platform once you have reached the top to prevent the player from falling back down can be beneficial.\nSpiral.\nSpiral elevators feature a vertically stacked spiral of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. Since the pistons and wiring surround the player while they ascend, this type is not good for giving a clear view. However, they are more suitable for multiplayer, as they do not transport the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; as quickly and so are less likely to trap the player due to lag. \nModerate.\nThese elevators operate at a moderate and practical speed. They are designed to provide a more realistic appearance and operation than most other elevators.\nPiston-worm.\nPiston-worm designs use a set of alternating pistons to push the player or a carriage up and down a shaft. Often these designs are very resource-friendly and simple to build.\nSlime block flying machine elevator.\nFlying machine designs are fast, efficient and resemble a real-life elevator. They use a two-way vertical flying machine to carry the player up or down. They are special due to their capability to carry many players and mobs at once and their safety.\nBedrock compatible design:\nSlow.\nThese piston elevators are slower than more traditional ways of gaining height, like &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s and powered &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. While not practical, they are designed with style in mind.\nSingle column elevator.\nSingle column elevators made to reach the top quicker are usually short due to their need for complex &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; wiring methods. It can be simplified by using &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; as a floor and pistons to push sand. However, this elevator is much slower.\nSlime block elevators.\n&lt;a href=\"Slime%20block\"&gt;Slime block&lt;/a&gt; elevators come in two main forms, bouncing and conveyor style. These elevators are very fast and range from simple to difficult to build. They use characteristics of the slime block to move the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nConveyor.\nThis design uses a mechanic that moves slime blocks up and down in a conveyor belt fashion moving a platform that the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; stands on. You can view the 3D schematic for this elevator &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mineprints.net/creations/344-slime-block-2x2-conveyer-elevator\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nMulti-floor.\nUsing the conveyor method it is possible to create a very fast multi-floor elevator.\nBouncing.\nThese elevators bounce the player up a series of slime blocks.\nWater elevators.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; is very useful in elevators as they can carry players up and down, and can transport all mobs but undead mobs upward.\nTube design.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20Update\"&gt;Aquatic Update&lt;/a&gt;, these elevators are much faster and safer because the player can now swim much faster in water that flows down. It is advised to create multiple of these in a stairway if you want multiple levels as it may be hard to leave the elevator through a midway exit.\nAny solid blocks are suitable for making this. You can also use &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; to make it cool!\nWaterfall.\nA simple waterfall can be ridden up, or slow a fall to a safe speed. Make a waterfall by placing a source in a one-block gap in a floor, or on a ledge in a box that keeps the flow in a single block space on the way down. If possible make a one-block hole at the bottom of the waterfall to keep the water from spreading out over the floor. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; pouring out from the landing site keeps &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s back allowing for a safer landing in occupied territory.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is rising or falling, a careful motion should be used to move until one is far enough out of the vertical stream that air is available, one can tell because the breath meter disappears. Then, there is no limit on how far up or down one can go in the water. It is also possible to stay centered in the stream but moves sideways far enough that the breath meter is reset once in a while. This, of course, needs careful movement control.\nMobs that fall into the stream ride down safely, but they cannot rise in one of these.\nA temporary waterfall can be used to make a safe ride down from any height. If one places a water source close to, or at, the edge of a long fall the water stream needs to be left flowing for only a few seconds to be safe to ride down. One can use the empty &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; to pick the source back up and then immediately walk off the edge in the stream to be carried over the edge and then ride it safely down. This also makes a safe landing site even in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, but be aware that as soon as one lands on the obsidian that one has to move counter to the flow or risk being carried to the edge of the stream into the lava.\nJava breathable water elevator.\nA basic water elevator that works well in survival mode can be made in any vertical shaft that is 2 blocks by one block.\nRequires:\nThe shaft for this design is 2 blocks deep and one wide.\nBottom-up construction.\nStarting at the bottom the entrance to the shaft should be in a wall that is at least one block thick. The entrance should be a 2 block high opening with a door set in the last blocks space before the two deep space for the elevator. The door is to keep the bottom two &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; sources from leaking out the opening. Now, step into the shaft and place signs in a zigzag up one of the 2 block wide walls as high as you can reach. Then, fill in the gaps between signs with water sources, thus forming a zigzag of water blocks. Reload on water buckets and ride the elevator up as high as you can, place more signs as you bob up and down in the topwater block, and then place more sources. Repeat till you reach the top.\nTop-down construction.\nHave at least two full water buckets in inventory when you start this procedure.\nStand on the line between the two blocks that make the top of your elevator shaft. Dig down one block under each foot (note 1). Place a sign on a block on the two-block wide wall in front of you, it does not matter which. Dig down another block depth for both blocks. Place a sign on the same wall as the first, but on the other block, and repeat all this once more so that you have a four-block deep shaft with a zigzag of signs on one of the side walls. Looking up place two &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; sources besides the first and second signs that you placed. You are now standing in a safe breathing space at the bottom of a working elevator that you can use to return to the top to reload water &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, get more &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s or whatever.\nOne rises in the elevator by &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, going down is just falling.\nAs one rides up or down the breath meter may flash in and out of view unless you can stay perfectly in the middle of the alternating water blocks, but no matter as you are never more than a few ticks from your next \"breath\".\nThis kind of elevator is faster than a falling water stream due to the swimming action between water source blocks.\nNote 1: the reason you stand between two blocks is that one cannot fall when at least one foot is on a block, meaning when any part of your bounding box is over a solid block. Digging two or three blocks deep on one side, then the other allows the intrepid miner to notice that a ceiling has been breached before falling into empty space.\nFast water bubble (soul sand) elevator and drop-shaft.\nA rapid elevator for any height with no drowning issues, with a fast drop shaft. (1.13+)\nRequires:\nConstruction.\nDig down (or construct upward) a single-block column to the desired depth or height surrounded by the solid block of your choice. Dig a block out at the bottom of the column and place a soul sand block as the 'floor'. To make an entrance, replace the bottom two blocks of two \"adjacent sides\" with fence or glass panes creating a diagonal walk-in entrance. Fill up as many buckets as you can with water, and starting with the bottom space above the soul sand, place a source water block at \"each level\" (bubbles don't flow past a gap) until your column is full to the top. Once completed, simply step in the diagonal entrance into the (breathable) water column and you shoot to the top. \n\"Note: to complete purely in survival mode, don't place the soul sand until after you've filled the column with water blocks since you can't swim down through a bubble column. Be careful not to drown!\"\nAlternatively, pour a single bucket of water from the top and, starting from the block where soul sand goes, swim-up placing kelp on each block until the top of the elevator is reached; the kelp converts falling water into water sources. Then swim down, remove the bottom kelp block and place the soul sand block in its place.\nDrop-shaft.\nDig or construct another 1-block column close to your elevator. Make your entrance two blocks high, and place a sign at the two-block level (eye-level) below the column. Place a water source block two blocks up from that, creating a two-block flowing water column. You can now drop down from the top of the column, and the water slows you to drop safely past the sign to floor level.\nCombining the drop shaft with a bubble elevator can be done with them touching at the corners of the shafts for a 2\u00d72 block square vertical up/down the shaft for deep mining. Looking at the 2\u00d72 block from a diagonal, put the drop shaft at the 'front', glass or fence at the two side blocks two blocks high, then the bubble shaft at the 'back'. You can fall through the drop shaft, walk out, then walk through the drop shaft into the bubble column to go back up.\nA more expensive alternative is a downward bubble column made using a magma block. This has the downsides of being slower and potentially hurting the player when they reach the bottom if they do not sneak; it does however save space in certain floor situations.\nAdding floors.\nA common issue with bubble elevators is that a player may travel too fast for them to exit at the right floor. Solutions include:\nBreathable water elevator.\nAn expensive water elevator that works well in survival mode.\nRequires:\nThis elevator is a regular tube elevator attached to conduits.\nConstruction.\nBuild your conduit activation frame in a box of water right next to your tube elevator. Depending on the size and number of tubes, multiple frames may be needed. Add to your conduit or add more conduit frames until you can breathe in your entire elevator.\nOne rises in water elevators by &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, going down by falling can &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Drowning\"&gt;drown&lt;/a&gt; you in a normal elevator and burn time in a breathable one.\nIt is dangerous to move between multiple normal elevators without letting your breath meter replenish out of the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; elevators can't be built with the current versions of Minecraft.\nAlternate Java water elevator.\nA water-sign elevator can also be made in a one-block shaft, which is cheaper if making it as a freestanding column. The construction notes are written for survival mode.\nRequires:\nEnclose a 1\u00d71 vertical shaft with your construction blocks on all four sides, corners are not needed. \nTop-down construction.\nThis method is more useful when building a freestanding elevator up from a floor. One can tower up from the floor, placing blocks on all four sides at each jump on the way up. Then start placing &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s and water back down.\nStart by placing your safety net on the ground - make a one-block hole and fill it with a water source. When you fall from high up in the shaft, a single block of water is enough to break your fall so you take no damage.\nOnce you are at the intended top of your elevator place signs two and four blocks below your feet. You cannot reach down 6 blocks so now you can start with the water sources. Put one on top of each sign, then ready your signs, more full buckets, and jump in. Use the swimming action to stay in the bottom-most water block and place signs further down the shaft, then place another water bucket above this last sign (depending on the size, you may have to keep returning to the top to reload your &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s and repeat until you get down to the bottom).\nThe last sign can most easily be placed from the opening of the elevator at the bottom of the second block up from the floor. This holds the \"entry\" water block above the opening in the first block of the shaft proper. It does not matter if you have two water blocks at the bottom of the shaft as players and mobs rise through them fast enough that breathing is not a problem.\nBottom-up construction.\nAt the bottom leave a two-block high opening (from the floor) for the entrance. Start placing &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s on the opposite wall of the shaft starting with the second block from the ground. Above it place a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source, then jump up into the water and swim upward. Place signs and water sources alternating until you reach the top. The &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; action you need to use to keep on top of the uppermost water block causes you to bob up and down, but some practice makes it easy to work this way.\nIf you need to have an opening taller than 2 blocks place &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s up the back wall of the shaft to the highest block of the opening. The bottom-most water block then sits on top of the ladder.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; blocks to encase your water elevator gives it a cool look and is useful for monitoring a mob mover.\nHoney block elevator.\nThis elevator design takes advantage of the honey block\u2019s hitbox mechanics to make a two-way elevator. In the schematic below, H is honey, S is soul sand, A is air, W is a water source, and B is any other solid blocks.\nBottom layer\nAny layer above the bottom layer\nTo go up, you simply go into the corner of the 2 honey blocks, and because the honey block\u2019s hitbox is slightly smaller than the actual texture itself, when you go into the corner, the player\u2019s hitbox touches the stream of bubbles going up, and you rapidly go up, and to go down, just touch anywhere on the honey block that isn\u2019t in the corner.\nMinecart elevators.\nSimple minecart elevator.\nThis elevator mostly depends on your ability to collect &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and create &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as making &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTo create the elevator, all you need is a 1\u00d71 shaft, down (or up) to the place where you want to go. Once the shaft is finished, you need to divide the number of blocks by either four if you are in singleplayer, or five if you are in multiplayer. This is to figure out how many minecarts and trapdoors you need.\nAfter you have all the needed blocks, continue onto the next set of instructions.\nTo operate, just stand underneath the bottom minecart, look up, and hold the Right Mouse Button. If you did it right, you should go straight up to the top. To descend a minecart elevator, just walk over it; you should fall through the minecarts to the bottom, and the ladder or water breaks your fall.\nVariations\nFor other purposes, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;s also work like an elevator.\nElytra launchers.\n&lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt; launchers do not resemble any real-life elevator but can transport the player hundreds of blocks in the air instantly. They are a late-game method of transportation since you need elytra to use one. To use one the player equips the elytra and jumps into the elytra launcher. The player must press space on the way down. The &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; hits a large number of boats, which all push the player, causing them to travel high up.\nCommand block elevators.\nBesides from the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; elevator, &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; elevators can be made with some special effects, and are the quickest of all the elevators. The principle is that you can hit a button wired up to a command block with the command. (Alternatively, you can replace codice_1 with your username, creating a player-specific elevator.) The most basic design is to have the command block behind the button. To get a little more complex, you need a bit more room or use repeaters. The basic objective is to have a command block with the command, then a few moments later, having a command block with the previously mentioned command to do the main part of going to a floor. Note that if you are using this with a high-rise building, you may need to create more than one elevator cab for serving more than a few floors, since this type of elevator may get a little large, trying to serve 35 floors in one cab.\nAnother technique is to have two command blocks per floor, one sending the user one floor up, the other sending them one floor down. Align all the x and z coordinates, so that the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; stays on one spot relative to the two columns, and can simply click repeatedly to ascend or descend multiple floors.\nScaffolding.\n&lt;a href=\"Scaffolding\"&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; can be used to make space-efficient elevators you can move up and down on. Placing doors around a tower of scaffolding can make it look like a real-world elevator. Use the sneak key to go down and jump to go up."}

This creates a sliced portal in which mobs can spawn where the light level is 0. The light suppressors allow the light levels of the portal blocks to be 0, meaning that mobs can spawn directly into the portals and get transported into a drop chute.\nUpdate suppression.\nUpdate suppression is a glitch that allows the player to update certain blocks without causing updates to another. The main use is to make sliced portals which is a key component of the farm. It is used to place blocks at impossible block states usually done by stack overflow. If the update is cause directly by a player, it will not crash the game. But if it is done by natural means, it will crash the game. Using powered rails is the method of choice for most players. This does not work since Java Edition 22w11a, when the update order was changed from a stack to a queue. A bug involving this was fixed in the next snapshot, 22w12a. The replacement for this is update skipping. "}
{"id": "50056", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50056", "title": "Tutorials/End survival", "text": "This tutorial will tell the player how to survive in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; after killing the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrerequisites.\nBefore continuing, please note that this page assumes that the player has already killed the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. If they have not done so, then it is strongly suggested for them to do, as it is extremely difficult to survive in the End with the ender dragon alive. (If they need help to do so, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20the%20ender%20dragon\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating the ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;). It also assumes that they are playing on Easy difficulty or above because playing in Peaceful makes it far less challenging than on other difficulties.\nThe End is less dangerous than &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, however, the player will likely die quickly without proper equipment.\nUpon entering the &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt;, the player is recommended to open as many gateways to the outer islands as possible for maximum efficiency in transportation, covering ground, and gathering the resources of each island. The gateways will generate a maximum of 20, with new ones being created every time a respawned &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt; is killed by the player.\nThe first &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; will give the most experience to the player, and be the most difficult to defeat. The first dragon can only be defeated with resources the player has brought with them to the End, but after the first &lt;a href=\"gateway\"&gt;gateway&lt;/a&gt; is generated, it allows the player to set up an outpost on the outer End islands. There, the player can bring:\n\u2022 &lt;a href=\"Sapling\"&gt;Sapling&lt;/a&gt;s and dirt for &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; and growing &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s (providing building material, charcoal for torches and smelting needs, and much more)\n\u2022 2 water &lt;a href=\"buckets\"&gt;buckets&lt;/a&gt; for pools to stay safe from &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; (which still works in the End)\n\u2022 &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;s to synthesize bonemeal (wheat and beetroots are great for growing in the end, as they always leave more seeds than the player needs and feed the composter with these. Cocoa beans are the most efficient plants for feeding a composter)\n\u2022 lava for a cobblestone generator. \n\u2022 Optional: a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt; to brew potions for combat while the player takes a recovery break and bamboo for easy scaffolding structures. However, unlike the above-listed items, potions are not renewable in the End (&lt;a href=\"scaffolding\"&gt;scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; is renewable as it requires &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; which can be grown indefinitely under enough light level, or bone meal and &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;s which can be obtained as a junk item from &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;) and require the player to import the necessary materials from the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; beforehand. \nOnce a base of this sort has been set up, and the player has a sufficient amount of &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearls\"&gt;ender pearls&lt;/a&gt; to teleport through the gateway, they can take a break from the battle at any time. The player can respawn the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014only this time, if the player has been sufficiently damaged, rather than dying they are able to teleport to the outpost to eat, recover, and\u2014if they wish\u2014brew potions and acquire new building materials as needed. The player can then teleport back through the gateway to return to battle the Ender Dragon at full health (see \"pros\" of living in the end for a list of all the renewable resources, combat gear, and food the player can bring with them into the End).\nEndermen.\nEndermen can be very annoying while in the End ( more annoying than even Creepers ) . They completely cover the island and are very hard to avoid looking at. Therefore, when traveling in the End, make sure to always carry a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; of water. If an enderman tries to attack, place down the bucket where you are. It should walk into the water and then teleport away. It may also stop attacking, but even if it doesn't, it will die from the water. \nAnother approach is to wear a &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;, and all the endermen will ignore the player completely until the player attacks them. Unfortunately, the player can only see partially, but by pressing ( or on some computers), the player will enter third-person mode, where the player can see fully again. Alternately, they can also toggle the HUD by pressing which disables the blur caused by the pumpkin. However, this will make the hotbar and hunger bars disappear too. The final option is to use a resource pack that changes the pumpkin blur.\n, a useful tip to avoid accidentally looking at endermen is to show entity &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt;es by pressing + . The white-colored hitboxes can help discerning endermen from the similarly colored purplish-black background of the End.\nBuildings.\nThe Home.\nIn the End, there are many ways to build a home. If the player is on multiplayer, one idea is to build the house underground, so that other players won't be able to find them. Also, underground houses are very easy to make.\nAnother option is to hollow out one of the obsidian pillars, making a multi-level building. This may take a significant amount of time, as obsidian takes a long time to mine. However, keep in mind that if you or another player respawn the ender dragon, the obsidian pillars will regenerate, which will entirely destroy your base. \nWhether building or digging the home, the player will need to take measures against endermen spawning in it. The simplest tactic is to make sure that all ceilings are no more than blocks high, so they don't have room to spawn or enter. Where this isn't practical, the player can make floors out of bottom slabs. Then, they can't spawn or teleport there, though they can still walk onto it if they have the headroom. In particular, if you want a secure roof, fence it and make it out of bottom slabs.\nNote also &lt;a href=\"Enderman%23Moving%20blocks\"&gt;the blocks&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; can move. Because of this, the house should not be made of blocks that endermen can pick up, such as grass block. Instead, use stronger building blocks, such as any sort of stone or planks, that endermen can't move.\nAlso, the player can build a home in the outer islands where there are infinite islands.\nPortal Room.\nOne thing the player should do is make a room or building for the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;. This prevents the player from accidentally leaving the End, and also prevents endermen from falling through the portal and appearing in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. Note that if the player updates the portal by respawning the dragon, the ceiling of the portal room will disappear.\nIsland outpost.\nThis is similar to the main house, to be used as an overworld-like base in the process of respawning 19 &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to complete the circle of &lt;a href=\"gateway\"&gt;gateway&lt;/a&gt;s. When the player has killed the first dragon, they have unlocked a single end gateway to the outer end islands. The player will be teleported to an outer island, where they can build a simple house, farm and fish pond\u2014all of which are easy to make. This outpost is intended to have basic renewable resources in or around it, and can include a &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; for both crops and trees, water and lava for a cobblestone generator, &lt;a href=\"furnaces\"&gt;furnaces&lt;/a&gt;, methods of storage (such as a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"barrel\"&gt;barrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and a brewing stand if needed. The house should not have a bed, as it is nothing more than a hazard, and could be any size the player chooses. The farm must be lit up with a decent light source, or the crops will not successfully plant. The player is also advised to stock up on arrows and bows, as these are difficult to renew in the end.\nOnce the outpost is set up, the player may teleport to this house through the gateway when their health is critical during the process of killing the respawned ender dragon. If it is not a priority, it can consist of no more than a farm and hole-in-the-ground shelter. However, if the player plans to beat all 19 remaining dragons, the base can be extended into a fully self-sustaining presence, even providing iron for weapons and armor. Through great difficulty, &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s may be transported to the outer island base (either by flying machine or pushing baby villagers through the gateway) and traded with for arrows, bows, and enchanted gear. Through a variety of creative loopholes, the outer island base may be expanded into a fortress so self-reliant that the player never has to leave.\nThe Dragon Egg.\nThe player should also collect the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; from the top of the portal. Before collecting it, the player should cover the portal with blocks, so when it drops it will not land in the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; and get sent to the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; world spawn point. After that, \"do not\" mine it. If the player does, the egg will teleport away. One way to get the egg is to place a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; facing towards it and activate the piston, causing it to drop as an item. If you make the egg fall onto a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; it will be in item form as the egg is affected by gravity, like &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to mine the egg by making a large 30x30x15 cube of blocks with the egg in the very middle. You need to tunnel to the very middle and make the passage out of transparent blocks like doors or fence gates as the egg cannot teleport to these blocks. You can break the egg with your fist and it will drop. This method is not recommended as it will take many stacks of blocks.\nAlthough the dragon egg is purely ornamental, it is still nice to have in the base as an ornament to remind the player of when their journey in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; began.\nFarming.\nOverworld Farms.\nIn the End, the player can still make many of the farms they would typically make in the Overworld. One of the most important farms to make is a cobblestone generator. Here are two different designs for cobblestone generators that both require 1 lava bucket and 1 water bucket. The first design only generates one block at a time, while the second design can generate 4 blocks at the same time, making it far more efficient than the other one.\nAnother important farm to make is a tree farm. To make the &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s actually grow, the player will need to place a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; or some &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; near the tree, as the natural &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; is too low for the tree to grow.\nAll of the normal farms (like &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt; farms, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20canes\"&gt;sugar canes&lt;/a&gt; etc.) work as they do in the Overworld, however they may need to place a light source next to the farm for it to function properly. Nearly all renewable resources of the Overworld can be infinitely renewed in the End, with a few caveats: \nThe player must bring the necessary materials and mobs from the Overworld to start. However, once these are in place, the player can make a colony so self-sustaining that it requires no transport to the Overworld for supplies. When enough &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s have been killed to open as many gateways as the player is comfortable with, they can start by taking with them some dirt (with optional grass blocks to make the islands more like the Overworld), a few buckets of water and lava, and seeds. Crops and trees can grow normally in the End (unlike the nether, which has fire hazards and no water for the crops) so they will not need anything done differently to care for them, as well as the cobblestone generator. \nSecond, once the buildings and infrastructure are in place, the player can transport animals and &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; to the island. &lt;a href=\"Chickens\"&gt;Chickens&lt;/a&gt; can be brought in the form of &lt;a href=\"eggs\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; and hatched anywhere in the world, but other mobs will need to be pushed or lured through the &lt;a href=\"End%20portal\"&gt;End portal&lt;/a&gt;. The player is advised to block off the return portal, as this will teleport any mobs who fall through it to the player's spawning spot in the Overworld. Provided that the player has brought &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; through the gateway, it is possible to build iron farms in the End, giving the player infinite iron to make weapons and armor to fight the Dragon with once the initial farm is set up on an outer island. \nBuilding farms on the outer End Islands has several advantages, the biggest being safety from being destroyed by the Ender Dragon. If the player is seeking to colonize the outer End Islands, they will need to take many difficult steps to get animals and villagers there. &lt;a href=\"Pigs\"&gt;Pigs&lt;/a&gt; are under a block tall, and can be pushed/lured up a staircase or elevator to the &lt;a href=\"End%20gateway\"&gt;End gateway&lt;/a&gt; to be pushed through to the other side. For other mobs such as &lt;a href=\"cows\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Villagers\"&gt;Villagers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, the player will have to push baby versions of the mobs through the gateway. Building a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Flying%20machines\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; out of sticky pistons and slime blocks has several advantages, such as being able to transport adult mobs and able to cover far greater distances than &lt;a href=\"End%20Gateway\"&gt;End Gateway&lt;/a&gt;s (the flying machine will keep journeying through the void forever unless it collides with something or is broken en route by the player, and can be built high above the end's tallest structures to avoid collisions. If wanted, a player could take flying machines with villagers and animals millions of blocks away from the center, making for great secret bases on servers).\nSince almost everything works the same in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; as it does in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, the player can then set up the farms they would in the Overworld without great difficulty, once the animals or villagers required for it are in place. (&lt;a href=\"Beds\"&gt;Beds&lt;/a&gt; explode if a player tries to sleep in them, but villagers follow a normal day-night cycle in the &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"end\"&gt;end&lt;/a&gt;, and sleep in beds without issues, allowing for Iron farms and artificial villages to function normally). &lt;a href=\"Villagers\"&gt;Villagers&lt;/a&gt; will still trade Glass, Glowstone, Redstone Dust, Lapis Lazuli, Bottle o' Enchanting, Bows and Arrows, Armor, Tools, Enchanted Books, Stone variants, Block of Quartz, and more, and the player can gain the emeralds they need by trading the crops or smooth stone already availiable in the End\u2014effectively making the End a closed-loop system that eventually needs nothing from the outside world.\nEnd Exclusive Farms.\nOne of the advantages of living in The End is that it is far easier to build an enderman farm or grinder. These take a lot of effort to make but are extremely useful after making them. If the player wants to learn how to learn how to make one, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Enderman%20farming\"&gt;enderman farming&lt;/a&gt;. Enderman farms are useful, as enderman drop &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearls\"&gt;ender pearls&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to teleport or crafted into &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;, which are used to make &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAnother advantage of living in the End, or at least going to gather chorus fruits, is to make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Chorus%20fruit%20farming\"&gt;chorus fruit farm&lt;/a&gt; (The player can make it in the Overworld too). Chorus fruits can be used as food, items for making purpur blocks, and its popped variant also make end rod.\nEnder chest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most useful items in the game. The items inside of one ender chest are accessible in all other ender chests. Due to the massive amounts of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; present in the End, it is very easy to make an ender chest for each building or area of the End. &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20powder\"&gt;Blaze powder&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;rods&lt;/a&gt; used to make ender chests must be collected from &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s beforehand. Also, don't forget that ender chests \"can\" be destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20dragon\"&gt;Ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnd Survival Challenge.\nThis survival challenge is similar to the \"Starting in the nether\", but it is starting in the end. The challenge is shorter than the nether survival but is more dangerous. You have to use cheats to teleport yourself to the end outer islands. The game must be on hardcore mode, because if you die, you will end up in the overworld, which will be cheating. Do not set your spawn point in the end because the exit portal always takes you to your spawn point. Once you are there, you can start the game.\nSince there is no wood and animals in the end, your first goal is to get food. Gather at least 2 stacks of chorus fruit by breaking a chorus tree. Chorus fruit restores 4 hunger points but teleports you randomly. Your next goal it to find an end city to get tools, weapons, and armor. You don't have to kill the shulkers, but block the bullets by punching them. If you are at a large shulker tower, let one bullet hit you and punch the rest of the bullets so they can't kill you. Once you make it to the top, there are 2 chests containing enchanted diamond and iron armor and tools. Don't wear anything with curse of binding because you will be stuck with it. The treasure room also has chests, one chest and an ender chest. If you have a silk touch pickaxe, you can break the ender chest. Take all the treasure and kill the shulkers. If you got a pickaxe, you can mine end stone and purpur. Mine some blocks and bridge to the ship if there is one. Take the elytra, loot, and potions and kill the shulkers. Make sure you have good inventory management because you cannot make shulker boxes without crafting table. Raid more end cities to find more armor and tools and weapons. Your next goal it to find a return end gateway or build a 1000 block bridge back to the end central island. \nOnce you make it back to the central island, you have to kill the ender dragon. Pillar up to the towers and block yourself with end stone before punching the crystal in order to reduce damage. Repeat for the other towers. For the caged towers, break the iron bars from under and punch the crystal to reduce damage. Since you don't have a bow and arrows, stand in the exit portal and hit the ender dragon when it perches. Watch out for dragon fireballs and keep attacking until the dragon it dead. Gather all the experience. To get the dragon egg, get a torch from the exit portal and punch the dragon egg so it teleports onto end stone. Mine 2 blocks down from the block next to the dragon egg and break the block 2 blocks under the egg. Place a torch and break the block the egg is on. The egg will drop and you can collect it. Now you can return to the overworld and continue as normal."}

You can also farm end stone with this because end stone generates under the bedrock portal frame every time the dragon respawns, and torches with a system that will break them and collect them.

{"id": "26054", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26054", "title": "Tutorials/Enderman farming", "text": "The purpose of an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; trap is for the easy access and killing of endermen. It is possible for the user to create such a trap that can be used by simply standing still, and looking at the endermen. This angers any you look at, luring them into the trap. Most endermen traps are best suited to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt;s, as endermen spawn at a considerably higher rate there. You can still create this trap in the Overworld, but endermen spawn far less often.\nPiston trap design.\nThe schematics of this trap are as follows:\nUsing and operating the trap.\nTo use the trap, stand on the pillar, grab a sword and look at an enderman, causing it to rush toward the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; and fall into the pit. Activate the lever to extend the pistons. Wait a few moments and deactivate the lever. The enderman should be weakened by having its head smashed and the player can kill it with one strike. An upgrade is placing &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s (wooden for testing, so the player can activate the trap with an item, and stone for the enderman) at the bottom of the pit and rigging redstone into an AND Gate. The lever primes the trap and the enderman touching the pressure plates activates the pistons.\nExperience gains.\nIt is possible for the user to gain EXP from this trap, as the player hitting a mob once registers the mobs' death as a player-kill. This means that even with the pistons crushing the mobs down to half a heart, you can still give experience from the player hitting the mobs at their point of death. It is also possible to switch the levers and pressure pads with a button, these can be timed to crush the endermen, then release when they reach the health points of half a heart, readying the endermen for a one hit kill from the player.\nPanda's enderman trap.\nDescription.\nThe farm is built in the End at least 128 blocks away from any spawnable block, so the endermen can spawn there only. A platform is built for the endermen to fall onto from spawning pads built at least 43 blocks above the platform, with rings built upward to prevent endermen falling onto an area that isn't the platform. On the 43rd block up vines are placed to break the fall, so the endermen take 19.5 hearts damage, leaving them on half a heart.\nThe spawning pads either have pressure plates on them, connected to &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s with blocks attached, or a &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt; attached to normal pistons to push the endermen off the pads, down the drop and landing on the platform with only half a heart of health left, allowing for one hit kills by punching. A good way to start punching is to create a two-high ceiling and start staring at the endermen.\nA similar design uses &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; ignited by a player with a bow enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Because the player ignited the TNT that killed the enderman, they receive experience orbs.\nUsing this farm it is possible to get to level 30 in minutes, provided enough spawning pads have been built.\nEndermite lure trap.\nDescription.\nThe &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt; lure trap is one of the cheapest and most efficient &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; farms, requiring only blocks, a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;, and a minecart (a boat is inefficient as it can block enderman from getting in) while relying on enderman aggression toward\nthe endermite that spawned by an &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;. By naming the endermite and trapping it in a minecart, a permanent lure is created, and all endermen that spawn within 62 blocks and sight of the endermite pathfind to the endermite and attack it. The enderman can then be routed to a collection point where they can be farmed. If desired, the endermen can be dropped 43 blocks to take sufficient fall damage to render them one hit. To increase spawn rates, the farm can be built at least 128 blocks away from the main end island or any other areas where endermen can spawn. Alternatively, spawning on the main island can be prevented by lighting it up above light level 7, or by covering the main island with slabs or water.\nTop view of endermite lure trap:\nObtaining endermites:\nUnder the platform.\nThis design does not yield as much as some, but it is good for starting out. Start in the Overworld, and later switch to the end.\nTo start building, make a 2-block-high pillar out of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; or another easily mined block. Then, make a small platform on the pillar out of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; if you have it) that is 2*2 or 3*3.\nWhen there is an enderman nearby, look at its head until the anger animation shows. Quickly stand under the platform and hit the endermen repeatedly.\nTo cover a larger area, simply build extra platforms.\nExtremely efficient design.\nThis design is extremely efficient and uses only a few resources. docm77's design:gnembon's design:"}

{"id": "43517", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=43517", "title": "Tutorials/Endless circling pool", "text": "An endless circling pool, also known as an pool, allows the player or any player-sized mob that gets in the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to circle endlessly around the center. These are commonly used for AFK players in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; to avoid getting kicked off the &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nEndless circling pools, or AFK pools, are primarily used on multiplayer servers. Most servers prevent players from being idle for too long by kicking them off the server after 15 minutes or more. For that reason, some players make \"AFK Pools\" to prevent being kicked off by the system.\nThis is why many players build an endless circling pool when they have to be away from the computer. An endless circling pool automatically moves the player continuously. However, it can malfunction once in a while, causing the player to stop moving. Because of this, make sure to check your computer every 15 minutes (or however long the player is allowed to be idle before they get kicked off on that specific server). Also, note that some servers ban the usage of endless circling pools.\nUsage notes.\nHere are some important things to think about when using an endless circling pool.\nConstruction.\nWhen you are ready to build an endless circling pool, you need only basic materials:\nThe following schematics show the construction of an endless circling pool:\nTo use the endless circling pool, simply jump into the water at any place in the flow. The water should constantly carry the player using the pool all the way around.\nEndless circling moat.\nA better variation is to build a two-block-wide channel, which can accommodate a boat that you ride in. The advantage is that &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; is not depleted while riding a boat.\nWith proper water management, one can construct not only circling pools, but also moats around arbitrary areas. Strategic placement of water source blocks along with buttons or signs are used to control the flow of water such that one flow pushes the boat into the next flow, but the next flow \"pulls\" the boat out from the previous flow.\nUsing the techniques described in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Water-powered%20boat%20transportation\"&gt;Tutorials/Water-powered boat transportation&lt;/a&gt;, the smallest circling pool that can accommodate a boat has one solid block in the center and four quadrants of water flowing from one corner of each quadrant. This design requires a 7\u00d77 area, 1 layer, 4 water source blocks (\"S\" in the schematic), and 8 buttons or signs \u2014 one on each side of the central block and one on the wall opposite each central button or sign. A tamed &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; in the boat with you is useful to repel &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s if your pool is outdoors and lit sufficiently to keep monsters away.\nLarger moats are possible as long as the distance between sources are close enough to prevent the boat from getting stuck. In \"Java Edition\", the &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt; between water sources should be 4 blocks or less to avoid submerging the boat."}
{"id": "165141", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=165141", "title": "Tutorials/Experience farming", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; is a tricky resource: It is needed for &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;combining and repairing&lt;/a&gt; items, and for fueling the &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Many desired jobs require \"large\" amounts of experience \u2014 but it can take quite a while to accumulate a high experience level, and when the player dies, they lose essentially all of their current stock. Accordingly, many players resort to \"experience farming\" \u2014 arranging a situation where they can pick up large amounts of experience when desired. These fall into several categories, reflecting the many sources of experience, but most of them can be considered in terms of experience per time \u2014 either active or AFK time, with the player involved, or \"accumulation\" time before collecting the results.\nConsulting the Experience page, we can see several common \"target values\" for desired experience payouts:\nFishing.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; can function as a slow experience farm, with only two string and three sticks as an \"entrance\" fee to get started. However, it is wise to set up a secure fishing pond: You'll want a stretch of water at least two blocks deep and a few across (basically big enough not to accidentally miss the water). The water should be open to the sky, but you should have a lit, sheltered area to fish from, with a roof to fend off phantoms, and fences or glass to keep monsters from spotting and targeting you (a bit of height helps too). You should also make sure that you can reach the fishing area when it's night or storming, and that you can quickly climb back up if you happen to fall into the water. You need at least one double-chest to store your catches (and your rod, when not in use).\nFishing with any rod can catch enchanted fishing rods, which can be saved until a rod with Mending is caught. This rod can be combined (at an anvil) with other rods as they are caught, and fishing becomes essentially free. The goal is to produce a \"god rod\", with (&lt;a href=\"Luck%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Luck of the Sea&lt;/a&gt; III, &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lure\"&gt;Lure&lt;/a&gt;] III, and &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt;), which maximizes both fishing speed and treasure gained, while minimizing the experience used to restore the rod.\nWith these enchantments and while fishing outdoors, each minute you make an average of 8 catches, bearing experience orbs worth an average of 28 XP. Any &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; equipment worn may take 1 XP from each orb, perhaps reducing the total as low as 20 XP. The rod itself averages 1 damage per four catches on average, and if it has only one point of damage it repairs that for free! If multiple items are being mended, the rod may take a second point of damage before it mends, and then take an XP for its next mending. Mending affects any armor worn and the rod, but an additional item can be included by placing it in the off-hand. Total yield is thus 400 XP/game day (1200/real-time hour) if items are being mended, or 560/day (1680/hour).\nFishing under rain adds 25% to the yield (wait time is 20% less), for a potential of 25-35 XP / minute as long as the rain lasts.\nAside from the basic experience for catching items, there are a couple of \"side hustles\" that can yield extra experience: Cod or Salmon can be smelted (22.4 XP/stack) Any magic items (bows, rods, books) not kept for your own use can be fed to a grindstone for extra experience. \nThis is also a good way to while away rainy days and storms, when exploring may be unpleasant or dangerous, but &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Fish%20farming\"&gt;AFK fish farms&lt;/a&gt; can also be constructed for reduced boredom.\nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Villager%20trading%20hall\"&gt;Trading&lt;/a&gt; gives a fair bit experience itself, but emeralds can also buy &lt;a href=\"Bottle%20o%27%20Enchanting\"&gt;Bottles o' Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. While fairly expensive for the experience stored, these are truly portable, and can be used to top up your experience to reach any desired level. In the process, several useful villagers can be \"leveled up\" to provide more useful items. \nA variety of sellable items can be produced by automatic farms, easily farmed by hand, or provided as surplus from a mob grinder. Note that if a villager has any options for their first tier of trades (Novice), you can effectively choose for them, \"if\" you have not actually traded with them yet: The trick is to break their job block and let them revert to unemployment, then replace the block. This does not work for higher-tier trades, but it does let you pick one book (often Mending) from a librarian, pick a farmer's first crop, and make sure that other professions do indeed offer their \"cash machine\" novice trades.\nThe following list focuses on \"easy pickings\". \nEach trade (both selling stuff for emeralds, and buying the bottles) also grants an average of 4.5 XP to the player, 5 extra if the villager is willing to breed. This means that rather more experience is gained in the trading than stored in the bottles!\nThe Bottles o' Enchanting themselves average a yield of 7 XP each, so a stack of them yields around 448 XP. \nTrading is a good source of experience for repairing items (i.e those equipment enchanted with mending) but not as a permanent source of XP.\nMob grinder.\nMob grinders are typically built high up in the skies so constructing them is a bit risky, as there's a high chance of dying unless you have boots enchanted with Feather Falling III or IV and you're good at doing MLG's. Go for mob grinders if you haven't located a spawner yet and if you want access to different types of loot.\nSpawner XP farm.\nSpawner XP farms are typically not that great for XP as it requires about 24 minutes of grinding just to get to Level 30, but in the case of a zombie spawner, this duration is compensated by enchanted loot that you get. A blaze spawner though is worthwhile because you can use the blaze rods for blaze powder to brew potions, craft ender chests or use the blaze rods as a consistent source of fuel, as one blaze rod can smelt up to 12 items.\nQuartz mining.\nQuartz mining is arguably one of the easiest ways to get XP early game. However, they fall off at late game if you mined all the quartz in the area and had to explore more areas to mine more quartz. \nEnderman XP farm.\nAn enderman XP farm is a great source of XP. You can typically get to 30 levels in just under a minute. The biggest downside however, is the fact that you need to build this at y= 1 (to increase the rates) in the End Dimension, thus it has a high risks of dying in the void and losing your stuff.\nGold XP farm.\nGold XP farms have multiple designs but they all have the same mechanics, in Java Edition, most gold farms use magma blocks as a spawning platform, the killing mechanics depend on the farm design itself. Some designs make the piglins fall into a hole to easily kill them, some use turtle eggs to lure the pigman, some manually hit them to go to a killing chamber and so on. In Bedrock Edition however, most farm designs utilise obsidian portals that is continuously destroyed and lit up to spawn pigmen, which are then transported to a killing chamber for easy XP. Aside XP, the farm is also an infinite source of gold and thus you can use the gold to barter with piglins, craft golden apples or make a golden pyramid to power the beacon.\nThis farm is one of the best in collecting XP because of the bonus gold. You can get up to Level 100 in one hour depending on the design. \nGuardian farm.\nGuardian farm is one of the fastest ways to get high XP. However, you'd need to dedicate a lot of time draining an entire ocean monument and a lot of spawn-proofing to get the maximum rates possible. Guardian farms are still worth the try, as aside XP, you can get a new set of beautiful building blocks.\nSmelters.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Automatic%20smelting\"&gt;automatic smelter&lt;/a&gt; can be fed with the harvest from any of several automatic crop farms, and the resulting experience claimed when you need it. \nThere are a limited number of useful crops here, basically the ones that can be automatically farmed:\nFor large smelter farms, the load can be divided among several furnaces, which can be harvested separately; list allows storing larger amounts of experience without needing to harvest it all at once, and also allows faster progress (so long as the input farm can keep up). For a simple single-furnace setup, nearly two stacks of cactus (120 items) can be burned in a Minecraft day, collecting 360 XP per real-time hour. Potatoes and kelp burn twice as fast, but give less experience, yielding respectively 252 and 72 XP/hour. Of course, maintaining this rate for long periods of time requires an input farm large enough to supply 120 or 240 items per day, and this is multiplied for multi-furnace setups.\nFuel can be provided by the player in quantity, but it is even possible to fuel the farm with an automatic bamboo farm, or with an automatic charcoal smelter, perhaps fed by a tree farm. An automatic charcoal smelter can smelt 7 stacks of material for each stack of wood provided to it; dried kelp blocks are more efficient at 20 input stacks per kelp-block stack (11, if we discount the kelp blocks used to smelt more kelp), but they do require manual crafting to produce. A bamboo farm must be large enough to provide four stacks of bamboo for each stack of material to be smelted.\nIf continuous fueling is not practical, it is possible to set the intended yield of the farm by the amount of fuel loaded into it \u2014 for example, a cactus smelter loaded with 70 kelp blocks produces enough experience to bring a player from level 0 to level 30 \u2014 with a single furnace, this takes most of four real-time hours (3h 52.5m). This is significantly slower than fishing, but where fishing requires the player's presence, the smelters can be left to operate on their own (in any l&lt;a href=\"Chunk%23Chunk%20loading\"&gt;oaded chunks&lt;/a&gt;).\nEnder Dragon.\nKilling the ender dragon for the first time gets you 12,000 XP, which can get a player up to level 68 or 69. This gives you a lot of enchanting options, although they run out quickly.\nRe-summoning (using end crystals) the ender dragon gives only 500 XP so building a dragon farm (an ambitious project) is almost worthless."}
{"id": "180129", "revid": "56236829", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=180129", "title": "Tutorials/Exploring an ancient city", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;Ancient cities&lt;/a&gt; are among the most dangerous and challenging structures to explore in the game. It is mostly dark throughout, and while the cities do not have any normal hostile mobs in them, they are home to &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, which can easily slaughter players, even in full &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; armor.\nWhy bother?\nThere are several benefits in going to an ancient city:\nStarting out.\nTo prepare yourself for an expedition to an ancient city, there are a few things you need to do.\nFinding a city.\nTo locate an ancient city, you first need to make sure you're in the right biome. Ancient cities are found exclusively in &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biomes, which are more likely to occur beneath tall mountains, and never generate below aquatic biomes like oceans, rivers and swamps, so make sure not to waste your time digging underneath the wrong biomes. When you locate a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; biome, dig down at the foot of the mountain to Y=-51, and then start tunneling horizontally towards it. This gives you the highest chance of finding a deep dark biome. \nOnce you find a deep dark biome, start exploring around until you find an ancient city. Not all deep dark biomes contain an ancient city, so you will likely have to explore multiple deep dark biomes until you find one. While you explore, try to stay between the Y-levels -30 and -50 as much as possible, as these are the coordinates between which ancient cities may generate.\nA more tedious, but more guaranteed way is to dig parallel tunnels at Y=-51 in a zigzag pattern: dig a long horizontal tunnel, and when you reach the end of the deep dark biome, dig to the side for a few hundred blocks, and then turn around to dig another tunnel. Tunnels should be spaced about 200 blocks from each other; ancient cities have a massive footprint of about 220 blocks on each horizontal axis, so they cannot be missed even when tunnels are spaced that far apart.\nYou should approach and reach the ancient city either from the same level or from below, as if you mine into it from above, you run the risk of falling directly into it. If you survive fall damage, then death likely comes from the warden.\nExploring the city.\nWhen you explore the city, the most important thing is to &lt;a href=\"sneak\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; at all times, unless you are on the corridors with &lt;a href=\"gray%20wool\"&gt;gray wool&lt;/a&gt; walkways. This causes slower movement unless you have &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Sneak\"&gt;Swift Sneak&lt;/a&gt; on your leggings, which you wouldn't have if this is your first trip to an Ancient City, as it can only be found in an ancient city. However, there is a trick to sneak faster: sneak \"diagonally\". when pressing two directional keys (such as and ) at the same time, the player moves at a faster 1.8 m/s as opposed to 1.3 m/s. This can make it hard to see where you are going, so you can use the &lt;a href=\"third-person%20view\"&gt;third-person view&lt;/a&gt; to get an eagle eye view of your character.\nUse your &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; to see without having to place &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es (as that potentially alerts sculk sensors and shriekers). Torches, however, are useful as a last resort if you run out of Night Vision potions or are under the &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; effect, so use your night vision to identify spots where a sculk shrieker or sculk sensor cannot detect the sound, and place torches in those places, so that you can see by their light later. There may be some areas where it is extremely difficult to get through if you have run out of night vision potions or have the darkness effect and you should simply avoid these areas. Lastly, you can throw your snowballs into an area to check how many sensors there are, or if the area is safe. Additionally, doing this at a distance allows you to stay out of range of the warden that spawns if it is your fourth time activating a shrieker within ten minutes, for the warden spawns relative to the sculk shrieker, not the player. However, this technique should still be used only when you have a good escape plan.\nDestroying sculk shriekers.\nThe most dangerous block in the ancient city by far is the &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;, as it is directly responsible for spawning in the wardens. So one of the most important things to do when exploring an ancient city, is to destroy all the sculk shriekers to stop that from happening, or place wool around them to stop vibrations. Breaking the sculk shrieker triggers nearby &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt;s, which can in turn alert other shriekers nearby, so placing wool is the recommended choice. Breaking all sculk shriekers without spawning any wardens is a challenging task, but it is not impossible. To do so, the player needs to understand how the Sculk Shrieker works.\nMechanics.\nWhen a sculk shrieker activates, it start shrieking but it does not actually spawn a warden right away. It does so after its shrieking has finished, if you have activated a shrieker four times. The shrieking lasts for a total of 4.5 seconds, during which the player can do a couple of things to utilize the situation:\nHow many shriekers?\nWhen a player approaches a patch of sculk blocks, the first thing they want to do is to count how many sculk shriekers there are. If there is just one shrieker, this makes the task quite easy. The player simply needs to sneak up to the shrieker and break it with their hoe \u2013 even though this triggers the sculk sensors nearby, no wardens can spawn because there are no more shriekers nearby that can spawn it. \nHowever, the presence of just one shrieker doesn't mean the player should not prepare for emergencies. It is perfectly possible for there to be another, hidden shrieker the player fails to see, or there is a hidden sculk sensor behind a pillar or wall or something that alerts another shrieker further away. This illustrates the extreme importance of scouting the area before breaking any shriekers, preferably using the &lt;a href=\"third-person%20view\"&gt;third-person view&lt;/a&gt; to view from a higher vantage point and from different angles. Even when thoroughly prepared, the player should also prepare for the scenario below. \nMore than one shrieker.\nIf a patch has more than one shrieker, or if there are multiple interconnected patches containing shriekers, the player must act strategically. They need to be mentally prepared that as soon as they break one of the shriekers, all other shriekers nearby are alerted, so you should surround the shrieker with wool. In the case you do activate one, destroy all of them to save time and further shrieks.\n\"As such, it is of vital and imperative importance for the player to have an escape plan ready, in the form of a safe escape route with which to escape the ensuing warden.\"\nAs mentioned above, a sculk shrieker has a range of 16 blocks, and shrieks for 4.5 seconds. This gives a small amount of time to run in case a warden appears due to 2 other shriekers being activated earlier. Ideally, the player should have a safe escape route leading all the way out of the Ancient City, toward the surface, to be safe.\nLooting the city's chests.\nAncient Cities are full of loot chests with all sorts of valuable resources, everything from common items such as coal ores from items of high value such as various enchanted items as well as amethyst shards. Unlike some structures such as Woodland Mansions or even Strongholds, the Ancient City's mass amount of loot chests are easy to find. Not just because of sheer amount, but because if you have a potion of night vision, you can see them easily. This is partially because they aren't separated by massive walls. However, it's also because they're placed in obvious structures. Examples of these structures are shrines with lit soul sand or a small warden statue, large towers that \"very\" vaguely resemble &lt;a href=\"Pillager%20Outpost\"&gt;Pillager Outposts&lt;/a&gt;, (these towers are made out of deepslate, don't confuse them with the \"domes\" \"clearly resembling\" Pillager Outposts, which are made of Dark Oak, are low to the ground, and have no chests) or simple but clearly unnatural clusters of blocks to mark where the chests are.\nGetting loot from chests in the ancient city is tedious, because chests may be surrounded by several &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Shrieker\"&gt;sculk shriekers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor\"&gt;sculk sensors&lt;/a&gt;. However, something you can do is destroy the sensors first so you can safely loot the chest, but this may get difficult if there are more than 2 sensors nearby because breaking one of them may activate another sensor nearby resulting in the shriekers detecting your activity. As a result, it is best to scout out the area thoroughly before making any triggering noises. You can also block the chest completely off with wool before opening it. However, this is not entirely foolproof.\nAnother thing that you can do is rush to destroy everything, but this may be extremely dangerous because the constant noise gets you quickly targeted by the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; if he emerges.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; decides to despawn, you can quickly rush to destroy all sensors and shriekers while he is burrowing into the ground to ensure a safe environment. Be sure to check if there are no more shriekers nearby.\nStrategies.\nThere are a few strategies with breaking sculk shriekers: \nEvading the warden.\nEven the above strategies are not entirely foolproof, and it is still possible for something to go wrong and for the warden to spawn sometime during your explorations. When you hear a loud rumbling and growling noise, you can see the warden rising up out of the ground when it spawns. If this happens, you can still somewhat easily evade the warden without dying. When the warden spawns you have 7 seconds to get as far away as possible before it finishes its spawning animation and begins to track nearby vibrations/smells. During its spawning animation, you can sprint away from the warden without any consequences. However, this comes at the risk of alerting even more shriekers, which can spawn a second warden if the first warden is at a far enough distance. It may be tempting to sprint away after the animation finishes, but this creates noise that the warden can hear, increasing the likelihood of it giving chase (and likely killing you in the process). You must keep sneaking and slowly move away, unless the warden has already begun chasing you. \nIf you can't seem to get away from the warden because it keeps sniffing your location, then &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrows,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Egg\"&gt;Eggs,&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Snowball\"&gt;Snowballs&lt;/a&gt; can be used to distract it. However, if you choose to distract the warden then there are four things to bear in mind: \nAvoid creating too much noise if possible. The warden is blind and instead operates by sound, using noise to pinpoint whatever it was that awakened it. If it cannot hear anything, then it just roams around randomly, sniffing the air, waiting for any noise to happen, though it can still detect an entity if they get too close to the warden or bump into it. Over time, standing too close to the Warden (within 20 blocks) causes it to begin pinpointing the player's location by scent, so keeping a fair distance and escaping is important. If the warden hears too much noise, something gets too close to it, or sniffs you too many times, it roars and begins chasing its target. \nUnfortunately, if the warden does decide to chase you, its fast movement speed, ludicrous melee damage, and its armor \"and\" enchantment-piercing sonic boom attack makes escape incredibly difficult. However, it is still possible, especially if you have prepared for such an emergency beforehand. One escape method is to sprint to somewhere the warden cannot follow, such as though a two block high gap (wardens are just as tall as &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt;) and then try to get further away from there. Be warned that if you didn't create a hole about 30 blocks long before, the warden can still attack and kill you with its sonic boom attack. \nAnother strategy is to pillar-jump upward by placing blocks underneath your feet until you are higher than the warden. You need to be much higher because the warden can melee attack up to 5 blocks above itself, and 30 blocks with its ranged sonic boom attack, which it can use 10 seconds after it has started chasing you. Once you are a couple blocks up, continue upward (if possible) until you can reach the cave ceiling, then dig into it to create a small cavity and wait there for things to calm down. If you cannot see the warden, then listen to its heartbeat: the warden's heartbeat slows down when it is no longer angry, and even further if it can't find you for a while. Alternatively, if you're patient enough, you can wait at the ceiling until the warden despawns entirely.\nIf you sprint through a corridor with wool on the floor, you run silently provided you stay on the wool. While this doesn't slow down the warden, the lack of noise vibrations may allow you to lose the warden's aggression sooner. These corridors are rather large and span throughout the center of the city, so they aren't too hard to find.\nShould you die to a warden, don't panic. Instead, the best way is to wait patiently at a distance for the warden to despawn. If the warden fails to detect any vibrations or smell nearby entities for 60 seconds, then it burrows back into the ground and disappears. Meanwhile, your items stay on the ground for up to 5 minutes (300 seconds) before disappearing, giving you plenty of time to pick them up once the warden despawns. However, if the warden is able to hear/smell you or another mob, then its 60-second despawn timer resets, giving you less time to retrieve your items.\nUsing the warden's strong point against it.\nWardens are attracted to noise. At first, this may seem annoying, however if you use a block that makes noise, like a bell or note block, and link it to a redstone clock, the warden is attracted to it. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, so use at your own risk.\nHowever, this doesn't consider some elements. If this is built before the warden has spawned, the noise alerts a sculk shrieker or sensor, which spawns a warden, and this takes some time to build, therefore it is difficult to build after the warden has spawned. The warden also has a sense of smell, so if you stay too close for too long or the warden is aggro on you, then using distractions is not an option.\nBrute forcing it (with patience).\nBy taking advantage of the above strategies, it is theoretically possible to simply brute-force your way into and through the Ancient city, if you have the patience for it. This is extremely tedious to say the least, but it could allow you to eventually reach the loot in the city and clear it out without having to face the warden at all. You must, however, be aware of where the exit is and be ready at all times to turn around and immediately make your way back to and through that exit to safety and then wait for things to calm down and return later to continue on.\nSimply put; make sure that you have a safe escape route ready and available, ideally one that leads all the way back to the surface. After that, make your way into the city (by sneaking) and then simply start breaking every Sculk Catalyst, Sculk Sensor and Sculk Shrieker you can find. This causes an absolute cacophony of noise and surely causes the warden to spawn in short order. In that case, you simply need to turn around and quickly begin making you way toward the exit mentioned earlier, distracting the warden away from you as needed, and once far enough away, leave the ancient city and wait for about 60 seconds to allow the warden to despawn (ideally you should wait a bit longer to account for potential delays). Once the warden has despawned, you may safely return back and start breaking Sculk Sensors and Sculk Shriekers again, and leave once again when the warden appears and returning once more when the warden has despawned again. By repeating this cycle continuously, then as long as a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt; does not generate any new sculk sensors or sculk shriekers, the ancient city eventually runs out of them in the long run as the player gradually breaks them all one by one.\nAlso, the alert levels of shriekers go down over time, making it so you can just wait 30 minutes to do one large go and leave to finish it another time.\nUsing (some of) the Warden's Loot Against It.\nAncient Cities don't just have insane loot, but being so deep underground heavily increases the chance of valuable ores such as &lt;a href=\"Diamond\"&gt;Diamonds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, if you have an Iron Pickaxe, you can mine these ores to get yourself a diamond sword - just avoid summoning a warden in before you're ready though. Once you've done so, what happens next somewhat relies on luck and generation. Once you have your diamond gear, get an anvil and look in all of the loot chests. Often, Ancient Cities have Enchanted Apples and some sort of Sharpness book in some of the chests. Use the sharpness books to enchant your sword, and gather as many golden apples as you possibly can. Then you're going to need a tunnel, at least 20 blocks long (it must be 16 blocks long to escape the warden's sonic boom, but you can make it 20 blocks to be safe). Make sure at least the entrance to this tunnel is 2 blocks tall. Here's where the loot takes its toll: without coming out of the tunnel, get close to the warden and use your sword- which you should've enchanted with the books possibly found here- to spam attack the warden. If it sonic booms you, eat your enchanted apples to heal rapidly. Be careful though- your amount of enchanted apples may be limited. Also, don't get too confident. Stay at least 1 block away from the entrance, otherwise the warden can melee attack you, in which case not even the enchanted apple can save you.\nStraight Up Looting.\nAs already stated, wool is your best friend in ancient cities (aside from night vision potions and pickaxes for mining escape routes), because it suppresses your sound even if you aren't sneaking. This is incredibly useful for this strategy. Don't even bother trying to break the sensors or shriekers. Just surround any sensors, shriekers, or chest with wool. Of course, you'll need to scout the area well before opening the chest to avoid making a mistake. But once you've done so, open the chest and grab all the loot you like. Repeat this process for every single loot chest, and once you're satisfied with your gatherings, you can head back up to the surface and store your treasures back home. And once again, feel free to mine some ores while you're down there, as they're much more common deep underground.\nGetting into the redstone lab.\nThere is a redstone lab under the centre of every ancient city. You can find the city center easily because it has a massive structure made of reinforced deepslate on top. The secret door to the lab can be opened only by a specific method, which is random each time. First, you must find the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; in front of the \"warden face\" and open it. Then grab the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt; inside the chest and go down to the bridge opposite to the chest (don\u2019t eat the carrot yet). Finally, go under the center: the two recessed deepslate walls are the doors. To open the door, go to the door that has a chiseled deepslate block on it and eat the golden carrot. This activates the sculk sensor behind the door and open it. If there is a &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;, then eat it while on the tiled deepslate to open the door. When there is two walls, walk between them to open the door. If there's nothing, then walk on tiles to the left of the door where you would normally find the chest to open it. At the moment, the lab does not contain any noteworthy loot, apart a lot of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20block\"&gt;redstone blocks&lt;/a&gt;, which are not particularly rare, but it has educational purpose for new players, as it teaches them about how sculk sensors can be used for wireless redstone. It could also be a secret base after you remove the stuff inside and fully secure the ancient city.\nFuture uses.\nMake a base.\nMaking a base in an Ancient City can be a challenging but rewarding task. It's completely hidden, almost no reliable way of finding one (except mountains and Chunk Base), and has wide open spaces.\nMaking a warden farm.\nThe warden only drops one thing, Sculk Catalyst. Though it's pretty much useless due to only dropping 5 XP per block, in large quantities, it's a good way to carry portable XP sources and is renewable, unlike Quartz Ore, and cheaper, unlike XP bottles. When you can't access your XP farms directly, catalysts can be used as a substitute to mend your low-durability gear.\nWarden switch.\nIf you'd want to increase your god apple stocks but fear the warden, players can make warden switches to make exploration easier and safer. This basically prevents the warden from spawning and thus if you'd ever want more apples or Swift Sneak books, players can flick a lever to prevent warden spawns. And if you ever want to keep your Catalyst Farm running, players can easily turn off the switch. \nHow to kill the warden (Traditional method).\nEquipment:\nSteps:\nHow to Kill the Warden (Easier method).\nHere is a method to kill the warden. The pre-requisites are as follows:\nFirst, BEFORE spawning in the warden, set up a 4x4 2-block-high roof against a nearby wall. This step is CRUCIAL.\nNext, jump on a shrieker repeatedly to activate it. This will summon the warden.\nThen, quickly run under your 2-block-high roof and eat a golden apple. The warden will chase you, but will not be able to pursue you under the platform. It will begin to prepare its shriek move.\nFinally, repeat these steps.\nThe warden will die in a few minutes, depending on the weapon. Congratulations!\nHow to Kill the Warden (Show-off method).\nIt is not recommended to proceed with this option. There is a large chance that this method will result in a pile of items on the floor where your feet once stood. The only real advantage is that it is more impressive to pull off and sucessfuly complete.\nPre-Requisites:\nFirst, before spawning, place obsidian laid into the ground at certain intervals. Place end crystals on these obsidian blocks embedded into the ground, and then proceed once all of your obsidian is expended.\nSecond, summon the warden.\nKeep luring the warden onto an end crystal, then proceed to detonate it, dealing a massive amount of damage. Make sure to use your shield.\nThe warden isn't immune to explosives, and the end crystals will quickly tear it to shreds. At point blank range, as little as 6 end crystals will kill it. Allow room for error, as the maximum 97 damage per crystal is near-impossible to achieve.\nCongratulations! You have risked your life and items to show off, but you've done it!"}

Most caves have tunnels branching off as catacombs and winding in all sorts of directions. They are often very deep and can go from the surface all the way to bedrock. Caves are not &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s but will often lead into them. Because they mostly lack illumination, they will often have groups of hostile mobs like &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and etc.\nOne should never go into a cavern without a good supply of any lighting and weapons. Leave all valuables back in a safe place on the surface. However, if these valuables are from the cavern itself, make sure to have a chest to put them in.\nCaves are huge and can have numerous intersecting tunnels, making them easy to get lost in. Getting lost in a cavern can be very dangerous, since getting lost in a cavern for too long may easily drain your &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"saturation\"&gt;saturation&lt;/a&gt;, weapon and armor durability, leaving you hungry and vulnerable to attacks, both of which could cause your death.\nFinding caverns.\nThere are many ways to find caves.\nRecommended materials.\nThese are some of the recommended items the player should bring with themselves into caves.\n(Water) buckets - Empty buckets stack (while water or lava buckets don't), but the player will want to keep at least one bucket already filled with water. This is useful for turning lava into &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to be safely walked on or mined. Note that there can still be lava below it though, and the water should keep flowing. This also useful for extinguishing themselves when on fire. Empty buckets can let the player move water or lava springs out of their way, or collect more water or lava for their own purposes. Water buckets can also function as a ladder, and are needed to capture mobs like the &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;. Lava buckets are also useful for fighting mobs, especally for slimes.\nExploring tips.\nNavigation.\nBring a compass.\nIt is surprisingly easy to get lost in caverns. Below are a number of methods the player can implement while exploring to prevent this, especially trail markers. The &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Navigation%23Underground%20Navigation\"&gt;navigation tutorial&lt;/a&gt; has much more information about markers and other navigation methods. (Summary: &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;Torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s (which can be placed in \"arrows\", and especially &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;s.)\nOne fairly easy marker method is the \"torch on the right\" rule. While exploring a cave simply place torches on the right side of the wall as players go deeper in. This way, no matter how complicated and even intertwined the caves get, you can always find their way back because if the torch is on the left of a cave wall, that means they are heading towards the exit. Conversely, if it's on the right, it means they are heading deeper in.\nAnother tip is to use markings such as colored wool, or other blocks, to find where the player came from. The player can also put signs for further clarification, pointing to the direction in which they came from. Optionally, they can make an arrow shape with the blocks themselves.\nAlso, a player can place magenta &lt;a href=\"Glazed%20Terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt; to place on the wall or floor as it has an arrow pattern on it. This can help show which way is the exit.\nWhile it will not help the player in navigating the cave itself, it may be wise to bring a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; with them into a large cave, should the player get lost and need to dig the way out. Note that most caves occupy less area horizontally than they might seem, but interconnected caves and &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s can sprawl over huge distances. The player might well map some new surface as the player is exploring underground, but the cave itself will not be mapped.\nCave survival.\nCaves can be very dangerous - the light level is dark enough for monsters to spawn, gravel is very common, which could suffocate the player, and the player will see lava often, especially in deeper caves, which can kill the player very quickly and burn dropped items. Here are some tips to help with surviving in caves:\nOther tips.\nHere are some general miscellaneous tips that can help you when exploring caverns:\nExiting.\nWhen finished exploring a cave, it is best to try and find the way back to the surface via the way they have came, rather than by digging upwards. However, if need be, they can make their own exit \u2014 just dig upwards to the surface in a staircase fashion, watching for drips. Players can also dig directly upwards, however, be careful when doing so, as gravel could fall on you and cause &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocation&lt;/a&gt;. If this happens, you can use a shovel to quickly dig your way out. You should also keep an eye out for water droplets or lava droplets falling from the block above.\nWhen digging a staircase out of a cave, it can be useful to check your map to figure out where you will, or want to, emerge. Coming out into the seabed can be tricky, especially if your torches get washed away. Put your torches 3 blocks up instead of 2 or 1 to avoid \"wash-outs\" (specifically: high enough that the air 1 block above the next higher stair isn't beside the torch).\nLike mentioned previously, if you found a water flow that leads up to the ocean surface, you can use this to exit the cave. One can create easy access from the cave to the ocean surface by making a pillar of &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;. This will provide a fast, breathable path in both directions. This method can be used for both entering and exiting caves. "}

It has various applications, ranging from simple displays of falling objects to advanced command block creations.\nCommands.\nThis cannot be used in the latest version of bedrock.\nThe most basic codice_1 command can be applied by running the command:\nThis command summons in a codice_1 entity in the chosen (x; y; z) coordinates.\nTo apply properties to the block, write codice_3 in the NBT Tag, where codice_4 is an optional list of block states.\nExtra data can be inserted in the NBT (Named Binary Tag) to modify the time in seconds the block remains in the air. This NBT is codice_5, which stands for the time (in ticks) for how long the codice_1 has existed. If 0, the entity despawns, if 1 or greater, will continue ticking up, until it reaches its maximum lifetime of 600 ticks, or 30 seconds, at which point it turns into a dropped item. The least time value you can give a falling_block is codice_7 (the lowest number that can be represented as a 32-bit integer). Below this value, the block will immediately despawn. It will also turn into an item if it has existed for more than 100 ticks (5 seconds) and is outside the build limit (above y=320 or below y=-63). Adding a value of time for the block will cause the block to assume a physical form when coming in contact with the ground, just like a normal sand block falling downwards. Ensure that the different data values are separated by commas:\nIf the codice_1 block spawns at the same coordinates as an existing block, an error: \"Unable to summon object.\" is thrown.\ncodice_1 does not necessarily need to fall. For an explosion-like feel, or even a simple bounce, codice_1's motion path can be altered. Note the use of square brackets for the codice_11 tag:\nThe maximum lifetime \u2013 30 seconds \u2013 cannot realistically be reached from codice_12 unless the codice_1 is riding another entity using the 'Passengers' NBT (in which case it isn't falling, but its time is still ticking). codice_1 can also reach the maximum lifetime if given the NoGravity tag.\ncodice_1 can be used to summon multiple blocks using the 'Passengers' NBT. Summoning multiple command blocks is the way you make 'one block commands'.\nThe NBT tag codice_16 allows the falling block not to be falling.\nExample uses.\nTo allow running the command repeatedly:\n summon falling_block ~ ~1 ~ {BlockState:{Name:redstone_block},Passengers:[\n {id:armor_stand,Health:0,Passengers:[\n {id:falling_block,BlockState:{Name:activator_rail},Passengers:[\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'gamerule commandBlockOutput false'},\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'data merge block ~ ~-2 ~ {auto:0}'},\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'put first command here'},\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'put second command here'},\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'setblock ~ ~1 ~ command_block{auto:1,Command:\"fill ~ ~ ~ ~ ~-2 ~ air\"}'},\nTo only make the command run once:\n summon falling_block ~ ~1 ~ {BlockState:{Name:redstone_block},Passengers:[\n {id:armor_stand,Health:0,Passengers:[\n {id:falling_block,BlockState:{Name:activator_rail},Passengers:[\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'gamerule commandBlockOutput false'},\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'put first command here'},\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'put second command here'},\n {id:command_block_minecart,Command:'setblock ~ ~1 ~ command_block{auto:1,Command:\"fill ~ ~ ~ ~ ~-3 ~ air\"}'},"}

{"id": "65246", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65246", "title": "Tutorials/Far Lands", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"Far%20Lands\"&gt;Far Lands&lt;/a&gt; are a dangerous place, both for players (due to lots of darkness, hostile mobs and falls) and the device \"Minecraft\" runs on. But, if you want to go to this place, here is how to reach it and lessen the lag. \nHow to reach.\n, the Far Lands can only be found in versions from &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; 2010/03/27 (though they existed in previous versions, the world became non-solid half-way to the far lands, which made it impossible to reach without teleporting) to &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7.3\"&gt;Beta 1.7.3&lt;/a&gt;. They start generating near the coordinates of \u00b112,550,821 on X and Z axes. Given that one block\u2019s side is one meter long, the distance to the Far Lands from the world\u2019s center of coordinates can be measured as about 12,551 km (7844 mi). There is no conventional way of using &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; to quickly reach this huge distance, since they didn't exist in these old versions, except for multiplayer. Instead, the different methods listed below are used. There is also a glitch in 1.12 where if you codice_1, exit before you hit the ground, load the world in beta 1.7.3, you will be 124 blocks short of the far lands, this is a very easy way to reach it if you don't have the single player commands mod.\nDirectly by the Overworld.\nJust walking in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; towards any direction (positive or negative X and/or Z axis) is the most time-consuming way; reaching the Far Lands from the world center would take 9 months of overall Minecraft gameplay. However, it is safer than walking in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; and doesn't require items difficult to obtain. Crafting a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; before starting the long journey is recommended; sleeping in it before the night falls completely will avoid the annoyance of hostile mobs in the way. Crafting a handful of &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s will also help crossing large water bodies. Pay attention to heights and avoid falling from them. Since &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; was not present prior to Beta 1.8, you won't need much food but only enough to restore your health in case of you losing it by falling or being hit but if you are on creative the fastest way to reach it is by flying and sprinting toward the same direction for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; and with elytra and fireworks in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the Nether.\nWalking one block in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; is equal to walking eight blocks in &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, by traveling through the Nether, it is possible to reach the Overworld Far Lands in just over a week. However, since the Nether is a rather dangerous dimension and many different items are required to construct a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;, it will take you a considerable time of trivial Minecraft play in order to obtain material and proper equipment. \nWhen finally in the Nether and adequately protected, the player must travel a few million blocks in the X and/or Z axis. It won't be so far as in the Overworld, but it will still be a long trip. Another portal will be required to exit the Nether, so, before proceeding, it is recommended to either mine all the &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; blocks of the portal and take them with you, or bring enough blocks to construct an exit portal after your trip. Evidently, &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; should also be taken to easily light the portal. \nThe Nether is a very dangerous place, so be \"very aware\" of mobs, lava, fire and high heights all around, and bring as much as food as you can to restore your health after the likely unfortunate events that will happen in your way. When the sufficient distance (see below) is finally reached, using the rebuilt portal will place the player near or in the Far Lands.\nThe nether portal in the Nether must be placed no further than at X/Z of \u00b14,000,000, because beyond that point, the portal would attempt to teleport the player to coordinates beyond X/Z of \u00b132,000,000, which is the limit on the world coordinates. Likewise, an Overworld portal even near X/Z of \u00b132,000,000, would lead the player to the coordinates near X/Z of \u00b14,000,000 (less than one-third of the way to the Far Lands), so it is not possible to reach the Nether Far Lands by this way. Placing the portal near X/Z of \u00b11,568,852 would allow the player to reach the inner edge of the Far Lands. If you reach X/Z \u00b112,550,820 in the Nether, the \"Nether Far Lands\" will generate. More info about the Nether Far Lands can be found &lt;a href=\"Far%20Lands\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. \nIf you tried to make a nether portal at the Nether Far Lands, you would end up at \u00b1100,406,560 X/Z, which is impossible, because beyond 32,000,000 at the Overworld, blocks stop generating and \"fake blocks\" will generate. You can't edit the terrain beyond \u00b132,000,000 X/Z, so the nether portal can't appear past this point. This is a dangerous but faster method then walking from the Overworld.\nThe quickest way to get to the Far Lands is to using the elytra. Unless you plan to pack multiple elytras, bringing one with unbreaking 3 and mending is important, as depending on your starting location, you'll likely be flying over 1.5 million blocks. Frequently checking the durability of the elyctra is important to assure that no untimely deaths are met by way of fall damage. Night Vision potions will significantly lower your chances of flying into a wall, and Fire Resistance will save you from lava falls. Additionally, a &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; could be useful to save you in a tight spot. Fireworks can be used to propel your flight, and so taking a lot of these will make the trip much shorter; however, you will need to be extra vigilant, as flying faster will give you less time to react to sudden events and obstacles. Assuming a continuous rocket boost for the entire duration of the flight, and a completely straight flight path with no stops, it would take just over 13 hours to cover the distance (33.5 m/s over 1,568,852 meters). Needless to say, the journey is long.\nCommands.\nCommands weren\u2019t available in \"Minecraft\" singleplayer until after the Far Lands were removed, but if the player is on a beta multiplayer server, then the player can do the codice_2 command.\nIn both above cases, codice_3 can be negative.\nIn the Nether, these commands will teleport you above the top layer of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, so make sure to either teleport lower, turn \"no-clip\" on, use &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode if possible, or a combination of them.\nTo not get instantly hit by loads of lag, it can be better to teleport to a few hundred meters away from the Far Lands or if using a mod, use lag reducing mods such as Optifine or Fastcraft.\n(Note: In relatively recent versions of pocket edition, while teleporting to the above coordinates is still possible, terrain generates as normal but the player cannot move freely) CAUTION may crash or break your world.\nExternal programs.\n&lt;a href=\"Programs%20and%20editors\"&gt;External editors&lt;/a&gt; such as an &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; editor or MCEdit can be used to edit the coordinates of the player.\nMCEdit.\nAlternately you probably should use MCEdit to get to the far lands, however, you may die a few times before getting it right. Start the Minecraft Launcher and create a new profile in Beta 1.7.3 (check the box that says \"Allow use of old Beta versions\"). Create a new map, walk around for a few seconds, then save and quit. Open the map in MCEdit and move the player's position to a few hundred meters from the Far Lands (so as to not get hit by the full force of the lag all at once). When doing this, it is a good idea to set the player's spawn point here, so if you die, you will be able to respawn near the Far Lands and not have to go through the whole process again (a similar method can be used in the possible situation where you spawn above or below ground.) The Far Lands' land distortion starts at 12,550,821 (x or z, although if you go for a corner where they meet expect double the lag, due to the mobs) so it is better to go to the X/Z 12,550,400-12,550,600 range. Save and quit, load up the world (in Beta 1.7.3), and as it is a new area it will be empty for a while as it loads up. Once there, it is a good idea to turn your render distance down if you have not done so already, as this will help with the lag. Once there hit F3 and check to see which direction increases the number (which will display something around 1.2550E7 because 12,550,000 is considered too long by the game to display.) You should notice strange physics immediately, however, the wall of distorted terrain is still a 200-400 meter walk away (if you used the provided number range.) Once the edge of your view range hits the start of the distorted terrain you will start to get a large amount of lag. Now, you need to explore the Far Lands as much as you can before the lag makes the game too slow to play because once you convert your map into Beta 1.8 or higher, the only Far Lands terrain you will have to explore is the terrain you generated in 1.7.3. Load your map in a newer version, and now you have the Far Lands terrain to do things to. Just remember that any terrain that you did not explore in Beta 1.7.3 will generate as normal terrain. If you want a lot of the beta 1.7.3 land to generate then once things get too laggy you can keep using MCEdit to teleport yourself 100 blocks further. After changing location with MCEdit and closing the map (Vital! You can corrupt the map having it open in 2 programs at once!) start Minecraft up, load the level, pause while looking at the sky (this lessens the CPU load) and give it a short time to process the changes (waiting until there are no chunk updates left may take too long). View distance doesn't seem to affect newly generated terrain distance (notice the explored area circle around you when using a map doesn't change when view distances change) so keep it turned down even though that seems counter-intuitive. Then save and quit and use MCEdit to move yourself another 100 blocks. Keeping either X or Z at 12,550,820 and lowering the other one by 100 each time will let you tour the edge of the wall. Increasing past 12,550,820 will let you explore the interior of the Far Lands, however, the chance of appearing embedded in solid blocks is higher. You might want to consider visiting all 4 corners and mapping 1 square km around them. One last warning: do not ever change the worldspawn (the default spawn location where you appear at the start and reappear at if you die and your bed is obstructed) to a Far Lands area, either with a map editor or on later versions, cheats. The area in a 10 chunk radius around the worldspawn is always loaded, and so any lag in that area is also always loaded.\nlevel.dat.\nYou can edit level.dat file using an NBT editor such as &lt;a href=\"Programs%20and%20editors/NBTExplorer\"&gt;NBTExplorer&lt;/a&gt; to get to Far Lands.\nWorld customization and mods.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Old%20Customized\"&gt;customized&lt;/a&gt; worlds (before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;) to crank up the Coordinate Scale option to high enough numbers can cause the area where the Far Lands would be to be walkably close to the origin of the world. The Far Lands can then be activated using mods. This will probably not cause as much lag as conventional methods since the gravel falling bug is only due to excessive effects and not the terrain.\nChanging the Height Scale up to similarly high options (such as 134000000) will generate the Sky Far Lands, without mods.\nVersion switching.\nYou can make a new world in modern Java edition and run the following command Leave modern Java edition and go to Beta 1.7.3 or older. If you suffocate, repeat the process again. If you do this at the correct Y position, you should see the Far Lands. They cannot be reached by creating a superflat world and travelling many blocks, as the Far Lands cannot generate on a Superflat world.\nWhat to do at the Far Lands.\nWhen at the Far Lands, prepare for lag if you don't have a really beefy computer. The section below this one can help, but a decently good computer/laptop is required for a great experience. Once at the Far Lands, just enjoy the area. You could try to see some corruptions in terrain which are quite interesting. Good luck. (To your computers, of course.)\nAvoiding lag.\nThe Far Lands are a very laggy place, due to excessive coordinates and entities; however, the lag can be lessened by the following means.\nThe difficulty could be switched to peaceful so that no hostile mobs spawn inside of the Far Lands and lag your computer.\nIf the Far Lands are ported (see below), and the player has access to &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, the codice_4 command will stop mobs from spawning, and the command can be used to remove excessive entities in the vicinity (use about 3 times per minute for greater efficiency; although it will kill \"any\" entity other than the players, including &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s, potentially useful mobs etc.; 300 can be any desired distance), and can disallow sand and gravel dropping as items (but mobs wouldn\u2019t drop anything either) (sand and gravel will not cause excessive drops in Far Lands made to spawn closer). If not ported, use mods and/or &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; to get appropriate commands. Alternatively, if the terrain is ported, it can be possible to also perform the first command with the use of &lt;a href=\"command%20blocks\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20clock\"&gt;redstone clock&lt;/a&gt;. Also, if you are using Minecraft 1.9 or newer, you may use a command block on the \u201crepeat\u201d setting, along with toggling \u201calways active\u201d. Another option is to add lag reducing mods, like Optifine or Fastcraft.\nAdditionally, the render distance could be brought down to render less of the area, which can help with the lag. Looking at the sky leaves lag-inducing entities away from the point of view, also lessening the lag. \nHowever, if you want to play on beta and you cannot install Single player commands, you can remove the lagging entities from an area via some precise saving and re-logging. you would to this by first NBT editing yourself to 500 blocks away from the Far lands and start walking to them. Keeping f3 open, when you see the Far Lands and the entity count starts rapidly stuttering, you save and quit then reopen the world, when you join back you have to press escape and open the menu as fast as possible, then you relog back and walk around long enough to check whether the entity count is stuttering rapidly. If it is not stuttering, then you have cleared that portion of land from lag. if it is still stuttering then you need to keep relogging and checking the count till it calms down. This whole process is kind of just luck since the entity counter seems to calm down at random points, if you can clear out a lot of terrain in one go, that's better but if you can't do it in time and the entity counter calms down at 2000-3000, then you are going to be left with residue lag and have to manually destroy the gravel entities on the ground. Alternately you can get the entity counter to stop going up steadily but it will still be dilating up and down a bit, this is a semi stable state and is the most common state for the Entity relog, while it is easiest to get it to this, its not the best because you can easily make it unstable again, although doing this is a bit more uncommon. To get a fully stable piece of land is the best but it is tedious, annoying and the chance of doing this while still beating the entity counter is stupidly unlikely, to get this you just keep relogging until the entity counter doesn't dilate rapidly at all. Unfortunately, sometimes hitting a semi stable state is not possible when you are deep in the farlands, or in the corner farlands, in this case you have to hit a fully stable state, which involves saving on the same frame that all the randomly falling gravel in the area has finished falling or gets destroyed but has not reloaded yet.\nPorting the terrain.\nIt is possible to port the Far Lands terrain from pre-Beta 1.8 into modern versions. To do that, after starting a pre-Beta 1.8 world and later reaching the Far Lands, start going (or teleporting) around to generate the Far Lands while getting rid of lag by the methods above. After generating the desired amount of terrain, convert the world into modern versions, and you will have the Far Lands terrain to do things with.\nIf you are using a mod, load as much terrain as you can, then convert to vanilla Minecraft of the same version."}

Most AFK (away from keyboard) designs involve right-clicking an &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt; with tripwire above it, causing fish caught to flow into a hopper and then into a collection chest. \nDesigns.\nAFK Automatic Fish Farming.\nPre-1.16, automatic fish farming involves right-clicking a door with tripwire above it and hoppers for collection. It\u2019s a good idea to use an automatic fishing rod dropper to supply new fishing rods when the previous one breaks. The ideal rod is Lure III, Luck of the Sea III, Unbreaking III and Mending. For some AFK farms, it is required to hold down a button or key. For these, they can only be truly AFK if it is held down by something besides a person.\nSnapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w12a\"&gt;20w12a&lt;/a&gt; changed how fishing worked. Now, in order to get treasure loot, the bobber will need to be in a 5x5x4 area of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Lily%20Pad\"&gt;Lily Pads.&lt;/a&gt;. This broke all old AFK fishing designs. The current designs use a timer to approximate how long it'll take to catch a fish, and then forcefully cause the player to reel it in via trapdoors activated on a redstone timer. These aren't as fast as the pre-1.16 designs.\nSnapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w49a\"&gt;20w49a&lt;/a&gt; added the &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor\"&gt;Sculk Sensor&lt;/a&gt;, which powered a new generation of AFK fishing farms. A design by Rays Works uses sculk sensors to detect a bobber sinking into the water when loot bites, triggering the sensor and forcefully causing the player to reel the bobber in via trapdoors activated by a sculk sensor.\nNote: None of these work , due to how tripwires and doors work.

It is possible to get lava in bedrock edition only on console during a work around this can be done by creating a world on the old Minecraft Xbox one edition and including strongholds and any other world generation you may need and then syncing this world into the newer version however make sure that you render in any villages or strongholds otherwise they may not be there when loading the new version \nEquivalent challenge.\nBecause there is only one kind of Flat world , this tutorial is written from that perspective, but most of the information here applies to \"Java Edition\" also.\nThe flat world has no structures, just one layer of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, two layers of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and one layer of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;. That's all. The \"Java Edition\" \"Classic Flat\" world has villages by default. For a real challenge in \"Java Edition\", turn off structure in the world generation option.\nAchievements and experience.\n, &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s are disabled in flat survival, so it does not matter if you start out in Survival, or start out in Creative and switch to Survival. Starting out in Creative, you can set yourself up for the desired level of challenge by giving yourself a few items critical to survival.\nYou gain &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; from killing mobs and doing other activities, but experience is not useful unless a mob happens to drop an item enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;. It is highly unlikely for you to get enough iron to spare for an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, which requires experience to use.\nPlanning your start.\nThere are two ways to approach a flat world. One is with \"some cheats\" to give yourself some key resources before switching to Survival mode, and the other is to avoid any cheats and switch to Survival immediately, where you use the contents of a &lt;a href=\"bonus%20chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome cheats.\nPlayers attempting a flat survival game often begin by giving themselves some minimal amount of resources at the start of the game, just enough to keep things challenging:\nThese are cheats, but because you can't earn \"achievements\" anyway in flat survival, do whatever you think will provide the most fun challenge.\nNo cheats.\nWithout buffing up your resources in creative first, create the world with a &lt;a href=\"bonus%20chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt; in Survival mode. Do not to switch to &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative Mode&lt;/a&gt;. Play until you die or reach your goal, such as creating a village or making a base.\nYour bonus chest contains some resources, and you have to work from this to survive and gain more resources.\nAt a minimum, your bonus chest should contain a sapling for &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;. But saplings don't appear bonus chests, so you must have the bare minimum of 4 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; and importantly atleast 2 &lt;a href=\"Apple\"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt; to make golden apple for getting villagers later.\nSaplings in order of preference:\n\"Note:\" If you get trees that don't drop apples, make sure to have atleast 2 apples in your bonus chest.\nBirch and oak grown near flowers can produce &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be harvested once you get a campfire from a fisherman villager.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" after 1.14, it is possible to get saplings in a flat survival world by trading with &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s using &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s obtained from &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Curing%20a%20zombie%20villager\"&gt;cured villager&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;'s weakness potion and golden apple obtained with golds obtain from &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; from setting a &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;lighting bolt&lt;/a&gt; on to pigs.\nIt is nice if your bonus chest includes a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; but you can make one yourself using your wood.\nThere is no of getting lava without cheats. Lack of lava makes challenge harder!\nBuilding.\nFrom starting to mid-game, your only building material is dirt. After you grow and harvest some woods, your priorities are:\nWooden tools are the best you can expect to have for a long time. When you are able to get a toolsmith villager much later in the game, you can &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; tools.\nFeeding yourself.\nCooking your food is not an option for the first 100+ in-game days. To cook food, you need to succeed in the most difficult task: starting a village. Then you can trade with a fisherman villager for a &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; isn't an option because stone is unavailable without cheats.\nLivestock animals are abundant in a flat world and replenish themselves as you kill them for food. &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;Cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Pig\"&gt;Pig&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Sheep\"&gt;Sheep&lt;/a&gt; can all be eaten raw, and drop other useful things like &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; for armoring yourself and &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; for making a bed. At the start of your world, you should kill all &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Passive%20mobs\"&gt;passive mobs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20chunk\"&gt;spawn chunks&lt;/a&gt; to make more mobs spawn elsewhere.\nIn addition, you can farm crops from seeds and roots (carrots or potatoes) found in your bonus chest. Grow enough of these to breed animals as appropriate. &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; harvested from &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; like wheat, and pigs like &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, or &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nKilling &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s gives you &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s, which you can craft into &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. Applying bone meal to the grass blocks all around you causes flowers and grass to grow. Breaking the grass can give you seeds which you can use to grow &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; and breed animals.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s have a small chance to drop a carrot or potato, which can be used to breed pigs. Pigs are necessary in the long journey to getting a villager.\nYou need a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; to convert grass or dirt blocks into &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;. Plant your crops, but growth is slow until the farmland is hydrated, and for that you must wait for rain.\nSurvival goals.\nThere are several points at which you may decide you've had enough of this flat survival.\nThe first respectable goal is simply get to the point where you can feed yourself indefinitely, defend yourself, and survive. This is a hand-to-mouth existence. Once you accomplish this, you are well prepared for &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Island%20survival\"&gt;island survival&lt;/a&gt; or more challenging &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Desert%20survival\"&gt;desert survival&lt;/a&gt; games.\nA good second goal is to create an infinite water source, from which you can feed yourself with &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, create larger bodies of water for &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; up enchanted loot, and creating &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Drowned%20farming\"&gt;drowned farms&lt;/a&gt;. This goal itself involves a lot of hard work, including a \"mega-project\" of making a mob farm without water (see below).\nAn extremely challenging goal is to create a village. Doing this requires accomplishing a difficult and lengthy chain of dependent tasks described in the following sections, as well as luck.\nWaterless mob farm.\nThere are two basic techniques to farm mobs without using water. But remember that &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; need to be killed by player to drop &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe simplest is a dig in the ground, 2 blocks deep, generally surrounding your home base. The moat is lined with open trapdoors, which will make hostile mobs think they're solid blocks even if they are open. When they pathfind to you, they fall into the moat, then you can kill them with your sword or fist.\n[OLD NEEDS TESTING] A more labor-intensive way, but with greater yield after the initial effort, is to make an aerial farm. Mobs drop down from a spawning platform, taking enough fall damage that they can be killed in one punch. You don't want them to die by falling, because zombies drop iron ingots only if killed by the player.\nThis farm works only at night unless you spend extra time building a large roof over the platform, overhanging the edge by 7 blocks, and made from blocks that mobs cannot spawn on (such as wooden stairs, slabs, or dirt path blocks). The advantage to night-time-only operation is that you can focus your day on survival activities: feeding yourself, breeding livestock, harvesting wood to make more tools, and so on. \nStand a small distance from the landing area (so that you are 24 blocks from the platform, which is the minimum spawn radius) and wait for mobs to fall, then run into the landing area to kill them with one punch each. If the mob is wearing armor, or if it's a witch, you may need your wooden sword because these mobs still have multiple health points after falling.\nGetting unlimited water.\nOnce you have a steady supply of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and have become adept at killing zombies in your mob farm, you can focus on your next goal: creating an infinite water.\nAs you kill zombies, you slowly collect &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. Your top priority is to create a &lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, which requires 7 ingots.\nAs soon as you get 7 ingots, craft a cauldron and put it down somewhere exposed to the sky, so that it can fill up with water the next time it rains. If you already have three &lt;a href=\"water%20bottle\"&gt;water bottle&lt;/a&gt;s dropped from &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es, you can fill the cauldron immediately.\nGet three more ingots to craft a bucket. Once you have a bucket, use it to pick up the water from the cauldron and transfer this water to a hole in the ground to create a water source block. You need more water to make an infinite water source. There are three ways to get more water:\nOnce you have a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; and a cauldron full of water at the same time, you can make an &lt;a href=\"Water%23Source%20blocks\"&gt;infinite water source&lt;/a&gt; to get unlimited water source blocks. The most convenient configuration is a 2\u00d72 hole in the ground, one block deep. Use the bucket to place water in two diagonally-opposite corners of this hole to create four water source blocks, one in each corner. If two water source blocks flow into an empty space, another source block is created. A 2\u00d72 hole lets you remove water from any corner, which gets replaced immediately. You can also make a 1\u00d73 straight trench or a 2\u00d72 L-shaped trench, but then only the middle block can be removed. If you remove one of the end blocks, you can't get more water.\nOnce you have your water production hole, take water from it to produce a pond for &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, using a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; that you craft from sticks and &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; obtained from &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s you killed.\nYou can fish from a location above the pond where mobs cannot bother you, or fish from a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. If you make the pond 2 blocks deep, and your fishing rod's bobber has water 2 blocks deep for horizontal distance 2 blocks around it, you also have a chance to fish up other items, like &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt;s for making stew if you have &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s or both red and brown &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;s for taming &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s, and even enchanted fishing rods.\nRaw fish isn't as high-quality a food as raw meat, but it's plentiful and less effort to obtain. Punching animals drains your hunger bar. Your hunger doesn't change at all when fishing from a boat; you can do that indefinitely without eating, as long as you don't get attacked.\nCongratulations! You now have an easy, unlimited supply of food and additional resources. This is a significant milestone on the way to a comfortable life. Take some time to relax, collect a few stacks of fish so you can eat on the run without needing to hunt animals, tidy up your area and your inventory, make some nice living quarters. If you plan to get villagers, you can start planning and constructing some village buildings, although getting a villager is a huge next step, even more difficult than what you've just lived through to get to this point.\nCreating a village.\nOnce you have unlimited water available, you can work on creating a village, which requires villagers. There is a large cascade of dependencies here:\nThe success of some of these steps depends strongly on luck:\nIf, after working through all this and getting lucky enough, you may find yourself with two villagers. You can breed them to get more.\nProtect your villagers! Surround them (or the village you build for them) by a fence to prevent any zombies from attacking them. A hostile mob can come up to the fence but not cross it. Be sure the villagers can never access horizontal surfaces that mobs can spawn on. &lt;a href=\"Dirt%20path\"&gt;Dirt path&lt;/a&gt; blocks should be everywhere the villagers can be. You can make sleeping huts from dirt and wood, but be sure the roofs and the tops of any roofless walls have no spawnable surfaces (like wooden stairs, bottom slabs, or dirt path blocks).\nGetting the most out of your village.\nVillager professions.\nDecide what professions your villagers should have. For your first villagers, with the resources you have available, you can craft only five different kinds of job site blocks:\nAny beds or job site blocks should not be near the villager at first. Put them in your inventory or in a chest (including your cauldron). Your newly-cured villager might be one that wouldn't normally exist because it doesn't match any of those professions (such as an armorer, butcher, cleric, fletcher, stone mason, or weaponsmith). Trade what you can with that villager before giving it a profession. \nIf you get a nitwit, keep it for breeding.\nAfter you get a few emeralds from trading with villagers, you might be able to obtain &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;. With sugar cane, you can craft &lt;a href=\"paper\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, from which you can create &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn let you craft two more job site blocks:\nThe rest of the job site blocks require stone, but stone isn't available in a flat world without a &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nUseful trades.\nVillagers can sell you useful items which are otherwise unobtainable or extremely hard to obtain. They can also have useful trades that let you obtain emeralds easily.\nWandering traders.\nBefore you have any emeralds, a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt; may appear occasionally. There is no penalty for killing it, and no real advantage either. Killing a wandering trader gives you a couple of &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s, which you can also get by crafting the &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;s that you likely already have in abundance. The trader &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s can be a source of &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, which you can already get from the cows that spawn in a flat world.\nHowever, \"after\" you earn some emeralds from trading with villagers, wandering traders become valuable resources, because they offer items that are normally impossible to get, such as:\nIron golem farming.\nYou have many options for an iron farm in either Bedrock Edition or \"Java Edition\". If you have trapped a villager in a boat, it's easy in a flat world to drag the boat wherever you want using a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;, or row it over land, to put each villager exactly where you want it.\n, you can have a working village and an iron farm coexist so that you can obtain iron at a decent rate while continuing to trade with villagers (see ), but because you have limited illumination, you must make sure your village and sleeping bunker have no spawnable surfaces anywhere inside the fence.\nYou can use campfires to kill the iron golems. It is a much slower method than using lava but it is the best available in a flat world where lava is unobtainable. Without campfires, you may need to resort to slower or more dangerous methods, such as using the &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; from your bonus chest, or contriving to have a confined skeleton shoot at the golem.\nGetting an enchanted set of diamond armor and tools.\nAn &lt;a href=\"armorer\"&gt;armorer&lt;/a&gt; can sell diamond armor, but an armorer is not available unless you cheat to have lava. Then you can make cobblestone from lava, make a furnace from cobblestone, make smooth stone with a furnace, and then make a &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; as the armorer's job site. If you get an armorer by giving yourself lava, you can trade with the armorer up to the top tier to get a full set of diamond armor.\nOtherwise, it is possible (but very hard) to get maxed out diamond armor and tools (except &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Sneak\"&gt;Swift Sneak&lt;/a&gt;).\nIf you can obtain unenchanted diamond armor, you can collect enough iron for an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, which you can use to enchant the armor using &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s obtained via &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. Getting enough iron for an anvil is a major project on its own, obtained either by killing zombies or creating an iron farm.\nBattling a raid.\nFighting a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; in flat is easier than in a normal world, because the raiders are much easier to find. Here are some tips:\nWhen you are ready to start the raid, you need to find a &lt;a href=\"Patrol\"&gt;pillager patrol&lt;/a&gt;, which are difficult and tedious to find. Pillager patrols can spawn only in corners 24-48 blocks away from the player in the four directions, and only at low light levels. You need to choose a certain block for AFK waiting, and make a roof on all blocks that are 24-48 blocks away from the AFK spot in both the X and Z axes.\nOnce you get a patrol, kill the raid captain to get &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the pillagers, and then go to the village site to spawn the raid. During the raid, snipe the mobs with a bow from your vantage point, and try not to engage in melee combat. In between waves, try to pick up the items, especially totems, redstone, and glowstone, since you cannot get them any other way. Emeralds, glass bottles, and saddles can also come in handy, however these items are obtainable by other means such as trading or fishing.\nGetting to the Nether.\nGetting to the Nether is not possible without cheating, because there is no way to get lava or obsidian in a flat world. However, you might want to advance further. You can't earn achievements anyway due to the flat world forcing you into Creative mode at the outset, so you might consider allowing yourself a &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;. Besides being your ticket to the Nether, a lava bucket opens up a world of new possibilities, allowing you to create a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone farm&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn lets you have stone tools (which are far better than wooden tools), a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; for cooking and smelting, stone blocks and slabs for creeper-proofing your living areas, and many other items.\nOnce you get a lava bucket, you can use &lt;a href=\"dripstone\"&gt;dripstone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s to get more lava, until you have at least 10 buckets worth. Once you do, you can make a Nether portal by creating cobblestone molds layer by layer, filling them with lava, and pouring water on the lava to transform it into obsidian. Just be sure you are careful where you put the lava to change to obsidian, because you cannot break the obsidian after it is created. Lighting the portal itself is a challenge because there is no way to get gravel or flint; however, you can light it with burning wood ignited by lava.\nNether survival.\nWhen you get into the Nether, survival becomes easier. You can get wood and gold, you can get nether wart and ingredients for potion brewing, you can get blaze rods for an ender chest, you can find pure diamonds, you can mine blackstone to unlock making furnaces and several other crafting recipes, and so much more.\nThe ability to brew &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s becomes possible, because brewing stands can be crafted and most of the ingredients required for &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Health\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; potions are found in the Nether. You can also brew &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; potions to cure zombie villagers, resulting in lower prices for villager trades for diamond armor, tools, and enchantments. You can also build farms for blazes, wither skeletons, or zombie pigmen, giving you more XP for using an anvil or enchanting table. An enchanting table is also craftable due to the availability of pure diamonds.\nFighting the wither.\nOne thing pro players may want to do is defeat the wither. Wither skulls can be obtained from a fortress and soul sand can be found in the Nether.\nFighting the wither is significantly easier than on normal worlds because the entire terrain is flat. Once you are ready to fight the wither, travel a few hundred blocks in the nether and build a portal. This takes you to a new portal thousands of blocks away from your Overworld spawn point, so you don't risk destroying your home area. When you spawn the wither, dodge its hits and shoot it with a bow until it gets to half health, and kill it with a sword.\nOnce the wither is defeated, the &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt; can be collected and used to make a beacon. If you have a productive iron farm, you can afford to power the beacon, which gives you buffs.\nThe End.\nAccessing &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; is not possible in a flat world without significantly cheating. You must switch to Creative mode and give yourself all of the ingredients needed to construct an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtainable blocks and items.\nIn addition to &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; (the only resource available from the world to start with), these blocks and items are obtainable in a survival flat world without cheating and with bonus chest. The sections are arranged roughly in order of availability, with the early-game blocks and items listed first.\nFrom the bonus chest.\nNot all of these may be available. Seeds and vegetation are not available in &lt;a href=\"bonus%20chest\"&gt;bonus chest&lt;/a&gt;s .\nFrom harvesting plants.\nSome items are dependent on bonus chest contents or wandering trader offers.\nFrom early-game crafting.\nThese blocks and items are available to craft from naturally-available resources, prior to obtaining water, zombified piglins, or villagers.\nFrom fishing.\nAfter obtaining enough iron ingots to craft a cauldron and a bucket, it becomes possible to fish for additional items:\nFrom trading with villagers.\n All &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s:\nFrom trading with wandering traders.\nTrading with wandering traders is possible only after getting emeralds from trading with villagers.\nFrom villager gifts after raids.\nNote: This is only \n Baby &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s:\n Unemployed:"}

The block must either have no block above it (which is obstructing &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;light), or be lit with a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of at least 8. Flowers and tall grass will spread over grass blocks up to 7 blocks away in both directions (a 15\u00d715 square). However, approximately 95% of growth occurs within a 4-block radius (a 9\u00d79 area) around the source grass block.\nThe types of flowers that spawn depend on the biome. See &lt;a href=\"Flower%23Flower%20biomes\"&gt;flower biomes&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo-high flowers cannot be grown this way at all; instead, they can be farmed by applying bone meal directly to them, which causes an item to drop.\nIf you use bone meal directly on a one-high flower, it will spread (similar to using it on a grass block).\nIf the planting conditions are not met, flowers will quickly pop out. This allows flowers to be used in the creation of light-sensitive &lt;a href=\"mechanisms\"&gt;mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Poppies\"&gt;Poppies&lt;/a&gt; are also a byproduct of &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron farms&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s will (apart from the iron) drop 0-2 poppies on death.\nPoppies spawn much less frequently than dandelions. They are the most abundant in Mountains biomes, but are also somewhat common in Taiga and Tundra biomes.\nLocation.\n, small flowers cannot be duplicated by using bone meal on them, so they have to be generated by using bone meal on grass blocks within the right biome.\nThe best location to build a flower farm is on the border of a and a regular (not a mangrove swamp), so that all types of small flowers (except wither roses) can be farmed within a single area. This occurs very rarely, only once every couple thousand blocks, so it's best to search such locations using a seed finding program. \nFortune Enchantment.\nStep 1: Get something with fortune.\nStep 2: Break a 2 block tall flower (Peony, rose bush, lilac, sunflower, etc.)\nStep 3: Collect the 2+ flowers\nIt is also tracked on .\nShifting floor design.\nAnother technique for automated farming is to shift the ground beneath the flowers with pistons.\nThe general idea is to have a redstone clock trigger the following three events in order:\nSize comparison.\nThis chart shows the area and flower yield of different sized designs, as well as the necessary number of pistons.\nVideo.\nMysticat - Minecraft Flower Farm: AFK Endless Dye 1.16\nRAHsite - Automatic Wool Farm &amp; Flower Farm - Minecraft Bedrock 1.16+"}

{"id": "56092", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=56092", "title": "Tutorials/Flying machines", "text": "Flying machines are mechanisms that use s and/or s, , s, and s to move a structure of blocks in one or more directions, moving freely through air or water without support. They can also be designed to carry along a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; and/or other entities, which may be riding in a minecart or towed along by honey blocks.\nThe mechanics of such machines vary slightly between the \"Java\" and Bedrock Editions of \"Minecraft\"; This guide covers \"Java Edition\" and Bedrock Edition in separate sections.\nGeneral Principles.\nThe key blocks for flying machines, more or less in order of appearance:\nThere are two main components of slime block flying machines:\nThe engine provides the basic control and motion, based on the idea that a slime block pushed by a piston will move adjacent movable blocks, including other slime blocks, when pushed or pulled. However, each piston is limited to moving 12 blocks total. \nExtensions uses additional pistons to let tow along additional segments of a larger machine. Honey blocks can also be used to bypass the piston push limit by using adjacent slime block and honey block flying machines to divide the number of blocks in a structure among pistons. In Bedrock Edition, extensions are divided into leading and trailing types. \nNote that the schematics in this section use the usual building scheme where layer 1 (or occasionally layer 0) is the \"bottom\" layer. \nJava Edition Flying Machines.\nEngines.\nEngines are mechanical parts of slime-block based flying machines used to move them.\nIn all cases, a major issue is control, especially how to start and stop the machine. There are several options here:\nSchematics.\nA two-way engine can be made with as few as 6 blocks \u2013 2 Observers, 2 Slime Blocks, and 2 Sticky Pistons. Two-way engines A and B (see gallery above) show two different ways to do this.\nIn both cases, the direction of flight depends on which observer is updated first. Note that in the diagram shown, each observer directly powers a slime block. The dock shown is placed so that the trapdoor will cover the face of the incoming machine's near observer, which lets it send the machine back the way it came.\nAdding honey blocks allows a player to be carried with the machine in relative safety. The rideable engine shown adds two honey blocks, and a player can stand on each of them. It can be made with 14 blocks \u2013 8 slimeblocks, 2 honey blocks, 2 sticky pistons and 2 observers. Getting on and off is another problem...\nTurbo Engine A (see gallery) is a high-speed single-direction engine. It fits into 2\u00d72\u00d76 dimensions and uses 14 blocks. Since zero ticking pistons is not possible on Bedrock Edition, this kind of flying machine will still be the same speed on Bedrock Edition as normal flyers, however, several 2.5 meters per second flying machines have been created for specific use on Bedrock Edition.\nAn engine can also move diagonally by moving alternately along 2 axes. The Diagonal Engine shown is best built out from level 3 (the upper slime--and-piston layer). It moves along its slime-block diagonal, but is guided by immovable (e.g., obsidian) barriers on level 3, so it can follow a straight or curved \"rail\", in whichever direction(s) it \"can\" move until it reaches a corner to block it. It is started by activating either of the observers on top (placing a block, flint-and-steel), and will move away from that corner (that is, it is also a two-way flyer).\n\"Credits:\" design from \"samnrad\" (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGkfZWoMCHiA\"&gt;\"smart diagonal flying machine and curved flying machines\"&lt;/a&gt; \"YouTube\"\nThis video demonstrates two-way engine A above, with long slime-block arms for harvesting, which shuttles between two prepared docks. It can be triggered by placing a block atop the pistons, or by switches at the stations. Note that the harvested crops will be launched at some speed, so this design may be better for an enclosed farm.\nExtensions.\nExtensions are mechanical parts of a fully-automatic flying machine used to push an independent part of a large flying structure. A single &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; only can push or pull up to 12 blocks. Extensions use additional pistons to \"extend\" a slime structure by allowing more blocks to be pushed.\nOne-way extension.\nA one-way extension has 2 parts: a normal piston in the rear, and a slime block (or more) with a power source in the front with space between them.\nOnce the rear part with the piston is pushed, the piston will be activated by a power source from the front part. It will push the slime block (and thus the next part of the flying contraption and its extensions), which pulls the power source with it. The piston will then deactivate and prepare for another push.\nSome simple engines are just made of looped extensions, such that, at any given time one piston is always powered (in these machines it is important to place the redstone blocks last).\nTwo-way extensions.\nA two-way extension consists of an observer powering at least one sticky piston which pushes or pulls a part of the flying contraption. This is possible only in \"Java Edition\" because it's the only version where sticky pistons (upon receiving a short redstone pulse) can push a block and then retract quickly without pulling it back.\nThis type of extension will either continuously pull or push depending on whether the part it's supposed to move is initially retracted or not. If the part is initially retracted and the extension is continuously pulled, the sticky piston will continuously pull the part. On the other hand, if the part is one block away (\"not retracted\") and the extensions is continuously pushed, the sticky piston will continuously push the part. This mechanism necessitates a switch within the flying machine to independently retract and extend the extension before flight, because otherwise, the engine will most likely be unable to push due to the \"stuck\" retracted extensions adding extra load to the engine's pistons.\nDriveable flying machines.\nA flying machine can be designed to not only carry a player along, but allow them to control the machine in flight, starting, stopping, or changing directions. Often due to lag, slime engines can bug allowing the player to fall through the machine. This can be solved by placing the player in a vehicle such as a minecart, by standing on top of a honey block, or by standing inside a &lt;a href=\"Composter\"&gt;Composter&lt;/a&gt;.Note: Placing a minecart in any such build will require a temporary rail, perhaps atop a temporary block for convenience.\nStarting the engine of a flying machine often involves updating a piston or observer. Braking, on the other hand, isn't as straightforward to do in survival because a piston-immovable block must be present to stop the engine. A reliable braking method that was first popularized by SethBling is to attach a noteblock (or any similar redstone component movable by pistons) to the \"face\" of an observer that powers a piston. The piston is placed on the front of the engine, and since extended pistons cannot be pushed by other pistons, activating the noteblock at the right time will stop the engine. \nBy using sticky pistons instead of pistons for the braking components, they also become 2-way extensions. These can be used to carry extra blocks, such as holders for minecarts/minecart chests, passenger roofs, TNT duplicators, etc. \nDriveable flying machine B, 2-way.\nA version of Drivable machine A, modified by kurzawa6's, with minecart chests and a roof attached to the 2 two-way spliters. One extension carries a roof to protect the driver from phantoms, the other carries a cargo module with two minecarts (optionally with chests) \nCredits: Design from \"kurozawa6\" &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOQzipAjhVTQ\"&gt;\"Minecraft Flying Machine: Drivable, 2-Way, And Roofed With 2 Extra Passengers/Cargo\"&lt;/a&gt; \"YouTube\"\nDriveable flying machine C, 2/4-way.\nA 2-way machine which can be reconfigured in the field to go the \"other\" two ways, by mining and replacing four blocks. It can carry two passengers, and has two cargo bays for minecarts with chests (or plain minecarts, for passengers). It uses 20 slime blocks including the cargo bays. Its use is complex, but may be worthwhile just for bragging rights.\nDriveable flying machine D, 4-way.\nA compact four-way engine that is controlled by applying a redstone torch to the central observer.\nDriveable flying machine E, 4-way, compact.\n\"A modification using honeyblocks to my second 4 way flying maching making it rideable in survival. The stopping block can be any movable block exept slime and glazed teracotta. i just used honeyblocks because they are easy to break.\" --FirewolfQuasar\nMore complex engines.\nThe following video shows a complex example, an arbitrarily expandable flying machine with a 2-way engine and multiple extension (each carrying 2 TNT Duplicators):\n\"A 4-way engine (2 vertical directions) that switches directions upon contact\" with a few blocks. \nBedrock engine designs.\nFlying machines are much more restricted due to the lack of &lt;a href=\"quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity&lt;/a&gt; and other piston behaviors. , a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; powered with a 1 tick &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit\"&gt;pulse&lt;/a&gt; will drop the block it is carrying. The absence of these behaviors makes it difficult to create complex flying machines.\nSimple engine 1.\nThese are basic flying machine designs. The shown examples will move to the viewer's left.\nRemoving the &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20redstone\"&gt;block of redstone&lt;/a&gt;, or placing obsidian in front of the observer, will cause the machine to stop. This may be hard to do, unless in creative mode.\nFor players who want to ride their flying machine, it may be hard to add and remove the obsidian or redstone block (especially in survival mode). A slightly easier way is to add layers of another material (such as wood plank) to the machine, stopping just before the limit of what a piston can move and doubling as a practical gondola for the player at the same time. From a position sitting on the machine somewhere, the player may add another wood plank block to the machine, killing the speed. Removing the final block causes the machine to start again.\nSimple engine 2The simple engine 2 provides a narrower but longer design, which requires less &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; than others (less redstone blocks). In this example, the machine would begin moving to the left once the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; on the right is activated. This can be done with a redstone pulse, or just lighting the face with &lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo reverse the direction of this machine, simply move one of the &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Block\"&gt;slime blocks&lt;/a&gt; to the back, and switch the &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; and sticky piston.\nThis design is ideal when redstone is scarce, or when up to 9 blocks need to be placed on the front end (the front half only consists of 3 blocks, with a total of 12 blocks able to be pushed by the piston).\nTrailer\nBy placing an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; onto the side, one can build off of the Simple engine 2 design to make the machine bigger as a whole. Keep in mind that multiple trailer attachments can be placed on the side, up, and/or down simultaneously without exceeding the push/pull limit of 12 blocks. This is one way of creating a extension in Bedrock Edition.\nThis addition can be used to hold more cargo, whether it be entities, &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; (which are only movable in Bedrock Edition), or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; (which can be detonated by a following machine equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Redstone\"&gt;redstone block&lt;/a&gt;).\nMulti-directional engines.\nThis design is multi-directional but it does require a return station to change the direction. The &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s are 1 block higher than everything else and have &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s below them. The return station is only an example, anything that pushes the machine over so that the other &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; is unable to pull the terracotta should work. It may help to watch the videos below to see some more examples.\nExtensions.\nIn Bedrock Edition, it is possible to create extensions, however they are only functional in one direction. This first is the trailing extension (Trailer, shown above), and the leading extension. The leading extension can be made by attaching a backwards-facing &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; directly behind a forward-facing normal &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, both attached to &lt;a href=\"Slime%20Block\"&gt;slime blocks&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\nBedrock Edition: "}

Certain aspects of a panda's behavior and appearance vary depending on its &lt;a href=\"Panda%23Personalities\"&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nPandas spawn rarely in groups of 1\u20132 in &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes at the surface on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s with at least two-block space above them at a light level of 9 or more. They are slightly more common in &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20jungle\"&gt;bamboo jungle&lt;/a&gt;s and have a 5% chance to spawn as cubs instead of adults. They do not spawn on &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; despite that bamboo jungles are covered by it.\nPandas spawn with a randomized personality, with the normal personality being the most common and the brown variant being the rarest.\nDrops.\nUpon death, adult pandas drop:\nBaby pandas have a chance to drop 1 after they sneeze.\nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped.\nLike other baby &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, killing a panda cub yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nPandas act similarly to other neutral mobs; they attack when hurt but only once, similar to &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s. Pandas do not attack on &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Pandas follow any player that is carrying &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; and stop following if the player moves beyond approximately 16 blocks away. They also whimper if a thunderstorm is happening in the area. Adult pandas seek out &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; to eat.\nBaby pandas have a chance (0.01666%) of sneezing every tick. Weak baby pandas are more likely to sneeze with a (0.2%) chance every tick. Sneezing makes all adult pandas within 10 blocks jump and rarely drops a &lt;a href=\"slimeball\"&gt;slimeball&lt;/a&gt;. Baby pandas also occasionally roll over and jump around.\nPandas have one private inventory.\nPandas can be ridden by baby &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; variants.\nA &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used on a panda by normal means. However, a panda can be leashed using a map editor or &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; editor.\nIf a panda is being attacked by a player near a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, that villager displays angry particles. However, it does not affect the &lt;a href=\"Village%23Popularity\"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; of the player.\nPersonalities.\nPandas have different personalities: normal, lazy, worried, playful, aggressive, weak, or brown.\nBreeding.\nThe panda is the only animal to have extra &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt; conditions. , pandas enter love mode when fed with bamboo, but will only breed if there is at least one &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; block (not including shoots) within a five-block radius; otherwise the pandas will briefly shake their heads and not breed until that requirement is met.\n, there must be at least 8 &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; blocks within a five-block radius of each panda in order for them to enter love mode. If a panda is fed without a sufficient amount of bamboo nearby, it sits and eats the &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt; instead of entering love mode.\nOnce pandas successfully breed, they produce a panda cub which remains passive instead of neutral toward that &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nGenetics.\nEach panda has two hidden values called \"\" or \"alleles\", as found in . Pandas have a main gene and a hidden gene, each assigned to a particular trait. Normal, aggressive, lazy, worried, and playful personalities are dominant traits, while weak and brown personalities are recessive traits. If the main gene is a dominant gene, then it will present as the personality regardless of the hidden gene. If the main gene is recessive and the hidden gene is not the same trait, then a normal personality results. As recessive traits, weak and brown personalities occur if both the main and hidden genes of a panda are weak or brown, respectively. The hidden gene is only relevant in determining the panda's personality if the main gene is recessive.\nWhen two pandas breed, each one passes one of their genes to their children, who then randomly mix both obtained genes as their respective main and hidden genes. There is also a chance for each gene of the baby to mutate into another gene. Normal, weak, and brown traits more commonly result from mutations than other traits do. These probabilities also apply to naturally spawned pandas for their main and hidden genes.\nSounds.\nPandas use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nPanda have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Parrots imitate &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s of nearby monsters and can perch on the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s shoulders.\nSpawning.\nParrots naturally spawn in groups of 1\u20132 in &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sparse%20jungle\"&gt;sparse jungle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20jungle\"&gt;bamboo jungle&lt;/a&gt;s above &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUnlike most passive mobs, parrots cannot be &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;bred&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nA parrot drops from one to two &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s upon death. The amount is increased by one per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a range of one to five with Looting III. From &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs are dropped when parrots are killed by a player or a tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nParrots are passive and &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; by flapping its wings. A parrot flies and usually flies upward if it is struck; parrots flap their wings and fall slowly, preventing fall &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Parrots fly under normal conditions, but they can tire and return to the ground after a short time. Parrots crowd and settle around other nearby mobs, including neutral and hostile mobs.\nParrots can be tamed by feeding them &lt;a href=\"wheat%20seeds\"&gt;wheat seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon%20seeds\"&gt;melon seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20seeds\"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot%20seeds\"&gt;beetroot seeds&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"torchflower%20seeds\"&gt;torchflower seeds&lt;/a&gt; with chance of success. Once tamed, with a parrot makes it sit down and stand up.\nA tamed parrot follows the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; unless told to sit and teleports if there is a distance of 12 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s between it and the player. A &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; is displayed to its owner upon death. The parrot teleportation is completely silent. , attempting to feed a parrot a &lt;a href=\"cookie\"&gt;cookie&lt;/a&gt; instantly kills it, emitting &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; particles as it dies. , feeding a cookie to a parrot gives it &lt;a href=\"fatal%20poison\"&gt;fatal poison&lt;/a&gt; instead. This is a reference to the fact that chocolate is toxic to parrots.\nA tamed parrot on the ground can be made to perch on its &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s shoulder by moving through the parrot. On its own, a tamed parrot can also fly to and perch on the player's shoulder, unless it has been told to sit. A player can have one parrot on each shoulder. Parrots always prefer a player's left shoulder first, if it is empty.\nA parrot dismounts its player when the player:\nParrots on a shoulder always look in the same direction the player's head is looking.\nA parrot on a shoulder cannot take any &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; but may get hurt as soon as it dismounts, as when dismounting a player submerged in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nA parrot sitting on the shoulder appears in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; interface.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", a parrot sitting on a shoulder prevents the player from entering a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nImitating sounds.\nParrots imitate the idle &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s of nearby &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Hostile%20mobs\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; and certain &lt;a href=\"Mob%23Neutral%20mobs\"&gt;neutral mobs&lt;/a&gt; (including the hiss of &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s but excluding &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s); they have a detection range of 20 cubical &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s. The sound produced by the parrots is simply the same sound as the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; being mimicked at a higher pitch. Occasionally, a parrot may imitate sounds of mobs that are not in the area.\nParrots dance near a &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt; if a &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt; is inside it. Parrots even have the ability to dance while on a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s shoulder. This is a reference to the Party Parrot meme. The game does not seem to have any real way to determine when the music ends, though; as long as the disc remains in the jukebox, the parrot continues dancing even after the music stops. \nThe dancing radius is 3 blocks from the jukebox. If they dance and then fly beyond this radius, they stop dancing. A parrot does not dance if the music disc was inserted prior to it spawning, dismounting or being within the 3 blocks range. \nSounds.\nGeneric.\nParrots use the \"friendly creatures\" sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nImitations.\nNote that these are the original mob sounds, and not the pitched up ones heard from parrots in-game.&lt;br&gt;\nWhen making their ambient sound, parrots have a chance to trigger a random sound from this list if the difficulty is not Peaceful.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nParrots have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nWhen a parrot is resting on the player's shoulder, it ceases to be a distinct entity and its entity data is stored in the player's codice_1 or codice_2 NBT. See also &lt;a href=\"Player.dat%20format\"&gt;Player.dat format&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "102241", "revid": "51591677", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=102241", "title": "Patrol", "text": "A patrol (officially a pillager patrol) is a rare, naturally-spawning group of &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpawning.\nPatrols spawn as a group of 1 to 6 &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s or 2\u20135 illagers , one of which is the patrol captain. The patrol captain wears an &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"illager%20banner\"&gt;illager banner&lt;/a&gt; in \"Bedrock Edition\" and \"Minecraft Education\", on its head. The other illagers follow the captain around. \nThe patrol captain \"always\" spawns as a pillager, unless &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; are used.\n, patrols never spawn if is set to codice_1.\nConditions.\nPatrols spawn naturally after the world age reaches 100 minutes (5 &lt;a href=\"in-game%20day\"&gt;in-game day&lt;/a&gt;s), then after a delay between 10\u201311 minutes an attempt is made to spawn a patrol with 20% chance of success. After an attempt is made, the delay is reset.\nPatrols spawn in any &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; biome except &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt;, although a patrol may wander through the biome after spawning.\nPatrollers do not spawn in Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Java Edition\".\nPatrols can spawn on any non-&lt;a href=\"fluid\"&gt;fluid&lt;/a&gt; block with a motion-blocking &lt;a href=\"material\"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;. They can spawn during the day on blocks with a block light level of 8 or lower. If a player is within 5 by 5 by 5 sub-chunk cube around a village, patrols do not spawn.\nThe game picks a random location 24\u201348 blocks along each of the X and Z axis away from the player to try to spawn the patrol's captain. If a pillager cannot spawn at the chosen position, it gives up and does not spawn anything. If the captain can spawn, the game tries to spawn the value of codice_2 (rounded up) more pillagers, with each pillager spawning within a 4-block radius square around the previous pillager.\n\"Bedrock Edition\".\n, patrols spawn around 24\u201348 blocks away from the player (or more than 48 blocks away if the player is in a village). Additionally, patrols can spawn in biomes where common monsters cannot spawn such as in:\nPatrols spawn on solid blocks at light level 0\u20137 at the surface.\nCommands.\n\"Bedrock Edition\".\nPlayers can summon patrol captain and patrol members via command within &lt;a href=\"spawn%20event\"&gt;spawn event&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummon patrol captain:\nSummon patrol members:\nSummon unused vindicator patrol captain:\nBehavior.\nPatrols seek villages, wander around, and attack nearby &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, adult &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s. The patrol members' heads turn to follow a player or villager-like mob who looks at them or attracts their attention. A player or villager-like mob who approaches within 10 blocks of the patrol provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking, and pursuing if the player flees. The pursuit lasts until either of the parties dies or gets 10 blocks away.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es that join the patrol assume the patrol's behavior.\n, any &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es that did not spawn with the patrol can join the patrol if sufficiently near a patrol captain. Evokers and illusioners who join a patrol wander around but do not seek out targets as other illager members in the patrol. They still do cast spells to attack mobs, however.\nIf a \"Johnny\" &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; joins a patrol, all patrol members assume the Johnny vindicator's aggressive behavior, attacking any non-illager mob, which includes witches and ravagers (which are not illagers in \"Java Edition\"), except baby villagers and ghasts. \n, when one of the patrol members is attacked, it alerts nearby patrol members within 10 blocks to attack the same target as a swarm. The attacker can be any mob and doesn't need to be a player, and the distance between attacker and patrol can be up to 64 blocks away from alerted patrol members. This means that a &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt; who accidentally spits on a patrol member can provoke all of the members of the patrol at once. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt; patrol members target and attack the player without prior provocation.\nA patrol spawned by a player might not function properly; instead, causing some of the patrol members to wander around. One of the ways to fix this is to reduce the size of the patrol to around 5 members. Another way is to make the captain move, as the rest of the patrol members can move along with it and follow it around. &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es might not function properly in a patrol because the witch is not an &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust like normal &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, when a patrol pillager's arrow hits another pillager, the hit pillager does not retaliate.\nThe patrol captain always drops an &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"illager%20banner\"&gt;illager banner&lt;/a&gt; in \"Bedrock Edition\", upon death.\nBad Omen.\nUpon killing a patrol captain (either directly or when a tamed wolf kills it), the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; receives the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect for 100 minutes, which has no consequences unless the player enters a village. Upon entering a village, the effect is removed from the player and a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; spawns nearby after about five seconds. , the level of the Bad Omen determines the chance of enchantment on raid members' weapons and additional waves. The number of waves depends on the difficulty. In \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", killing multiple pillager captains does not grant another level of Bad Omen, and does not increase the chance of raiding mobs yielding enchanted weapons. The Bad Omen effect can be removed by drinking &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, entering a village, waiting until the effect is over, or the player's death."}

They attack by diving at the player from the sky to bite them. Usually, they appear in trios.\nSpawning.\nPhantoms spawn unless the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 is set to codice_2. The spawning mechanics differ between \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; editions. In both editions, they spawn in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" &lt;a href=\"statistic\"&gt;statistic&lt;/a&gt; is at least 1 hour (72000 ticks or 3 in-game days). This statistic is reset when the player dies or enters a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the player must not have a block overhead that &lt;a href=\"opacity\"&gt;blocks light&lt;/a&gt; in any way; for example, leaves prevent phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; does not, as its light opacity is 0. Phantoms do not spawn in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, but they do spawn in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nBedrock Edition.\nPhantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap. Phantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5. Phantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters. However, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds the phantom appears somewhere in a 21\u00d715\u00d721 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.\nJava Edition.\nPhantoms attempt to spawn every . They spawn only if it is night or a thunderstorm is happening, the player is above sea level (y=64) with sky access, and the &lt;a href=\"local%20difficulty\"&gt;local difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is greater than a randomly chosen value between 0.0 and 3.0. The chance of a successful spawn is , where \"x\" is the number of ticks since the player last entered a bed or died. This roughly comes to a (25.0%) chance on day 4, a (40.0%) chance on day 5, a () (50.0%) chance on day 6, (about 57.1%) chance on day 7, and so on.\nIf all conditions are met, a group of phantoms attempt to spawn 20\u201334 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s above the player, and off to the side by a &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt; of up to 10 blocks. The number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in &lt;a href=\"Easy\"&gt;Easy&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, 1-3 in &lt;a href=\"Normal\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;, and 1-4 in &lt;a href=\"Hard\"&gt;Hard&lt;/a&gt;. Phantoms can spawn inside buildings, if the player is outside and the building is both near enough and the building has a large enough cavity for them to spawn inside.\nPhantoms are counted toward the hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; cap, but they don't adhere to it when spawning. Their spawning mechanic is based on the location of players in the world rather than by chance, unlike regular &lt;a href=\"mob%20spawning\"&gt;mob spawning&lt;/a&gt;. Phantom spawning is completely independent of the biome, meaning they can spawn in biomes that normally prevent hostile mob spawning such as &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20fields\"&gt;mushroom fields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20void\"&gt;the void&lt;/a&gt;. Phantoms increase in number every consecutive night a player hasn't entered a bed and stop spawning when the player lies down in bed.\nDrops.\nPhantoms drop when killed:\nBehavior.\nWhen idle, phantoms fly around in a roughly circular pattern within 15 to 25 blocks of a player horizontally and within 24 to 35 blocks of a player vertically, leaving a trail of gray smoke while doing so. Their movement speed is one of the fastest of any mob, up to 20 blocks per second. They have a large search radius, targeting and following players from 64 blocks away. Once every 10-20 seconds they swoop down or up quickly to attack. If stopped or hurt during this action, the phantom retreats back to its original elevation. When a path to its original elevation is obstructed by a block, the phantom continues attempting to return to its original elevation until it either attacks or moves out from under the block. Phantoms do not attack an exposed player sleeping in a bed. \nPhantoms can move through water at their normal speed. In Bedrock Edition, a phantom underwater attempts to fly to the surface, and dies from drowning after 20 seconds if trapped underwater. Phantoms do not drown in \"Java Edition\".\nA phantom's body disappears when under the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; effect, but its eyes and smoke &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s are still visible.\n&lt;a href=\"Cat\"&gt;Cat&lt;/a&gt;s hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 64 blocks away from them. , phantoms also avoid &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s in the same manner.\nUndead.\nLike other &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs, phantoms are harmed by the &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt; effect, healed by the &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Instant Damage&lt;/a&gt; effect, immune to the &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; effects, ignored by the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, and affected by the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nLike &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, phantoms burn in sunlight. They burn even when equipped with &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;s through commands.\nSounds.\nPhantoms use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nPhantoms have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Pickaxe blocks can be incredibly useful for all kinds of redstone contraptions as they are moveable by pistons an make for excellent mining devices.\nA pickaxe block can be placed so that its mining side faces in any direction, including up or down. When placed, the mining side faces toward the player. The texture of this side is identical to the output of an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;.\nActivation.\nA pickaxe block can be activated by:\nA pickaxe block is \"not\" activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.\nInteresting behavior.\nAs previously mentioned, the pickaxe block is the only glitchless way of breaking bedrock in an uncheated vanilla game of survival \"Minecraft\". On top of that it can also destroy &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%20Frame\"&gt;end portal frames&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"End%20gateway\"&gt;end gateways&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Barrier\"&gt;barrier blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Structure%20Block\"&gt;structure blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Structure%20Void\"&gt;structure void&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Command%20Block\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt; (Without dropping them).\nThe pickaxe block can destroy (and drop) the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; without it teleporting away.\nAlthough it can be crafted using any pickaxe, it actually makes no difference which one is used, as there is only one variant of the block which doesn't save additional NBT data.\nIssues.\nPickaxe blocks are an unsupported &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; due to being an joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed."}

Pigs are a source of &lt;a href=\"porkchop\"&gt;porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s and can be equipped with a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt; to be driven.\nSpawning.\n, pigs spawn in groups of 4 above &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s at a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 9 or more in any grassy &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; biome except in &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Badlands%23Wooded%20Badlands\"&gt;wooded badlands&lt;/a&gt;. Individual pigs rarely may spawn on grass after the world generation. , pigs spawn in groups of 1 to 3 above grass blocks at a light level of 7 or more in any grassy Overworld biome except in snowy plains, meadows and wooded badlands plateaus. Individuals regularly spawn on grass after the world generation.\nPigs spawn in animal pens, stables and in butcher house backyards in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s. 95% of pigs spawn as adults and 5% of pigs spawn as piglets. Pigs cannot spawn naturally with a saddle.\nDrops.\nAn adult pig &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; upon death:\nKilling a piglet yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s nor &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nPigs roam the Overworld avoiding hazards and harmful falls. A pig flees for a short time when harmed.\nWhen a pig or piglet is struck by &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;, it transforms into a &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; or baby zombified piglin, respectively. If the pig was equipped with a saddle, the saddle is lost and the player dismounts. If lightning strikes a pig in &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, the pig does not transform but takes normal damage from the strike.\nRiding.\nIt is possible to ride an adult pig by using a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt; on it. When a saddle is used on a pig, the pig might stare at the player for a few seconds. Saddled pigs are controllable with a &lt;a href=\"carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt;. They start slow but accelerate to 5.20\u00a0blocks/s. Piglets cannot be saddled nor ridden.\nPig cannot float on water when being controlled. Pigs can be controlled through 1-block-high bodies of water with a carrot and stick, but deeper water causes the player to dismount. the carrot on a stick while riding a pig makes it run faster at the cost of 7 durability. If the pig and rider fall, then fall damage doesn't cause any knockback or slower movement speed.\nA player can travel through a space 1 block high by riding a pig. \nBreeding.\nPigs follow players within six blocks using &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Carrot%20on%20a%20Stick\"&gt;carrots on a stick&lt;/a&gt;.

After breeding, the parents have a cooldown of 5 minutes before they can breed again. Piglets mature in 20 minutes and stay near their parents. Feeding them reduces the remaining time to maturity by 10%.\nSounds.\nPigs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nPigs have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

They also have a 10% chance per &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; slot of spawning with golden armor, meaning they have a 34.39% chance of spawning with any armor and a 0.01% chance of spawning with a full set.\nPiglins spawn in Peaceful difficulty, but are passive to players.\nDrops.\nAdults have an 8.5% chance of dropping the held item (a or with random &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;). Each &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; level increases this chance by 1%. Babies spawn without equipment. \n, a picked-up item always &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; with the same durability as when picked up. , armor picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break depending on how much damage the piglin takes. Piglins do not drop &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingots\"&gt;gold ingots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raw%20porkchops\"&gt;raw porkchops&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"cooked%20porkchops\"&gt;cooked porkchops&lt;/a&gt; that they have picked up. In both versions, a piglin also drops a piglin &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; when killed in the vicinity of the explosion of a &lt;a href=\"charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a piglin is killed in one hit while admiring a gold ingot, the gold ingot is dropped upon the piglin's death.\nArmor.\nAdults sometimes spawn with 1-4 pieces of armor, which can be:\nThese have a chance of being &lt;a href=\"enchanted\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese are dropped with an 8.5% chance and random &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to their drops, piglins can also pick up other types of armor, including wearable items from the player.\nExperience.\nAdults drop and an additional per armor piece if killed by a player or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Baby piglins only drop .\nBehavior.\nPiglins snort enviously while watching players holding a gold-related item or anything else. Like &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, piglins can open and close wooden &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s but cannot open &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s, all &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, and iron doors. Piglins cannot swim and can drown if submerged. Unlike zombified variant, they are not naturally immune to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nIdle piglins are afraid of &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"soul%20fire\"&gt;soul fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul%20torch\"&gt;soul torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"soul%20lantern\"&gt;soul lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, and lit &lt;a href=\"soul%20campfire\"&gt;soul campfire&lt;/a&gt;s. If a piglin comes within a certain distance of any of these things, it will squeal in fear and run away until the object or mob is out of its sight range. Hostile piglins lose their fear of soul fire items, but they will still flee from zombified piglins and zoglins and will not approach the player if they are near either of these mobs. Baby piglins additionally retreat from &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, but adult piglins will attack these on sight. Crossbow piglins do not reload their crossbows when spawned, unlike &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s. They reload only when provoked.\nBaby piglins are passive and play with baby &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin. They can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away. They can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons. However, they are unable to pick up &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, baby piglins never grow up.\nIf the player attacks a piglin, this action will not aggravate zombified piglins in the area. Infighting between these two mobs can start when an aggravated piglin carrying a crossbow shoots a zombified piglin by accident. When this happens, all nearby zombified piglins will become angry and pursue the piglin until it is either killed or runs out of their sight range. \nAggravation.\nAdult piglins are neutral if the player is wearing at least one piece of golden &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. Piglins are provoked by any player who: \nOther.\nPiglins do not react to the opening or breaking of s, s, s, s, s, or s. Opening or breaking a does not provoke the piglins. Breaking a does not provoke them either, despite piglins admiring them as gold.\nAttacking.\nWhen a piglin is attacking, it holds its dominant arm and sword in front of it, similarly to a &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;. Adult piglins are hostile toward &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s. They congregate within 16 blocks and attack in hordes.\nWhen attacking with a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, piglins shoot arrows every 2 seconds. , they walk backward (stopping if at the edge of a drop) as soon as the target is close. , their crossbows can break if it runs out of durability, making the piglins use their fists, while their crossbows never break. Unlike mobs armed with &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, they do not strafe from left to right while shooting. Piglins with &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s rush at the target.\nIf a group of piglins successfully defeat their target, they gather at the site of their target's demise and emit \"celebration sounds\". However, piglins do not have a chance of dancing unless their target was a hoglin.\nWhen a mob attacks a piglin or piglin brute with no AI, other piglins nearby do not attack the mob that attacked the piglin or piglin brute with no AI.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s attack both adult and baby piglins; however, piglins do not attack iron golems without provocation.\nThe detection range of piglins is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;.\nHunting.\nPiglins sometimes attack &lt;a href=\"hoglins\"&gt;hoglins&lt;/a&gt;, causing other piglins and piglin brutes in that area to attack the targeted hoglin as well.\nAdults do not immediately attack adult hoglins on sight, but a piglin has a random chance to make the decision to hunt a hoglin (this decision is almost never made if the piglin recently hunted, but other piglins can still start a hunt). Once that piglin attacks the hoglin, all other piglins and piglin brutes in that area become hostile to the hoglin. If outnumbered by hoglins, the piglins flee, making \"retreat\" sounds. After defeating a hoglin, piglins have a 10% chance to do a \"victory dance\" by bobbing their heads and sticking out their arms like a T-pose.\nThe more piglins there are, the bigger chance of a hunt might happen (because more piglins that detect the hoglin will each have a 10% chance of starting a hunt).\nAfter a hunt, any nearby piglins pick up the porkchops or cooked porkchops the hoglin dropped, but not the leather. Piglin brutes never pick up any porkchops or leather.\nPiglins that spawned as part of a bastion remnant during world generation do not hunt.\nPiglin brutes also join in hunts started by piglins, but do not start a hunt themselves.\nBeing distracted.\nPiglins briefly stop attacking when given gold items. If the player offers a gold ingot, &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; then takes place as it normally would. They resume attacking once the barter is complete. If the player distracts them with a gold item and equips a piece of gold armor while the piglin is examining the item, then the piglin ceases hostility. They may also cease hostility if distracted enough times. If the player breaks any gold-related block or hurts/kills a piglin, and then distracts the piglin up to 5 times with a piece of gold armor equipped, the piglin ceases hostility entirely.\nBartering.\nAdult piglins can trade gold ingots for certain items, when a gold ingot is dropped near them or the player uses it while looking at them. The piglin proceeds to \"examine\" the ingot for six or eight seconds, then drops a random item from the &lt;a href=\"Bartering%23Items%20bartered\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt;. However, baby piglins examine the ingot but instead run away without dropping an item. Piglins can also pick up items dropped by a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;. The pool for what piglins can barter may be modified in a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;. However, piglins can still barter while riding another mob.\nPicking up items.\nPiglins can pick up and equip any &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s they come across, preferring &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;-related items, which they actively seek out. A piglin inspects any gold-related item before equipping, holding or putting that item in its inventory for six seconds after picking it up. However, items not related to gold are held or equipped (if the piglin does not have any gold equipment) instantly. Piglins do not pick up any items if the is set to .\nPiglins pick up &lt;a href=\"raw%20porkchop\"&gt;raw porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cooked%20porkchop\"&gt;cooked porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s that are within 1 block from them, unless they have done so within the last 10 seconds.\nPiglins have eight hidden &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; slots in which they can stack &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. Piglins with full inventories do not attempt to pick up gold-related items, except gold ingots. Baby piglins attempt to pick up any item and do not give the player any items in exchange for gold ingots. Adult piglins can pick up &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s (which do not help to obtain better items from bartering but are immediately placed in their inventory), &lt;a href=\"porkchop\"&gt;porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Porkchop\"&gt;cooked porkchops&lt;/a&gt; (they do not actively seek out and contemplate porkchops). Piglins drop any of these items upon death aside from gold ingots, raw porkchops, and cooked porkchops.\nWhen a piglin is admiring a gold ingot while bartering, it does not run away from nearby zoglins or nearby zombified piglins.\nPiglins with crossbows can pick up other crossbows and equip them.\nLike other mobs capable of picking up items, piglins pick up armor and weapons. Piglins pick up armor that is better than the armor they are already wearing, although they prefer gold over stronger armor. For example, a piglin does not pick up leather boots if it is already wearing diamond boots, but may discard a netherite chestplate to pick up a golden chestplate. However, they cannot unequip and discard armor with &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Binding\"&gt;Curse of Binding&lt;/a&gt;.\nPiglins that spawned in a bastion remnant during world generation, or that have picked up items or equipment, do not despawn naturally.\nItems picked up by a piglin do not drop when the piglin is killed.\nItems that piglins want are listed under the &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt; with the exception of &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s, which piglins pick up instantly to trigger the &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; \"O(oo)h Shiny!\". \"Piglins do not want any other items\", even if they are related to gold in some way.\nZombification.\nWhen in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, piglins transform into &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s after 15 seconds, retaining their armor, held items and their name. However, they cannot shoot a crossbow, using it as a melee weapon instead. Upon transformation, the spawned zombified piglin has the &lt;a href=\"Nausea\"&gt;Nausea&lt;/a&gt; effect for 10 seconds; this is just a cosmetic effect. When a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops anything except equipped weapons and armor in its inventory; other items in its inventory disappear. In Bedrock Edition, if the game is set to &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, the piglin despawns instead of transforming because hostile mobs do not exist in Peaceful difficulty. A piglin that returns to the Nether before 15 seconds remains unchanged, although the 15-second portal cooldown usually prevents them from returning during that time.\nA piglin does not zombify outside the Nether if its tag is set to .

Unlike regular piglins, they do not barter or retreat, and they cannot be distracted with &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ingot\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, they always charge at the player on sight with their golden axes.\nSpawning.\nA small number of piglin brutes spawn in &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnants\"&gt;bastion remnants&lt;/a&gt; \"only upon generation\" and in some rooms. They do not have a baby variant.\nPiglin brutes spawn with a golden axe, occasionally with enchantments. They never spawn with &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and do not equip armor from the ground, although they can still be equipped with armor via dispensers or commands.\nBehavior.\nPiglin brutes are hostile mobs.

They are neutral toward all other mobs, defending themselves if provoked. This includes iron golems, which themselves are hostile towards piglin brutes and attack them on sight. \nPiglin brutes also attack any mob (except for &lt;a href=\"goats\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt;) that attacks any piglin, or piglin brute, either by accident or purposefully. Examples include retaliation for attacks by &lt;a href=\"snow%20golems\"&gt;snow golems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golems\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt;.

They attack by firing arrows at the player.\nSpawning.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", a pillager spawned by a player using a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s can be a captain which has an &lt;a href=\"Banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt; sticking out of its head.\nPatrols.\n, the number of pillagers &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;ing in each &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt; varies from one to five and depends on the &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, with one spawning as a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;patrol captain&lt;/a&gt;. Patrols occur after 5 in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without &lt;a href=\"generated%20structure\"&gt;generated structure&lt;/a&gt;s. A patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block. The individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level less than 9, regardless of sky light.\n, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers. One of these pillagers is a patrol captain. After 5 in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, at a light level of 7 and below on Easy or any light level on Normal and Hard difficulty.\nOutposts.\nPillagers continually spawn in a 72\u00d754\u00d772 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; volume centered on the top floor in a &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Some pillagers spawn as outpost captains. They may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8. \n, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.\n, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner. A maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.\nRaids.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress. Despite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total. \nOne pillager spawns riding a &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt; in the fifth wave. \n, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; on the seventh wave.\n, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onwards, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the raid captain.\nDrops.\nA pillager &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; upon death:\n, pillagers that were spawned by raids have a 6% chance on easy and normal or 80% chance on hard difficulties to drop these:\nBehavior.\nPillagers are hostile toward &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s and adult &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s. Pillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs. In Bedrock Edition, a pillager that accidentally harms a &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; causes it to retaliate and attack the pillager. In \"Java Edition\", pillagers do not retaliate on vindicators or evokers that attack them.\nWhen a player is in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode or applied with the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player. If a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy. If a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.\nA pillager attacks by shooting &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s from its crossbows every three seconds from up to eight blocks away and pursues enemies for up to 64 blocks in \"Java Edition\" or 16 blocks in Bedrock Edition.\nPillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows in \"Java Edition\". In \"Bedrock Edition\", pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked, although they stop and look around, pointing their crossbows along. Pillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded.\nThe patrol captain wears an &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"illager%20banner\"&gt;illager banner&lt;/a&gt; in Bedrock and &lt;a href=\"Education%20Edition\"&gt;Education Edition&lt;/a&gt;s, on its head. The other illagers follow the captain around. The pillagers that are part of a &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt; do not attack immediately. The patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention. If the player or villager-like mob attacks or approaches within ten blocks of the patrol members, then this provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.\nIf raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing. Unarmed pillagers also cheer. , pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.\nPillagers can take and equip illager banners within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers do not search for ominous banners.\nIn \"Java Edition,\" if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding illagers and goats) or player, it will alert other pillagers to target the attacker unless the pillager was killed in one hit.\nCrossbow usage.\nJava Edition.\nPillagers can also use crossbows in their &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt;. When a pillager finds a target, the pillager chases the target, then locks the target in its attack range and loads its crossbow.\nPillagers with their crossbows loaded can attack at any blocks away if the target is out of their attack range.\nPillagers, unlike &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, attack on sight, not regarding distance, although attacking a pillager, vindicator or evoker far away causes the attacked illager and the same type of illagers around the attacked illager to attack the player regardless of distance. \nThe command codice_1 summons a passive pillager that does not attack.\nA pillager's &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; eventually breaks with repeated use, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs. Unarmed pillagers are passive toward the player, iron golems and villagers, but they still frighten &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s are still hostile toward them. This also includes pillagers that \"don't\" have a crossbow, which means any pillagers with a sword or any weapon other than a crossbow are still passive. An unarmed pillager always faces any player in its field of view or any mob that attacks it.\nA pillager spawned with arrows or &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s in its off-hand slot will use them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammo. When firing firework rockets, pillagers will aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.\nIf a pillager's arrow hits a neutral or hostile mob by accident, the mob attacks the pillager.\nBedrock Edition.\nPillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.\nPillagers use an outdated behavior. They also have different arm textures. Pillagers load their crossbows upon spawning or if their crossbows are unloaded. When a pillager finds a target, it loads its crossbow first, chases the target and attacks upon in range. Pillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows. \nA &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; can equip a pillager with &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. However, an armor item isn't rendered on pillagers.\nIf a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by &lt;a href=\"spawn%20event\"&gt;spawn event&lt;/a&gt; command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs. This is due to the fact that in the &lt;samp&gt;pillager.json&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;ranged piglin.json&lt;/samp&gt; files, the codice_2 have both codice_3 and codice_4, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the codice_5 behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the codice_6 behavior.\nUnlike in \"Java Edition\", the crossbows of pillagers don't break.\nPillagers use a melee attack while underwater, unlike pillagers in \"Java Edition\" that maintain using crossbows underwater, although the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.\nBad Omen.\nA &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; receives the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; status effect by drinking an &lt;a href=\"Ominous%20Bottle\"&gt;Ominous Potion&lt;/a&gt;. The effect lasts for 100 minutes (five in-game days) and can be removed by drinking &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;. When a player afflicted with Bad Omen enters a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; commences in that village, bringing about waves of illagers that seek and try to kill all &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEach patrol spawns one pillager captain. While outposts can continually spawn pillager captains, each captain inflicts the player who killed it with one level of Bad Omen upon death. \n&lt;a href=\"Raid%20captain\"&gt;Raid captain&lt;/a&gt;s do not inflict Bad Omen when defeated in a raid. \n, killing multiple captains in succession raises the Bad Omen level to a maximum of V, increasing the chance of pillagers and vindicators in the resulting &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; wielding enchanted weapons. As long as the Bad Omen level is higher than I, the resulting raid includes an additional wave with a raider composition identical to that of the last wave.\nSounds.\nPillagers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nPillagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

{"id": "102571", "revid": "50754776", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=102571", "title": "Pillager Outpost", "text": "A pillager outpost is an assortment of &lt;a href=\"structures\"&gt;structures&lt;/a&gt; inhabited by &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s. \nGeneration.\nPillager outposts are semi-rare structures, generating every several hundred to couple thousand blocks. This makes them rarer than &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s but less rare than &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPillager outposts can generate naturally in any village-generating biome, including:\nPillager outposts also generate in the following biomes, where villages do not spawn:\n, pillager outposts never generate too close to, or within, villages. They can do so as well as generate far away from villages.\n, if an outpost spawns in the water or in the air (e.g., spawning near a &lt;a href=\"savanna%20plateau\"&gt;savanna plateau&lt;/a&gt;), then a platform of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; spawns underneath it in a circular shape. This also applies to the smaller structures such as tents, targets, &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; piles, and cages. On occasion, the smaller structures still spawn in the air despite having a platform below them, depending on how high up they are.\n, pillager outposts generate with foundations similar to that of a woodland mansion: watchtowers use &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, birch &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, and dark oak logs as their foundation; tents and cages generate dark oak planks as their foundation; log piles use horizontal dark oak logs as their foundation; and targets generate cobblestone as a foundation.\nThe outpost tower generates each time. Up to 4 other smaller structures may spawn around the periphery of the main outpost structure.\nEight extra &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; blocks also generate around the outpost.\nMobs.\nIron golems and allays spawn only during the generation of the outpost structures. An iron golem has a 85% chance of spawning. Meanwhile, the allay has a 50% chance of spawning. These mobs spawn in cages. The iron golem can punch pillagers who are one block away from the fences of the cage. \nBoth regular pillagers and &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;pillager captain&lt;/a&gt;s can continuously spawn around the structure. Pillagers can still spawn if a player is inside the tower. they spawn in a 72\u00d754\u00d772 area centered on the top level of the watchtower, the same level as the chest. , they spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost; specifically, they choose the northwest corner of the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top.\n, only pillagers may spawn within a pillager outpost spawn area. Pillagers may naturally spawn on any valid opaque block (except leaves) as long as the block light level is 8 or less. They cannot, however, spawn on blocks that emit a light level of 14 or greater. There is a 6% chance a pillager will spawn as a patrol leader.\n, there are 15 jigsaw blocks that can generate the structures around the tower. Each structure has a 1 in 13 chance of being generated, including allay and iron golem cages. When generated, iron golem cages spawn one golem, and allay cages spawn two allays.\nA total of eight pillagers, including the pillager captain, spawns in a pillager outpost.\nBad Omen.\nUpon killing an outpost captain, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; receives 1 level of the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect applied to them for 100 minutes (5 in-game days) \"(1.20 and below)\". In 1.21 and above, the player upon killing an outpost captain will receive 1 &lt;a href=\"Ominous%20Bottle\"&gt;ominous bottle&lt;/a&gt;. \nStructure.\nA pillager outpost consists of a 4 level watchtower with other smaller structures around it.\n&lt;a href=\"Structure%20block\"&gt;Structure block&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to manually load pieces of the pillager outpost from the folder in &lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt;. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter , and press LOAD.\nHistory.\n "}

When codice_2, depending on the age, the chance of drop is different. On codice_3, they drop nothing. But on codice_4, they have a chance to drop themselves.\nNatural generation.\nHanging mangrove propagules generate under leaf blocks of mangrove trees that spawn in &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;mangrove swamps&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-generation.\nApplying &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; to a block of &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20leaves\"&gt;mangrove leaves&lt;/a&gt; with a space underneath produces a hanging mangrove propagule with codice_5. \nTrading.\n, a mangrove propagule is sold by the &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt; for 5 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nGrowing trees.\nA hanging mangrove propagule cannot grow into a tree.\nLike saplings, mangrove propagules can grow only if a player is within a certain radius, even in loaded chunks. \nAlso as with saplings, mangrove propagules have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees. When a tree is to be grown, a height is chosen and then the ground and space are checked; if the ground is bad or there is not space for the chosen height, the tree does not grow. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used to speed up the growth of the sapling, even to grow the tree without sufficient light.\nMangrove propagules can be placed all variants of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; (except &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s) or &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as on &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;. it requires a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of at least 9. A mangrove also requires at least 6 empty spaces above the propagule. The height of the tree depends on how far the roots can spread horizontally. The roots can spread up to 5 blocks away from the propagule. It requires at least one solid block within the 9\u00d79\u00d79 cube directly underneath and centered on the sapling outside the column where the sapling is, and solid blocks for the bottoms of the roots to land on within 11 blocks below the sapling in a 9\u00d79 area. The farther the solid blocks are below the sapling, the more attempts it takes to generate a suitable tree shape. Mud does not count as a solid block.\nDirt blocks in the space above the propagule are an exception. Dirt blocks do not stop the tree from growing. The dirt remains in place and the rest of the tree generates normally around it (it is possible to grow a tree that contains only one &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; block at the original sapling location, with a column of dirt above where the rest of the trunk should be and leaves spreading out from it). , all types of log block and wood block and their stripped versions are also treated like dirt blocks (they don't stop growth). , log and wood blocks are treated like other block types and stop the tree from growing if they are above it.\nWhen a propagule on a &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; grows into a tree, the grass block becomes a dirt block.\nBees.\n&lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt;s engage in a pollinating behavior with mangrove propagules, increasing the honey level in &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;s by 1.\nBreeding.\nMangrove propagules can be fed to bees for breeding, and reduce the remaining growth duration of baby bees by 10%. Bees also follow a player holding a mangrove propagule.\nDecoration.\nMangrove propagules can be placed in a &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuel.\nMangrove propagules can be used as a fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 0.5 items per sapling.\nComposting.\nPlacing a mangrove propagule into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of saplings yields an average of 2.74 bonemeal."}

The map's zoom scale is 1:8. The map is updated only while the player holds it.\nTrading.\nNovice-level cartographer &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; sell a single empty map for 7 &lt;a href=\"Emerald\"&gt;emeralds&lt;/a&gt; as their trades.\n, cartographer villagers may give players with the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; effect an empty map.\nUsage.\nMapping.\nCrafting a map creates an empty map. The map is drawn for the first time when it is held and used (with \"\"). This map can then be adjusted to different zoom levels. After conversion to a drawn map item, it starts to draw a top-down view of the player's surroundings, with North pointing to the top of the map. A pointed oval pointer indicates the player's position on the map, and moves in real-time as the player moves across the terrain shown on the map. The map does \"not\" center on the player when created, rather, the world is broken up into large invisible grid squares, and the map displays the area of whichever grid square it is in when it is first used. For example, if a player uses a new map in a certain grid square, and then moves a distance away and uses another fresh map but is still within the same grid square, both maps appear identical. To make a map that is not identical to the first one, the player would have to move outside of the edges of the first map (because then they would be in a new grid square). This way, no two maps of the same size can ever partially overlap and every map can display only a fixed area.\nTo record the world on a map, that specific map must be held in the player's hands while the player moves around the world. The world is recorded as-is during exploration, meaning that if the world is modified, a player must revisit the area while holding the map to update the map's view. Maps can also be &lt;a href=\"Map%23Cloning\"&gt;cloned&lt;/a&gt;. If a player holds a map whose one or more clones are on display in item frames, updates are made on all clone-connected maps. \nOther players are displayed on the map only if they have a map in their inventory cloned from the one being looked at. When placing a map into an &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;, the map displays with a green pointer shown at the location of the item frame. This is to help the player see where they are in relation to the area that the map is showing. If the player leaves a map in an item frame and views a clone of it, the green pointer remains in the spot of the framed copy. This can be used to set up waypoints. Unexplored areas are transparent, making the item frame visible.\nWhen the player leaves the area shown on a specific map, the player pointer transforms into a white dot that moves on that map. The marker shrinks to a smaller white dot if the player is far from the map's center: the area is 320 by 320 blocks per scale factor. The dot moves along the edge of the map to show the relative location of the player. However , the pointer remains as an arrow but shrinks until the player is near the area shown on the map.\nWhile maps in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; work, they show only the red-and-gray pattern, regardless of the blocks placed. The only useful function is finding where the player is in relation to placed framed maps, which show as green pointers. Additionally, the player pointer rapidly spins and is not a good indicator of direction. Placing a &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; still shows it on the map as usual. Having a smaller map image while riding a &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt; in the Nether can help one to see one's footing while traveling over &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\n, when using a map from another dimension, the map shows the player's position and direction when they were last in the dimension of the map. , however, the player can use maps from one dimension while in another dimension. For locator maps, the place marker changes color depending on the dimension that the player is currently in (white for the Overworld, red for &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and magenta for &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;). An Overworld map in the Nether shows the player's corresponding location and direction in the Overworld. Similarly, a Nether Map in the Overworld shows the player's corresponding location in the Overworld, but the place marker spins, just like a Nether map in the Nether. An Overworld map in the End shows the world spawn. A Nether map cannot be used in the End \u2014 the map appears, but the place marker is not shown anywhere \u2014 and similarly, an End map cannot be used in the Overworld or the Nether.\nA player can make a large piece of pixel art (128\u00d7128) facing upward, center a map on it, and place that map in an &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt; to create a custom picture. Locking is recommended. See &lt;a href=\"Map%20item%20format%23Map%20Pixel%20Art\"&gt;Map item format#Map Pixel Art&lt;/a&gt; for details on the techniques.\nMaps display as a mini-map when held in the off-hand, or if the off-hand slot is occupied; the map is full-sized only when held in the dominant hand with both hands free.\nA map always positions itself facing towards North when placed horizontally within an item frame regardless of how the map is placed.\nMap content.\nMaps consist of square pixels arranged like pixels in a 128\u00d7128 square pattern, with each pixel representing a square portion of land. , the &lt;a href=\"Map%20item%20format%23Color%20table\"&gt;color of a map pixel&lt;/a&gt; generally matches the color of the most common &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block in the corresponding area, as seen from the sky. 'Minority blocks' in the target area have no effect on the color of the pixel, thus small features tend to be undetectable on zoomed-out maps.\n, the &lt;a href=\"Map%20item%20format%23Color%20table\"&gt;color of a map pixel&lt;/a&gt; instead matches the single top-most opaque block in a grid sized by the map magnification pixel size (see the table in the \"Player marker and pointer\" section below). For example, a 3/4 magnification map has a pixel size of 8x8 blocks; this means the map will read only the top-most opaque blocks at the 0,0 coordinate, the 8,0 coordinate, the 0,8 coordinate, etcetera, ignoring all other blocks in the area. This means that , map pixel art requires only one block per pixel regardless of map magnification.\n, grass, foliage and water colors that are biome-dependent are represented accurately on a map.\nMaps also show ground up to about 15 blocks below the surface of the water in oceans as slightly lighter blue, to show where the ground rises. This is not true with land above water. Higher elevations in the world mean lighter colors on the map. The map records the surface even as the player moves below the surface.\nA standard map represents 128x128 blocks (1 block per pixel, 8x8 &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt;) but maps can be zoomed-out to represent up to 2048x2048 blocks (16 square blocks per pixel, 128x128 &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt;).\nSome relevant distances: 64 blocks (4 chunks) is the update radius from a player in the Overworld and the End. However, it is half this (32 blocks) in the Nether. Also, 1024 blocks is the minimum Overworld distance from a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;, at which players can build another portal and expect to reach a new location in the Nether. This is the distance across a 1:8 map, and also from a 1:16 map's center to its edge.\nPlayer marker and pointer.\n, every map contains a marker that marks the position of the player, and points in the same direction as the player. When a player moves out of a map, a big white dot appears and moves relative to the player's position. The pointer either disappears when the player moves away a certain distance from the border of the map or, in case of &lt;a href=\"explorer%20map\"&gt;explorer map&lt;/a&gt;s, the big white dot changes to a smaller white dot. The distance required for the small white dot to appear(explorer maps) or for the big dot to vanish (normal maps) changes with the scaling of the map.\n, a map can be crafted with or without this marker, and a map without a position marker can add one later by adding a compass to the map. When a map is crafted without a compass, it's simply called an \"empty map\", but when crafted with a compass, it's called an \"empty locator map\". The marker also turns red if the player enters the Nether with an Overworld map and shows the player's Overworld location relative to the Nether location. A map created in the End has a purple marker showing the player's location. If an Overworld map is used in the End, a magenta dot appears on the player's spawn point.\n, a cartography table can also be used to add a pointer to create a locator map or empty locator map. This can be done by adding a compass to paper, or to an empty map or map.\nZooming out.\nA &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to zoom out, taking only one piece of paper per zoom level.\nA blank map can not be zoomed out. A map has to have something already marked on it for the zooming to be possible.\nZoom details.\nThe zooming function starts from when the map is created (zoom level 0) up to its fourth zoom step (zoom level 4).\nMaps are always aligned to a grid at all zoom levels. That means zooming out any different map in a specific area covered by that map always has the same center. As such, maps are aligned by map width (1024 blocks for a level 3 maps) minus 64. A level 3 map generated at spawn covers X and Z coordinates from -64 to 959. All maps generated in this area zoom out to the same coordinates, guaranteeing that they are always 'aligned' on a map wall. For a zoomed-out map to cover a new area, it must start with a base (level 0) map that is in that area.\nAt zoom level 0, a map created on the point (0,0) has (0,0) at the center of the map. At higher zoom levels of the same map, the coordinate (0,0) is in the top left square of the map.\n, zoom level can be seen on a map by turning on Advanced Tooltips (a &lt;a href=\"Debug%20screen%23More%20debug%20keys\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; option that can be toggled by using the key combination ). The tooltip of the map then shows the zoom level, scaling factors, and map ID.\nCloning.\nA mix of empty maps and empty locator maps may be used. Whether the cloned maps show position markers is dependent only on the input map.\nA &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to clone a map.\nThe parts of the world that have already been explored and mapped are copied, and newly explored areas appear on both instances. If one of the maps is later zoomed out, then the maps lose their connection to each other and function as completely separate maps that have to be individually filled by exploring.\nIn Creative mode, a map in an item frame may be cloned by using on it, as long as that map is not also in the player's inventory.\nIt doesn't matter if the map to be cloned is at a higher zoom level (made of more paper) than the blank map. Upon copying the map, both resulting maps have the same magnification as the starting map.\nMarking points.\n the player has the ability to mark spots on a map. To do this, a map on a placed-down &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;, and the spot of the banner gets marked on the map. The mark takes the color of whatever the base color is for the banner, and if the banner has a name, the mark shows that name. Banner marks on a map are always oriented with their top facing north, regardless of the banner's actual orientation. If the banner is destroyed, the mark of the banner remains at first, but if the player gets closer to where the banner previously was, it disappears as the area is updated on the map.\nIf a map is mounted on an item frame and is within the area it depicts, the mounted map displays its current location with a green indicator rotated to match its orientation.\n the player can place copies of locator maps in &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s in order to create a land mark. The marker is a green dot that resembles the shape of the player's marker, but in green color. The position the marker points at depends on the direction the item frame is facing. It is worth noting that the markers work only on copies of the same map. Other maps of the same area do not show the existing markers that the player(s) had placed.\nIf a player has a cloned map in their inventory, their pointer appears white when viewed on the same map held by another player. Hence, if all players have the same cloned map in their inventory, all markers would appear white when the clone map is viewed. \nLocking.\nMaps can be locked when using a &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;. This creates a new map containing the same data and locks it. All copies of this new map are also locked. A locked map never changes, even when the depicted terrain changes. , locked maps have a unique texture.\nData values.\nMetadata.\n, maps use the following data values:\nMap icons.\nMap icons are 8\u00d78 in \"Java Edition\", but 16\u00d716 in Bedrock Edition. As such, there are minor misalignment issues in \"Java Edition\".\nIt should be noted that even if the player used a NBT editor to add an additional icon on the map, \"Minecraft\" shows only the first one listed when the player loads up their world."}

Each material has a base color which is multiplied by 135, 180, 220 or 255, and then divided by 255 to make the map color. Each base color below is associated with four map colors - to get the first map color ID for a base color, multiply the base color ID by 4. (Note: ID 0 has 4 gradients of itself despite them all being transparent)\nMap colors.\nEach base color above has 4 associated map colors below. The conversion works by multiplying each of the red, green, and blue values by a value and then dividing by 255, finally rounding down to a whole number. As of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8.1-pre1\"&gt;1.8.1-pre1&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth base color variant is now multiplied by 135, providing a darker set of colors rather than just a clone of the second base color variant.\nMap pixel art.\nPeople have used the map to create pixel art. The default map has an image size of 128\u00d7128 and reads each block as a specific color. By placing blocks in a specific arrangement, it is possible to create pixel art images. Constructing the image will cover an square area 8 chunks on a side, and require 16,384 blocks (256 stacks worth) not counting any support blocks.\nTwo methods exist for creating map pixel art: flat and staircase. The flat method involves laying the pixel image across a flat surface, effectively creating a floor. The flat method is the easier of the two methods, but offers a smaller palette of only 58 colors. The staircase method offers 174 colors, but is much more complicated to use. In the staircase method, blocks are placed at different elevations to obtain specific color variations. A block's color is darker if placed at a lower elevation than the block north of it, or brighter if placed at a higher elevation than the block north of it. (This is a case of the mapping convention of .)\nWith the flat method, the 2nd shade of each color group on the lists below can be used. For the staircase method, the first 3 shades of the color groups below can be used. The 4th shade can only be obtained with the use of an external tool.\nCode examples.\nListed below are some libraries used for modifying and exporting map data."}

After the full release of \"Minecraft\" (&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;), Persson transferred creative authority of the game's development to &lt;a href=\"Jens%20Bergensten\"&gt;Jens Bergensten&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersson sold Mojang and all of its assets to Microsoft on September 15, 2014. In a lengthy blog post, Notch states \"I love games and I love to program, but I don't make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don't try to change the world.\" He then goes on to say that \"I've become a symbol. I don't want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don't understand, that I don't want to work on.\"\nPersson left Mojang on November 6, 2014, along with the other founders. He wrote that \"as soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately.\"\nPersson has not been involved with \"Minecraft\" since selling Mojang to Microsoft, and the company has since disassociated with him, with a spokesperson for Microsoft stating that \"[Persson's] comments and opinions do not reflect those of Microsoft or Mojang and are not representative of 'Minecraft'.\"\nOutside of work Persson frequently takes part in competitions, including Ludum Dare, LD12 and the Java 4k Game Programming Contest.\nPersson engaged Ez during a vacation in , and married her on August 13, 2011. The two separated on August 15, 2012. Her brother, &lt;a href=\"Kristoffer%20Zetterstrand\"&gt;Kristoffer&lt;/a&gt;, is the artist whose &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s appear in the game.\nNotch\u2019s Goodbye Letter.\nThis letter, made by Notch, announces his departure from Mojang &lt;a href=\"https%3A//genius.com/Markus-persson-im-leaving-mojang-annotated%3Fbagon%3D1\"&gt;[SOURCE&lt;/a&gt;].\n\"I don\u2019t see myself as a real game developer. I make games because it\u2019s fun, and because I love games and I love to program, but I don\u2019t make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don\u2019t try to change the world. Minecraft certainly became a huge hit, and people are telling me it\u2019s changed games. I never meant for it to do either. It\u2019s certainly flattering, and to gradually get thrust into some kind of public spotlight is interesting.\nA relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. Jens was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things. At first, I failed by trying to make something big again, but since I decided to just stick to small prototypes and interesting challenges, I\u2019ve had so much fun with work. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure how I fit into Mojang where people did actual work, but since people said I was important for the culture, I stayed.\nI was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn\u2019t understand. I tweeted this in frustration. Later on, I watched the \"This is Phil Fish\" video on YouTube and started to realize I didn\u2019t have the connection to my fans I thought I had. I\u2019ve become a symbol. I don\u2019t want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don\u2019t understand, that I don\u2019t want to work on, that keeps coming back to me. I\u2019m not an entrepreneur. I\u2019m not a CEO. I\u2019m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.\nAs soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I\u2019ll probably abandon it immediately.\nConsidering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don\u2019t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won\u2019t feel a responsibility to read them.\nI\u2019m aware this goes against a lot of what I\u2019ve said in public. I have no good response to that. I\u2019m also aware a lot of you were using me as a symbol of some perceived struggle. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a person, and I\u2019m right there struggling with you.\nI love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can\u2019t be responsible for something this big. In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it\u2019s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change.\nIt\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about my sanity.\"\nGames and other work.\nNotch has released much of his work, including, but not limited to:\nGames:\nJava 4k Games:\nLudum Dare Games:\n2.5D Engines:\nNotch also has a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//soundcloud.com/markusalexei\"&gt;soundcloud page&lt;/a&gt; which includes 53 tracks in total.

Introduction to Minecraft Megabases.\nMinecraft megabases are large-scale, intricate builds that showcase the creativity and dedication of players. These structures often span thousands of blocks and include various functional and aesthetic elements. Megabases can serve multiple purposes, such as housing, storage, farms, and even entire cities. They are a testament to the limitless possibilities within Minecraft and the ingenuity of its community.\n2. Planning and Design.\nConceptualization.\nBefore starting a megabase, players typically spend a significant amount of time planning and designing. This phase involves brainstorming ideas, sketching layouts, and deciding on themes. Popular themes include futuristic cities, medieval castles, and natural landscapes.\nBlueprints and Tools.\nUsing tools like Minecraft\u2019s Creative Mode, WorldEdit, and external software such as MCEdit or Chunky, players can create detailed blueprints. These tools help visualize the final product and make adjustments before the actual building begins.\n3. Resource Gathering.\nMining and Farming.\nBuilding a megabase requires an enormous amount of resources. Players often set up extensive mining operations and automated farms to gather materials like stone, wood, iron, and redstone. Efficient resource management is crucial to avoid running out of supplies mid-project.\nTrading and Bartering.\nVillager trading and bartering with Piglins in the Nether can also provide valuable resources. Players often create trading halls and bartering stations to streamline this process.\n4. Construction Techniques.\nLayering and Scaffolding.\nConstructing a megabase involves building in layers and using scaffolding to reach higher areas. Players often start with the foundation and gradually work their way up, ensuring structural integrity and aesthetic appeal.\nRedstone Engineering.\nRedstone engineering plays a significant role in megabases. Automated doors, elevators, lighting systems, and farms are common features. Mastering redstone mechanics can greatly enhance the functionality of a megabase.\n5. Aesthetic Elements.\nArchitecture and Landscaping.\nAesthetics are a key aspect of megabases. Players use a variety of blocks and materials to create visually appealing structures. Landscaping, including terraforming and adding vegetation, enhances the overall look and feel of the base.\nLighting and Decoration.\nProper lighting is essential to prevent mob spawns and highlight architectural features. Decorative elements like banners, paintings, and custom textures add personality and uniqueness to the megabase.\n6. Functional Features.\nStorage Systems.\nEfficient storage systems are vital for managing the vast amount of items collected during the construction of a megabase. Automated sorting systems using hoppers and chests help keep everything organized.\nFarms and Mob Grinders.\nMegabases often include various farms and mob grinders to provide a steady supply of food, materials, and experience points. These can range from simple crop farms to complex multi-level mob grinders.\n7. Community and Collaboration.\nMultiplayer Projects.\nMany megabases are built collaboratively in multiplayer servers. Working with others allows for the sharing of ideas, resources, and labor, making the construction process more efficient and enjoyable.\nShowcasing and Tours.\nOnce completed, megabases are often showcased to the Minecraft community through videos, streams, and server tours. This not only provides inspiration to other players but also fosters a sense of accomplishment and pride.\n8. Challenges and Rewards.\nTime and Effort.\nBuilding a megabase is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. It requires patience, dedication, and a willingness to overcome obstacles such as resource shortages and design challenges.\nSatisfaction and Legacy.\nThe rewards of completing a megabase are immense. Players gain a sense of satisfaction from seeing their vision come to life and leave a lasting legacy within the Minecraft community. Megabases often become landmarks and sources of inspiration for future builders."}

Once the stem reaches maturity, it attempts to generate a melon block in one of the four immediately adjacent blocks; however, this attempt may fail if the chosen adjacent block is not empty or the block beneath is not an appropriate block (&lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Coarse%20Dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rooted%20Dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20Mangrove%20Roots\"&gt;muddy mangrove roots&lt;/a&gt;). Melons take 10 to 30 minutes to grow, which is equal to 0.5 to 1.5 times the length of a &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;daylight cycle&lt;/a&gt;. Once a stem has produced a melon, that stem does not produce any further melons until the existing melon is harvested. Melon stems connect only to the melons they produce. For example, if stem A generates a melon adjacent to stem B, stem B does not connect and can still produce another melon. Similarly, if a melon is placed adjacent to stem B, stem B would still be able to produce another melon. The same principle applies for &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s. Melons require a light level of 9 or higher to grow.\nTrades.\n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s who are journeymen (level 3) farmers buy 4 melons for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposting.\nPlacing a melon into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. Composting a crafted melon block instead of 9 melon slices is very inefficient. For example, 100 melons could yield 9.29 bone meals on average. Meanwhile, if not crafted, 900 melon slices could yield 64.29 bone meals on average."}

{"id": "9874", "revid": "51840855", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9874", "title": "Bedrock Edition Far Lands", "text": "The Far Lands were a terrain generation bug that happened millions of blocks from the world origin. It essentially formed the \"edge\" of an \"infinite\" world.\nLocation.\nThe Far Lands are initiated at X/Z: 12,550,821 and \u221212,550,824 and go on infinitely.\nIn new versions are initiated at X/Z: 16,777,215 and -16,777,215\nStructure.\nThe Far Lands were different from the Far Lands. The content of the Far Lands in the Bedrock Edition was slightly different in &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s and structure in positive coordinates. Sand and gravel do not fall from generating in Bedrock Edition, resulting in relatively stable performance. (Bubble columns can still cause those blocks to fall, however.)\nThe Far Lands do not generate on &lt;a href=\"flat\"&gt;flat&lt;/a&gt; worlds, due to the lack of a noise generator.\nThe exact structure depended on the platform. On &lt;a href=\"Realms\"&gt;Realms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Dedicated%20Server\"&gt;Bedrock Dedicated Server&lt;/a&gt;s, the Far Lands generated the same as on Windows 10, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4: only the &lt;a href=\"%23Nothingness\"&gt;nothingness&lt;/a&gt; generated. On mobile devices and Nintendo Switch, the &lt;a href=\"%23Edge%20Far%20Lands\"&gt;Edge Far Lands&lt;/a&gt; would generate, depending on the coordinates. In multiplayer, the structure would depend on the platform used by the owner of the world.\n, what happened at the Far lands depends on the world. Sometimes it is a skygrid, and sometimes it is a plain ocean/bedrock with different biomes.\nThe features of the Far Lands in other Bedrock ports remain unknown. \nCaves generated close to the Far Lands sometimes have an edgy \"zipper\" consistency, with sometimes every second block being hollowed out. \nEdge Far Lands.\nDespite Y level 256 being the maximum build height, the Far Lands were still cut off at Y=128, although trees still generated normally. (as the terrain generator is limited to Y=128 despite the 256 height limit). However as of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;beta 1.16.220.50&lt;/a&gt;, the Far Lands could generate above Y=128 and sometimes even to the new 320 height limit.\nIf &lt;a href=\"fossils\"&gt;fossils&lt;/a&gt; generate here, they usually appear in mid-air without touching any block.\nWarm and lukewarm ocean biomes in the Edge Far Lands appear as a \"desert-like\" patch, without any water in it, while normal and cold oceans generate grass blocks. &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck\"&gt;Shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"underwater%20ruins\"&gt;underwater ruins&lt;/a&gt; always generate above ground, sometimes higher than 128 on the Y-axis. Buried treasure sometimes generates without touching any block.\nNormally, you and any mobs that spawn fall through the blocks you touch and suffocate before hitting the void. If you are in creative, you will only be able to move up and down unless you use elytra and fireworks to move around which makes it extremely hard to go to a specific area.\nWhen trying to place blocks it might not work in certain areas.\nWhen you go to the nether (that is if you managed to build the portal correctly) there will be far lands as well and the only mobs you will find there are endermen teleporting to survive the suffocation, magma cubes because they are large enough so they won\u2019t fall through the blocks, and ghasts as they can fly.\nThere are many distinct terrain types of Edge Far Lands, listed in the table below:\nRepetitiveness.\nUsually, the Far Lands' appearance never seems to repeat. However, they start to become extremely repetitive and stretched horizontally, a great distance from the X or Z axis, with sections 12 blocks wide being repeated. There is a sudden change of the Far Lands terrain when the number of blocks from the axis exceeds 12,550,821 divided by a power of 2. This corresponds to when sections of the Far Lands terrain appear to recur more times. The periodicity of the Far Lands starts to become apparent at 784,426 or more blocks from the axis. Nearly perfect repeating occurs starting at around 3,137,705 blocks from the axis. Beyond 6,275,412 blocks from the axis, the sections appear to be symmetric, all the way to the Corner Far Lands. The Z Far Lands tend to look more repetitive than the X Far Lands for no apparent reason. This occurs due to floating-point precision loss with the noise coordinate, resulting in every noise coordinate being a multiple of 16. 684.412 * 3 is 2053.236, which gets rounded to 2048, a multiple of 256. Due to the fact that the noise function used to generate terrain repeats every 256 noise units, this results in repetitive terrain every 12 blocks. By the intersection of the Far Lands, all noise coordinates are multiples of 128, two noise coordinates get rounded to 128 while the third gets rounded to 256, and each repetition lasts 13 cycles (though it may appear shorter than this due to selector noise). If the terrain were allowed to lose further precision before overflowing (i.e. if the floats were half as precise, or the noise had a period of 128), the Edge Far Lands would resemble Java Edition's Corner Far Lands. This happens on every of the game that generates them. (i.e. mobile, Nintendo Switch)\nNothingness.\nIn the Far Lands with negative X coordinates, after the positive X coordinates degrade, and all the Far Lands in the Windows 10 Edition, the terrain stops generating entirely, resulting in there being nothing present aside from the ocean and the bedrock layer. \nCertain &lt;a href=\"structures\"&gt;structures&lt;/a&gt; are able to generate in this area. Several, such as &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;s, have elongated foundations when generated here. Jungle temples here do not have a foundation; they instead appear to float above the water. Fossils can generate underwater, but do not generate on the bedrock floor. &lt;a href=\"Igloo\"&gt;Igloo&lt;/a&gt;s generate underwater on the bedrock layer, replacing the bottom bedrock layer with stone bricks. Underwater ruins and shipwrecks always generate on the bedrock layer, and lava veins (with &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; on top) still generate near the bedrock layer, often creating bubble columns. Buried treasure generates above water. Pillager outposts generate only the watchtower without any peripheral structure around it; however, although the pillagers fall into the void, new pillagers can spawn again and again (infinitely) in and around the watchtower. &lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt; buildings generate on a floating platform of grass below them. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s spawn without falling through the world, although they cannot move.\nDesert wells, dungeons, abandoned mineshafts, and woodland mansions cannot generate here.\nMobs such as &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; still spawn normally. Seagrass and kelp still generate on bedrock.\nIn the frozen ocean biome, the surface of the ocean still freezes, and icebergs can still generate. &lt;a href=\"Polar%20bear\"&gt;Polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn without falling into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkygrid.\nIn the Corner Far Lands, Far Lands with negative Z, and past the normal positive Z Far Lands, a 3D grid pattern of grass blocks appears instead of the ordinary stack/loop. Tall grass and trees generate on these blocks. This results in a perfect three-dimensional array of grass blocks levitating high above the ocean. The name is a bit misleading, since the array of blocks extends not only up to Y=128, but also down to bedrock level. Structures generated here follow similar rules to that of the Nothingness with some differences:\nEffects.\n&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; uses 32-bit floating-point numbers (as opposed to 64-bit on &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;). At any given coordinates, even near the world origin, attempting to move is impossible if it is too slow. At every power of 2, the \"minimum speed\" doubles.\nThe player's hitbox corners are stored individually in memory (as opposed to the coordinates of the actual player in storage). If the player is at a power of 2, the hitbox corners may move at different speeds, changing the size of the hitbox. These size changes are usually negligible, but can potentially be significant. In extreme cases, the player's hitbox size reaches 0, making it possible to fall through the world.\nTerrain errors initiate at X/Z \u00b112,550,821, like in Java Edition.\n Near X/Z: \u00b12,147,483,648, the game crashes, as this is the 32-bit integer limit. However, not all devices are able to reach this point. Increasing render distance on near coordinates can cause the world and game to crash.\nDimensions.\nThe Far Lands of the Nether and End share similar characteristics to the Overworld Far Lands, although with some differences. They generate more similarly to each other than to the Overworld Far Lands.\nThe Nether.\nThe Nether Far Lands are similar to the Overworld Far Lands, except generated with Nether terrain features, with a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; ocean at Y=31. &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20remnant\"&gt;Bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s continue to generate. Bastions \"float\" on the lava, with their foundations at Y=29.\nThe Nether can be a great way to reach the Far Lands in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, as every block in the Nether counts as 8 blocks in the Overworld. The player must travel to 1,568,853 or higher to spawn in the Far Lands. Teleporting just a few blocks less allows the player to see the beginning of the Far Lands.\nThe End.\nThe End Far Lands are made up almost exclusively of end stone and appear a bit more squashed and stretched horizontally than the Overworld Far Lands. Micro-end islands still generate inside the Far Lands, even after the latter dissipates. Since there is no signature liquid of the End, they just generate down to a dry void; similarly, there is no bedrock floor.\nThe End Far Lands are cut off at y=128, although structures can still generate on top.\nCause.\nThe terrain effect is generated based on 16 octaves of . Each noise generator takes the floating-point inputs and uses those to interpolate between noise values at whole numbers. It does so by:\nIt covers an interval of [\u2212231, 231) without causing any problems. The problem is that many of the octaves cover a scale much smaller than a block, with up to 171.103 noise units per block. Indeed, 231 \u2248 171.103\u00d712,550,824.053. Thus, the Far Lands start 12,550,824 blocks away from the center of the Minecraft world. Once this value is exceeded, the integer is always 231\u22121, thus breaking the generation algorithm.\nAt the positive end, the remainder starts relatively small but usually much larger than 1, and grows by 171.103 per block. At the negative end, the remainder starts at \u2212232. This value is then adjusted by ((6x\u221215)x+10)x3 for quintic interpolation. Even one block in at the positive end, this is already around 1011. The negative end starts all the way around \u22121049. For the Corner Far Lands, multiply the values of both edges. When interpolation (really extrapolation) is attempted with values as large as these, it produces similarly large output. That output completely dwarfs all other terms that would normally give the terrain its shape, instead effectively passing only the sign of this one noise function through.\nThere are several other factors to the cause of the Far Lands, making things slightly more complicated:\nWhy do the Far Lands break down?\nThe Far Lands break down due to the limitations of 32-bit floating point numbers. Due to the interpolator returning really large values, the values eventually exceed 3.4*10^38, the largest value possible for a 32 bit float, causing parts of the terrain to stop as the equations that govern terrain generation return NaN. This is also why the negative Far Lands don't generate, as the remainder there is already greater than 2^32, which results in a value of way larger than 3.4*10^38.\nThe weights for each corner value are based on the interpolator outputs on each axis multiplied together. Thus, in the Corner Far Lands, when both sets of values overflow, the extremely large values given by the interpolator formula are multiplied together, which exceeds the 32-bit float limit in about 30 blocks, hence the \"normal\" corner leading into the skygrid.\nIn certain cases, one block out of every 4 on each axis is still properly generated, resulting in the skygrid.\nThe breakdown of the Corner Far Lands can be seen on Java Edition using a customized world preset. However, given the Edge Far Lands are so thin, the breakdown of the Edge Far Lands can't be seen.\nIssues.\nThe world at excessive coordinates is not supported, and as such certain issues related to the Far Lands may never be fixed. This is because such issues would affect only players who intentionally teleport to high coordinates, and exist as a limitation of the game engine itself."}

They are used in many places in \"Minecraft\". Block IDs are used to define blocks placed in the world and inventory items (including items in chests and items dropped in the world). Item IDs are valid only for items. Block data further defines blocks placed, describing for example the height of water or the direction a torch points. \nThese data values differ greatly from .\nIDs.\nItem IDs.\nBlock items.\nAll of blocks have their own direct item forms. A block with numeric ID over 255 have item form with numeric ID of codice_1 to avoid block item IDs being overlapped into the other item ID space.\nThe string IDs of most blocks' direct item forms are the same as IDs of the blocks themselves. However, there are some exceptions:\nNote that commands like use blocks' IDs to specify block items, instead of block items' IDs.\nOther items.\nOther items have values above 255, making it easy to separate the block item IDs from the other item IDs.\nIn early versions, items had numeric IDs which had been used in commands and savegame files. However, these numeric IDs are deprecated. The following table lists items with their legacy numeric IDs.\nIn current versions, items have numeric runtime IDs which are used internally in the game. The runtime IDs depend on the order in which the item is registered in the code. So when a new item is added, other items' IDs may also change. And some items are exclusive in normal Bedrock Edition, the developer version, or the Education Edition, so items' runtime IDs are not the same in each edition. The following table lists items with their numeric runtime IDs.\nNote that the codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 in the four tables above are not normal items in game. They are used as alias IDs. For backward compatibility, an item has alias ID if its ID was changed:\nEntity IDs.\nSeveral entity names do not correlate with entity names from \"Java Edition\". The standard for naming new entities changes with subsequent releases; however, existing entity names have not been changed."}

{"id": "107007", "revid": "53447031", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=107007", "title": "Bedrock Edition distance effects", "text": "As the player travels far from the world origin in Bedrock Edition, the world starts to behave abnormally. This is mostly caused by precision loss of the used for location.\nNote: Effects marked with an asterisk (*) are well-known effects. Effects shaded in blue are effects affected at the coordinates other than powers of two. Effects shaded in gray are effects affected beyond the 32-bit integer limit.\nGeneral effects.\nSome effects can occur at any distance but gradually worsen as coordinates increase. Bedrock Edition uses 32-bit floating points for many of its calculations, such as the player's position, as opposed to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, which uses 64-bit floating points. A 32-bit floating point uses 23 of these bits for precision (the other 9 are used for the sign and the order of magnitude). Thus, there are 223 (8,388,608) possible positions for any given order of magnitude. For example, there are 8,388,608 possible positions between 1 and 2, each apart, but there are also 8,388,608 possible positions between 8,388,608 and 16,777,216, each a full block apart. In general, between 2n and 2n+1, the valid positions are 2n-23 apart. At higher coordinates, the valid positions are farther apart, so position is less precise. This principle has several implications.\nBlock rendering errors.\nVarious blocks are rendered as partial blocks, and the game uses 32-bit floating points to calculate the corners. At high coordinates, these coordinates become offset, causing the block to render incorrectly. Blocks with more detailed models usually become glitched at lower coordinates (a few blocks start to render incorrectly at a relatively low 131,072 blocks), while full blocks continue to render correctly past 8,388,608 blocks, farther out than most partial blocks.\nSlow movement becomes impossible.\nFor an entity to move, it advances a certain distance each tick. At slow speeds or high coordinates, the increase in distance per tick is so little that when rounding to the nearest valid position, the entity is placed at its original position, so it essentially does not move at all. More specificially, between 2n and 2n+1, an entity's speed is rounded to the nearest multiple of 20*2n-23, so it must move at least 10*2n-23 to actually be considered moving.\nThere are several ways to slow the player\u2019s movement, such as &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s, using an item (e.g. drawing back a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;), or certain blocks (such as &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s). In addition, moving diagonally decreases the player\u2019s speed on any given axis. This effect can be amplified by moving almost (but not exactly) along an axis, and by walking into an object, one can do this without changing their coordinate on the other axis. Note that due to trigonometric rounding errors, extremely small angles do not cause the player to move as slowly as expected. The slowest form of movement without walking into objects (&lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt; VI while touching &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt; and drawing back a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;) becomes impossible at 256 blocks, and coincidentally, the slowest form of movement achievable by walking into an object at a slight angle also becomes impossible at 256 blocks; as a result, both methods must be used to slow the player down if one wishes to observe this effect at lower coordinates.\nJitter.\nThe game normally runs at 60 frames per second, so when the player moves, the game must calculate the camera position on the intermediate frames between ticks. This is normally not an issue, but if the player is moving close to the slowest possible speed, the camera position on intermediate frames becomes distorted, and the game starts to jitter.\nEventually, the slow speed and precision errors reach a point where the player only advances by 1 valid position per tick, forcing that the game to render the intermediate frames at exactly the starting or ending position. As a result, the camera moves as though the game ran at 20 frames per second instead of 60.\nSince slower speeds become jittery at lower coordinates, it is impossible to say exactly where jitter \"starts.\"\nFalling through the world.\nAt extreme coordinates, small entity hitboxes shrink to width 0, and such entities can fall through the edges of solid blocks. For example, if an entity smaller than blocks exceeds coordinate 2,097,152, its position is rounded to the nearest quarter. Since its hitbox extends less than from a valid position in each direction, both sides of the hitbox are rounded to the same position, so the apparent hitbox size is 0.\nIn addition, it is possible to manipulate hitboxes and fall through the world at much lower coordinates. While the positions of the centers of entities are stored in NBT, the positions of the individual hitbox corners are stored in memory. If the player is crossing a power of 2, these corners may move at different speeds, if they are affected differently by floating point precision errors, thus changing the hitbox size. The hitbox size resets to 0.6 in certain situations, including:\nAgain, if the player's hitbox size shrinks to 0, it becomes possible to fall through the edges of blocks and into the void (). Conversely, it is possible to stretch one's hitbox to several blocks wide.\nMedium effects (X/Z \u00b1131,072\u20131,048,575).\nEventually, some common forms of movement begin to glitch. In addition, blocks with detailed models begin to render incorrectly.\nMajor effects (X/Z \u00b11,048,576\u201316,777,215).\nBlocks are rendered based on their corners, whose coordinates are 32-bit floating point numbers. Generally, these are multiples of . Thus, most blocks render normally as long the floating points are precise to the nearest sixteenth. This breaks at X/Z \u00b11,048,576 (220), and blocks continue to render incorrectly as the coordinates go even farther out. However, there is never any vertical distortion.\nIn the RTX betas, the lighting is unaffected by floating-point precision errors, although block shapes themselves are incorrect.\nBesides, many \"normal\" forms of movement become impossible.\nThe different types of block model deformation have changed a lot over the years, although the update specifics and hardware requirements are unknown. Previously, blocks such as &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; would appear completely 2D beyond 8,388,608 blocks, whereas they appeared as almost normal X shapes in more recent versions, but appearing as 2D again as of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.220\"&gt;1.16.220&lt;/a&gt;. Also, &lt;a href=\"sunflower\"&gt;sunflower&lt;/a&gt; heads could previously distort to become square, which also no longer happens; the flower appears detached from the plant instead.\nIn addition here, the terrain starts to break down following the table.\nGame-breaking effects (X/Z \u2265\u00b116,777,216).\nHere, the rendering fundamentally breaks down to the point where normal gameplay is completely impossible.\nStripe Lands.\nThe Stripe Lands are an artifact of the game's rendering and block hitbox calculation, rather than a quirk relating directly to terrain generation. The Stripe Lands start at X/Z \u00b116,777,216. They exist because coordinates are off by up to a full meter, causing the blocks themselves (not just their corners) to appear in the wrong places. \nPast X/Z: \u00b133,554,432 all blocks are rendered as two-dimensional, and the gap between valid blocks doubles to 1 out of four. This gap doubles again at every power of 2 and reaches 128 blocks wide at X/Z: \u00b11,073,741,824. This is the widest the gaps can be since the game crashes near X/Z: \u00b12,147,483,647. \nVertical limits.\nLike the X and Z axes, the game breaks at excessive Y coordinates. Since blocks cannot be placed above Y=320, block rendering glitches do not occur, but other effects do.\nMany of these effects would occur at negative coordinates, but there is a barrier at Y=-104. Beyond this entities can move only vertically using the \"fall through the world\" glitch, or teleporting below Y=-104. Thus the barrier can be avoided by teleporting past X/Z \u00b18,388,608. Also, all entities, except players in &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt;, disappear in the void."}

The code is available at https://github.com/Mojang/leveldb-mcpe, and the building instructions are documented by Tommaso at .\nFor a Java implementation of LevelDB + Zlib, see https://github.com/tinfoiled/leveldb\nGoogle's leveldb library has evolved extensively since Mojang released their version, but the Mojang version still works (as of 2022). The code does require some minor tweaks to compile:\nThe database is stored in the db/ subdirectory of a Bedrock Edition world. The database path which is passed to the LevelDB API is this directory path, not the path to any file within it. It seems this is also where terrain generation is stored. This is because you can turn an old world infinite by replacing its db folder with one from an infinite world.\nChunk key format.\nA database key for data regarding a chunk is the concatenation of:\nAccordingly, such a key may be 9, 10, 13 or 14 bytes long. Not all subchunks necessarily exist for a given chunk.\nThe \"BlockEntity\", \"Entity\" and \"PendingTicks\" records are represented by a sequence of concatenated root tags in a variant of &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; which stores the lengths and the multi-byte integer types in little-endian format, as opposed to the big-endian format used by or the original NBT specification.\nThe value 0 is used in the \"Version\" record in old style worlds; higher values are used in infinite worlds.\nOther keys.\nThere's also the special key ~local_player for an entity data entry that holds the local player entity. If entity data exists here, it takes precedence over the player data stored in level.dat. The value associated with the ~local_player key is NBT encoded and only has a single compound tag at the root level.\nThere's also a special key for remote players which consists of two parts. The first part is the prefix \"player_\" (without the quotes) and the second part is the client ID which is contained in the remote player's clientid.txt file. For example, player_-12345678 would be the key for a remote client with an client ID of -12345678. The value associated with the \"player_\" prefixed key is NBT encoded and only has a single compound tag at the root level.\nThere's also a special \"game_flatworldlayers\" key of length 20 for flat worlds. The value associated with this key is a set of numbers in ASCII text format. An example of a value associated with the \"game_flatworldlayers\" key is \"[7,3,3,2]\" where the value length for this example is 9.\nThere are several keys related to villages\nOther keys start with the following strings\nNBT structures.\nThe following articles document NBT structures of block entity and entity.\nlevel.dat.\nThe level.dat is still in uncompressed NBT format. The file begins with an 8-byte header, consisting of a little-endian 4-byte integer indicating the type of the file, which is 3 (was 2 before latest update) for level.dat. It is followed by another integer containing the length of the file, minus the header.\nLOG.\nThe LOG files are located at the /db path of a level, and are part of the leveldb format, used in between compaction of the LDB files. It is similar to a Log file for a program. The format is:\nYYYY /MM/DD-Hour/Minute/Second.StepName \"Info\"\nExample:\n2014/07/24-22:20:08.400488 4a3638 Recovering log #3"}

This was replaced in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;Pocket Edition 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; by the \"SubChunkPrefix\" record, storing each 16\u00d716\u00d716 subchunk separately as a different leveldb key, analogous to an &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20file%20format\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; \"section\". A new version of the subchunk format enclosing \"Block Storage\" records was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.13\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.2.13&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubChunkPrefix record (1.0 and 1.2.13 formats).\nThe original version of the subchunk format is as follows:\nThe light information may be omitted in chunks saved by more recent versions. If present, it is ignored by the current version.\nA new format was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.13\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.2.13&lt;/a&gt; to allow the representation of blocks with IDs outside the 0\u2013255 range, although the old format may remain in existing chunks until they are re-saved. It is as follows:\nThe Block Storage format, as used in level files (as opposed to the server protocol) is as follows:\nBlocks are stored column-by-column (incrementing Y first, incrementing Z at the end of the column, incrementing X at the end of the cross-section). This is the opposite order of axes to the one used by the Java Edition formats. Each block state contains a \"name\" tag specifying the &lt;a href=\"resource%20location\"&gt;resource location&lt;/a&gt; of the block, and either a \"states\" tag listing the &lt;a href=\"block%20state\"&gt;block state properties&lt;/a&gt; or (if the chunk was last saved by &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.12.1\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.12.1&lt;/a&gt; or lower) a \"val\" tag giving the block metadata value.\nLegacyTerrain record (0.9.0 format).\nThe 0x30 terrain data entry appears to contain block data for an x*z*y = 16*16*128 block chunk. The value associated with the 0x30 terrain data key is always of length 83,200 and seems to consist of the following data:\nThe following definitions are provided to clarify the mapping between the location of a block within a LevelDB entry containing a chunk of 32,768 blocks and the corresponding location of the block within the entire world:\nAssuming the definitions above, the location of a block with a LevelDB entry with key values X and Z maps to the corresponding location of the block within the entire world as follows:\nThe x index specifies the North to South location where a smaller value of x is farther North than a larger value of x. The z index specifies the East to West location where a smaller value of z is farther East than a larger value of z. The y index specifies the vertical location where a smaller value of y is at a lower height than a larger value of y. For an old style world, the block at the bottom of the North-East corner of the world is W [0, 0, 0].\n0.8.1 and below.\nlevel.dat.\nThe level.dat file is in NBT format, based on the format of level.dat in a Desktop world. level.dat is an uncompressed little-endian NBT file that stores environmental data (time of day, for example) and player health, inventory, velocity, and position within the map.\nThe file begins with an 8-byte header, consisting of a little-endian 4-byte integer indicating the type of the file, which is 3 (was 2 before latest update) for level.dat. It is followed by another integer containing the length of the file, minus the header.\nchunks.dat.\nThis file stores all the terrain data that makes up a world. It is comprised of chunks which are 16x16x128 (XZY) block sections of the terrain. It can store a maximum of 1024 chunks (32x32) and 512x512x128 (33,554,432) blocks, however, the game only generates 256 chunks (16x16) and 256x256x128 (8,388,608) blocks by default.\nThe file is separated into 4kb sectors (4,096 bytes). The first sector is the \"chunk index\" which defines where in the file and world a specific chunk is located. Every 4 bytes of the chunk index represents 1 chunk. Every 128 bytes of the chunk index represents a column of 32 chunks along the Z axis (North to South). Each subsequent 128 byte section represents 1 row of chunks along the X axis (West to East). But in a default world generated by the game, only 16 chunks are defined for each column and row.\nThe format of each chunk in the chunk index is only 4 bytes. Ex: codice_5. The first byte describes how many 4kb sectors make up the chunk's data. In practice, this is always 21 (0x15). The next three bytes is a little-endian number describing how many 4kb sectors from the start of the file exist before the chunk data begins. If a chunk is not present, all 4 bytes will be zero codice_6.\nAs an example, if a chunk in the chunk index at 1,0 (X,Z) reads codice_5 we can locate the chunk data within the file. First we get the decimal representation of the last three bytes which are in little-endian codice_8 equals codice_9 in decimal. Next we calculate the offset by multiplying our result by the size of a sector codice_10. Last we get the decimal representation of the first byte which is always 21 (0x15) and multiply it by the size of a sector codice_11. As a result, we know this chunk is located at the decimal offset of codice_12 and is codice_13 bytes in size.\nThe actual chunk data stores all the terrain data. This includes blocks, data, skylight, blocklight, and biomes.\nThe first 4 bytes of the chunk data which are in little-endian represent its length in bytes. In practice it is always 82180 bytes (chunk data header: 4, actual chunk data: 82176).\nThe next 32,768 bytes contains the block data. The block order is YZX. Every 1 byte is equivalent to going up vertically along the Y axis. After 128 bytes, the height limit of the world is reached, so we move South 1 block along the Z axis and repeat. After 2,048 bytes (128*16) 1 column of the chunk is finished, so we move East 1 block along the X axis and repeat. In most programming languages, this is just a basic 3d array codice_14 ([x][z][y]). To reiterate, every 128 blocks is a column on the Z axis, every 16 columns is a row on the X axis.\nThe next 16,384 bytes contains the \"data\" data. Otherwise known at damage, meta, or auxiliary data. It's what gives wool its color and chests their direction etc. Just like the block data, the order is YZX. Since data values only range from 0-15, only half a byte is needed to represent 1 block. So, 1 byte actually represents 2 blocks. Hence why the data section is half as big as the block section. This data is big-endian, so a byte like codice_15 actually means the first block at this location has a data value of f, and the second block at this location has a data value of 2. \nThe next 16,384 bytes contains the skylight data. The format is identical to the previous \"data\" format. If a skylight value is f, that means the sunlight is fully lighting that block (like air or glass). The less sunlight is present in that block, the lower the value (like semi-transparent blocks such as leaves or water). And when the skylight value is 0, no sunlight is present in that block (like stone or dirt). Because the game automatically generates lighting, it is unimportant to modify this part of the file when generating a world via an outside program.\nThe next 16,384 bytes contains the blocklight data. The format is identical to the previous skylight format. If a blocklight value is f, that means the block is emitting the max amount of light (like glowstone). The less light a block emits, the lower the value (like powered redstone). And when the blocklight value is 0, no light is being emitted from that block. Because the game automatically generates lighting, it is unimportant to modify this part of the file when generating a world via an outside program.\nThe last 256 bytes contains the biome data. Each byte corresponds to a specific biome type. The order is XZ. Every 16 bytes is a new row.\nentities.dat.\nThis file uses the modified little endian uncompressed NBT format. It appears to store entity information using a format based on the Alpha Level Chunk Format. It also stores &lt;a href=\"tile%20entity\"&gt;tile entity&lt;/a&gt; information as well.\nThe file has a 12 byte header. It begins with the ASCII Characters \"ENT\", then one zero byte, then a little-endian integer with the value 1, followed by another little endian integer stating the length of the file in bytes, not counting the header.\nEntity Format.\nEvery entity is an unnamed TAG_Compound contained in the Entities list of a chunk file. The sole exception is the Player entity, stored in level.dat.\nAll entities share this base:\nMobs.\n Sheep has two additional fields:"}

This could also be a reference to the &lt;a href=\"Ray%20Tracing\"&gt;Ray Tracing&lt;/a&gt; functionality in Minecraft &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; or the scrapped &lt;a href=\"Super%20Duper%20Graphics%20Pack\"&gt;Super Duper Graphics Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nBundle.\nOriginally announced for the &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; update, development of this item was delayed for a future version. &lt;a href=\"Bundle\"&gt;Bundles&lt;/a&gt; are a storage item that can be used for managing items inside the player's inventory, and allow for combination of multiple item types within single inventory slots.\nFirefly.\nFireflies were originally going to be eaten by frogs to produce froglights, but this was scrapped after the developers found out that some species of fireflies are poisonous to frogs in real life. They would have glowed in the dark and they would have been two pixels in size, which would have made it the smallest mob in the game. Some players still had hope that it would still be added, but it was officially bluntly confirmed that they were scrapped in an Ask Mojang episode.\nFlattening.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;, many IDs were changed, and numerical IDs were removed. This process, known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Flattening\"&gt;The Flattening&lt;/a&gt;\", is also planned for Bedrock Edition. Certain items and blocks to be added include spectral arrows and air variants.\nCombat changes.\nChanges to 's combat system is planned for Bedrock as well.\nFletching table functionality.\n&lt;a href=\"Fletching%20table\"&gt;Fletching table&lt;/a&gt;s will gain functionality in a later update, planned for both &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nVoted updates.\nThe &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biome reworks are the two remaining biome reworks from the &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Earth%202018\"&gt;MINECON Earth 2018&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Earth%202018%23Biome%2520chooser\"&gt;biome chooser&lt;/a&gt; vote. Both biomes are promised to be updated in the future:\nThe &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biome rework is the last remaining biome rework from the &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Live%202019\"&gt;MINECON Live 2019&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Live%202019%23Biome%2520vote\"&gt;biome vote&lt;/a&gt;, as the winning mountains rework was implemented in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.18.0\"&gt;1.18.0&lt;/a&gt;, and the swamp rework was implemented in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.19.0\"&gt;1.19.0&lt;/a&gt;. The Badlands have been promised to be updated in a future update:\nThe and the are the two remaining mobs from the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202020\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2020&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202020%23Mob%2520Vote\"&gt;mob vote&lt;/a&gt;. Both mobs could come in an unknown future update as stated by LadyAgnes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"glare\"&gt;glare&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Golem\"&gt;copper golem&lt;/a&gt; are the two remaining mobs from the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202021\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202021%23Mob%2520Vote\"&gt;mob vote&lt;/a&gt;.\nPartially implemented.\nThese features had been shown by a Mojang staff member, but either had no further development or were canceled shortly after.\nPaddle.\nOn September 19, 2014, Tommaso stated that when adding &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s to Pocket Edition, he would add a \"paddle\" item, which would be required to move boats. Paddles were never implemented as items, but rather as part of the boat model. The crafting recipe used to require a wooden &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; to represent the paddle. As of the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.20.10\"&gt;1.20.10&lt;/a&gt; update, a wooden &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; is no longer required to craft a boat or raft . \nMinecart with Furnace.\nOn January 23, 2016, Tommaso stated that he'd like to add &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20furnace\"&gt;minecart with furnace&lt;/a&gt;, but is unsure of how to implement.\nMentioned.\nThese features were mentioned at one point, but later abandoned or their current status is unknown. Note that some of these features were mentioned by developers who either no longer work at &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt;, or no longer work on \"Minecraft\".\nWorld generation.\nThere have been a number of mentioned changes to world generation from the developers. Tommasso had planned a Far biome (probably changed &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20Far%20Lands\"&gt;Far Lands&lt;/a&gt;, made into its own biome), found at the edge of infinite worlds was going to be implemented in 0.9.0 but was delayed for unknown reasons. He also proposed a unique underworld underground structure and a dream dimension, however, none of these ideas (other than the \"unique underground structure\", which was added as &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;) came to fruition.\nTommaso stated on that he would like to add a \"difficulty\" number that mobs could have depending on their circumstances, such as resource that it spawns from and weather. This would vary the amount of hostile mobs at night and the amount of resources gained from each biome. He also stated that he would like more biome-specific mobs as well as biomes with specific difficulty/mob distributions (Partially added with more biome-specific mobs added in the last couple updates).\nMany of these ideas were reiterated again at &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202016\"&gt;MINECON 2016&lt;/a&gt;, where the developers stated they could either port the world generation changes from PC (added in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;) or create a new world generation altogether. They said this new world generation system could have a better progression over time with harder biomes further from spawn, more space underground (also added in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;), possibly raising the sea level to y=96 and making the terrain less predictable (also added in &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;).\nAs the world generation got completely overhauled in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.18.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.18.0&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.9.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, and with the new &lt;a href=\"Cave\"&gt;Cave&lt;/a&gt;s, Terrain port from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and the addition of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;Ancient City&lt;/a&gt;, 4 of the mentioned changes were/are officially added into the game, with 1 being partially added (more biome-specific mobs).\nMonster of the ocean depths / barnacle.\nIn the 2017 Mob Vote, a sea creature was one of the options. It was known as \"Mob A\", \"the monster of the ocean depths\", or the &lt;a href=\"barnacle\"&gt;barnacle&lt;/a&gt;. It would have spawned in deep water and attacked players with a tentacle-like tongue to pull players down to drown them.\nThe great hunger and wildfire.\nTwo other creatures in the Minecon vote of 2017 were given. One was \"Mob C, &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Hunger\"&gt;the great hunger&lt;/a&gt;.\" It would have had a large mouth capable of removing enchantments from items and would have camouflaged itself by entering the ground with its mouth open upwards. &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the mob wouldn't have been aggressive, only damaging the player if they accidentally fell into its mouth, and wouldn't have stripped items from players unless players fed it intentionally.\nThe other mob was \"Mob D, &lt;a href=\"The%20Hovering%20Inferno\"&gt;the hovering inferno&lt;/a&gt;.\" It would have looked like a large &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; with shields instead of rods, and would have spawned with groups of blazes in the nether. This mob was also planned to appear in the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; DLC under the name \"&lt;a href=\"wildfire\"&gt;wildfire&lt;/a&gt;,\" but was cut due to time constraints.\nMob B, the \"monster of the night skies\", was the &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;, which won the vote and has been added.\nAlligator, monkey, deer, and river dolphin.\nIn 2018, a mob vote was held in which Chinese users could vote on which Chinese animal should be added to Minecraft, to promote the release of &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20China\"&gt;Minecraft China&lt;/a&gt;. There were five options: giant panda, Chinese alligator, snub-nosed monkey, white-lipped deer, or baiji. The &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt; won the vote and was added into the game. It was later stated on &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Feedback\"&gt;Minecraft Feedback&lt;/a&gt; that alligators and/or crocodiles would likely not be added as hostile mobs as, like the shark, hostile mobs had to be fantasy creatures.\nMeerkat, ostrich, and termite.\nIn 2018, a biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;. The taiga won the vote and would be the first biome to be updated. The taiga included the &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;, while the desert would have included the &lt;a href=\"meerkat\"&gt;meerkat&lt;/a&gt;, and the savanna would have included the &lt;a href=\"ostrich\"&gt;ostrich&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"termite\"&gt;termite&lt;/a&gt;. There has been no information as to when the desert and savanna would be updated.\nVulture.\nIn 2019, another biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The mountains won the vote and would be the first biome to be updated. The mountains included the &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;, and the swamp included the &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;, while the badlands would have included the &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;. The goat was added in 1.17.0, while the frog was added in 1.19.0. There has been no information as to when the badlands would be updated.\nMoobloom and iceologer.\nIn 2020, a mob vote was held between which mob should be added to the game next. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"moobloom\"&gt;moobloom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iceologer\"&gt;iceologer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;. The glow squid won the vote and was added into the game. There has been no information as to whether the moobloom or iceologer would be added, as they are not planned, but have been mentioned as a future possibility.\nGlare and copper golem.\nIn 2021, another mob vote was held between which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"glare\"&gt;glare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"copper%20golem\"&gt;copper golem&lt;/a&gt;. The allay won the vote and it was added in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.19.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.19.0&lt;/a&gt;. There has been no information as to whether the glare or copper golem would be added, as they are not planned, but have been mentioned as a future possibility.\nRascal and Tuff Golem.\nIn 2022, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: &lt;a href=\"Sniffer\"&gt;Sniffer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rascal\"&gt;Rascal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Tuff%20Golem\"&gt;Tuff Golem&lt;/a&gt;. The Sniffer won the vote. &lt;a href=\"Jens\"&gt;Jens&lt;/a&gt; has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if or when they fit and can be prioritized.\nInterface/controls.\nAt MINECON 2016, the developers mentioned potential future improvements to the controls to make them vector-based, allowing full mouse support on Android (added in &lt;a href=\"1.17.0\"&gt;1.17.0&lt;/a&gt;) and having better in-built controller support.\nIn addition, at a previous panel, they also mentioned the ability to remap long touch to hardness-based touch (3D Touch) for capable iPhones.\nIn a Twitch stream previewing the Nintendo Switch version, the developers mentioned that they would like to look into adding motion-controlled aiming, but currently have no plans to add it.\nBluetooth keyboard and mouse support was added to iOS and iPadOS devices in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.19.10\"&gt;1.19.10&lt;/a&gt;\nOther world sizes.\nTommasso stated on Reddit that they may make other limited world sizes available, in addition to the current &lt;a href=\"Old\"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt; world type (256\u00d7256). Mentioned world sizes were 1000\u00d71000 and 10000\u00d710000. The addition of different world sizes was again mentioned at MINECON 2016.\nLoading external files on console.\nRoger Carpenter talked about this in a stream of the 1.2 beta for Xbox One. They would like for the console versions to support the loading of files from external media such as a USB stick. This would allow the use of Add-Ons, custom worlds, skins and resource packs, etcetera, like on the other platforms. However, console companies are worried about \"security issues\" that this could cause. Other games that loaded content from external media have sometimes been exploited by hackers to run unauthorized code on consoles. If loading add-ons from external media is not an option, they would \"work it out some other way\". (Partially added with full add-on and behavior packs support for Xbox One)\nBrief mentions.\nThese features were briefly mentioned, but no further information was given after that.\nFrom Java Edition.\nAll features from will make their way to Bedrock Edition sometime in the future. Specific mentions include:"}

{"id": "178041", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=178041", "title": "Bedrock Edition removed blocks/Metadata variants", "text": "Blocks resulting from extreme data values.\nThe majority of these blocks were likely never actually meant to exist in-game, and occurred only due to the game handling extreme metadata values as it would those in usually attainable ranges, resulting in strange blocks with traits arguably analogous to garbage data.\nSeamless stone slabs.\nThis slab variant existed in the game at one point.\nSix-sided blocks.\nBedrock Edition had a handful of versions of \"pillar\"-type blocks which used side textures on all six sides. These were effectively removed in an unknown version, forcing them to appear identical to normal such pillars, either by changing their models to that of the normal y-axis pillar or just directly changing them (which method was utilized is unknown).\nWeird piston.\nThe \"weird piston\" block existed for a period of time in Bedrock Edition, but with a much different appearance from the weird piston known from other editions.\nGranite, polished granite and diorite bells.\nUpon their introduction to Bedrock Edition, bells using the textures of granite, polished granite and diorite also existed. They could only be placed by commands, but could also be found in villages.\nIt is extremely likely that these were the result of the bell being incompletely programmed. The bell can face four directions, and at this point there were four different types of bell (the stone bell alongside these three), which would correspond to the four orthogonal facing directions. Since at this point granite and diorite were stored as data value of stone, it seems reasonable to expect that these would result from drawing from that data value of the used stone texture. Attempting to place a bell with data value 4 or above would fail; there were as a result no polished diorite, andesite or polished andesite bells, as these would not have any facing directions to correspond to. As they later spawned in villages, this would also imply that these were intended to be directional bells.\nBell-less Block.\nThere had been an unused &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; which consists of the stand without a bell. This bell cannot be rung, but it will drop a normal bell when broken.\nIt was merged into the normal version of the block in an unknown update. But however you can see this weird block if you break a normal bell when the game lags but you can't interact with it but when the game updates (remembers what blocks were broken/placed) it will disappear.\nLocked Smoker, Blast Furnace, Lectern, and Barrel.\nThere were also several unused blocks which were in a locked state. These blocks cannot be opened or used by the player (their GUI does not show up, but the player hand can still perform an action).\nIt was merged into the normal version of the block in an unknown update.\nSmokeless Campfire.\nCampfires updated from beta 1.10.0 to 1.11.0 did not produce smoke particles because campfires in 1.10.0 had no functionality. Their difference in the code is not known.\nIt was merged into the normal version of the block in an unknown update."}

These features may have been replaced, or a developer decided against the feature later on.\nNote: This page only documents game features that were removed; features of an existing game element that were removed are noted in that element's history. See &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20unused%20features\"&gt;Bedrock Edition unused features&lt;/a&gt; for features that are still currently in the game.\nItems.\nCopper Horn.\nThe copper horn was an item used to play sound, there were 10 variations of copper horns, and each of them played 3 different sounds: when looking up, crouching, or doing neither of those. In total, there were 30 different sounds that could be played using copper horns. \nIn the beta 1.19.0.24, the copper horn has been removed. Mojang in the &lt;a href=\"Feedback%20site\"&gt;Minecraft Feedback&lt;/a&gt;'s Knowledge Base saids \"the Copper Horn was a fun experiment that didn't quite live up to our design goals, so we decided to remove it\".\nRecipes.\nStone bricks.\nIn older versions, &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; could be crafted using &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, and their polished variants. However in 1.9, stone bricks were changed to be crafted with stone only.\nRedstone repeaters.\nIn older versions, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;s could be crafted using &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, and their polished variants. However, the recipes then changed to use only stone.\nStructures.\nNether reactor.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.1%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, a Nether reactor could be activated by tapping its core, sending the client message \"Active!\". Immediately after activation, a massive 35\u00d717\u00d717 structure of &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; with multiple rooms, unofficially referred to as a \"Nether Spire\", was generated around the reactor, then the cobblestone would turn to glowing obsidian and pigmen would start spawning along with nether related items such as quartz. Over time the reactor would cool, and once it diminished the glowing obsidian would turn into normal obsidian. The reactor was constructed by placing &lt;a href=\"gold%20block\"&gt;gold block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor%20core\"&gt;nether reactor core&lt;/a&gt; in the 3\u00d73\u00d73 arrangement shown below. The Nether Reactor's functions were removed after the Nether was added into Pocket Edition, but can still be obtained, without its functionality, using an external editor.\nGameplay.\nPowered rail.\nPrior to Pocket Edition v0.13.0 alpha build 1, any placed &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt; would be always active. This was because &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; mechanics did not exist at the time.\nSplashes.\nWhen a splash is removed, the line it occupied in splashes.json is deleted, meaning the line number of all subsequent splashes lowers by one.\nSprinting in water.\nPrior to Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.13.8 the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; could &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. This feature was removed soon after due to the new &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; mechanic. In Mobile on Bedrock Edition however, you can still do that by sprinting first then hold sprint and one of the buttons that uses to go up in the water simultaneously.\nUI.\nThere have been many UIs that have been changed, such as the &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;. The crafting table UI has changed since &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.2&lt;/a&gt;, but before that version, the crafting table had already previously been changed. Early UI for the crafting table had text showing item information could be crafted. This is similar to the &lt;a href=\"stonecutter\"&gt;stonecutter&lt;/a&gt; UI, which later changed in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.9.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.13.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.13.0&lt;/a&gt;, when the crafting table's UI was changed, the stonecutter UI was completely removed and its use was re-purposed to a decorative block. Also, the &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; text of output items and information of that item could be used.\nUI text information.\nAs the old UI was removed, text information showed in that UI was also removed.\nEnhanced underwater visibility.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.4.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, wearing an enchanted &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; enchantment would boost underwater vision. The higher the level, the better it improved the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s vision. This enhanced vision has since been removed, due to the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; texture being changed and because the player can now see clearly underwater without effects or enchantments. However, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; is still required for better visibility. Also, enhanced underwater vision is still obtainable from other methods, such as &lt;a href=\"Conduit%20Power\"&gt;Conduit Power&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt;s added in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.5.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.5.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nFull hotbar.\nBefore the Better Together update, creating a world in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode always had a full hotbar, which included oak saplings, bricks, oak planks, spruce planks, cobblestone walls, dirt, etc. (dependent on the sixth to ninth hotbar slots).\nTilling grass.\nIn older versions, tilling a &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; had a small chance of dropping wheat seeds.\nAccidental Education Edition additions.\nSeveral features intended to be exclusive to were accidentally added in the first build of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.16.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.16.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, and were removed shortly after. Among these features were the &lt;a href=\"Allow%20and%20deny%20blocks\"&gt;Allow and Deny blocks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"chalkboard\"&gt;chalkboard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"border\"&gt;border&lt;/a&gt; block and the &lt;a href=\"portfolio\"&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt; item. Some of these items were readded in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.12.0\"&gt;1.12.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bedrock%20Edition%201.13.0\"&gt;1.13.0&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bedrock%20Edition%201.16.0\"&gt;1.16.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntities.\nInstant chicken jockeys.\nPrior to Pocket Edition v0.14.0 alpha build 1, &lt;a href=\"chicken%20jockey\"&gt;chicken jockey&lt;/a&gt;s had a chance of spawning from &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, and their &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s. At that time, baby zombies and baby zombified piglins had a 5% chance to spawn as a chicken jockey. However, as of v0.14.0 build 1, chicken jockeys were partially removed and no longer spawn naturally, but baby zombies, baby &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, and baby &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s have a 15% chance to spawn as a jockey when trying to attack the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Said jockeys will seek and mount nearby &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that can be ridden, such as &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s. However, baby zombified piglins did not have the ability to mount nearby mobs, causing zombified piglin chicken jockeys to be completely removed.\nChickens spawning in the Nether.\nDue to the natural zombified piglin chicken jockey removal, &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s are no longer able to spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, as zombified piglins will no longer spawn as zombified piglin chicken jockeys.\nHostile zombified piglin drops and behavior.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.11.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s dropped &lt;a href=\"feather\"&gt;feather&lt;/a&gt;s as common drops and &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s as rare drops. This was changed in v0.11.0 build 1; in this update, the zombified piglin's common drop was changed to &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; and its rare drop was changed to &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. In Alpha 0.12.1 build 1, &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s were also added as common drops.\nBefore Alpha 0.12.1 build 1, zombified piglins were hostile mobs that burned in sunlight but were also immune to fire. However, during this time, fire particles would still be shown around them, even though the zombified piglins themselves did not take any damage. During this time, they also lacked a hat layer, moved slowly, and both of their hands did not draw up. In Alpha 0.11.0 build 1, they had a &lt;a href=\"chicken%20jockey\"&gt;chicken jockey&lt;/a&gt; variant, but in v0.14.0 build 1, their chicken jockey variant was removed and prior to v0.12.1 build 1, the only way to make the variant spawn naturally was from an active &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor%20core\"&gt;nether reactor core&lt;/a&gt;. In v0.14.0 build 1, adult zombified piglins were mountable by the baby zombified variants. In &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.12.0&lt;/a&gt;, zombified variants had a small chance to spawn with armor but then removed.\nTamed ocelots.\n&lt;a href=\"Ocelot\"&gt;Ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s were tameable by feeding them raw cod or raw salmon to transform them into cats. However, in Beta 1.8.0.8 ocelots and cats became separate mobs, and giving them any type of fish will just breed them and gain the trust of the player and increase baby ocelot growth speed by 10% rather than taming them.\nMob behavior.\nMagma cubes taking damage when wet.\n&lt;a href=\"Magma%20cube\"&gt;Magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s previously took damage when they became wet, as the vanilla behavior pack had the magma cube's behavior codice_1 set to codice_2. Magma cubes would also take damage if exposed to sunlight or moonlight during rain and while in the water. However, as of an unknown build in 1.1, this feature was considered a bug and removed, as its vanilla behavior of taking damage when wet was set to codice_3 again.\nHorses.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s were added, they used an older model, which was replaced with a newer model in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.6\"&gt;1.2.6&lt;/a&gt;. In the earlier versions of v0.15.0 builds, horses could be tamed by feeding them food, although this feature was removed and now the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is required to mount the horse to tame it.\nBreedable dolphins.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt; was added in Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.20.1, it was breedable by feeding them &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt;. However, in beta 1.5.0.0, feeding a dolphin with raw fish will make it swim toward the nearest &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;. Baby dolphins can only spawn naturally in the ocean and not via breeding.\nVillagers avoiding monsters.\nAt an earlier version where &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s were added to the game, they would avoid any type of monster, including neutral mobs such as endermen and spiders. However, in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.12.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, this feature was removed, as villagers now only avoid zombie variants and &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s as of Bedrock Edition 1.1.\nBaby mobs with adult sounds.\nIn earlier versions of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20Alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, all baby versions of mobs used the same sounds as their adult counterparts, rather than the high-pitched versions that they use now.\nBurning attack.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20Alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, if a mob that is set on fire attacks another mob, the mob would always transfer its burning effect to the mob it attacked. For mobs that could fire a projectile, such as the &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;, its projectiles would always be set on fire. However, as of an unknown update, burning attacks now depend on regional difficulty.\nMobs always dropping armor but not items.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.1%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, mobs could spawn with equipment, but if the mob was killed, it would always drop its armor, even when killed from &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, falling, &lt;a href=\"drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt;, or otherwise dying. However, they would never drop an item held in their hand (an exception was the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;, which would always drop whichever potion it was drinking upon death).\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.0\"&gt;1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, this feature was removed, and now a mob with a weapon and/or armor equipped will drop any of its equipped items when killed by a player, and only at an 8.5% chance for each item. This includes potions dropped by &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nMobs breathing in lava.\nPreviously, any mobs under the Fire Resistance effect could stay submerged under lava without suffocation. As of an unknown update, this feature was removed and only some mobs, such as the &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;, are able to breathe in lava. Now, the player and most other mobs require either the Water Breathing or Conduit Power status effects in order to breathe in lava.\nGuardians attacking fish.\nIn beta 1.2.14.2, &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s were hostile toward &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;, but this feature was removed in the 1.6.0 betas due to a performance issue with low-end devices when the player is near a &lt;a href=\"monument\"&gt;monument&lt;/a&gt;.\nParticles.\nFor testing purposes, some particles which couldn't generate naturally were added in several versions. However, these particles have since been removed.\nFood.\nHealing.\nPrior to 0.12.1 build 1, eating food would heal the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; directly. With the addition of the &lt;a href=\"hunger%20bar\"&gt;hunger bar&lt;/a&gt;, this feature was removed.\nPufferfish.\nBefore 0.12.1 build 1, eating &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; would not inflict the &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nWorld generation.\nBiomes.\nBefore Alpha 0.9.0, many biomes existed, most of which were removed. Biomes prior to Alpha 0.9.0 are identical to Java Edition's biomes between the &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Update\"&gt;Halloween Update&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Update\"&gt;Adventure Update&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt;'s biomes before &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20version%20history\"&gt;TU5&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiomes that got removed in Alpha 0.9.0:\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"extreme%20hills\"&gt;extreme hills&lt;/a&gt; biome and its variants did not generate &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; above Y=90.\nVillages.\nBefore Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha build 1, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s used &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; paths; however, this was changed and &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s are now used instead.\nPrior to Pocket Edition v0.15.0 alpha build 1, &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s that would generate in &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biomes used oak &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, oak wood &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, oak &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, and oak &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, but this village was later replaced with the acacia village.\nTrees.\nAt the same time that cold-en oak trees existed, &lt;a href=\"oak%20tree\"&gt;oak tree&lt;/a&gt;s at the time would only generate with 2 &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s in a canopy rather than 3.\nMineshafts.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s were added to &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; in v0.9.0 build 1, it would generate a &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; inside of it instead of a &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;, which was because cave spiders didn't exist in Pocket Edition yet.\nNether Spires.\nThe Nether Spire was a huge structure consisting of &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; that generated when a &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor%20core\"&gt;nether reactor core&lt;/a&gt; was activated. It would replace many blocks and started spawning multiple rare items and &lt;a href=\"zombie%20pigmen\"&gt;zombie pigmen&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor%20core\"&gt;nether reactor core&lt;/a&gt; stopped working, all the reactor blocks that had already become &lt;a href=\"glowing%20obsidian\"&gt;glowing obsidian&lt;/a&gt; transformed into normal &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. The Nether Spire structure would start to break, causing holes to form on the outside. It also set the time to night. The Nether Spire consisted of many floors and would destroy many blocks in its path.\nIf the Nether Spire generated in a high place, the upper part of the nether spire would not generate properly and become cut off due to the then-128 block height limit. Activating the Nether Reactor Core at Y=1 would cause the bedrock to be replaced with netherrack (making it possible to fall into the Void if the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s difficulty was set higher than Peaceful).\nFar Lands.\nThe Far Lands was the area that formed the \"edge\" of the \"infinite\" map versions prior to &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.17.30\"&gt;1.17.30&lt;/a&gt;. They initiated approximately 12,550,821 blocks from the center of the world, at X/Z 0. The Far Lands had three variations: The Edge Far Lands, the skygrid, and nothingness.\nThe Edge Far Lands and the skygrid both featured extremely strange terrain. The Edge Far Lands formed a solid wall that extended up to Y=127, with extremely long, large holes perpendicular to the edge. This wall pattern continued below ground level to the bottom of the map. The Edge Far Lands became less dense as the player ventured further out, transitioning completely into nothingness by X/Z +12,758,545.\nThe skygrid consisted of a 3D pattern of surface layer blocks that extended from Y=127 to the bottom of the map. In later versions of the game prior to their removal, the skygrid only generated in the Nether and the End, with the same areas in the Overworld being occupied by nothingness.\nIn nothingness, terrain stopped generating entirely, with the only features being the ocean and the bedrock layer. Certain structures could still generate in this area, and the surface of the ocean was frozen in cold biomes.\nThe Edge Far Lands, the skygrid, and nothingness were all removed in Bedrock Edition beta 1.17.20.20.\nSounds.\nMany sounds were removed in Bedrock Edition, such as old footsteps, old breaking block sounds, old &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; and metal block sounds, old sounds for &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; sounds, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;s, along with others.\n\"Old Hurt\" still exists with the command.\nOther.\nServers.\nMineplex.\nMineplex and its website have been shut down as of May 16, 2023, and was removed from the Featured Servers list. But Mineplex is now returning soon after former admin and Content Creator Samito acquired 100% of Mineplex.\nCrying obsidian texture.\nThe old texture of Crying Obsidian was added in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.1.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.1.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"terrain.png\"&gt;terrain.png&lt;/a&gt; what matches &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.3\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.3&lt;/a&gt;. It was removed in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.2.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, as terrain.png has now been changed to match up with &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.0\"&gt;1.16.0&lt;/a&gt;, these blocks were added to the game. For \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" since &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt; (20w10a), this texture was re-added in &lt;a href=\"Programmer%20Art\"&gt;Programmer Art&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;samp&gt;123123.png&lt;/samp&gt;.\n&lt;samp&gt;123123.png&lt;/samp&gt; was added to the game files in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.3.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.3.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt; with the last changed date April 5, 2012. Presumably, a mockup for the Minecraft Advanced Touch Technology Interface System (MATTIS) crafting system, first publicly announced on April 17, 2012. It was removed in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.3.3%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.3.3 alpha&lt;/a&gt;.\ncommand.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.16.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.16.0&lt;/a&gt;, it was possible to summon fireballs, small fireballs, wither skulls, and their dangerous variants using commands. This was removed in 1.0."}

Since &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.9.0%20alpha%20build%201\"&gt;v0.9.0 build 1&lt;/a&gt;, cocoa beans were made able to be obtained with &lt;a href=\"cocoa%20pods\"&gt;cocoa pods&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.16.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.16.0&lt;/a&gt; official release, cocoa beans' crafting recipe was removed.\nThe recipe was removed because cocoa beans could be obtained from cocoa pods. It was reported by a user in the issue tracker and was confirmed as an unintended feature.\nEnchanted golden apple.\nThe &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt; recipe was removed in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2\"&gt;1.2 beta 1.2.0.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, enchanted golden apples may still be &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Golden%20Apple%23Obtaining\"&gt;obtained&lt;/a&gt; in other ways.\nBed.\nThe recipe of crafting the red &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; with any &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; color was removed in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.1.0\"&gt;Pocket Edition 1.1.0&lt;/a&gt; with the addition of multiple colored beds. This recipe was removed because prior to 1.1.0, only red beds existed in the game, and now it is required to have matching red wool to craft a red bed.\nOld Stonecutter.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.13.0%20alpha%20build%201\"&gt;v0.13.0 build 1&lt;/a&gt;, the crafting recipe for the &lt;a href=\"Stonecutter/old\"&gt;old stonecutter&lt;/a&gt; was removed, but it is only available through add-ons.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.10.0.3\"&gt;Bedrock Edition beta 1.10.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, the old stonecutter was not removed but functionally replaced with the new &lt;a href=\"stonecutter\"&gt;stonecutter&lt;/a&gt;.\nNether reactor core.\nThe &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor%20core\"&gt;nether reactor core&lt;/a&gt;'s recipe was made no longer available and it no longer appears in the creative inventory. It will drop its ingredients when broken.\nSmooth stone slab.\nIn older versions, the smooth stone slab (called Stone Slab then) could be crafted using any &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;. However, the recipe changed to use stone only in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.2.0.2\"&gt;1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.9.0.0\"&gt;1.9.0&lt;/a&gt;, the recipe changed again so it requires &lt;a href=\"smooth%20stone\"&gt;smooth stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nStone bricks.\nIn older versions, &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt; could be crafted using &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, and their polished variants. However, in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.2.0.2\"&gt;1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, stone bricks were changed to be crafted with stone only.\nRedstone repeater.\nIn older versions, &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Repeater\"&gt;redstone repeaters&lt;/a&gt; could be crafted using &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, and their polished variants. However, in 1.2.0, the recipes changed to use only stone.\nRedstone comparator.\nIn older versions, &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Comparator\"&gt;redstone comparators&lt;/a&gt; could be crafted using &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, and their polished variants. However, in 1.2.0, the recipes changed to use only stone.\nSandstone and red sandstone stairs.\nSandstone and red sandstone stairs were previously crafted from any type of Sandstone or Red Sandstone, but in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.9.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.9.0&lt;/a&gt;, the recipe changed to use regular sandstone or red sandstone only.\nSandstone and red sandstone slab.\nSandstone and red sandstone slabs were previously crafted from any type of sandstone or red sandstone, but in Bedrock Edition 1.9.0, the recipe changed to use regular sandstone or red sandstone only.\nHoneycomb Block.\nHoneycomb blocks were previously crafted from 9 &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt;s. Now, honeycomb block can be crafted from 4 honeycombs.\nCopper Horn.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Horn\"&gt;Copper Horn&lt;/a&gt; was an item used to play sound, which had 10 variations; each of them could play 3 different sounds when looking up, crouching, or doing neither of those, respectively. In total, there were 30 different sounds that could be played using copper horns. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.19.0.24\"&gt;beta 1.19.0.24&lt;/a&gt;, the Copper Horn was removed. Mojang in the &lt;a href=\"Feedback%20site\"&gt;Minecraft Feedback&lt;/a&gt;'s Knowledge Base said \"the Copper Horn was a fun experiment that didn't quite live up to our design goals, so we decided to remove it\".\nString.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20alpha%201.1.0.3\"&gt;Pocket Edition alpha 1.1.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive recipe of using one &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt; to craft 9 &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; was added. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.20.10.20\"&gt;Bedrock Edition beta 1.20.10.20&lt;/a&gt;, the recipe was removed to match .\nSmelting recipes.\nRed dye.\nThe reason for the removal of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dye\"&gt;red dye&lt;/a&gt; recipe is unknown. It may have been because of the name being \"rose red\", implying it came from &lt;a href=\"rose\"&gt;rose&lt;/a&gt;s instead of &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, although the name was changed to \"red dye\" in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.8.0\"&gt;1.8.0&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "74048", "revid": "48384975", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=74048", "title": "Bedrock Edition unused features", "text": "Since the beginning of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\"'s development, there have been a number of features added to the game that has little to no actual use. Some of these features are leftovers from removed features, or simply placeholders for new features in future updates.\nMechanics.\nEnchantments.\nThis is a list of unused features related to enchantments.\nEnchant anything.\n, players cannot enchant a block or item; only tools, weapons, and armor can be enchanted, even if the player is in creative mode. However, it is possible to apply enchantments to non-enchantable items or blocks using an NBT editor. By using an NBT editor, it is possible to apply enchantments that cannot be applied in-game normally, such as Fire Aspect on flint and steel or Blast Resistance on TNT. It is also possible to add multiple enchantments that are not compatible with each other such as Smite or Bane of Arthropods to a sword. Although the command cannot enchant past the maximum level limit, it is possible to enchant items with a higher level than the max limit via the NBT editor.\nLoot table.\nMobs.\nIn vanilla behavior packs, there is a loot table for the &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;, a mob that cannot be spawned in Bedrock Edition.\nChest loot.\nNew Village architecture is no longer behind &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20gameplay\"&gt;Experimental gameplay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.11.0\"&gt;1.11.0&lt;/a&gt;, which consists of new chest loot. However. old village chest loot has not been removed but has become unused. This old loot consists of:\nThere are unused loot tables that have similar loot, like dungeon chest loot before the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;. It is named monster_room.json (unknown structure)\nOther.\nThere is also unknown equipment loot called low_item_tiers.json\nBlocks and items.\nOld stonecutter.\n&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.10.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.10.0&lt;/a&gt; introduced the stonecutter with the model and texture similar to the stonecutter, however, the new stonecutter does not replace the old stonecutter, as the old stonecutter was removed only from the creative inventory and commands. It is still available if the player already had it in a world prior to 1.10.0 or uses inventory editing.\nLava in cauldron.\n&lt;a href=\"Cauldron\"&gt;Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to store &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, but always filled by level. However, using or command with different data values can obtain a cauldron with through level filled by lava, which normally can't happen due to the fact that dying &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; and filling &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt;s isn't possible with lava.\nGlowing obsidian.\n&lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Obsidian\"&gt;Glowing Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; blocks were part of the (now obsolete) &lt;a href=\"Nether%20reactor\"&gt;Nether reactor&lt;/a&gt;. It emits a soft red glow at light level 12, and drops a single &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; when broken with a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20pickaxe\"&gt;wooden pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. It can be obtained only by using inventory editors or a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; enchanted pickaxe and doing the Gravity Block Glitch. As of 0.12.1, this block doesn't generate anymore. The block may still be obtained using inventory editors or by retaining it from previous worlds before the update.\nreserved6.\nThis block was implemented as a temporary fix to a bug causing Fire to spread to any block. This block replaced any Fire blocks created in a world until v0.7.0 when the aforementioned bug was fixed.\nNether reactor core.\nThe functionality of the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Reactor\"&gt;Nether Reactor&lt;/a&gt; was removed in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.1%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor%20core\"&gt;reactor core&lt;/a&gt; block still exists in-game and can be obtained through inventory editing or by retaining it from previous worlds before the update. It now drops its ingredients, and cannot be obtained though normal methods or with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to v0.12.1, they were used to activate the &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor\"&gt;nether reactor&lt;/a&gt;. Tapping on it would activate the reactor if built correctly. When the core is activated for the nether reactor structure, the &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Gold\"&gt;blocks of gold&lt;/a&gt; are both replaced with &lt;a href=\"glowing%20obsidian\"&gt;glowing obsidian&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaintings.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.5.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.5.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s to Pocket Edition, four unused 32\u00d732 paintings were present in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"kz.png\"&gt;kz.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; that remained unused - using IDA and the Android codice_1 file, it has been found that the paintings are referenced from the game code, particularly in the codice_2 method (get all paintings), but the codice_3 method excludes them as possibilities for a random painting. In v0.8.0 alpha build 2, despite still being unused, the textures of these paintings were updated to be more detailed.\nThe paintings are named and designed according to the four classical elements - \"Earth\" features a brown square on a light brown background, \"Water\" is split into a lower light blue half and an upper blue half with a jagged line, \"Fire\" consists of three orange isosceles triangles on a yellow background, with the largest having a small red triangle inside it, and \"Wind\" features a beige hollow circle on a white background.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Zbihlyj\"&gt;Helen Zbihlyj&lt;/a&gt;, these paintings were originally added \"as part of a Pocket Edition promo map\" (no footage found) which was planned to be a part of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; promotion at &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202012\"&gt;MINECON 2012&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202013\"&gt;or 2013&lt;/a&gt; and have never been used in game. The artist of these paintings remains unknown.\nUpdate game blocks.\nThe update game block looks like a dirt block with the word \"update!\" written with what appears to be grass. This was a placeholder for blocks that were put into the game before the full files made. It was available for the outdated version of 1.13.0 . It could be seen if the player was playing with a friend on 1.13.0 and their device wasn't updated or if using an item in a world then downgrading Minecraft to a version that didn't have the block. Players can still get this by placing an Education Edition block, then disabling Education Edition, also using the /setblock command for a block called \"Unknown\" places this block, which can then can be broken and collected.\nIt wasn't called the update game block either, the name used numbers and letters.\nIt can be found if a friend runs a world on a newer version and all added blocks on that version then have this texture. \nThere is also a version of this block with the word \"ate!upd\".\nInvisible bedrock.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt;, invisible bedrock made up the borders of &lt;a href=\"old\"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; worlds. As of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.18.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.18.0&lt;/a&gt;, it is no longer possible to create new old worlds, but it is still possible to play existing old worlds that were created prior to this update. The block is now unused, but it can still be obtained via add-ons or inventory editing. If obtained these ways, the texture in inventory is one face of a &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; block, and the tooltip is codice_4.\nOld wooden slab.\nBefore normal wooden slabs were added, another type of wooden slab existed with stone characteristics.\nMore explorer maps.\nDespite ocean explorer maps, woodland explorer and buried treasure maps being the only &lt;a href=\"explorer%20map\"&gt;explorer map&lt;/a&gt;s that can be obtained in game, other explorer maps actually exist in the game files, and can be obtained only via inventory editing. These maps being:\nThese explorer maps, named \"Unknown Maps\", have the same scale as the woodland and ocean explorer maps. However, when held, its name is changed to Map 0 and shows a green triangle to mark the destination structure.\nThese explorer maps have normal map textures but have the same layout as a woodland and ocean explorer maps, which are brown. They use stripes for bodies of water, and a sort of tan color for landmasses.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; obtains these unused explorer maps in an incorrect dimension, ex: obtaining a fortress explorer map in the Overworld causes the game to freeze and/or eventually crash.\nPotions and tipped arrows.\nSome potions are unobtainable in normal gameplay, they appear in 3 different types: drinkable potions, splash potions, and lingering potions. Each potion also has its own respective tipped arrow variant, they are:\nTipped arrows.\nBesides the tipped arrows that are created from unused potions, some tipped arrows are also unused. These tipped arrows do not give any effects when shot at an entity. These arrows are tipped arrows from base potions:\nPurpur blocks.\nThere are unused data values of the purpur block that have the same texture as the normal purpur block and can be obtained only by or inventory editing. These are:\nUnused grass variants.\nThere are unused data values of grass variants which can be obtained only by or inventory editing. These are:\nResources.\nThere are no items, placeable blocks, or mobs for these, as they appear only as textures, meaning they are currently without use in-game. Some of these are from the Education Edition of Minecraft, and their textures still exist .\nBlocks.\nChalkboard.\n&lt;a href=\"Chalkboard\"&gt;Chalkboard&lt;/a&gt; comes in 3 variants: slate, poster, and board.\nCamera.\nThe &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt;'s texture still remains, despite it no longer existing as a block, although it was re-added in &lt;a href=\"beta%201.12.0.2\"&gt;beta 1.12.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, being obtainable with the command, but only as an item. However, the ability to get the camera using commands were removed again in &lt;a href=\"beta%201.13.0.1\"&gt;beta 1.13.0.1&lt;/a&gt;. It is used to take photos because back then, phones didn't have the ability to take screenshots. Cameras are once again obtainable with in &lt;a href=\"beta%201.16.100.54\"&gt;beta 1.16.100.54&lt;/a&gt;, and can now take screenshots. However it was removed again in &lt;a href=\"beta%201.16.100.58\"&gt;beta 1.16.100.58&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld rose.\nThe exclusive blue rose was removed from the game, but its texture still remains as codice_5\nItems.\nItems from Education Edition.\nItems that were added during &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.16.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.16.0&lt;/a&gt; development versions:\nPortfolio.\n&lt;br&gt;The \n&lt;a href=\"Portfolio\"&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt; was an item that can save photos that were taken with the camera.\nChalkboard.\n&lt;br&gt;\nComes in all 3 variants: slate, poster, and board.\nCamera.\nThe camera item takes a screenshot and saves it to the internal storage of the device the game is being played on.\nSpawn agent.\n&lt;br&gt;\nDoes not spawn an &lt;a href=\"agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; unless connected to a WebSocket server.\nMinecart with furnace.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20furnace\"&gt;minecart with furnace&lt;/a&gt; exists , while in Bedrock Edition it appears as an inventory icon texture.\nQuiver.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe quiver was going to be used to hold arrows, but it was never implemented; Dinnerbone said that holding arrows in the offhand felt more natural.\nRuby.\nRubies were supposed to be in the game, but since Dinnerbone was color-blind and couldn\u2019t tell the difference between it and &lt;a href=\"Redstone\"&gt;Redstone&lt;/a&gt;, it was scrapped, leaving only a texture. It was implemented in , with a completely different use and texture.\nHoglin meat.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.0\"&gt;1.16.0&lt;/a&gt;, two textures named and were added. They are textured identically to raw beef and cooked beef, respectively.\nEntities and mobs.\nGray tabby cat.\nIn the vanilla &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; exists. However, it is completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.\nTamed ocelot.\nIn the vanilla resource pack, textures exist, along with the other cat textures, for an &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt; texture, as well as the texture for a tamed ocelot. Again, it is completely unused and can't be spawned in-game.\nOld nitwit villager and old nitwit zombie villager.\nNitwit &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s have existed from earlier versions alongside its zombie villager version, but remain unused. Its texture still exists in the game files.\nNitwit villager and zombie villager added in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.10.0\"&gt;1.10.0&lt;/a&gt; but they are new villagers with a different ID and texture, which means the old nitwit villager and zombie villager textures are unused.\nClownfish.\nIn the vanilla resource pack, there is a texture for a generic &lt;a href=\"Tropical%20Fish%20%28item%29\"&gt;clownfish&lt;/a&gt;, which is completely unused, instead, clownfish are a variant of &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther.\nOld Pocket Edition panorama.\nAs of Bedrock Edition 1.2.0, a new panorama background is used, but the old panorama before 1.2.0 was not removed. Despite many updates to the main panorama, the (now unused) old panorama texture still exists.\nStatus effects.\nSome of the status effects in Bedrock Edition are unobtainable and can be obtained only by using inventory editing or .\nHealth boost.\n&lt;a href=\"Health%20Boost\"&gt;Health Boost&lt;/a&gt; was added to the game in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.12.0&lt;/a&gt;. It gives extra health that can regenerate. It can be obtained only with commands.\nWorld generation.\nNether in Old world type.\nNether Portals cannot be activated in the &lt;a href=\"Old\"&gt;Old&lt;/a&gt; world type unless converted to the Infinite world type. \nAs of Alpha 0.16.0 build 5, commands can be used by players to access the Nether in the Old world type without converting it to Infinite by using commands or with the Nether Portal.\nThe Nether in the Old world type looks like the normal Nether but is limited in size. It is the same size as the Overworld, which is 256\u00d7256 with a 128 block height. However, since the Nether and the Overworld have the same size, and traveling 1 block in the Nether is still equal to traveling 8 blocks in the Overworld, this leads to a problem that can make the game freeze or crash. This is the reason why the Nether can not be accessed in the Old world type. When the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; goes to the Nether, a new &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt; generates naturally in the Overworld, because a portal placed with commands is not counted. However, the player cannot make a nether portal normally.\nEnd in Old world type.\nThe End Dimension was added, and alongside it the End in the Old world type. The End is inaccessible because strongholds never generate in the Old world type and building an end portal also does not work. The only way to access it is via block-placement commands such as and .\nUnlike the Nether in Old worlds, which can generate all structures, The End here generates just the main island and not the outer islands, due to the size limit of 256\u00d7256 blocks.\nHowever, sometimes the End in the Old world type generates improperly, resulting in the central island not generating due to the border. If this happens, the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; may get stuck in mid-air at the border, and the exit portal generates halfway or does not appear. The &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway%20portal\"&gt;end gateway portal&lt;/a&gt; is also nonfunctional, due to the size limit.\nThese problems are the reasons why the End dimension is normally inaccessible, as the only way to go back to the Overworld is via cheats or death.\nCustom superflats.\nThere is an NBT string in every level.dat file called \"FlatWorldLayers\", which when edited properly, can cause the respective world to generate custom layers. This is used when Custom Superflats created on Legacy Console Edition get converted over to Bedrock Edition.\nCustom Superflats can, nevertheless, still be created without cheats through custom world folders.\nOther.\nFifth giant tree taiga biome variants.\nThe file codice_6 contained a biome name that never existed in game.\nOut of the five giant tree taiga biomes, only four can generate in the game while another one, codice_7, appears only in this code, as that biome is not defined in the vanilla behavior pack in the biomes folder. Whether the biome is a dropped feature or not is unknown.\nColors: \nWorld settings.\n&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20level%20format\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt; contains several player abilities. Most of these are used in multiplayer, to determine who has what permissions. However, some are completely inaccessible without an NBT editor. With the exception of codice_8, none of these settings can be altered in-game for the world itself, only for individual players. The codice_9 changes in-game as players toggle flight mode, but cannot be altered manually without editing.\nEntities.\nArmed zombie villager.\nThe zombie villager was added, but it cannot spawn with armor equipped. However, armed zombie villagers are still spawnable via mob editing.\nIf a zombie villager is wearing armor, the helmet is struck through the head, the chestplate and leggings can be seen through holes in their clothes, while the boots look normal.\nWither skeleton archer.\nIf a wither skeleton is equipped with a bow, it uses it as a ranged weapon, and arrows shot are always set on fire regardless of what enchantment it has, or if it has an enchantment. However, wither skeleton archers cannot spawn naturally.\n&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; has .\nWither jockey.\nSpiders spawned in the Nether have a 1% chance of spawning while being ridden by a skeleton, which has an 80% of being a wither skeleton and a 20% of a normal skeleton. However, since spiders cannot naturally spawn in the Nether, this mob is unused. Instead, it can be spawned using spider spawn eggs in Creative mode. Wither jockeys also have a cave spider variant. It can also be spawned with commands.\nZombie horse.\nZombie horses can be spawned only by using its spawn egg or , as it cannot spawn naturally.\nZombie horse jockey (and variants).\nThese jockeys (see below) are unused since zombie horses cannot spawn naturally.\nBaby trader llama.\nTrader llamas were added in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.11.0.1\"&gt;beta 1.11.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, which at that time were breedable and could spawn a baby. However, as of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.11.0.3\"&gt;beta 1.11.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, trader llamas no longer spawn naturally as babies since they are no longer breedable, causing the baby trader llama to become unused.\nRavagers.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt; with riders do not spawn naturally and must be summoned using :\nAgent.\nThe agent was added in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20alpha%200.17.0.1\"&gt;alpha 0.17.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, although it was hidden in the file of the game. However, it is still used in conjunction with Code Connection.\nCamera.\nThe camera was first found in the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.1.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.1.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt; .apk file, as of this version, the camera has functionality. \nAs of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.9.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.9.0&lt;/a&gt;, the camera entity was removed. Tommaso stated \"It doesn't mean that it's dead forever, in fact, I have a lot of ideas for it! I think it will be back when have shaders, sharing and redstone.\"\nThe camera was re-added in alpha &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.14.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.14.0&lt;/a&gt;, accessible only with inventory editors, but was removed again in alpha &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.16.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.16.0&lt;/a&gt;. However, the block can still be obtained in servers.\nCameras were added again in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.8.0.8\"&gt;beta 1.8.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, but it requires mob editing to summon it or using an NBT editor to get its spawn egg. The camera can now be obtained using as of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.12.0.2\"&gt;beta 1.12.0.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.13.0.1\"&gt;beta 1.13.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, this item can be used by slide while using the item, the take picture sound can be heard and an explosion can be seen and a picture is saved to LocalState/screenshots folder on Windows 10 or /storage/emulated/0/screenshots folder on Android. However, Cameras are no longer obtainable using \nAs of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.16.100.54\"&gt;beta 1.16.100.54&lt;/a&gt;, Cameras are once again obtainable using . It was reverted again in &lt;a href=\"beta%201.16.100.58\"&gt;beta 1.16.100.58&lt;/a&gt;\nOld villager.\nOld villagers, prior to the Village and Pillage update are still available in the game, but they are instantly converted into codice_10 (new villagers).\nTheir spawn egg can be obtained only via . However, trying to spawn them with that spawn egg spawns an old villager who is instantly killed. A new villager then spawns and take its place.\nTheir trade tables were not removed, even though trading GUI has changed between Village and Pillage and prior updates.\nElder guardian ghost.\nThe elder guardian ghost is an unused mob added in &lt;a href=\"beta%201.13.0.4\"&gt;beta 1.13.0.4&lt;/a&gt;. Its file isn't included in the behavior pack, and it can be spawned only by using the command . "}

This version disappeared after the acquisition of Minecraft by Microsoft. Due to the transition, all versions of Minecraft Pocket Edition, including the \u201cJ\u201d version, were removed from the store.\nThe first version of Minecraft for mobile devices was Pocket Edition, released on August 16, 2011. Contrary to popular belief, this edition consisted of four subversions, the most popular being Minecraft Pocket Edition Original and Minecraft Pocket Edition Lite. Each offered different features and limitations, allowing players to experience the game in different ways, adapting to the capabilities of mobile devices at the time.\nThus, Pocket Edition J was one of the subversions intended for low-end devices, with a reduced weight of only 1.84 megabytes. Due to its limitations, it had low performance and a very small inventory. Despite this, Pocket Edition J was paid, but a demo could be purchased.\nCurrently, it is not known for sure how many versions of Pocket Edition J were created, although the following are known: 0.3.0 J Alpha, 0.5.0 J Alpha, 0.5.0 J and 0.1.1 J. The last one is the only one available on the internet."}

{"id": "170999", "revid": "46666745", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=170999", "title": "Minecraft Wiki (website)", "text": "Minecraft Wiki is an online encyclopedia which covers the \"Minecraft\" franchise and is maintained by the game's voluntary community. Over the years, it has gone through a number of periods where its users have built and shaped such a website. On 24 September 2023, Minecraft Wiki was forked to https://minecraft.wiki, which is hosted by Weird Gloop, due to advertising on Fandom (see for more information). \nDescription.\nThe Minecraft Wiki runs on the software, also used by Wikipedia and many other large wikis. Like other , the content on the Minecraft Wiki is created by volunteers and almost all pages are open to be edited by anyone with a Fandom website account. There are also a number of admins with certain capabilities such as being able to delete pages, but otherwise behave like other editors.\nRecent edits on the wiki are shown in the page, where they can be reviewed and corrected if necessary. Every edit to a page is also listed in its \"page history\" view (accessible under the dropdown next to the \"Edit/\"View source\" button on Desktop view).\nContent on the wiki is divided into different \"namespaces\", which are specified as prefixes in the page title. Articles about &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; are in the \"default namespace\" and do not have any prefix, while &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; articles are in a separate namespace and have a \"Minecraft Dungeons:\" prefix, and &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Legends\"&gt;Minecraft Legends&lt;/a&gt; similarly has its own namespace and prefix. There are many other namespaces that are \"behind the scenes\" and do not directly serve content to readers, including \"File\", containing all of the images, audio and other files uploaded to the wiki; \"Template\", containing code that allows complex content to be more added and modified on articles; and \"Category\", which allows pages to be organized into categories.\nEvery page also has an attached \"Talk:\" page for discussion on that particular page. This allows wiki editors to participate in discussions without having to use a different platform, and for past discussions to be searchable on the wiki itself. The majority of larger decisions are reached through community discussion rather than being decided by a single admin or editor.\nHistory.\nThe Minecraft Wiki was founded on June 17, 2009 by (Samuel Ryan, a British student who got to know Minecraft during his last school year in May 2009), who also created the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Forum\"&gt;Minecraft Forum&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally named \"Minepedia\" and hosted at codice_1. In August 2009, the wiki went offline for three weeks due to a lack of financial resources for hosting. With financial support provided by community member , the wiki came back online on August 28, 2009. Since then, the wiki has been growing quickly along with the growth of \"Minecraft\" itself, doubling in visitors every month.\nOn August 19, 2010, a backup failure caused edits since August 3, 2010 to be lost, resulting in discussions about a new hosting plan. Despite community member giving some hardware, the site has been growing too quickly, raising issues again, which ended up with wiki staff asking for donations, implementing ads and incorporating \"&lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Wire%20Ltd\"&gt;Redstone Wire Ltd&lt;/a&gt;\" to manage both the wiki and forums. While these measures helped, the wiki still suffered from performance issues.\nAround the same time, a company called \"Curse Inc.\" had been trying to step into the wiki hosting business. They approached \"Redstone Wire Ltd\" about acquiring the wiki and forums, which was accepted and since November 15, 2010, the wiki had been owned by Curse. Not long after in December 2010, Minepedia was forced to rename to Minecraft Wiki due to legal issues.\nIn August 2012, Minecraft Wiki introduced a new header, which was followed by a new logo on September 24, 2013.\nIn December 2012, Curse officially launched the wiki farm Gamepedia, with a goal of unifying all of its wikis under a single domain to better compete with other wiki farms, along with using a single engine to power all of the wikis. Minecraft Wiki officially moved to Gamepedia in August 2013.\nIn January 2016, Minecraft Wiki launched a short-lived mobile application. On July 18, 2016 at around 15:00 UTC, Minecraft Wiki surpassed 1 million edits.\nOn August 26, 2016, Curse has been acquired by Amazon through its subsidiary \"Twitch Interactive\", introducing new forms of advertisements. On November 24, 2017, Minecraft Wiki has been moved to .\nIn June 2018, the wiki's Discord server was launched.\nOn December 12, 2018, that Fandom acquired Gamepedia, including the Minecraft Wiki.\nThere have been various pushes over the years to make the wiki less centered around Java Edition. From March 9, 2019 all &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; versions have been prefixed with \"Java Edition\", &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; are prefixed by then unofficial term \"Bedrock Edition\" and Console Edition is being renamed to &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt;. In the months following, a wiki project dedicated to creating videos for wiki articles was created, anonymous users were disallowed from creating new pages (effective September 11, 2019), simplified version history guides were officially adopted, and the wiki expanded beyond &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;base game&lt;/a&gt; with the addition of Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Earth content.\nOn December 17, 2019, a Discord server was launched to discuss merging with the started as part of Fandom's \"&lt;a href=\"w%3AUser%20blog%3AMira%20Laime/Update%20on%20our%20plans%20to%20bring%20Gamepedia%20and%20Fandom%20together\"&gt;Crossover&lt;/a&gt;\" process, ultimately leading to that wiki being closed and redirected 15 months later on March 9, 2021. After that, a few more Minecraft wikis merged. After disputes about \"Minecraft: Story Mode\" Wiki, a Minecraft Story Mode namespace was created in August 2021.\nIn August 2021, the Minecraft Wiki, along with other wikis formerly on Gamepedia, switched from the old Hydra skin to the FandomDesktop skin.\nIn October 2021, the Minecraft Wiki was required to change the wiki logo, main page and usages of official Minecraft logos due to the expiration of a contract with .\nSince the acquisition and changes by Fandom, there have been multiple discussions about switching to another wiki platform.\nAs of January 24, 2023, anonymous editing on the wiki has been disabled due to the potential risks of violating . This reduced the amount of vandalism on the wiki, but also decreased the amount of constructive activity by increasing the barrier to entry for editing.\nA namespace for Minecraft Legends was set up on January 30, 2023.\nIn September 2023, a large majority of the Minecraft Wiki editor community decided to fork from Fandom, Inc. and launch a new wiki. The new wiki, entitled \"The Minecraft Wiki,\" is hosted instead by Weird Gloop Limited, who also runs the official RuneScape Wikis. Listed reasons for forking include getting a new skin, faster load times, fewer advertisements, improved search functionality, the removal of the age verification pop-up, and the reintroduction of anonymous editing."}

{"id": "224218", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=224218", "title": "Minecraft clone", "text": "A Minecraft clone (or \"fake\" Minecraft) is one of various unofficial video games designed to resemble \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\", developed by various developers. The majority of these are apps made for Android and iOS.\nThe names, icons, and in-game graphics of Minecraft clones are intended to deceive potential users into believing they are playing \"Minecraft\". The name of Minecraft itself is normally avoided by publishers of these apps, often using key words such as \u201cmine\u201d, \u201ccraft\u201d, \u201cbuild\u201d, and \u201c3D\u201d; presumably to avoid detection by copyright protectors while still appearing in search results on mobile application storefronts.\nGameplay in Minecraft clones often closely mimics the control scheme of the mobile version of \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", especially older versions of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these games use assets derived from Minecraft itself, including screenshots, graphic and audio files, and/or the original game code, constituting intellectual property violations.\nPurchase and availability.\nUnlike \"Minecraft\", most Minecraft clones can be purchased and downloaded on mobile application storefronts such as the Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS and iPadOS) for free. Others, especially older examples, often come in the form of web games.\nAs Minecraft clones are free to use, they might serve as an alternative to the original Minecraft for users who decide not to purchase the original game after trying the official &lt;a href=\"Demo%20Mode\"&gt;trial version&lt;/a&gt; of \"Minecraft\".\nAs with almost all other free-to-play apps, most Minecraft clones contain in-game advertisements (which are denoted by the text \"Contains ads\" in the app info in the Google Play Store), which might play either between menus or while the game is being played. These can either be banners displayed on certain portions of the screen or full-screen video advertisements that can interrupt gameplay. These can only be turned off by turning off Wi-Fi (and mobile data, for devices with cellular support).\nSome Minecraft clones on mobile platforms can additionally contain in-app purchases, which are bought for real-world currency. Unlike in \"Minecraft\", these might be used for unlocking built-in, in-game functions, including purchases that remove the aforementioned advertisements.\nGameplay.\nMinecraft clones often share similar game modes and difficulties with those in \"Minecraft\". These include game modes matching the premises of &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt;, as well as difficulties matching the differences between the Minecraft difficulties of Peaceful, Easy, Normal, and Hard.\nMinecraft clones often receive updates from their developers containing similar features to major updates released for \"Minecraft\". Many Minecraft clones have equivalent features for almost every object from a certain version of \"Minecraft\".\nDifferences.\nTextures for equivalent items and blocks in Minecraft clones are different from those seen in \"Minecraft\", to prevent copyright issues; the same applies to the models and textures of entities, especially mobs. Often, the appearances of menus and screens in Minecraft clones resembles those used in older versions of \"Minecraft\".\nMinecraft clones often place emphasis onto multiplayer game modes, character customization, and other features that encourage visiting portions of the game with in-app purchases, which receive their own buttons in the main menu.\nNot all of the blocks, items, entities, and other features from the present version of \"Minecraft\" are copied onto Minecraft clones. For instance, a notable number of Minecraft clones seem to be based on the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Update\"&gt;Nether Update&lt;/a&gt; of \"Minecraft\"."}

Mineshafts are the only structures where &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s can be found.\nA unique variant of mineshafts made out of &lt;a href=\"dark%20oak\"&gt;dark oak&lt;/a&gt; wood can generate on the surface in &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biomes.\nGeneration.\nMineshafts generate underground in any Overworld &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;.

When a mineshaft intersects with an &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt;, a barrier of solid blocks generates to prevent fluids from flowing into the mineshaft, often resulting in corridors cut off from the rest of the mineshaft.\nMineshafts often generate on the surface in &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Badlands mineshafts are composed of dark oak planks and &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s with railways more complete above ground.

Mini games can be played solo, &lt;a href=\"splitscreen\"&gt;splitscreen&lt;/a&gt; on the same console, online, or with another console locally via an ad-hoc connection. The three mini games currently available on all versions of Legacy Console Edition are Battle, Tumble, and Glide.\nPrior to each round, all players can freely explore a lobby and interact with various items, such as &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;s. Any player who wears one of the six heads in the lobby retains that head into the next round.\nLobby.\nUpon creating or joining a server, the player spawns in the lobby. It is a small \"town\" in the middle of a superflat world. All players are in adventure mode and are immune to damage (just like in Creative mode). When playing with other players, the next game starts within one minute, although the player can create an invite-only game to gain the freedom to explore the lobby.\nThe mini-game lobby is complex. There are many redstone puzzles scattered around. The main collectables and secrets of the lobby are getting the music discs, getting all of the armor sets, the hidden old lobby, and the mob head hunts to get the the dragon's head.\nIn older versions like PlayStation 3, escape is possible with an elytra or a fishing rod, but the final version is impossible to escape with, due to Microsoft adding invisibible barriers to the \u201cnether portal\u201d exit area. Using elytra in the 1\u00d71 space in the area above the barrier grants the \"supersonic\" achievement.\nBattle.\nInitially codenamed/known as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//tcrf.net/Minecraft%3A_Wii_U_Edition%23Unused_Graphic\"&gt;Arena (as seen in Wii U Edition's unused files)&lt;/a&gt;, Battle is a mini game most similar to the popular \"Hunger Games\" mode on servers, where players compete in a \"last man standing\" or \"deathmatch\" style game. Battle was added to the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; on June 21, 2016. The gameplay of Battle differs from the standard \"Hunger Games\" mode in a variety of ways, such as:\nUp to 16 players can join a single game on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox One Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, 8 players on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 3 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and 4 players on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Vita%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation Vita Edition&lt;/a&gt;. A \"Casual\" or \"Competitive\" option can be chosen when creating a lobby, which can either allow or restrict the use of smaller-sized skins and can change the appearance of spectators. Spectators cannot pass through blocks, but can fly through one block tall spaces. As of TU60 and equivalent updates, the &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; can be found in a map's center chests, commonly in the High Power mode, occasionally in the Food Central mode, and never in the Decayed mode.\nCustom Battle is an option that allows a player to change various aspects of Battle, such as:\nLoot.\nAll loot in the Battle mini game is obtained from chests or other players. Center chests at the beginning of a round may contain high concentrations of valuable loot, such as armor, weapons, food, and potions. Different regions of the maps have different types of loot. Some special, hard-to-reach chests can have valuable loot also. After intervals of time, loot is restocked in chests, with a smaller number of items than they had originally. On small and large maps there are two chests with valuable loot, and on large+ there are four. On high power these chests usually have exclusive loot. The valuable loot, as well as some exclusive loot, can also be found in the chests in the center after a refill, alongside the loot that can be found in regular chests, alot the loot that is found within the center chests at the start of the round, will not appear again after a refill.\nFollowing loot will appear in any of the regular chests around the map:\nFollowing loot will appear within the 2 special chests (4 on Large+) in any map:\nFollowing loot is exclusive to the center chests at the start of a round, and will not appear after a refill:\nFollowing loot can appear in the center chests after a refill:\nThe following appear more often in the High Power custom mode:\nA chest in the Halloween map always contains the following items, regardless of the mode being used:\nMaps.\nAs of TU49 and equivalent updates, there are a total of 21 maps in Battle mini game (excluding the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;). The first three maps - Cavern, Cove, and Crucible - can be used by anyone, however the remaining 18 maps must be purchased through the respective Battle Map Pack or the Season Pass (excluding the Nintendo Switch Edition). Each map is based on a theme, occasionally with unique music and a &lt;a href=\"texture%20pack\"&gt;texture pack&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the texture pack cannot be changed during Battle mini game.\nThe Season Pass and nearly all DLC Battle maps are absent on the Nintendo Switch Edition, even though all other versions, including the &lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt;, have these maps as purchasable DLC. When asked about this during the Official Minecraft Livestream, it was stated that excluding Nintendo Switch Edition players from Battle Map DLC is \"kind of intentional.\" This is currently still the case, where Valley is the only DLC Battle map that is available on the Nintendo Switch Edition through the purchase of the Chinese Mythology Mash-Up Pack.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt; 1.90, maps with the default textures were replaced with the newer \"Minecraft Classic\" pack.\nThe current available battle maps are as follows, with the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt; having access only to Cavern, Cove, Crucible, and Valley:\nDLC packs.\nThe current available Battle Map DLC Packs are as follows, with the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt; having access only to the Chinese Mythology Mash-Up:\nTumble.\nTumble is a mini game most similar to the popular \"Spleef\" mode on servers, where players aim to cause others to fall off of an arena by using &lt;a href=\"snowballs\"&gt;snowballs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s, or other items to mine the ground below them. Tumble was added to the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; on August 30 and August 31, 2016. \nSimilar to Battle, a Tumble game is divided into three rounds. The object of the game is to remove blocks from under other players, causing them to fall in a last-man-standing scenario. The default Tumble mode encompasses a single, large platform where players use &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s to remove blocks. Other modes include competing on three smaller platforms, throwing &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s, using &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s, or throwing &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt;s with the &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; effect. All blocks are broken immediately by a shovel, snowball, or &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;. The sole exception is &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, which act as both a pitfall and an explosive that can be used to destroy lower platforms, if enabled.\nUp to 8 players can join a single game on most platforms, with &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Vita%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation Vita Edition&lt;/a&gt; allowing a maximum of 4. \nGamemodes.\nAs of TU58 and equivalent updates, the \"Custom\" game type allows the host to change these settings:\nAfter a certain amount of time, Showdown mode begins, like in Battle mode. Player names are shown during this period. When shovels are enabled, they are replaced with snowballs.\nEvents.\nVarious special events can occur in the Tumble mini game: \nGlide.\nGlide is a mini game where players maneuver through a track while wearing an &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, aiming to finish in the fastest time or score the most points by flying through colored rings. Glide was added to the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; on March 29, 2017. Glide currently features two different game modes:\nA Glide match is divided into three rounds, where a player with the fastest time or highest score from any round is the victor. Each map has checkpoints with two beacon beams. The player has 3 hearts of health. When losing all 3 hearts of health you die. Hitting a wall causes you to lose one heart of health and landing on the ground causes you to die immediately. Upon death the player respawns at the last checkpoint after a few seconds and can continue playing. Up to 16 players can join a single game on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox One Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, 8 players on &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 3 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and 4 players on &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Vita%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation Vita Edition&lt;/a&gt;. \nSolo.\nBoth Time Attack and Score Attack can also be played in solo mode. When enabled, only one player is required to start the match. Online play is unavailable but multi-player play is possible using a split screen. A match is also divided into one round instead of three. A solo player can press a button to restart the entire game and you can press a different button to teleport back to the last checkpoint. The player's best run in Glide is also recorded (as long as it is under 5 minutes) and a ghost flies alongside to help the player improve. \nMaps.\nSimilar to Battle, every DLC Glide track is absent from the Nintendo Switch Edition, even though all other versions, including the Wii U Edition, have these tracks as purchasable DLC. This is currently still the case, where Cavern, Temple, and Canyon are the only playable tracks on the Nintendo Switch Edition.\nAs of PlayStation 4 Edition 1.90, maps with the default textures were replaced with the newer \"Minecraft Classic\" pack.\nThe current available Glide maps are as follows, with the Nintendo Switch Edition having access only to Cavern, Temple, and Canyon:\nDLC packs.\nThe current available Glide Map DLC Packs are as follows. None are available on the &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;:\nRing blocks.\nThe Glide mini game features an exclusive block type called the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20Block\"&gt;Ring Block&lt;/a&gt;, which comes in green, yellow and blue variants. These are used for the rings that players fly through.\nMusic.\nMini games feature their own unique music tracks. These were released on two separate official soundtracks: ' and '.\nHistory.\n "}

The game was released on December 19, 2011, and never got any official updates.\nAfter its discontinuation, it became open source, and its popularity increased as many players created their own versions of \"Minicraft\". Notch was also developing a sequel called Minitale, but it was never released and little is known about it.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay is in some ways similar to \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The player must gather materials to craft tools to mine ore, chop trees, farm wheat, dig pits, and kill zombies and slimes. In order to win they must defeat the boss, the &lt;a href=\"Air%20Wizard\"&gt;air wizard&lt;/a&gt;. The theme of the Ludum Dare competition the game was created for was \"Alone\", and the game's submission description reads, \"The goal of the game is to kill the only other sentient being in the world, making sure you'll be alone forever.\"\nPlayers spawn in a series of islands, with a border at the edges of the map. \"Minicraft\" has 5 surface biomes, which are forest, plain, desert, mountain, and ocean, as well as 3 cave biomes, which are dry caves, water caves, and lava caves, along with a sky biome.\nThe player has 10 health and 10 energy. Energy rapidly regenerates, while health must be restored with food. Energy is depleted by doing things such as attacking and eating, and these actions cannot be done if the player does not have enough energy. When the player runs out of energy, they are unable to use items and their movement speed is reduced. The more energy a player has, the more damage a tool does to its target when used. Each tier of tool is more powerful and uses less energy than the last; wood tools consume 5 energy when used on most tiles and 7 when used on ore, and each subsequent tool tier uses 1 less energy per action. Eating food consumes 6 energy. If the player runs out of health, they die and have to restart the game. The player also has an inventory with no limit on how many items they can carry and no maximum stack sizes.\nEntities.\nEntities are mobile objects in the game world.\nMobs.\nAll other mobs are hostile towards the player, pursuing them when close and dealing damage on contact.\nFurniture.\nFurniture are objects that can be placed in the world. They collide with players and mobs, and the player can push them around, or pick them up with the power glove. There are six furnitures in the game, the Workbench, the Chest, the Oven, the Furnace, the Anvil and the Lantern. All of them except the lantern can be interacted with and used to craft or store items.\nOther entities.\nThe other entities in the game are Dropped items, which are automatically picked up on contact with the player, and begin to blink and then despawn soon after dropping; and Sparks, which are the projectiles fired by the air wizard, which move slowly away from it and deal 1 damage on contact with the player and other monsters.\nTiles.\nTiles are the two-dimensional equivalent of &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and make up the world of \"Minicraft\".\nItems.\nItems are obtained from killing mobs, breaking tiles and crafting other items.\nLevels.\nThere are 5 levels in the \"Minicraft\" world, connected by staircases. These are:\nGallery.\nNotch\u2019s screenshots:"}

For the in-game default level III, attack speed decreases by 30% (attack speed cooldown attribute decreases by 0.6).\nThe mining speed is reduced to 0.30^\"level\" of the normal mining speed. For the in-game default level III, the speed is reduced to 0.33 (0.027\u00d7) of normal speed, taking 37 times longer than usual to break a block with the proper tool for that block.\nNegative levels increase attack speed, but still act as level 4 with respect to mining.\nWhile afflicted, a player can still &lt;a href=\"craft\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt; and ride entities as usual, but cannot remove most vehicles due to how slowly the vehicle can be broken.\nThe affliction is cured by drinking &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;, although milk does not prevent a subsequent affliction by an elder guardian, which can happen within a few seconds or immediately. &lt;a href=\"Axolotl\"&gt;Axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s can also remove this effect, if the player helps an axolotl kill a mob while an axolotl was battling that mob.\nCauses.\nThe only natural cause of Mining Fatigue is from affliction by an &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;, and the only natural effect level is III.

A player cannot defend from this attack. Concealment behind blocks, underground, or by a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20invisibility\"&gt;potion of invisibility&lt;/a&gt; offers no defense.\n, elder guardians within range afflict Mining Fatigue III immediately.

The official &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; server program started to be developed when Multiplayer Test was released to the public (&lt;a href=\"Classic%200.0.15a%20%28Multiplayer%20Test%201%29\"&gt;0.0.15a (Multiplayer Test 1)&lt;/a&gt;). After Classic &lt;a href=\"Classic%200.30%20%28Creative%29\"&gt;0.30 (Creative)&lt;/a&gt; was released, servers were removed from the game, which is why multiplayer is not available in &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; versions of the game. Servers were reintroduced to the game when &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.15\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.15&lt;/a&gt; was released (however, versions as early as &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.5\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.5&lt;/a&gt; had multiplayer code in them, though it was unusable, except to &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Persson\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt;, who used the code to test multiplayer), and they have been consistently updated since. There are programs available that allow connection to &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; servers. \nThe oldest server version that the launcher will allow the player to download is from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.2.5\"&gt;release 1.2.5&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe \"Minecraft Launcher\" was released during &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.0\"&gt;Alpha v1.0&lt;/a&gt;'s development. This launcher could not update itself, and each time a new update was released for the launcher, a player would have to download it from minecraft.net. This launcher was developed from 2010 to 2013, and is still available to be downloaded from archived versions of its page. It is not known how many versions of this launcher existed. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1.6.1\"&gt;1.6.1&lt;/a&gt; snapshots, a new launcher was released. This launcher was built to update itself, and the player could now have the launcher window and the game window open at the same time. The player could also switch what version they were playing without having to replace &lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt; in the bin directory. This launcher was developed from 2013 to 2018, whether or not it can still be downloaded is not known. The latest version is 1.6.91.\nThe latest \"Minecraft Launcher\" was made available to the public by &lt;a href=\"Nathan%20Adams\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; on October 26, 2016, through a twitter statement and a post on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//reddit.com/r/Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft Reddit community&lt;/a&gt;. This launcher no longer required java to be installed to run it, downloaded its own runtime for the game, and had more advanced features compared to other versions of the launcher. This launcher has been under steady development since 2016, and the current stable release of this launcher is for Windows 7+, for Windows 10+ (Microsoft Store/Xbox app), for macOS, and for Linux."}

Outside of its use in missing models, this is almost always due to a texture being referenced which simply does not exist under that name.\nThe texture uses a prominent black and magenta checkerboard or a black and magenta checkerboard , in order to stand out as much as possible in most cases. Using bright colors is industry standard, and black and magenta is employed by other game development studios, notably Valve.\nThe texture is not intended to appear in vanilla gameplay, and cases where it does are due to misconfigured resource packs.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.20.5\"&gt;Java Edition 1.20.5&lt;/a&gt;, it is not possible to see the missing texture in the vanilla game without the use of a resource pack; creating particles associated with minecraft:air is explicitly forbidden by /particle command and associated commands.\nWhen the game has to use the missing texture, such uses are generally announced in the game's output log:\nHistory.\nHistory of the texture itself.\nThe missing texture used in these versions would be generated differently depending on the operating system and Java version.\nMissing model.\nIn an analogous fashion to the missing texture being used for instances where no texture is defined, the missing model is use in cases where no &lt;a href=\"model\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; is defined, or the model is invalid.\nBy default, the missing model is a full 16x16 cube which uses the missing texture on all six faces. These faces are culled accordingly where possible. Only two faces will have the same color at each vertex, rather than the three one may expect; Mojang have decided to not fix this.\nThe missing model is obviously also never intended to appear in standard gameplay, and uses the missing texture again to appear prominent and highlight errors to fix.\nContrary to popular belief, no central \"missing texture block\" has ever existed in the game; all cases of blocks which use this model are due to another block simply having no assigned texture or model.\nNotable bugs.\nExamples of cases where the missing model is not used.\nBy definition, any block which does not use a model does not use the cubic missing model. If a model is still not defined for the block, however, this will likely still reflect in the block's particles.\nThe vast majority of entity models are also completely hardcoded. There are two notable exceptions in the &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glow%20item%20frame\"&gt;glow item frame&lt;/a&gt;, which do in fact have customizable models. Therefore, the item frame and glow item frame are the only two entities which are capable of using the missing model; all other entities may lose their texture, but retain the same model shape.\n&lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s are a particularly interesting example of an entity which are discussed further in a later section. In multiple version ranges, certain invalid horses can either appear completely invisible or have a solid white texture, neither of which are the missing model.\nTranslucency ordering.\nFrom 14w25a up to 19w38b, there existed a remarkable visual bug where missing models associated with blocks that used translucent rendering (such as ice, stained glass, stained glass panes and slime blocks) would interact anomalously with the rendering of transparent blocks in the world, as well as of entities, including the holder. Unlike normal missing models, translucent blocks and other entities would render in front of such a model when held, even if they were physically farther away from the camera. However, this only applies if the distant entity or transparent block in question is not first occluded by the player model. As a result, the held translucent block can form a player-shaped silhouette around the player model in front of a background made of entities (such as paintings) or translucent blocks.\nThis effect can be seen without the use of resource packs up to 17w46a simply by holding ice, stained glass, stained glass panes or slime blocks of an invalid data value. For versions 17w47a up to 19w38b a resource pack is required to break the model of an existing translucent item, and from 19w39a the bug is no longer present at all.\nThis effect also happened to particles and certain other objects in-game from 13w41a onwards.\nUnloading the default resources.\nIf a sufficiently broken resource pack is loaded, the game will catch such resource packs and unload them automatically if errors were detected. From 17w43a up to the full release of 1.13, this also included the default resources, meaning that applying a flawed resource pack would result in all assets being unloaded, and as such the missing error assets appearing everywhere.\nFrom 18w30a onwards, the game was made to unload all resource packs \"except\" the default resources in cases like these.\nCertain game objects do not use textures in the standard way, instead layering them on top of each other. Horses use these for their pattern variants, and banners for each banner pattern. When there is no texture to pick from, these instead appear completely white. If the textures in question have already been loaded into the game, it is not possible to unload them even if all other textures are unloaded.\nAs shields use an item model, even though said item model points to an entity model, it appears as a missing model even though it makes use of texture layering.\nTropical fish, despite also using composite textures to distinguish variants, do not turn white if a texture cannot be loaded, and instead use the usual checkerboard (which is tinted in certain cases).\nThe screenshots below also demonstrate that player skins, despite not being layer-based, are also not unloaded due to not being resource pack dependent.\nIt is interesting to note how this bug highlights different changes to parts of the game through 1.13's development. Focusing on the main menu, for example, reveals multiple details:\nInterestingly, the rendering of the enchantment glint on items to which it applies appears different when all assets are unloaded, compared to cases where the enchantment glint image file and its associated mcmeta are deleted instead. For the unloaded case, the texture is renderedmuch smaller and moved much slower. The exact underlying reason for this currently remains unknown."}

Beside its common meaning, the term \"mob\" is short for \"mobile entity\". All mobs can be attacked and hurt (from &lt;a href=\"Falling%20damage\"&gt;falling&lt;/a&gt;, attacked by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or another mob, falling into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, hit by an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;, etc), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs often have unique AI and drop good or bad &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; depending on the mob that was killed.\nSpawning.\nMobs &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;mansion&lt;/a&gt;, or at night). Animals usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player. Some mobs including passive and neutral animals, and even &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s have the ability to be &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;bred&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, creating offspring. &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s also breed randomly depending on the time of day and the number of &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s (though they can\u2019t be directly bred by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;). Most mobs never spawn on &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other aquatic creatures), in lava (except for &lt;a href=\"strider\"&gt;strider&lt;/a&gt;s), on &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, or on blocks &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;less than a full block tall&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s placed on the bottom half). The exception is &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawners\"&gt;monster spawners&lt;/a&gt;, from which monsters can spawn naturally on any block including &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome mobs (like the &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;) require that the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; \"construct\" them before being able to spawn. The &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; can spawn naturally and can also be constructed. The ender dragon can be respawned with four &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s can also spawn mobs easily by using a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Creative%20mode\"&gt;Creative mode&lt;/a&gt;, or the command. \nDespawning.\nMany mobs despawn (cease to exist) after a certain amount of time if far enough from the player. , most passive mobs do not despawn, while most monsters do. , almost all mobs despawn.\nBehavior.\nMobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to &lt;a href=\"physics\"&gt;physics&lt;/a&gt;, and they can be &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;hurt&lt;/a&gt; by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning, attacked by weapons, /kill command, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain hazards, such as some &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; mobs, which are immune to fire. All &lt;a href=\"aquatic\"&gt;aquatic&lt;/a&gt; mobs except &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s and other mobs can climb up &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s. When mobs are killed, they turn to &lt;a href=\"Particles\"&gt;dust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; items that may be useful resources. Each type of mob in \"Minecraft\" has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within 32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get to a desired object or destination. &lt;a href=\"Mobs%23Passive\"&gt;Passive mob&lt;/a&gt;s flee in random directions after being hurt, while &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s face and chase/attack the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; as soon as the player comes close. &lt;a href=\"Mobs%23Neutral\"&gt;Neutral mob&lt;/a&gt;s remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking), at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit it. Most mobs are aware of players within 16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s of them, but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16 blocks (spherical) away. Mobs are harmless to players in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nMost mobs cannot see through most solid blocks, including semi-transparent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s. , mobs (except &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s) do not attempt to walk over &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s tracks unless pushed onto the rails by other mobs.\nList of mobs.\nMobs are listed and classified by their nature from the player's perspective. For more details on a particular mob, click on them to view their individual page.\nPassive mobs.\nPassive mobs are harmless mobs (except for the &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked. Most of them can be &lt;a href=\"bred\"&gt;bred&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"tamed\"&gt;tamed&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeutral mobs.\nNeutral mobs are sometimes passive and sometimes hostile toward the player. All of these mobs (except &lt;a href=\"Goat\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fox\"&gt;foxes&lt;/a&gt;) are provoked when the player attacks it first. Some mobs may also be naturally hostile with provocation, and some mobs also have some additional way to be provoked.\nHostile mobs.\nHostile mobs are dangerous, aggressive mobs that always attack the player within their respective detection ranges.\nCompound mobs.\nCompound mobs, also called &lt;a href=\"jockey\"&gt;jockey&lt;/a&gt;s, are a special condition in which a mob spawns riding another mob. All jockeys are hostile except for the &lt;a href=\"Strider%20Jockey\"&gt;strider jockey&lt;/a&gt;, which is neutral.\nBoss mobs.\nBoss mobs are special hostile mobs that are distinctly more dangerous and tougher than other mobs. They do not spawn randomly, and are confronted intentionally. Boss mobs provide unique challenges but also equivalent rewards. \nUnused mobs.\nOnly contains a few mobs that never spawn naturally in-game as they can only be summoned with the command though the &lt;a href=\"zombie%20horse\"&gt;zombie horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; can be spawned in with a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemoved mobs.\nRemoved mobs no longer exist in current versions of the game.\nJoke mobs.\nMobs that were added as a &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20April%20Fools%20jokes\"&gt;joke for April Fools' Day&lt;/a&gt; .\nUnimplemented mobs.\nMobs that were announced by Mojang as potential additions to the game, but either got scrapped or shelved indefinitely.\nMob vote.\nIn 2016, &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt; to \"Minecraft\" over the alpaca. In the six annual \"Minecraft\" events &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Earth%202017\"&gt;MINECON Earth 2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Earth%202018\"&gt;MINECON Earth 2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MINECON%20Live%202019\"&gt;MINECON Live 2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202020\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202021\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2021&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202022\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Live%202023\"&gt;Minecraft Live 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the public also voted on a mob to be added to \"Minecraft\". In the first vote, the winner was the &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt; (then known as \"Mob B\" or \"The Monster of the Night Skies\"). In the second, the winner was the &lt;a href=\"Taiga\"&gt;taiga biome&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;. In the third, the winner was the &lt;a href=\"Mountains\"&gt;mountain biome&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;. In the fourth, the winner was the &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;. In the fifth, the winner was the &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;. In the sixth, the winner was the &lt;a href=\"sniffer\"&gt;sniffer&lt;/a&gt;. And In the seventh, the winner was the armadillo. Shortly before the second vote, the &lt;a href=\"China%20Edition\"&gt;China Edition&lt;/a&gt; also had a mob vote, the winner of which was the &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the second vote, there was also a vote for which new &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; skin would be added, the winner of which was Jellie. The mob vote was discontinued in 2024.\nClassification.\nMost of the mobs are divided into different types, such as the &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s or the , but some creatures are assigned to a more detailed group. There are a total of four mob classifications that have different effects than other mobs.\nWeaknesses and immunities.\nSome mobs are weak or immune to certain kinds of damage. Sea creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, take more damage from tridents that are enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and their variants are immune to drowning. All undead mobs are healed by &lt;a href=\"potions%20of%20Harming\"&gt;potions of Harming&lt;/a&gt;, but take extra damage from weapons enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, along with taking damage from Potions of Healing. Many of these weaknesses and immunities are a result of what category (see below) of mobs that the mob falls into.\nUndead mobs.\nThis group of mobs includes &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20horse\"&gt;skeleton horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20horse\"&gt;zombie horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. These mobs are damaged by potions of Healing, healed by potions of Harming, and are immune to drowning (except for husks and zombies, which turn into zombies and drowned if drowning, respectively) and poison damage. Zombies, zombie villagers, drowned, skeletons, strays, and phantoms burn when under direct sunlight, unless they are touching water or wearing a helmet. Under the &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect, undead mobs still catch fire in direct sunlight but do not get hurt by the fire. All undead mobs except for drowned, phantoms, and withers sink in water. All undead mobs take extra damage from weapons enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt;, and are ignored by withers.\nMost undead mobs have the ability to pick up &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. Some can spawn wearing &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, or holding &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAquatic mobs.\nThis group of mobs includes &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"tropical%20fish\"&gt;tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;, but not drowned. They take extra damage from tridents enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt;, and, except axolotl, do not cause pufferfish to inflate nor take damage from them. All aquatic mobs except dolphins are immune to drowning, and all except guardians, elder guardians, and turtles take suffocation damage if out of water for too long. Aquatic mobs have the ability to swim, whereas other mobs simply float on &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or sink.\nIn there is no in-game classification for these mobs.\nArthropods.\nThis group consists of mobs based on , namely &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. They take extra damage and receive the &lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt; IV effect when attacked with &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Bane%20of%20Arthropods\"&gt;Bane of Arthropods&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllagers.\nThis group includes &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"illusioner\"&gt;illusioner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s. They are immune to evoker fangs &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and ignored by vindicators named \"Johnny\" (except ravagers). They are hostile toward &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; mode. &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es may accompany them in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s. Illusioners (and witches) can see players or targets through blocks.\nKnockback resistance.\nSome non-boss mobs resist a percentage of &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; from attacks.\nAdvancements.\nAdvancements are made when a player accomplishes something that is either rare to accomplish or sometimes easy to do so (such as \"&lt;a href=\"Advancements%23Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt;\" for killing or getting killed by an entity)."}

If the player had a custom skin, any mobs created would still use the default skin and would not assume the look of the player. They would not notice dangers, and because of this they would sometimes jump into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;."}

To make sure they are more prepared, they decide to learn more about the creeper, and hostile mobs in general. Sam collects more wood and builds a house before nightfall, and then mines iron the next day to craft some iron armor to protect themselves. Sam also suspects that creepers spawn in the dark, so they place torches around their house to prevent them from spawning. Despite this, Sam decides to venture out into the darkness, soon coming across a creeper nearby in a forest. They hide behind a tree as the creeper approaches, and then attacks the creeper, ultimately killing it and making it drop gunpowder. Sam decides to kill more creepers to obtain more gunpowder, ultimately using it with sand to craft TNT. The next day, Sam comes across a village and finds their first diamond in a chest. They also tame a cat, which helps to scare creepers away. A skeleton then appears and starts attacking Sam, but the creeper takes the blunt of the arrows and drops a music disc when killed. Sam picks up the music disc, kills off the skeleton, and then feeds fish to their cat before taking shelter in a house in the village that night. Some time later, Sam crafts a jukebox and begins dancing to the music from the music disc.\nI Survived a Skeleton!\nSam once again introduces themself to the reader as they mine inside a cave. Just then, skeletons shoot at them, having spawned thanks to a nearby mob spawner. Sam decides to head out of the cave into daylight, fortunately allowing them to buy some time as the skeletons that were after them burn up under the sun. Sam decides to craft some iron armor and a shield at home before heading off to a snowy area that night, coming across some strays. After blocking one of their arrows with a shield, Sam kills one of them and takes their bow before hurrying back home to build an observation tower the following day. Later, a thunderstorm rolls in, and despite the hostile mobs, Sam feels safe up in the tower. As the storm passes, Sam notices a skeleton horse in the distance and checks on it, but lightning strikes it, turning it into a skeleton trap horseman, whilst spawning three others. Sam retreats to the observation tower as the skeletons shoot at them, but they eventually get the upper hand (literally) and kill the skeletons. Sam then puts on an enchanted helmet that one of the skeletons left behind, along with iron armor, and equips themself with their shield and an enchanted bow from another killed skeleton, and then kills the skeletons spawning in the dungeon that is home to the spawner. Sam then finds a saddle in the dungeon chest before using it on a skeleton horse, saying to the reader that they feel like they can take on anything.\nMysterious Mooshroom!\nSam sets off from their camp, hoping to find as many different biomes as they can. They decide to only bring their tools so they have plenty of room in their inventory \"to bring back treasures.\" They go through mountains, an old-growth forest, and a flower forest, before coming to a shore and noticing an island in the distance that had trees that \"weren\u2019t shaped like other trees.\" Sam then crafts a boat and heads toward the island, soon noticing that it is a mushroom biome, and upon making it to said island, soon discovers a mooshroom. Sam then empties the water from their bucket and milks the mooshroom for milk, followed by using a bowl on it for mushroom stew. Just then, the sun starts to set, and Sam prepares themselves for any hostile mobs that could spawn, but is surprised when not a single hostile mob spawns at all. The following morning, they tempt a mooshroom with wheat onto their boat and bring it back home just as a thunderstorm starts to roll in. After Sam brings the mooshroom to a fenced area near their house, they head inside as it starts to rain, and then, lighting strikes just outside their house. When the storm clears, Sam notices that the mooshroom has turned into a brown mooshroom, realizing that there are \"still many mysteries\" for him to explore in this world."}

{"id": "34818", "revid": "38950647", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34818", "title": "Mods", "text": "Mods (short for modifications) are alterations to the code of any edition of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\". All mods change \"Minecraft\"'s game content in some way, such as to make minor adjustments to the game's mechanics or implement entirely new features. \nDescription.\nMost mods add content to the game to alter &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt;, fix &lt;a href=\"bugs\"&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt;, change the creative feel, or give the player more options in how they interact with the \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. Some mods may be bigger expansions, while others add more settings and options to optimize the speed, graphics, or gameplay of the game. Server mods or plugins mainly give server admins more options and ease of use, and most mods for single-player have a server version that allows or enhances the mod in multiplayer. Notably, a significant amount of Java Edition &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Block%20and%20item%20duplication\"&gt;item duplication glitches&lt;/a&gt; are not patched in Java Edition (either never patched or in the case of TNT duplication, patched then reverted) but mods that patch them are available.\nWhen the base game is updated, the developer of a mod must update the mod accordingly; otherwise, the mod might not work on the newest version of the game. \nAn official way of creating additional features for Minecraft worlds, called &lt;a href=\"add-ons\"&gt;add-ons&lt;/a&gt;, is available for .\nTypes of mods.\nClient-based.\nClient mods are direct modifications of the \"Minecraft\" game files. They are not custom clients, as they require modification of the file. These require mod loaders such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//files.minecraftforge.net\"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fabricmc.net/\"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//quiltmc.org\"&gt;Quilt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//neoforged.net/\"&gt;NeoForge&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.spigotmc.org\"&gt;Spigot&lt;/a&gt; (server-side only).\nBecause the \"Minecraft\" server software ignores custom content from the client side, most of the client mods which add new content to the game do not work in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; unless a modification has also been installed on the server. Some authors of client mods have made server versions of their mods available, and others have not. A few of the Loader/API-type client mods and many of the functional client mods (e.g. or ) have effect in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; straight away, without any modification on server side.\nServer-based.\n&lt;a href=\"Server\"&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; mods are modifications to the official \"Minecraft\" server software. They are commonly designed to make the administration of servers easier by implementing tiered privileges for commands (such as kicking, banning, etc.). They are frequently implemented as \"wrappers\" which do not modify the main server .jar file, instead of monitoring its output and sending commands to it. Server-based mods may also be called plugins depending on the mod loader.\nMod packs.\nMod packs are collections of mods that have been put together and configured so that they all work together. Mod packs are often centered around a general theme like tech, quests, or magic. Mod packs often have either custom launchers or installers that make installing and running the mod pack easy. Some of the most popular mod packs include , , , and .\nIn addition to making it easy to install mod pack clients, certain launchers can also download server mod packs.\nCrash reports.\nIf \"Minecraft\" crashes, a modified game is flagged in the crash report.\nThe crash report text includes one of these lines near the bottom:\n Is Modded: Probably not. Jar signature remains and the client brand is untouched\n Is Modded: Very likely; Jar signature invalidated\n Is Modded: Definitely: client brand changed to (present loader, such as \"fml,forge\", \"modloader\", or \"fabric\")\n Is Modded: Unknown (can't tell)\nA shortened example crash report is given below:\nThe code that checks for mods is fairly simple, and it's not always correct; it may say 'probably not' even with mods installed. However, it's very difficult to get the 'very likely' message if you haven't modified your \"Minecraft\" .jar file somehow, so that's essentially a 'yes'. There's also a 'definitely' message, seen when a Bukkit server crashes and under other similar circumstances, like when the Minecraft Forge API is installed.\n'Probably not' appears when the client/server brand appears to the in-game check to be unaltered (often termed 'vanilla') and the codice_1 folder is still there. 'Very likely' appears when the codice_1 folder is not present but the client/server brand seems to be vanilla. 'Definitely' plus the client name appears when the client is not vanilla:\n Is Modded: Definitely: Client brand changed to 'fml,forge'"}

Plans for official game customization date back to July 5, 2010, with the Modding API planned after the release of . It was then stated to be released in Beta 1.8. The Modding API was then rebranded as the Plugin API, with the release originally stated to be planned for 1.3, then for 1.4, and then it was accidentally stated by Curse that it would be implemented in 1.5. \nAt &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202012\"&gt;MINECON 2012&lt;/a&gt;, Mojang shared their vision for the future of the Plugin API. The API was to be developed by the &lt;a href=\"Custom%20servers/Bukkit\"&gt;Bukkit&lt;/a&gt; team and intended to simplify the modding and downloading process, although containing a slightly limited feature set. After initially publishing a developer website (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130609115416/http%3A//dev.minecraft.net/blog/\"&gt;http://dev.minecraft.net&lt;/a&gt;) and GitHub page, these were both taken down within a year.\nDevelopers on numerous occasions have mentioned that many changes made in the game's code were in preparation for the Plugin API, including Dinnerbone on July 29, 2014, Grum at the \"The Minecraft Team - Behind the Scenes\" panel on July 5, 2015 and Dinnerbone again on October 19, 2015 while working on the loot tables for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt;. A user replied \"I think an official \"we're working on it\" would really help a lot\" to which Dinnerbone replied, \"We're working on it.\"\nOn August 12, 2016, Searge tweeted: \"There will be news about the API at Minecon. I'll talk about the things I'm working on and what our plans are. But no more details for now.\" The next day it was confirmed by Grum to be for &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; and at MINECON the plan and roadmap for the development of Add-Ons were outlined.\nMinecraft introduced an experimental Physically Based Rendering (PBR) pipeline in 2023. It is designed for use with Deferred Lighting and Ray Tracing. This feature enables precise modeling of surface details and scene illuminators, ensuring a consistent lighting model throughout the day. Leveraging PBR and the innovative Deferred Lighting pipeline provides enhanced creative control over scene mood and lighting conditions."}

Advancements can also be granted (and revoked) using the command.\nAlthough advancements guide players logically through the game, they are independent of each other; an advancement can be completed without having completed the advancements \"before\" it. There are 110 of them: 16 in the Minecraft tab, 24 in the Nether tab, 9 in the The End tab, 35 in the Adventure tab, and 26 in the Husbandry tab.\nWhen advancements are obtained, a sliding notification displays in the top right corner, and a message is displayed in chat if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\u200c The color of the header text in the notification depends on the advancement; normal and goal advancements have yellow header text, while challenge advancements have pink header text. Completing a normal advancement causes the header text to display \"Advancement Made!\", completing a goal advancement results in a \"Goal Reached!\" header, and completing a challenge advancement shows \"Challenge Complete!\" In addition, &lt;a href=\"%23Sounds\"&gt;music plays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; is rewarded when completing these kinds of advancements.\nInterface.\nThe button to access the Advancements screen is found on the &lt;a href=\"pause%20menu\"&gt;pause menu&lt;/a&gt; screen. The &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can also open this screen by pressing (this can be changed in the in-game &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; menu).\nThe advancement system involves several trees composed of advancements, each tree beginning with a root advancement from which several branches diverge. By clicking and dragging, the player can view different branches of an advancement tree. Each tree is categorized into different tabs (which are defined by the root advancements). Tabs are not visible if no advancements in the tab have been unlocked. There are currently five tabs in vanilla Minecraft:\nEach tab has a different background with a repeating texture. Tabs only appear when at least one advancement in that tab has been made. Tabs are ordered left to right, based on when the first advancement in each tab was made.\nAdvancement icons display a header name and description when hovered over. The advancement descriptions have a unique color depending on the type of advancement with normal and goal advancements having green descriptions and challenge advancements having purple ones. As more advancements are unlocked, new ones become visible, with up to two advancements being displayed ahead of an unlocked one. Unlocked advancements show all of its direct parents advancements (the advancements between the root advancement of the tab and it), even those that have not been unlocked (but only show up to 2 advancements downstream of advancements already unlocked). Nine advancements, \"How Did We Get Here?\", \"Voluntary Exile\", \"Hero of the Village\", \"Arbalistic\", \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", \"Smells Interesting\", \"Birthday Song\", \"Little Sniffs\", and \"Planting the Past\" are hidden advancements, meaning that they cannot be viewed by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; until they have been unlocked, regardless of if its child advancement(s) (any advancement after it, including all branches), if any have been unlocked, which would normally display its parent advancements (as advancements can be unlocked and completed in any order).\nIf the player has not completed/unlocked any advancements, the interface shows a black background with white text reading \"There doesn't seem to be anything here... :(\".\nThe icon frames of advancements can vary in appearance based on difficulty, and whether or not it was completed. A legend is provided below:\nExtra advancements and tabs can be added and customized with the use of &lt;a href=\"/JSON%20format\"&gt;JSON files&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;s."}
