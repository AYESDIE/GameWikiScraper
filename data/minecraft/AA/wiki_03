{"id": "118213", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=118213", "title": "Tutorials/Transportation methods", "text": "Transporting items, mobs, and yourself long distances is an important but tiresome task. Thankfully, there are many ways to make the trips easier and faster.\nPlayer transport.\nWalking or running everywhere are viable options, but you may want a faster or smoother option, possibly with added storage benefits. Below are options for transporting player(s) in order of the effort required to construct them.\nHorses.\n&lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in plains and savanna biomes, and can be tamed by mounting them until they produce heart particles. A saddle is required in order to control the horse, and it can be equipped with tiered horse armor (Both saddles and horse armor are found in various generated structures). Horses have variable colors and stats, with running speed, jump height, and health all being randomized for each wild horse. A horse that spawns with high stats in all categories makes a useful, tough mount for traversing rough terrain. \nDonkeys uncommonly spawn under the same conditions as horses, with the unique ability to be equipped with chests instead of horse armor. This allows for early game, 15-slot mobile storage. However, donkeys spawn with less desirable maximum stats than horses. Fortunately, donkeys and horses can be bred to produce mules, which share the chest ability of donkeys with stats more resembling horses. \nLlamas.\n&lt;a href=\"Llamas\"&gt;Llamas&lt;/a&gt;, which spawn in Mountains and Savannahs, are notable for their ability to form a convoy if a llama is being &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; by the player. However, since llamas cannot be controlled when mounted by any means, they serve better as item transportation in singleplayer (As they can be equipped with chests, with the amount they can carry being a randomly generated stat). However, if the player is playing with other users, they could ride on the llamas while one player leads.\nElytra.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt; are late-game items found in the End that can be equipped in the chest piece slot. While falling, the player can double-tap the jump button to activate the elytra, allowing the player to gradually glide long distances. This by itself is a powerful transportation method, but the player can enhance their flying with the use of firework rockets to propel themselves in any direction, allowing for extended flight time. However, the player must take note of the elytra's durability, which gradually decreases while flying (The Unbreaking enchantment can be added to slow this effect, and Mending can be added to exchange gathered XP for durability). Phantom membranes can be used to repair elytra in an anvil if necessary. Having a sustainable amount of firework rockets is also fairly expensive if the player does not have a mob farm to easily produce gunpowder. There is also the possibility of the player dying of fall damage if the elytra's durability runs out, or from smacking into a surface at high speeds.\nMinecarts.\n&lt;a href=\"Minecart\"&gt;Minecart&lt;/a&gt;s allow the player to be transported along rails with no input from the player, with the downside of having to create rail systems to any desired destinations. It can also be quite expensive to create longer rail lines, especially if powered rails are being used. See tutorials for minecart-related redstone contraptions to automate launching, create minecart dispensers, and more.\nBoats and ice roads.\nSurprisingly, one of the fastest transportation methods in the game involves a boat on solid ground. When boats are on any variant of ice blocks, they can be controlled as easily as if they were in water, and can travel at immense speeds thanks to the slippery nature of the ice. The speed of the boat can also be adjusted depending on which variant of ice is used; Normal ice is the slowest, with packed ice being in the middle, and blue ice being the fastest option. However, this is possibly the most resource and time demanding method in the game, as the player needs huge amounts of ice, blocks to keep the boat on track, and other materials if the player chooses to decorate the track. Additionally, colliding with mobs can be a considerable hazard, especially hostile ones.\nItem transport.\nTransporting items is essential for players who have advanced to the point of having more items than they know what to do with, whether it is for moving items around your base autonomously or moving items across vast distances.\nThese options are better for moving items across long distances, such as from one home to another.\nDonkeys, mules, and llamas.\nAs mentioned above, these mobs work well as player/item transport combos. They usually have small inventory spaces, as they are early game options. With leads, many of these mobs can be moved at once, although it can be frustrating with the fragility of leads and rough terrain.\nEnder chests.\nAn &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; is a variant of chest obtained with 8 obsidian and an ender eye, with the unique ability to share its inventory with all ender chests across the world (specific to each player). It can be used as a \"bank vault\" of sorts where all of your most important items are kept, as its contents are completely safe from being stolen. Alternatively, it can be used to deposit items from one location and have those items be immediately accessible from any distance in another ender chest. Furthermore, if a silk touch pick is kept on hand, the ender chest can be picked up freely (otherwise, 8 obsidian minus the ender eye is dropped), allowing for a makeshift extra inventory to carry around. \nShulker boxes.\nEnd game items that can be crafted from 2 shulker shells and a chest, these boxes allow for the most efficient storage in the game. The size of a single chest, each box retains its contents when broken, allowing for a backpack of sorts. While shulker boxes cannot be placed inside other shulker boxes, just a few shulker boxes in a player's inventory can allow for a small storage room's worth of items to be in the player's hands at any given moment. They can additionally be dyed and named to create catalogs of what items they contain.\nNote that shulker boxes can be put inside ender chests, meaning by combining the carry-on ender chest's inventory space with the player's inventory (excluding the hotbar) to fill with shulker boxes, the player would have a total of 1458 inventory spaces for carrying items.\nShort-range systems.\nThese methods of item transport are best used in transporting items around small areas, such as transporting item drops from a mob farm into adjacent chests.\nWater channels.\nBy using water source blocks, players can create an item transporting channel that serves as an early game transport system. Combined with soul sand bubble columns, which lift items to higher levels, and magma bubble columns, which pull items down, water channels provide efficient transport. They can additionally be outfitted with ice tracks to make the items move even faster, although this adds to the cost of the system.\nHoppers.\nHoppers are essentially item pipes that move items within them into the container it is pointing to. This can include other hoppers, allowing for hopper chains that can transport items quickly. The hoppers can also lead into chests, barrels, dispensers, and more to funnel items into storage rooms or to fuel redstone contraptions. This is a more pricey, slower, and less versatile system than water channels, with the prime downside being their inability to transport items upward (only to the side or downward). Therefore, hoppers are better used sparingly, only to take items from one container to another or from a water channel into a container.\nVillager and mob transport.\nThe player can transport villagers and other mobs to new locations (for the purpose of starting new villages or baiting mob traps) using a variety of techniques:"}

{"id": "15922", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15922", "title": "Tutorials/Trap design", "text": "Traps deal damage to the target without the assistance of the player. Not all traps are hidden and visible traps can induce a sense of safety in the target before they trigger the main one. In the following, the target is either the player or a mob, and not all traps are equally effective against them.\nTrap Parts.\nThere are three or four parts that can be seen in most traps:\nTrigger.\nA trigger is what activates the trap. Triggers tend to use redstone, but analog triggers are also possible (water breaking torches, for example). Triggers can be effective if hidden in plain sight. This can be a button beside a door, or a pressure plate infront of a door which triggers more than expected.\nComplications.\nA complication is any part between the trap triggering and the method being employed. Many more complications exist than just those below. Complications tend to add a delay to the trap, which is usually not desirable.\nMethod.\nThe method is any reliable way of dealing damage to the target. The method is usually hidden so the target doesn't suspect impending danger. For more detail about damage calculation, see &lt;a href=\"Health%20and%20Damage%23Natural%20Damage\"&gt;Health and Damage&lt;/a&gt;\nUsing the Terminology.\nLet's create some simple traps to describe the parts we just discussed:\nExample 1\nA miner is digging away a 2x1 tunnel. They find gold ore, but once they mine it arrows are relentlessly shot at him.\nOn the back of the ore is a redstone torch that acts as the trigger by sending a signal once broken. This signal allows a rapid pulsar (complication) to repeatedly send power to a dispenser, the method.\nExample 2\nAn explorer comes across a cave. They drop down a few blocks when they notice it's getting lighter instead of darker. They jump to their next ledge just before a flow of lava engulfs their previous position.\nSince our trapper can't maintain the trap consistently without drawing suspicion, let's assume they set up a redstone clock to a dispenser. Every four and a half minutes a new item will be dispensed, maintaining the trap. Clocks are generally a complication, but since it is used to stabilize the trigger we'll call it part of the trigger.\nThis trap is hidden in a natural location and uses an invisible trigger (an item through the wall). This opens a flood gate of lava (method) in the entrance, it will spread and trap the explorer in the cave.\nExample 3\nThe owner of a large underground mansion is being chased by another player. The owner escapes through an iron door controlled by a pressure plate. On the other side, they hit a button.\nThe pursuer sees him open the door by the pressure plate and follows him, but the door doesn't open. Instead, a series of pistons opens a hole and pushes the assailant into it. Once the pistons extinguish the light from the opening, it is pitch black.\nThe button on the far side of the door is a safety attached to a T-flip flop. It engages the trigger (the pressure plate), which, until a moment ago, was pretty uninteresting. Both sets of pistons (The ones that opened the hole and the ones that pushed the assailant) are complications. The obsidian jail is a live-capture method.\nExample 4\nA robber has snuck into a large obsidian-reinforced storage facility and walks into a room with a red wool floor. They hear an audible click before the opposite wall is pulled away revealing dispensers that start to pelt him with splash potions of poison and slowness. Before they can get away, a 9 block TNT charge goes off but since the room is reinforced the facility as a whole escapes unscathed.\nThe pressure plate in the door is the trigger. The piston-removed false wall is a complication. The dispensers are a method. However, there is a 6-second repeater delay (complication) connected to a secondary method (bomb).\nExample 5\nA player in a faction server is wandering about, searching for bases to raid. They are in a plains biome and sees a house made of andesite (flat biomes are great to put baited traps in because of high visibility). The player has left a door open (usually players will not mine on factions servers). The player walks inside cautiously and finds medium-tier loot. Thinking it is the house of an unexperienced player (try to make your trap's bait appeal to the server, nobody will walk into a giant obsidian monolith with no backup), they walk into the basement. However, upon opening the spruce door (opaque) to enter the basement, the blocks before and after the door are opened up, and the player is quickly funneled into a hay-based creeper-proofed capturing trap, and can't teleport away. The player's friends can't rescue him before the trapper claims the land and demands a ransom.\nObviously this trap works best on factions with a lot of ranked players.\nSafety.\nAny trap that uses redstone can be given a lever to create a safety switch. This switch may be activated to allow the trapper to perform maintenance or pass safely. The simplest way to do this is to construct an AND gate, using a lever as one of the power sources. When active, the AND gate functions as a double NOT gate.\nGenerally, the AND gate is placed between the trigger and the rest of the wiring, but this may not be the case for all traps.\nDisarming Traps.\nTraps are not designed to be found and immediately lose effectiveness once discovered. That being said, disarming a trap will require an understanding of the trap and there is no guarantee you'll survive the disarming process.\nThe more traps you disarm, the more proficient you'll be at it.\nBut if you come across a something suspicious that you don't recognize, here are a few tricks:\nAnti-tampering complications are rare. So when a player incorporates one into their trap, it will often be something of their own design. Synchronized clocks are probably the most common and will trigger a defense mechanism if one is desynchronized.\nMob grinder.\nMob grinders are an integral part of a mob farm. One way to think of a mob farm is as one entirely self-sufficient trap. The spawning of mobs is the trigger, canals are a complication and the grinder is the method. We'll only be looking at mob grinders here, for a tutorial on Mob farms, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20Farm\"&gt;Mob Farm&lt;/a&gt;.\nWater streams push the target into the grinder. Grinders don't work well with players because they can fight the current or disrupt it by placing blocks."}

{"id": "12873", "revid": "36156286", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12873", "title": "Tutorials/Trapdoor uses", "text": "This tutorial demonstrates some uses of the &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;. Trapdoors can be used in a variety of ways, whether it's a mob farm, a drawbridge, or a secret entrance.\nDrawbridge.\nIf you place the trapdoors in a trench in this fashion:\nYou can create a fairly good drawbridge; You can extend it lengthways and its widthways. It's possible to walk on the ledge of an opened trapdoor if there is enough space above it. To create a drawbridge in this fashion that is not vulnerable to ledge walking, so long as there is an overhang 2 blocks above the ground before the trapdoors start. Trapdoors can also be used with lava underneath.\nSewer.\nDo the same with the drawbridge, then in the pit (make the pit only 1 block tall) add water, the amount of water you put is the amount of trapdoors wide. Only add water at the beginning of the sewer,if the sewer runs out of water (after 7-8 blocks) make the pit one block lower where the last water block is. Now, you can decorate it. Add mossy cobble at the sides and for added effect, connect it to a house, or make a whole water system in a town.\nEntrance to Underground.\nYou can make a useful entrance to underground by using trapdoors. It can be controlled by &lt;a href=\"Redstone\"&gt;Redstone&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Redstone\"&gt;Redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Torch\"&gt;Redstone Torch&lt;/a&gt;es, and possibly if you want it automated, &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Repeater\"&gt;Redstone Repeater&lt;/a&gt;s. Obviously, you can use different objects that give charges instead of &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plates\"&gt;Pressure Plates&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinecart Entrance.\nSimilarly to making entrances underground you can use trapdoors to drop your minecart onto track underneath making an automatic entrance (good for keeping hostile mobs out, making it convenient getting into your base). It can be powered by the rail detector so the trapdoors will only be open for a short period of time. A minecart will not fall through a single trapdoor (a 2x3 trapdoor setup works fine).\nAnti Zombie Door.\nTrapdoors can be used as an alternative to a wooden door. The advantage of this is that zombies will not attempt to break down the trapdoor, making your house zombie free. This is particularly useful in Hard difficulty, as zombies will not go into your house.\nRetractable Stairs.\nYou can make retractable stairs with trapdoors. Basically, you need a staircase of trapdoors, with the \"hinge\" on the wall, and a channel in the wall next to it for the Redstone wire. A lever can then be used at the top and/or bottom to extend or retract the staircase.\nTraps.\nTraps can be built by placing lava or water underneath trapdoors and wiring redstone circuits and pressure plates to them. This can be used as a 'reverse drawbridge' or underground to trap mobs or other players.\nLaunching Pad.\nIt is also possible to create a minecart launching pad by placing two trapdoors side by side. Now connect the trapdoors with a button/lever and one redstone wire. Then build 2 ramps with minecart tracks. One should lead to your launch pad and the second one should be built under your trapdoors. If you build 2 minecart launching pads side by side, it would allow you to create a minecart racetrack. Just put your minecart on the top of the upper ramp, enter it and wait until you're on the trapdoor and press the button to start.\nAesthetics.\nTrapdoors can also have aesthetic function. It's possible to create a functional and good-looking bardoor.\nAlso, putting closed trapdoor beyond a furnace creates oven with burners.\nTrapdoors used above a hopper or a water-filled cauldron can form a toilet.\nDistributor.\nYou can make a distributor by making a vertical succession of trapdoors and link them with redstone. Use a button to power the circuit. Just place an object on each trapdoor and when you'll push the button, each object will fall from one block.\nMinecart Door.\nTrapdoors can be used to create a door which cannot be entered by mobs but is convenient for the player to enter on foot or in a minecart. This is done by placing a closed trapdoor on the upper block inside a 1*2 doorway and a minecart track under it leading through the door. The player is not affected by the trapdoor, and the minecart travels on the block under it, so the player can ride a minecart through the trapdoor without getting hurt and without losing speed.\nEntrance.\nYou remove a block above your head, and place a trapdoor there. When you hit the trapdoor, it opens and you can get in your shelter.\nLong Distance Wolf Caller.\nThis design can be used with the distributor to make a fully functional wolf caller. By placing a trapdoor above a 1x1 pool of water with a wolf on the trapdoor, if you are the right distance away - when you push the button the wolf will fall in the water and, to prevent itself from drowning, stand up, sense you're away and teleport to you. This design is effective for people who frequently fight monsters. Add the distributor and you can successfully call multiple wolves.\nPlanting Pots.\nIf you are wanting to make a nice looking pot for your plants, then try this:\nYou will need a 3X3 flat space to do this properly, or at least a + shape space. Put your material (whatever you're planting the object in) in the center of the + / 3X3, Then, while walking around it, you place the trapdoors so they face each side of the brick when retracted, when retracted you will have your pot, but when not retracted, it will just sit around your plant. see below for schematics. The trapdoors can also be used as panelling for other aesthetically pleasing uses. Surrounding bookshelves with trapdoors on the sides is one other use.\nTerraforming deserts, Clearing gravel.\nDig down until you find at least 3 solid non-gravity affected blocks (e.g. neither gravel nor sand) below the sand or gravel you want to clear (you only need to be one lower, but going an extra level deep to start reduces the chance of you running into a sudden drop in the level of the bottom of the sand). Clear out as much as you can one level \"below\" the bottom level of sand (so there's still something solid for the sand to sit on) in such a way that you can position trapdoors \"under\" the solid blocks. Make sure the trapdoors are closed and then just start breaking the blocks above the trapdoors and watch the sand all come tumbling down at once, breaking into objects galore!\nNote: If you do this with gravel you will never get flint. But if you're planning to build a house of glass and strip mining all the sand bores you to tears, or if you're building a dungeon and just tunneled into a desert or a glut of gravel, it's a far more entertaining way to get it all out of the way.\nMob Spawner Trap.\nThe AI within &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (both passive and hostile) do not recognize open trapdoors as holes, making them vulnerable for them falling off cliffs. This is a technique used in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20Farm\"&gt;mob spawner traps&lt;/a&gt; to lure them into a collection zone.\nSpider-Proof Walls.\nIf you're using a castle style defense you can build a 2-block wide overhang of slabs, then use trapdoors at the corners as well as in the middle. This will eliminate the blind spot near the walls. You should also build either a fence or a cobblestone wall as a guardrail."}
{"id": "1256", "revid": "52520523", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1256", "title": "Tutorials/Traps", "text": "Traps are a common mechanism in multiplayer built by players to kill other players or mobs automatically. The following is a list of basic traps with a short tutorial that often assumes the reader has a working understanding of the basic concepts required to build the trap. Most traps are considered to be &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mechanisms\"&gt;mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;, though some are not classified as such.\nVideo.\nNote: this video is outdated.\nOverview.\nTraps are devices designed to trap or damage entities, often referred to as targets. Traps are often made up of 3 components: &lt;a href=\"%23Lures\"&gt;A lure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Triggers\"&gt;a trigger&lt;/a&gt;, and the damage source. In a simple &lt;a href=\"%23The%20landmine\"&gt;landmine&lt;/a&gt;, the lure could be a base behind the landmine, the trigger a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, the damage source &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Not all traps have a lure, they may rely on chance or something else to lure the target. Feel free to add any ideas of traps you have here. Just follow the style guide and everyone will have new strategies to remove their enemies.\nA list of components for a good trap can be seen below: \nTrigger components.\nThese components are a trigger that allows the rest of the trap to work.\nPressure plates.\n&lt;a href=\"Pressure%20plate\"&gt;Pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s are commonly used to detect whether an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; or item presses on it . There are 4 variants (viz.wooden pressure plate, stone pressure plate, light-weighted pressure plate, and heavily weighted pressure plate.)\nWooden.\nWooden pressure plates measure all entities and give out maximum signal strength. The most commonly used pressure plate. Useful if you want to detect anything including items being thrown. Works best when paired with an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;.\nStone.\nStone pressure plates measure only players and mobs and give out maximum signal strength. The second most commonly used pressure plate. Useful if you want to detect only a player or mob. Works best when paired with an observer.\nLight-weighted.\nLight-weighted pressure plates measure all entities, and the strength increases as more entities are added. Useful if you want to detect a specific number of entities. Works best when paired with an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeavy-weighted.\nHeavy-weighted pressure plates are similar to a light weighted pressure plate but they measure groups of 10 entities per redstone comparator output.\nObservers.\n&lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt;s are most commonly used to detect whether a block state changes (ie: an &lt;a href=\"%23Ore%20Trap\"&gt;ore trap&lt;/a&gt;). They are useful if you want to kill someone destroying a block in your base, a TNT lighting, redstone getting activated, containers being opened, furnaces turning on or off, etc.\nString.\n&lt;a href=\"String\"&gt;String&lt;/a&gt;, when connected to a pair of &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt;s or an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;, can detect when a player/mob steps through it or breaks it. It is also difficult to see.\nTripwire hook.\nWhen a player/mob/item comes in contact with a string connected to 2 &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt;s, it will output a redstone signal.\nPros:\nCons:\nButton.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; is pressed, it outputs a redstone signal. Useful for redstone control rooms.\n&lt;a href=\"Daylight%20Detector\"&gt;Daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt detects the 'time' of Minecraft day. It can be right clicked to detect sun or moon. Shadow affects this, however, so if you set it to detect sun, and it is in direct sunlight, a redstone signal will be produced, at a power level relating to the height of sun or moon. If it was in shadow, it would not produce any signal, and vice-versa for moon mode. Useful for hourly traps and such, though redstone clocks are more precise but also expensive. \nIt has no effect on adjacent opaque blocks.\nLectern.\nThe &lt;a href=\"lectern\"&gt;lectern&lt;/a&gt; can hold books. It emits a redstone signal power depending upon the page of the displayed book. Useful when you want to tempt someone with important information, and blow them up as soon as they start reading a particular page.\nMechanism components.\nThese components actually affect the target.\n&lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf course, that's obviously coming to your mind first. &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; traps are ubiquitous and common. Most like the landmine (involving a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; and some TNT) are easy to make; others like the &lt;a href=\"%23TNT%20Floor%20House\"&gt;TNT floor house&lt;/a&gt; are harder and more expensive. TNT traps have many triggers; from pressure plates to observers to pistons to dispensers...and more!\n&lt;a href=\"Pistons\"&gt;Pistons&lt;/a&gt;.\nPistons are often used, for example, to push a player into lava, push someone into a pressure plate, push someone into a block and suffocate them, and more. They are often used in some &lt;a href=\"%23Capture%20Traps\"&gt;capture traps&lt;/a&gt; to continuously keep a player out of an area.\n&lt;a href=\"Dispensers\"&gt;Dispensers&lt;/a&gt;.\nDispensers can be used to shoot out deadly objects like &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, Tipped &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Charge\"&gt;Fire Charges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nDon't ever put diamonds in a dispenser unless you are trying to lure someone, or else they will just become rich off your trap\n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether Portals&lt;/a&gt;.\nNether Portals can be used to make traps upon entering &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;. They pause &lt;a href=\"Chunk\"&gt;chunk generation&lt;/a&gt;, witch means you light TNT in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; over a Nether Portal, then light the portal. as long as there is no chunk generator (Machine That Uses A Minecart In A Nether Portal To Load Chunks) or players in the nether, you, upon entering the nether, will be blown up.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mobs&lt;/a&gt;.\nMobs, like &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Zoglins\"&gt;Zoglins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicators\"&gt;Vindicators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piglin%20Brute\"&gt;Piglin Brutes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pufferfish\"&gt;Pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; can deal damage to players. To prevent mobs inside of traps from despawning, one should use &lt;a href=\"Name%20tags\"&gt;Name tags&lt;/a&gt;. If you can't spawn the mob, you can use Boats in Minecarts to take 2 mobs at a time to your trap. Each mob has their own pros and cons:\nExplosive traps.\nThe traps here primarily use TNT to cause harm to the target. When testing explosive traps it may be a good idea to use a different block such as the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;, which like &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, is triggered by &lt;a href=\"redstone%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; but it is less likely to accidentally blow up prematurely.\nLectern info bait.\nLecterns can hold books, therefore, you could give a hint to someone about some important info, and set it up so as soon as they reach the sixth page maybe, the doors close, and TNT blows up the place. Don't set it to explode at the first page, they would go through the first few pages cautiously, and then feel safe, only to find out while they are reading the most important page, TNT removes them from the Minecraft world.\nTrick house trap.\nThis is a trap that can be used to catch someone while they are out adventuring. You place TNT at various points around their house, prioritizing spots which are behind an input like a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; or likely to be set alight by an unsuspecting player, like behind an empty fireplace. To finish it all off, place a few pressure plates near their bed with TNT underneath. If the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; dies and respawns, they would spawn on top of the pads and cause an easy kill. Keep in mind that some servers would consider this sort of behavior cheating or griefing.\nEnd portal trap.\nIf you have enough TNT, a dispenser, and an input, it can't hurt to pump some TNT into the &lt;a href=\"End%20portal\"&gt;End Portal&lt;/a&gt;. The TNT will go to the spawn point of the world and will be loaded, as the spawn chunks are always loaded, and will explode soon after. If nobody is in the end, the first player enter the portal will make the chunks load, which will instantly kill that player.\nA better version of this is getting to build hight above the End Portal to drop a Dripstone into the portal. It will instantly kill anyone who will try entering the End, even if they have full Netherite armor. \nBog-standard landmine.\nThis landmine by itself is inefficient and non-lethal. It damages the landscape and deals little if any damage to players. It is easy to make by placing a pressure plate on a block and one or more TNT directly beneath. Stepping on the pressure plate will ignite the TNT To make it more efficient, there are many variations players can use:\nInstant landmine 1.\nTNT, when activated normally, plays an audible hissing sound and waits for a few seconds before blowing up, which can give anyone plenty of time to escape a landmine placed on the ground. A much more dangerous landmine with instant activation can be built instead:\nInstant landmine 2.\nReplace the wool with an end crystal, and put an arrow in the dispenser.\nwhen the dispenser is activated, it will shoot an arrow and blow up the crystal, leaving no time to escape.\nThe Youtuber Squibbles made a great &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DD1GkCFemyak\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; about a way better version of this trap (albeit it's harder to build)\nInstant landmine 3: Sculk proximity jubilee.\nThis one's a bit tricky to build. It requires both precise placement of &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20TNT\"&gt;TNT minecarts&lt;/a&gt; and extreme care not to set the trap off yourself. Do everything in order and make liberal use of the Sneak key and you'll be fine. Probably. Test it several times in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; Mode just to be sure.&lt;br&gt;The top row has an empty space labeled with ESC. This is your escape route.\nFirst dig a hole 2\u00d72 wide and 3 deep. Seal off the top with matching blocks. Surround the hole with a 2 block high wall of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a Steve-sized gap for your escape route. Do not fill it back in yet. In the spot where you left the gap, dig out an escape route leading directly away from the mine. Return to your wool pit. &lt;br&gt;Place two &lt;a href=\"powered%20rails\"&gt;powered rails&lt;/a&gt; (keeping them unpowered) along the wall opposite of your escape route (you do NOT want the TNT carts in the way of your escape). Here's where things start to get tricky. You need to place at least two TNT carts on the same powered rail. The trap will not work otherwise. Placing the first will of course be easy. For subsequent carts, you will need to right click carefully on the side hitbox of the track that the first cart is on. The top will not work, as the first cart is in the way. You'll know it worked if the minecart's shadow gets noticeably darker, or know, if your hand empties. Once you find the right spot, feel free to place as many TNT carts as you care to sacrifice. More carts means a bigger, more powerful explosion, and significantly less chance of escaping the blast (though it's not much of a chance to begin with). Just make sure not to bump the carts.&lt;br&gt; Now is where things go from tricky to deadly. One wrong move will make you the victim of your own trap. This is when you hold Shift like your life depends on it, because it absolutely does. While holding Shift and not letting go, place the sculk sensor, either adjacent to or in front of your escape hole. Now, still holding Shift, sneak your way into your escape hole. This is where you finally close the gap in the Steve-sized wool wall hole, making sure there is no hole for the Sculk Sensor to hear you through. You should be safe by this point, but if you want to be extra careful, continue sneaking as you move away from your newly planted mine.\nNot that you can waterlog the Sculk Sensor to make it silent (so the target can't hear it).\nThat should be it! Just whatever you do, do NOT step over your landmine. You will almost certainly die. Save the dying for the enemy. \nTree trap.\nWhen the player chops down the tree, the &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; will be lit by the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;. The observer can be replaced by a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit%23NOT%20gate\"&gt;NOT Gate&lt;/a&gt; if you are short on &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Quartz\"&gt;quartz&lt;/a&gt;. \nCake trap.\nYou eat the cake, you explode! In this trap when you eat the cake, the observer senses the update in the cake and ignites the TNT. 1) Dig down 2 blocks. 2) Place TNT at the bottom. 3) On top of the TNT place an observer pointing up. 4) On top of the observer place cake.\nDeath temple.\nCreate &lt;a href=\"BUD\"&gt;BUD&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"desert%20temple\"&gt;desert temple&lt;/a&gt;. If a player should try to disarm it, KABOOM! Note that if you use the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;, players might be able to detect it, since the pressure plate won't cover it completely.\nThe hidden house.\nThis trap is the opposite of a &lt;a href=\"%23The%20landmine\"&gt;TNT door trap&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; is obvious, while the house is hidden. Make a field of TNT extending about 5 blocks into the ground. Place signs all over the field saying: \"Find my hidden house.\" It lures people in twice: the TNT danger, and the hidden house challenge. The problem is that there is no house! Beneath the field are pressure plates which ignite the TNT, leaving no time to escape, as you are in a field of TNT 5 blocks under.\nTNT floor house.\nBlow up a fake base and kill assassins attacking you! (this can also be used for demolition)\nIf any enemy, mob or player steps on the pressure plate (potential griefers included), they will be blown sky-high!\nExplosive house.\nGriefers love blowing and burning people's houses up. This trap turns the grief onto the griefer.\nIf you use this for demolition (that is, if you have any fragile buildings to be destroyed), you can set it and wait for somebody else to do the work for you by setting it off unknowingly.\nC4 trap.\nThe \"C4 trap\" is a vertical or horizontal stack of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; with a button wired to a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; in it. The dispenser is placed one block above or below the stack (vertical) or one block next to the stack (horizontal). This usually works better for demolition than for a trap. If you want to use it as a trap, wire a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; to the dispenser. This works similarly to a flaming &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; hitting a stack of TNT from above. This works better than a dispenser shooting TNT, because the \"C4\" stays in one place. Also, if only two TNT blocks are used, it works well as a disposable cannon, even better on obsidian blocks, but not in a tube. All evidence of the trap is usually destroyed. Note: C4 trap from below does not work well.\nExploding furnace.\nWant a big unexpected boom? Have a bunch of spare furnaces? You need a Redstone comparator, TNT, a furnace and something to smelt. Place the furnace, and then put the comparator directly behind it. Then, just put the TNT behind the comparator and wait till someone smelts something!\nAn alternative is to put coal, iron, or food in a furnace and add a redstone comparator behind linked to a not gate. Use the not gate to trigger some tnt. Also hide observers under the furnace so people can't break it.\nInescapable arrow trap.\nLike to kill your fellow players with protection IV armor? You need many harming II arrows, a bow, soul sand, and water. Use the water and soul sand to make a bubble column, then shoot arrows into the pit until you run out. It will instantly kill anyone that falls in! Just don't fall in yourself.\nPitfall traps.\nThese traps primarily use fall damage to harm the target. Some minor variation can make a simple pit much more deadly.\nSand trap.\nWhen the target walks on top of the trap, break the bottom block of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;. It is a good idea to disguise the trap by making a house on top of the sand. If you do this, you will probably want to put in carpet so as to not make it so obvious. Some variations:\nFence trap.\nConstruct a hallway. A diagonal hallway works best. Fence posts should be underneath the path and you should drop the sand or gravel for the floor on the fences. Below the fences, you can have a pit.\nThis works because when a gravity-affected block falls on a fence post, the block stays as an entity. As a result, a player walking between the fence posts will fall through the sand entities, causing them to plummet. Diagonal hallways make it more likely to fall through the sand without landing safely on a fence post. Keep in mind that the sand is going to look half a block higher than a normal block, but this can easily be covered up. The best part: it does not need to be reset!\nChest pitfall.\nThis can work in conjunction with other traps. The player drops down into the pit, and at the bottom, they die and their items are sucked into the hoppers for you to use.\nPainting trap.\nThis trap is easy to make. It hides a secret passage behind a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;. The target may unwittingly decide to check for a secret passage behind the painting. Big mistake. \nFake chunk error.\nDig a 16\u00d716 hole, preferably in line with real &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s, at least 20 blocks deep. Some inexperienced players may think it is a chunk error and walk-in.\nFake water pitfall.\nDig a hole (2\u00d72 works best) at least 30 blocks deep, the deeper the better. At the bottom place a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;block of lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, a block of &lt;a href=\"blue%20wool\"&gt;blue wool&lt;/a&gt; or a block of &lt;a href=\"blue%20stained%20glass\"&gt;blue stained glass&lt;/a&gt;. Add a false corridor at the bottom to make it look like it goes somewhere. When an unsuspecting player comes across the hole, they may think that there is water at the bottom, jump down and die. Experienced players are less likely to fall for this particular trap but it generally works quite well. You can also place real water instead of blocks if you're wearing frost walker boots, just go down there, hide in the fake secret passage and sneak to hide nametag. Use F5 to see if a player is coming. If someone falls down, quickly move to freeze the water.\nSnowball trap.\nLoad a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; with snowballs (or other &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; item), and connect it to a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. When the target walks across the plate, the dispenser, if aimed correctly, shoots a snowball and knocks the target into the pit. You can also replace the dispenser with a piston.\nPiston pit.\nPlace the &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; so it pushes the block the &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s are on. The player can make up to twelve rows using one piston. Make sure there is a block of empty space at the end of where the piston pushes. Connect the piston to a trigger, such a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, and when the piston moves it should break the signs and cause the sand to fall along with the target. It is also possible to do this by pushing a line of blocks with torches or buttons on them, which may be slightly cheaper. Alternatively, use a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; connected to a &lt;a href=\"NOT%20gate\"&gt;NOT gate&lt;/a&gt; which retracts a block with a sign on it, which allows the player to use more than 12 rows.\nFake elevator.\nMake what is shown in the schematic, a water elevator with water only on the top block. Make sure the hole is 30-40 blocks deep, which is enough to kill the player. It could help to place a lure sign near the 'elevator' saying something like \"Do not enter!\" You can also make the signs' text something like a floor countdown like \"35\", \"34\", \"33\", etc. so players are more likely to fall for the trap. If they want, you can place hoppers with chests so you can gather the loot from the victims, but if they really want the drops, they will need a secret passage to the bottom of the pit for collection.\nFalse-floor trap.\nA false-floor trap is a variation of a pitfall trap. It works by creating a concealed safe route through the pitfall to allow authorized players to pass, while catching unauthorized players or mobs and killing them. It generally works best when there is no way around, forcing the player to pass through the trap.\nIf anyone steps on one of the pressure plates with TNT under it, the TNT will explode causing the whole bridge to collapse! Note: You will need to have something under the TNT, perhaps more TNT or something easily destructible to make sure the TNT doesn't fall and fail to ignite the rest of the TNT.\nFalse door pit.\nA false door pit utilises Redstone torches and pressure plated to drop an unsuspecting player\nWater traps.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; traps use water to suffocate, trap, or push the target. None of these traps will work on zombies, as they will turn into &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; after drowning, instead of dying. Players who use potions of water breathing will also be unaffected.\nFake water elevator.\nMake a water elevator using &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; bubble column, but without an exit at the top. The column will force the unfortunate player upward, where they will be trapped against the ceiling, unable to break their way out because of the fact that blocks break much slower underwater. Cobblestone can be swapped for Obsidian. This can also be used reversely, with Magma Blocks, taking advantage of the fact players cannot swim upwards easily. In both cases, the players may not drown since they're in a bubble column, \nor you could make it more dangerous and put a sign with lava on the top but make sure to not have the blocks the lava is touching or is around is not flammable as it will burn.\nA way better version of this is having the Soul Sand switch with Magma Blocks using Pistons, a redstone clock, and a NOT Gate (aka a Redstone Torch).\nRetrieval trap.\nCreate a water current that drags the mobs down under a solid block. The current will hold the mobs under until they drown. The loot from the mobs will float, making the collection hard. If you use this trap to kill &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, they won't die, but will turn into &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; instead. This trap will also not work on skeletons.\nWhirlpool trap.\nThrough clever use of &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s, you can pull the target down into water. It should be noted that it's possible to breathe while inside a bubble column, so this trap is not useful for drowning players.\nPufferfish pit.\nDig a 1 block wide, 1 block long, 2 block deep pit with a magma block floor. Replace the 4 adjacent blocks to the air block at the bottom with trapdoors (make sure they open towards the magma so the pufferfish don't escape and die) and open them, then put a pufferfish in each one. Fill the pot with water, and (optional) add an open trapdoor in the hole, which mob Ai sees as a solid block. The magma pulls it down and causes fire damage, while the pufferfish poison and damage the mob/player who fell in or was knocked in.\nNote: This could be disguised as an elevator to a secret by putting the magma further down.\nResource requirements: 1 magma block, 4 buckets of pufferfish, 4 trapdoors (any), and 2 water buckets.\nLava traps.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; traps usually use lava to burn the target, or distract them for an easier kill. Note that most of these traps will destroy the loot.\nLava staircase trap.\nThis trap can be handy for players who want to deal with assailants. The player should lure the target into the staircase for this trap to be most effective.\nWhen the target steps on the pressure plate, it will be trapped by the lava running down the staircase. Even if they have &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, it will take a long time to wade back up.\nThis trap can be expanded to make a handy escape mechanism. If you place the pressure plate on the upward side of the dispenser, the lava will flow down onto anyone chasing you. You could also make a hidden escape at the bottom. Just make sure you have a button to remove the lava.\nWith some clever &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; work, the entire trap could be concealed except the pressure plate. Be wary of stepping on the trap yourself or placing the pressure plate in the wrong location.\nThere are many variations of this trap, so don't be scared to alter elements of it, especially concerning the direction (descending or ascending), who steps on the trap (you or assailant) and more.\nLava door.\nMake a house, and right inside the front door make a pit with lava. Most players will likely notice the trap and avoid it, so it works only on really careless players.\nTrapdoor lava pit.\nIf the target should wander onto the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, good luck getting off!\nCapture traps.\nThese traps don't actually kill the target. Instead another trap is often used, or the player can come later to kill captured mobs.\nCuriosity trap.\nThis might work on only inexperienced players because experienced players can use the parts that are shown to think of what might happen to them if they went in. You may also have a bit like having a dropper that throws out diamonds to lure them over to the trap.\nPiston trap.\nThis trap is best for 2-tall tunnels, perhaps inside a friend\u2019s mine. Make sure there is a roof over it, so when the target hits the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, it cannot escape. When the pressure plate is stepped on, two &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s push up. Note that players will easily be able to break blocks and escape so you probably will want to combine this with another trap. \nDoor trap.\nThis is a simple and rather obvious trap that is made by putting a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of 4 open &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt;s so that the target is trapped inside when they enter. If using this trap against mobs such as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, you don\u2019t have to use iron doors.\nShallow pitfall.\nDig a 1-block deep pit at least 5x5 blocks. Place &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s on the inside edge. Since fences count as one and one half blocks in height, mobs can walk in, but cannot jump out. Alternatively, line the outside with half-slabs. This can also be combined with a mob grinder, via water currents leading to it. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s will take damage from sunlight during the day if the pit is uncovered, making this an effective way to sort out creepers. This design does not capture &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTrapping pool.\nThis trap is designed to trap &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, not to kill them!\nSlime trap.\nThis simple trap targets slimes. \nWhen a slime of any size wanders around, it may fall into the hole. Since slimes cannot jump in water, it will not be able to escape. You can come by later and kill all the slimes. If you are not interested in the drops, just leave them into lower slime population. This trap is best on superflat survival worlds where slimes spawn frequently. In that case, water can be obtained in villages.\nQuicksand.\nStep 1: Dig down an x/1&lt;y/z (However wide and long you want, a minimum of 2 blocks deep) hole with soul sand on the bottom\nStep 2: Fill it with water that goes up to 1 block below ground level, make sure bubble columns are made\nStep 3/4: Fill in the area at ground level with cobwebs*\nStep 3/4: Place sand in the bubble columns*\nStep 5: Knock someone in!\nExplanation: The bubble columns keep the sand on the same level as the cobwebs, so it just looks like slightly darker sand (entity and block shading are different) but sand entities don't collide with players or mobs, so you get stuck in the cobwebs and you need to use a sword or shears to break them, and you have to hit through the sand entities. You could also break a block at the edge of the hole.\nNOTE: Only works on BE, in Java the sand will break after several seconds.\nNetherite block live-capture trap.\nThis trap is extremely expensive to construct.\nThis trap is intended to work on players, and requires a secondary trap to initiate.\nShould the trap be triggered, the following sequence of events will occur:\nPiston traps.\nThese traps use &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s to harm the target.\nCrushing trap.\nThis is ideal at the end of a water flow mob grinder as it minimizes drop losses. The design can be expanded to make a long row.\nHoneycomb trap.\nConnect two &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s to a &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt; so that they rapidly push a &lt;a href=\"Honeycomb%20Block\"&gt;honeycomb block&lt;/a&gt; back and forth. If done correctly a player fallen into this trap will be unable to get out. Honeycomb block was chosen because &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; do not affect the breaking speed, even with &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, a Block of Netherite could be used instead, as while Pickaxes break it faster, it still takes so long to break that even an Efficiency V Netherite Pickaxe cannot break it in time before it gets moved.\nCake trap.\nIf the target moves too near to the cake, the pistons will trap them and destroy the cake.\nPitfall trap.\nThis device uses pistons to push entities into a pit.\nManual traps.\nThese traps require the player to manually trigger the trap, or perhaps even be the trap.\nGrave digging.\nAsk someone if they could dig down at a spot, perhaps because you lost diamonds there. When they get far enough, cover them with &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; for a more dramatic death, however, this will destroy their drops as well and won't work if they have a source of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. This will probably only work on inexperienced players.\nFacebreaker trap.\nIf done correctly, the gravel blocks should fall on your target's head, thus trapping or killing him. Hence the name facebreaker. Make sure not to take too long or else the target may escape jumping off the gravel or placing blocks.\nReturn home to a potion of instant damage II.\nNote: This trap needs to be built on an already existing ender pearl \"stasis chamber\" where a player throws an ender pearl in and it teleports them back if the chamber is turned off, or a player enters it\n1: Throw in a lot of splash potions of various negative effects. Make sure they don't shatter.\n2: Trigger the ender pearl, teleporting the player who threw it into the splash potions, which shatter, possibly killing them\nOther traps.\nThe traps here do not yet fit into any of the other categories.\nSpike trap.\nMaterials: a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; and any type of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThis trap is not lethal, except to players or mobs with low health. It could be made to be more of an annoyance if you replace the arrows with &lt;a href=\"Arrow%23Tipped%20arrows\"&gt;tipped arrows&lt;/a&gt; with potions such as &lt;a href=\"Slowness\"&gt;Slowness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; to inflict fire damage.\nSlow monologue trap.\nUse &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; to collect spider webs. Then dig a 3 block deep hole placing lava at the bottom and cobwebs on the top layer. Anyone not watching their step could get caught in the web and slowly fall to their death, allowing you to get a few dramatic words in as they die. (experienced players will be able to get out of this by mining the cobweb, and quickly placing a block in the lava)\nFalling minecart.\nThere is a way to 'store' fall damage in a minecart and later have someone take that damage even though they don't actually fall a distance that would make them take damage. You can also search up for a video on how to do this.\nMagma carpet trap.\nThis trap will probably involve a trip to the Nether. After gathering a fair amount of &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s, make a room. Use the magma blocks you have gathered to make the floor of the room, and cover ALL the magma blocks with carpets. When the target walks on to the carpet, they will take damage from the hidden magma blocks, often wondering and unable to figure out where the damage is coming from. If they don't figure out the trap soon enough, they will eventually die or lose a lot of health from fire damage.\nOne alternative is to make the entrance to the Magma Room two &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt;s with pressure plates on the outside but not on the inside, potentially trapping the target inside to burn.\nThis trap could also be a potential mob farm. When the mob is killed by the fire damage, you can enter the room, most likely by a secret entrance, and by sneaking or wearing Frost Walker boots, claim the mob loot and go back out without taking any damage at all.\nNote: This trap will not work on all types of &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; mobs, as they are immune to all kinds of fire damage.\nNote: This only works pre 1.16.\nAnvil trap.\nWhen the target stands on the pressure plates, the doors won't open and while they are confused the anvils will fall on them. They will either be killed or if the anvils don't fall from high enough they get injured. This trap is useful to stop thieves from stealing valuable goods, and exploits the fact that people don't look up.\nCommand mine.\nSick of rebuilding land mines that don't even kill the target? Replace the TNT with a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; with the command 'codice_1' and the command block will instantly kill any entity that touches the trigger! If you use a repeating command block instead of an impulse command block and set \"needs redstone\" to \"always active\", you don't need a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. This trap may be of use only in Creative mode, though. (you can also use the /summon lightning_bolt command)\nArrow trap.\nBy connecting this to a &lt;a href=\"%23triggers\"&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt;, you can rapidly fire &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s at the target. It is recommended to place this trap in a 1-wide 2 tall tunnel so there is less room to run. You can either place this in the side of the tunnel or shooting down the tunnel.\nSome variations:\nMurder holes.\nWandering mobs will not be afraid to try and walk on the signs. If they do, they will get trapped. This will not always work, so it is advised to make the deeper part wider.\nWither rose field.\nSurround your base with a field of &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berry%20bush\"&gt;sweet berry bush&lt;/a&gt;es, and leave a block-wide path leading to your base, or make a hidden underground tunnel leading to it. Any hostile mob that walks through the field takes significant damage, but unless you make the field large enough, this trap isn't fatal. This trap works only on mobs and not on players, because players can disarm it quickly with just a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;. For added effect, place &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s on top of the plants, and if you are using wither roses, plant them on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;. This way, the mobs have to spend more time inside the trap, making it more fatal.\nBig spiky fish.\nWhen in action, the player will be trapped and the pufferfish will inflate and bounce around the room. (Fun fact: Fish out of water bounce. A lot.)\nTriggers.\nThe traps here are most notable for their trigger and can be connected to many different mechanisms of harm.\nTrapped ore 1.\nWhen someone mines the ore the TNT will explode! Be sure to place the torches before the TNT and to not place any TNT next to a lit torch.\nTrapped ore 2.\nUse a piston to push a TNT next to a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; when a block is mined. The advantage of this method is that the trapped block does not need have wires right next to it and that it can cover a wider area.\nTrapped ore 3.\nFor a more expensive but instant explosion, place an observer behind the trapped ore and a dispenser behind the observer with an arrow inside facing away from the observer and place and end crystal where the dispenser is facing. Place the observer before the dispenser and the ore before the observer.\nRedstone mine.\nInstead of a &lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt;, you can also use an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;. This trap is good because it is hard to detect. If you build this above ground, it may seem somewhat out of place, so you should cover the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20ore\"&gt;redstone ore&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt; or build it underground. When the target walks on the redstone, it lights up, triggering the TNT. A similar trap is achieved by putting a valuable block that the player may want to mine in place of the redstone ore. When the player breaks the block, the daylight sensor activates, provided there's a light source or clear air above it.\nFurnace trap.\nNormally people would expect only chests to explode, so this trigger will surprise them as soon as they loot your furnace. You can replace the furnace with any other container for the same effect.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Griefing\"&gt;griefer&lt;/a&gt; loots the furnace the comparator deactivates and the torch turns on, blowing the victim to bits.\nMinecart mine.\nA target riding the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; triggers the &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; and gets blown up. It might help to disguise the detector as doing something else, like switching tracks, opening a door, etc.\nWrong lever.\nPlace several &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s on a wall and put &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; behind it. Place a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; saying something along the lines of, \"Which one...,\" \"Don't pull these!,\" or \"Passcode entry.\" Eventually a player with too much curiosity may come along and pull a lever.\nExploding bed.\nConnect a bed next to a Observer, the Observer to some TNT, and cover the whole thing in cobblestone. Then just wait for the player to sleep in it and get blasted sky-high.\nInvisible tripwire.\nThis trap relies on the fact that like end portal, &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; is invisible from the bottom. Make a room or hallway at least 3 blocks high, and put tripwire in a layer on the third layer up. If the victim jumps, they trigger the trap. However, if the victim sees the tripwire hooks they will probably mine the block so they don't have to jump.\nChest bomb.\nIf someone puts something inside the chest, it will go into the hopper, turn on the comparator, and activate the TNT. You could attach the comparator directly to the chest, but it would be more obvious as you can see over chests.\nTrapped chests are also an option but they can be seen by experienced players. Also, they can be seen more easily with resource packs.\nFishing trap.\nIt is possible to detonate TNT with a pressure plate and a fishing rod. This method is mostly undetectable; however, it is unstable and prone to premature detonation if you don't have patience.\nProximity detector.\nA proximity trap is a player detector paired with an output.\nLures.\nThese traps' primary feature is the way they lure the target into the trap. Note that none of these lures work on mobs.\nDropped loot.\nYou could drop items such as gold or diamonds near your trap to increase chances that someone will walk into it. This works best if you know someone is coming by. Some tips:\nSigns.\n&lt;a href=\"Sign\"&gt;Sign&lt;/a&gt;s are useful for luring new, and sometimes even experienced, players into a trap. Here are some messages which can be good to lure players into traps.\np/s by troller10000: \"DO NOT\" means \"yes\", while \"FREE\" means \"no\".\nChests.\n&lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;Chest&lt;/a&gt;s, especially when paired with &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, can make a good lure. If you place one inconspicuously in a wooden house, what self respecting griefer would not go and investigate?\nOre blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Ore\"&gt;Ore&lt;/a&gt; blocks make an irresistible lure. After all, if you saw a &lt;a href=\"diamond%20block\"&gt;diamond block&lt;/a&gt; just sitting there on the ground, would you just leave it there? This lure is good when paired with a &lt;a href=\"BUD\"&gt;BUD&lt;/a&gt; trigger.\nFake mineshaft.\n&lt;a href=\"Mineshaft\"&gt;Mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s are known for lots of loot. If you trap one, you can pretend to have 'accidentally given away directions' to the mineshaft.\nIron door.\nAn &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt; looks somewhat out of place in a dark cave. If a player sees one, they may be tempted to go inside. Unfortunately for them, there may only be a &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; on one side of the door, or a landmine hidden under the plate.\nDisarming traps.\nWhen faced with a trap, the safest course of action is usually to leave the way you came. If the player really wants to disarm it though, here are some tips:"}

{"id": "2535", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2535", "title": "Tutorials/Tree farming", "text": "Tree farming is the process of planting a large number of &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s and waiting for them to grow into &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s. These trees are then harvested for &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and more saplings, which can be used to grow another generation of trees. This can be repeated indefinitely, yielding a regular supply of logs without the hassle of covering large areas of terrain, therefore making wood a &lt;a href=\"renewable%20resource\"&gt;renewable resource&lt;/a&gt;. A secondary benefit of tree farming is that it allows conservation of the surrounding environment. The use of &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can speed up the process, or players can just plant the saplings and go do something else while they grow.\nFor detailed information on the mechanics of tree growth and structure, see the article on &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUses.\nTree harvesting is an essential first step for any player in &lt;a href=\"Survival%20mode\"&gt;Survival mode&lt;/a&gt;. The wooden blocks can be harvested for wood, without requiring tools, although an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; quickens harvesting. Each wood can be crafted into &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used to craft tools, like a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20pickaxe\"&gt;wooden pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; and similar wood-derived materials.\nWood can also be &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;smelted&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, a functional, easily renewable substitute to &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen leaves are harvested, or decay naturally, they have a chance to drop a sapling of their own species, which can be planted to grow a new tree. Decaying oak and dark oak tree leaves also have a 1/200 chance of dropping an &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestroying leaves does not require a tool; a sword is negligibly faster than bare hands but wears out the sword. Using a hoe increases the speed of breaking leaves, with an iron hoe able to mine them instantly. Using &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; harvests usable leaf blocks for the player to pick up and later place elsewhere. Use of &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; also destroys leaves quickly, but when used on a tree, fire also destroys much of the wood. Also, any leaf block unconnected or too far from a block of wood decays naturally over time.\nWood is also one of the most used building blocks in the game, used as pillars, flooring or simply as the main building material for base building.\nAside being used as a building material, wood is also essential in crafting. Chests, hoppers, tools, fences, torches, etc. have wood as one of its materials and are thus really important.\nWhich type of tree is best?\nBecause all eight types have different advantages and disadvantages, the best tree to choose can vary with the situation: \nWood texture.\nDifferent kinds of trees have different wood textures. If building wooden structures, you may choose a specific type of wood for its texture. Because the efficiency difference among tree types is only slight, appearance often has priority. If building or decorating with multiple wood types, having a tree farm for each is also useful.\nTree comparisons.\nAzalea Trees\nFarming various types of trees.\nSimple farming.\nWhat players need:\nFirst dig 1 block down. Count 4 blocks to the left and dig 1 block down. 4 blocks left again, dig one down. Repeat one more time. Then plant a sapling in every hole:\nWait a day (or use bone meal), then harvest the trees and get the saplings. Place the chest nearby to store the saplings (and axe, if players have one) in there. Then, you can extend the grid if you like, as long as all the saplings are the same type. (Mixing types can work, but the timing and space requirements get a bit messier.) You can add a torch in the middle to make the saplings able to grow at night and also ward off some mobs.\nGiant tree farming.\nSpruce and jungle trees can be planted and grown just like any other tree. But unless you only need a small amount of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; quickly, this is not useful. Not only are regular jungle trees slightly too large to harvest easily, but the jungle trees drop saplings rarely, and may not even replace the one used to grow them.\nHowever, four saplings can be grown into the respective \"giant spruce\" and \"jungle giant\" forms, by planting them in a 2\u00d72 formation: \nAside from the saplings, make sure there are no blocks less than 2 blocks away from the saplings (even torches), at any height up to the future height of the tree trunk (up to 32 blocks). A huge tree needs a 2\u00d72 thick trunk to grow. These trees average ~96 wood (1\u00bd stacks), and some can exceed 2 stacks. Bone meal can be used on any one of the saplings to make the tree grow more quickly. (Dark Oak must be planted similarly, but they don't grow tall enough to require the special harvesting techniques.)\nHarvesting trees is a bit harder, since the trees are really tall. You can do with a top-down technique or with a spiral-up technique.\nIf you want to be able to pause your work or are just afraid of heights, you can put a block of water around the dirt blocks where tree sapings sit on. If you are working with spruce trees, increase the depth to two blocks in case leaves grow over them.\nOak tree farming.\nSince the player can only harvest 7 blocks above the ground without climbing on something, the most efficient tree farm design limits the height of trees to 9 blocks. This allows 7 blocks of logs as a \"trunk\" and 2 block of &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; above that. This is accomplished by adding a ceiling at 10th block above the ground, leaving a space 9 blocks high in which trees can grow. This allows all of the wood from the trees to be harvested quickly and with minimal effort. The other option is to grab what you can from the ground and use a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; to burn what you can't reach.\nIt should be noted that leaving 9 blocks of space for trees to grow does not guarantee that all trees grow to this height. Trees grow with trunks 4-7 blocks in height, but not higher. Some may also grow branches despite the height limitation.\nThis height issue can also be avoided by planting a sapling on the bottom of a 2-block-deep hole. This ensures that the top layer of the tree remains reachable, and has the added benefit of preventing mobs from hiding in the shadow of the tree and surviving daylight. It also prevents growth of the smallest size, whose leaves would be blocked by the hole.\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Tree%23Growth%20and%20characteristics\"&gt;oaks can grow through certain blocks&lt;/a&gt;: Small oaks can replace many blocks (&lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; (but not &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s), while the branch wood of large oaks can grow through even solid blocks (including bedrock).\nBecause trees grow underground with a nearby &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; source, and also grow when in direct or diagonal contact with other trees, quite compact arrangements can be used for efficient use of space.\nUnderground saplings rely on &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; light to grow. Various patterns of saplings and torches can be used to achieve varying degrees of space efficiency. Since saplings only require light level 9 to grow, a single torch starting at light level 14 can sufficiently light 60 saplings. However, this torch-efficient model comes at the cost of stability. Trees can grow and block the torch light to other saplings. Underground tree farms should stay clear of magma blocks because a bug relating to the &lt;a href=\"south-east%20rule\"&gt;south-east rule&lt;/a&gt; may let magma affect any leaf/wood blocks occupying the same corner.\nSpace-efficient farming.\nIt is also possible to grow trees to maximize wood for the territory. However, because the canopies overlap, you harvest fewer saplings. Oak, birch, jungle, and acacia trees ignore logs of their own kind when calculating when to grow. However, spruce trees still require two blocks between other trees.\nThe most space-efficient way to prevent grown trees from blocking light to other saplings is to have every sapling\ndirectly next to a torch (not diagonal). This strategy yields a basic space efficiency of 80% since the pattern is made up of units of 1 torch + 4 saplings. The plus-sign shaped units can be arranged to completely fill an area.\nIt is recommended that the perimeter walkway and all blocks with a torch underneath be a different material, such as cobblestone. This allows for quick visual identification during re-planting, of which blocks get saplings and which get torches that may have been inadvertently knocked out during harvest. It is recommended to do the same for torches on the wall, as these may get knocked off by growing trees. If you dig down two blocks instead, and place the torches under glass blocks, the trees still receive the proper light level, and you are far less likely to inadvertently break your light structure during harvesting or replanting.\nA 11 by 7 farm, utilizing 61 Saplings and 22 torches, with a perimeter walkway.\nThis design takes account for the fact that all saplings adjacent to the walkway are supplied by light from the torches on the walkway. Thus the farm yields an efficiency of 84%.\nNote when the tree farm is cut down, the amount of returned saplings per tree is much lower than cutting trees in a forest, as the canopy is shared by many trees. Using an iron &lt;a href=\"Hoe\"&gt;Hoe&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; III to break the leaves will, on average, will drop enough saplings to replant the farm.\nFarming spruce and birch.\nUnlike oak trees, spruce and birch trees never grow to a branched tree. This makes them easier to harvest, but to farm Birch and Spruce trees efficiently, more space is required.\nBirches can be planted next to other birches with 2 blocks of space between them since the birch leaves can overlap with other birch leaves. This same spacing holds true for spruces. However, when planting the different types of trees together, birch and spruce trees need 4 blocks of space in between the saplings (the tree does not grow if leaves of a different tree are obstructing its path). Both birch and spruce trees require 9 blocks of vertical space above the sapling to grow regularly (10 is more efficient for growth). Both spruce and birch grow with less space, but not as regularly. Like other saplings, they must receive light level 8 or better to grow.\nFarming acacia.\nAcacia trees require six blocks of space from the sapling to the ceiling, if there is any, and at least two empty blocks to each wall. So the minimum space that an acacia tree requires to grow is an empty rectangular cuboid over the sapling of 6(height) \u00d7 5(wide) \u00d7 5(long) blocks.\nFarming small jungle trees.\nUsing the same spacing as a birch farm, one can grow individual jungle tree saplings as small jungle trees. Without fortune enchantments, a single tree would not produce enough saplings to replace itself. A 3\u00d73 grid of trees growing will usually produce enough saplings to replace itself in the long term, and occasionally produces 1-2 excess saplings. After 6-7 real life hours of hovering over the farm, cutting down, and replacing trees as they grow, a profit of about 10-20 saplings can be accumulated this way. A starting supply of 9 planted saplings and 18 back stock for the eventual stretch of losses is necessary to keep the initial tree grid planted at all times. After enough iterations, the ultimate result is a profit in jungle saplings.\nFarming huge fungi.\nHuge fungi require &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;Bone Meal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nylium\"&gt;Nylium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;Fungi&lt;/a&gt; to farm. You can make a platform of nylium, apply bonemeal until it generates fungi, then quickly grow the fungi and break the bottom stem to prevent the nylium from decaying. Cut down the fungus, and break the vegetation and nether wart blocks that generate and compost them, along with all the non-fungus vegetation that generates with using the bone meal on the nylium. With luck, you can get enough bone meal to do it all over again. You can always farm some other vegetation to produce enough bone meal to make sure you do not run out.\nCollecting huge fungi blocks in their own biomes is a great way to collect a sufficient amount of wood and decorative blocks early game. \nThe fastest way to use this method is to make an efficiency 5 netherite axe and hoe, then travel to the nether and fly around using an elytra until you come across a warped or crimson forest. If it's a crimson forest, be sure to bring warped fungus to repel hoglins (must be planted, with an area of effect of 15 blocks). \nAfter planting a fungus, build a 3x3 platform of gold blocks with a beacon on top for the haste 1 effect. Fly up from the beacon base and destroy the netherrack obstructing the beacon beam. The haste 1 effect reduces the mining time per stem block by 2gt. \nThis also helps when mining wart blocks and shroomlights, as when combined with an efficiency 3 netherite or diamond hoe, you can mine each block in 1gt. Setting up and removing a 1 layer beacon in the nether takes on average 600gt, so this beacon method is effective only if you are mining more than 300 stem blocks, or if it is necessary for instant mining more than 38 blocks. \nOnce the beacon is set up, you can begin harvesting trees. Huge Fungi normally generate together in clumps, so it's best to climb to the top using twisting vines, and then mine from the top down. Be sure to use a hoe to mine the leaf blocks (wart blocks and shroomlights), and your axe to harvest the stems.\nTo marginally increase speed, carry with you a few shulker boxes of unbreaking 3, efficiency 5, gold axes to reduce the mining speed by 1gt per stem block. \nPlace 2 nylium in a 3x3 grid pattern with 6 blocks in between each one. Then construct a water stream platform beneath it. Have the water stream funnel the items into a chest storage, connected by a hopper. To use the manual farm, place down a fungus on each nylium block, then grow the fungi using bone meal. Now climb to the top using ladders, a bubble column, scaffolding or vines, and mine out the huge fungi from the top down. After harvesting the huge fungi, collect any items that didn't drop into the water stream below.\nSemi-automatic harvesting is when everything in a farm is self-sufficient except for the input. \nIn the case of semi-automatic huge fungi farms, this would be the placement of fungi plants and often, but not always, supplying it with bone meal.\nThe positives of a semi-automatic design, is that they're fast, inexpensive to construct, lag friendly on small scales, and produces every block from the tree (wart blocks, shroomlights and weeping vines included).\n\"The Menace\".\nThis is a nether tree farm designed by ncolyer dubbed as \"The Menace\". The design is fairly complex but to simplify, it uses TNT dupers to destroy the logs and pistons to destroy the wart blocks. A modified design includes a system to convert byproducts such as vines, wart blocks and shroomlights to bonemeal to fully AFK the farm without the worry of running out of bonemeal. In all, it produces 80,000 logs per hour.\nFarming mangrove.\n&lt;a href=\"Mangrove\"&gt;Mangrove&lt;/a&gt; trees are really tall, and require a horizontal footprint of 13 by 13 blocks to grow fully. They are very difficult to harvest from the ground up, because their log usually starts a few blocks above the ground, and the logs branch in all sorts of different directions, which is very hard to trace when digging through the leaves. Therefore, the best way to mine these trees manually is a top-down approach. However, these trees are usually very tall and difficult to get on top of. Despite this difficulty, mangrove trees possess a unique trait that stands out among other trees: they can be planted underwater.\nTo farm these trees underwater, find a flat lakebed or ocean floor that is at least 10 blocks deep, place the mangrove propagule in the middle, and use bone meal on it. The tree will grow, and you can easily swim to the top and start harvesting it downwards. Because you will stay underwater for long periods of time, a helmet with &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Affinity\"&gt;Aqua Affinity&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; might be helpful. Because mangrove leaves do not drop saplings, There is no point to wait for all of them to decay before you plant the next tree, so you can simply mine out all the logs and mangrove roots, and then start planting the next tree.\nBecause mangrove propagules can be easily obtained by using bone meal on mangrove leaves, you can simply harvest a bunch of propagules, then start planting new trees without worrying about propagule collection at all.\n3+ in 1.\nYou can much more easily collect all the logs if you farm multiple trees in a special shape.\nEthosLab's tree farm.\nIn EthosLab's LP episode 51, Etho has a tree farm with 24 trees growing side by side in a 7x7 square. The tree/dirt part looks like:\nThe farm should be put above a flowing source of water to auto-collect the drops. In Etho's version, the farm is put in the middle of a 13x13 square,\nand on each corner of the square is a water block. This takes all drops from the leaves to the center point of the setup, where you can place a hopper.\nAfter setting up the farm, just put a sapling (oak, birch, or spruce) on every dirt block. If you want to plant 25 trees, you can put a dirt block in the dead center.\nAutomatic tree farms.\nAlthough somewhat complex to build (as opposed to planting saplings and just waiting or applying bone meal and then manually chopping them down), these automatic tree farms allow you to harvest wood at a much faster rate by automating the gathering and block breaking portions of tree farming.\nAuto grow, manual harvest designs.\nFocusing only on the growth portion of the farm, these designs allow you to quickly grow hundreds of trees by pressing down a mouse button and then ignoring it. A dispenser with bone meal automatically forces the tree to grow, and a column of pistons pushs the trunk into a collection area where it is stacked in a large block for you to later 'mine'. The more complex designs also include leaf breaking, meaning that you end up with a net positive on the saplings and in the case of oak trees get apples without having to do much of anything.\nAfter a few minutes you then go over to the storage area and mine out all the wood blocks in much the same way as you would cave-mine; meaning that you do not have to waste time by moving from one tree to the other.\nMinecraft for Dummies design.\nSmallest auto tree farm design (no sapling collection, oak only)\nFrilioth's design.\nAuto tree farm design (breaks all leaves, for oak trees only)\nMumbo Jumbo's design.\nAuto tree farm design (breaks all leaves, can use any tree type except spruce and dark oak)\n1.14 TNT farms.\nAs of update 1.14, it's possible to make a TNT based tree farm, or TNTree, with 100% drop rate for saplings, apples, sticks and logs.\nAFK tree farm designs.\nSeveral mobs in the game can break blocks, and most of them have been used for wood farming. An overly complex design featuring &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s was made, but the insane size of it makes constructing it anywhere exceptionally difficult. A different design that uses &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s is also available and much simpler to make, however when ghasts break blocks they destroy (without dropping) most of them, making tree farming with the ghast extremely inefficient.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; makes it possible to auto-break blocks by using the wither's ability to break any blocks within a 3\u00d73\u00d74 area (4x6x4 on bedrock edition) of it one second after it has been damaged. The wither can be trapped in bedrock in any of the dimensions. Because of the larger breaking area on Bedrock Edition, you can grow oak, birch, jungle, acacia, spruce, and even dark oak (by using boats to shift the breaking area) inside the breaking area of the wither.\nA newer method of caging in the wither has also been found that enables a tree farm to be build anywhere while at the same time using the wither to break the wood blocks. Although potentially more dangerous than encasing the Wither in bedrock (as in the above design), this cage has been found to be completely reliable as long as it is built correctly. It works by distracting each head with mobs without them being able to damage those mobs.\nAFK-able universal tree farms.\nThese tree farms work with all tree types except for dark oak. The only reason it does not work with dark oak is because they have a 2x2 block trunk. The section below covers those.\nAutomatic dark oak tree farms.\nThese are nearly non-existent because dark oak trees grow with a 2\u00d72 trunk and have extremely specific growth restrictions.\nSelf-sustaining huge fungus farm.\nFungi can be generated from using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt;. The bone meal can be generated by composting the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart%20Block\"&gt;Wart Block&lt;/a&gt;s from a grown &lt;a href=\"Huge%20Fungus\"&gt;Huge Fungus&lt;/a&gt;. Combine this with a flying machine and a TNT duplicator for breaking the blocks and add some sorting mechanisms, a self-sustaining farm is made.\nSince nylium decays when an opaque block (like tree stem) is above it, it is recommended that players stay away from the farm so that &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;s don't land on the nylium blocks. A smaller-scale version for logs only (without the TNT and composting) is shown to the right.\nAFK-able huge fungus farm.\nApart from being placed on it's respective nylium block, fungi have no growth restrictions thus removing the need for double piston-extender walls. This allows for rapid cycle speeds, and fast rates for minimal build effort. Wart Blocks and Shroomlights can be composted to provide a semi-self-sustaining functionality.\nSimple huge fungus farm for starter worlds\nMore advanced huge fungus farm for increased drops and efficiency\n1.13+ stripped log farms.\nPlayers can also create farms that automatically place saplings and break logs by either using an auto clicker or holding f3+t in some versions. In 1.13, logs were changed to become stripped logs when right clicked by a player holding an axe of any kind. These types of farms won't give you the raw logs you need for building, but can give you sufficent wood for crafting mass items."}

Another use for a turtle farm are potions of the turtle master, an extremely powerful potion that can be used for PvP. This tutorial describes a turtle farm that can reasonably be built in Survival mode.\nLocation.\nFirst you need to obtain &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s. There are two approaches: Hunting for eggs, or breeding turtles. In either case, once you locate turtle eggs, immediately build a fence around the eggs to protect them from being trampled by undead mobs while you build the farm.\nHunting for eggs.\nFind a &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"warm%20ocean\"&gt;warm ocean&lt;/a&gt; biome, or a beach next to a warm land biome such as &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;, where turtles have already laid eggs. You need &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s to start the farm working and producing. You must build the farm around eggs already laid by turtles or use a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; to pick up eggs and then place them in your farm. If you don't have a silk-touch tool, just build your farm around the eggs.\nIf you manage to find plenty of eggs in the wild, you don't really need to build a farm. Pick up the eggs with a Silk Touch tool, then place them in a safe location for hatching and harvest scutes as the turtles mature.\nYou may be lucky enough find two turtles breeding on a beach or splashing up sand in preparation for laying eggs, or find eggs already laid.\nBreeding turtles.\nIf you see turtles instead of eggs, look around the nearby beaches to see if they've laid eggs. If you don't find eggs, use seagrass to lure two of them onto a beach, feed them sea grass to get them to breed, and then follow them to where they want to lay their eggs. Only one of the two turtles lay eggs. If one looks slightly fatter after mating, follow that one. If you can't tell, try to keep track of both turtles until you see one of them splashing sand. A second player in the same world can help.\nIf you don't build around eggs, but instead lure turtles with sea grass into your farm and then breed them there, they won't lay their eggs in your farm. The pregnant turtle always swims back to its &lt;a href=\"Turtle%23Home%20location\"&gt;home beach&lt;/a&gt; to lay the eggs. You need eggs in your farm before your farm can work.\nConstruction.\nDesign considerations and preparation.\nThere are many variations of turtle farms. At the most basic level, one needs: \nOptionally, it's also good to have several hoppers and a chest. If you're attempting a survival mode build, you may first want to build a to collect enough iron to craft as many hoppers as you need, as well as iron tools, weapons, and armor.\nDuring construction, it may be a good idea to have a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; and shelter nearby to get some occasional sleep, to prevent &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s from spawning while you work.\nPreparing the beach.\nWhen fencing off the beach area, be sure to leave at least one block of clearance from the fence, so that hostile mobs cannot climb into the farm. Also, remember that turtles need to spawn on sand, so be sure to replace non-sand blocks on the beach with sand blocks.\nIt's a good idea to include one or more fence gates, so you can get in and out of the farm easily. Without a gate, you shouldn't be able to climb inside (if you can, then so can mobs).\nAlternatively, the player can place a carpet on a fence block so they can jump in and out easily. Mobs cannot do this.\nClearing the beach area typically yields enough blocks of sand to build the necessary structure in the ocean, from which the farm can be hollowed out. If you have a bucket, then don't be concerned about preserving the water in the farm, because you can always re-fill the necessary water blocks with buckets of water scooped from the ocean.\nYou don't need to make the beach flat, especially if the turtle eggs have already been laid on an elevated surface. Just be sure that the shoreline blocks are level with the water, and avoid steps that are two blocks high, so that the turtles may get up onto the beach easily.\nBuilding the farm.\nThe basic turtle farm shown as a side-view cross-section in the diagram on the right can be built easily in survival mode. This slice can be repeated any number of times to create a farm of any width, preferably at least 5 blocks wide (8 blocks wide is a practical size), with a chest at the end of the line of hoppers along the bottom. The farm in this diagram is designed to be built in survival mode, and allow turtles to go in and out freely. It has these features, from left to right: \nIn addition to these features, other features not shown in the diagram should also be included:\nOptional improvements:\nManaging the farm.\nThe eggs hatch after a few day-night cycles. After the turtles hatch for the first time, you're basically done. As each baby turtle grows up, it drops a &lt;a href=\"scute\"&gt;scute&lt;/a&gt; and leaves. You can accelerate their growth by feeding them sea grass. The turtles eventually return on their own to your farm to lay more eggs.\nA turtle farm works while you're away from the keyboard (AFK). Many in-game days are required to hatch enough baby turtles to create a sizable population of turtles laying eggs in your farm, but you can speed things up by actively managing your farm, using sea grass to lure back the turtles who left, feeding sea grass to pairs of turtles, and feeding baby turtles.\nYou can modify the barrier by installing a gate made from trapdoors under the barrier. The trapdoors can be operated manually, or you can lay a line of redstone dust on top of the barrier with a lever somewhere to power all the trapdoors at once. This can be used to keep adult turtles from leaving until you have fed them and got them to mate. A pregnant turtle needs to return to the water before returning to the beach to lay eggs. She may do this by returning to the water in the farm, and you might need to attract her back out onto the beach with seagrass. Otherwise, let them leave the farm and you can induce them to re-enter it later. A pregnant turtle fits under the trapdoors when open.\nIf you venture away from your farm further than the despawn range (128 blocks , 44-128 blocks depending on &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt;), the turtles in the farm despawn if you have not interacted with them by offering them &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you wish to have the turtles leave the farm area, you can add temporary slab (to each module) to the right of the current slab. However, place it on the bottom of that block rather than the top, to provide a staircase of sorts. Only do this when you have all adult turtles in the farm, and go to the outside with some seagrass to attract them to the outside. Once they've left, remove the temporary slabs, to prevent future baby turtles from also escaping on them."}

Ultra Hardcore mode is like Hardcore, but to add to the challenges of hardcore, you don't naturally regenerate health. This difficulty is extreme, so it is advised to try hardcore mode first to gain extensive experience, and move on to this difficulty when you think you are ready.\nAll the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Hardcore%20mode\"&gt;rules of regular Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; still apply, so read them first.\nCreating a UHC World.\nTo play on Ultra Hardcore, you must first create a &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; world. There are two ways to make a Hardcore world a UHC world. For the first method, once the world has finished generating, open the &lt;a href=\"Menu%20screen\"&gt;pause menu&lt;/a&gt;, click the &lt;a href=\"LAN\"&gt;open to LAN&lt;/a&gt; option, and turn on the &lt;a href=\"Cheats\"&gt;allow Cheats&lt;/a&gt; option, before clicking the \"Start LAN World\" button. Once this is done, exit the menu and enter the following command into the chatbox: . Once you have completed these steps, save and exit to the title screen, before returning to the game. For the second method, click create new world in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16&lt;/a&gt; or above, and set gamemode to Hardcore. Next, click game rules, and select natural regeneration to make it false. Once you have done that, click create world. Now you have successfully created your own Ultra Hardcore world.\nNotes and tips.\nUltra Hardcore Mode, like mentioned earlier, is very difficult to survive when playing, and if you die, your map will only be available for spectating. Therefore, it's important to know how to avoid dying. Here are some tips:\nBeginning.\nThere are a lot of options of what you can do play singleplayer UHC, but if you want to survive, you generally want to either not take much damage, \"or\" get a lot of materials to heal with. \nThe Overworld.\nWhen you start, get only 3 &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s. Make a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and wooden &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Go to the nearest &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and mine 3 blocks. Make a stone &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, then mine around 10 blocks to make &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. Mine 10 more stone and make a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;. As you move, kill passive mobs and try to get 12 pieces of &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt; and 3 &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;. Get 5 more logs and make a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. If you find &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, mine it. Try to get at least one &lt;a href=\"wheat%20seed\"&gt;wheat seed&lt;/a&gt;, and till the ground next to &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and plant the seed. If you have wood, make a stack of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nWhen night falls, it is safer to go mining unless you have already built a house with a bed. Try to get at least a stack of iron and a stack of coal. Get some &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"clock\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt;. Get some &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;. If you get &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, make a diamond pickaxe and mine 14 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Craft a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;, an iron sword and pickaxe, iron &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt; if you have the resources. If you have more iron, make a second bucket and a pair of &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you finish mining, you can go up and gather more logs and expand your farm. Once you have gathered materials, you should make a bigger base. The base should be able to fit all your chests, furnaces, crafting tables, and everything you need. Build an animal pen and expand your wheat farm. Get &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;oxeye daisies&lt;/a&gt;, both types of &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt; for healing. Once you have enough gold, make a golden apple, keep it in your &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;hotbar&lt;/a&gt;, and never remove it. It will save your life at some point.\nAfter you've gathered basic materials, you should probably either continue caving or go to the Nether.\nCaving.\nCaving in UHC mode is what you make it. Generally, people either try to go super fast or super slow. The goal of going super fast is to beat mob spawns through the caves and gain materials more efficiently. You can light behind you with torches if you want, \"especially\" if you plan to go back out the way you entered. If you run through placing &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es you might want to not even mine &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s to get through faster. The other approach is to go through caves very slowly. A lot of people will recommend this, although, for competitive or time-based environments, it's generally more efficient to just run through. When caving slowly, always block off mobs and attack their feet.\nYou can also avoid caves and just go strip-mining for ores and obtain a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s from a &lt;a href=\"fletcher\"&gt;fletcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nether.\nRead the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Nether%20survival\"&gt;Nether survival guide&lt;/a&gt; first. As usual, you need to avoid all types of damage. However, you must be even more cautious due to the many dangers of the Nether."}

{"id": "5392", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5392", "title": "Tutorials/Underwater home", "text": "An undersea home has certain pros and cons that set it apart from any other sort of base. An underwater home is immune to &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s, most &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s have difficulty attacking it, and it will provide a high level of protection and concealment. Additionally, the base can have access to conduit power. The difficulties with an undersea build in Survival mode are that it presents challenges of reduced movement and mining speed, breathing while working, clearing water from the structures, and special measures for entry and exit on deep bases. Also be wary of &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, as they are fairly common in oceans and sometimes have tridents, which can be very dangerous.\nMoving underwater.\nMovement and mining speed underwater can be improved by the player equipping a helmet enchanted with the &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Affinity\"&gt;Aqua Affinity&lt;/a&gt;, which increases underwater mining speed, with a maximum tier of 1, and &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Strider\"&gt;Depth Strider&lt;/a&gt;, which increases underwater movement speed, the maximum tier being 3.\nBreathing underwater.\nBuilding underwater is safer and simpler while wearing a helmet enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Respiration\"&gt;Respiration&lt;/a&gt; and having some 8 minute &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potions of Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; ready to drink. Note that Respiration only extends ones \"breath holding\" time, it does not give true underwater breathing. Although they do not give one enough time for work, even 3-minute potions will be of use in getting down to a deep base where you will have other means to keep breathing.\nA dried &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent way to remove a large volume of water from an enclosed volume. A &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; can also completely solve the problem of breathing. A sponge or conduit can be difficult or time-consuming to obtain in survival mode, however.\nFor extended work periods, a player will need to have air bubbles close by in which the breath meter can be refilled. The &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt; from a magma block will recharge your air supply but be careful that the downdraft does not suck you down into the magma block.\nJava Edition.\nBefore the Aquatic Update (version 1.13) it was possible to make air bubbles with fence posts, signs, glass panes, iron fencing, ladders and stairs as these blocks did not fill their volume completely, and would drive out water when placed. With the aquatic update only &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s still have these properties, and only . In other versions all the rest will become &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; when placed into a water source block.\nDoors and banners are the best options for making a breathing space as they can be placed on top of any block, even without walls on each side, and provide the needed head high air space. A gate needs to be placed against a head high vertical block, or be stacked up from the bottom to work. Note that only the upper half of a banner makes an air bubble so when placed on a wall it must be set head high.\nBedrock Edition.\n, all blocks are subject to &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogging&lt;/a&gt;, meaning there are no blocks you can use to displace water source blocks to create an air space. Doors, ladders, and gates can be used to displace running water only.\nTo make an air pocket in Bedrock Edition, place a solid block that can break quickly, like a slime block or a TNT. After breaking the block, quickly place a block that displaces flowing water, like a button, sign, or trapdoor, before a water source block forms in that space. The block where you place the sign is counted as a flowing water block, so a sign can create an air pocket there.\nGetting to the sea bottom.\nIn relatively shallow waters you can just swim down and place \"bubble blocks\" to create a place to stand. From that you can place blocks out into the water to make walls and then a ceiling, then use a method of clearing water to finish the room. \nThe \"lily pad\" method creates a 3\u00d73 column to the bottom by dropping sand off the four edges of a &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt; from a boat on the surface. Alternatively, you can place a block onto the lily pad to make it easier to place the sand. Once you have an enclosed 1 block column of water you fill the central block with more sand, then work your way down from the top digging out the central column of sand and replace at least one of the sides with a non-falling block, like dirt or wool, and place ladder blocks on the non-falling block. When you reach the bottom you can dig out through the solid wall (it will not collapse) and place a door to keep the water out. Or you can dig down further into the seabed and make your base entirely below water.\nA relatively risk-free method of getting down to the sea bottom is to dig down from a nearby landmark and then dig out horizontally until you are at the desired coordinates, based on previously rowing a boat out to your planned base location to note the coordinates.\nBuilding the base.\nIf your base is big you must take out the water with a command block; however, if your base is small you can soak the water with a sponge to do it quickly. Once you have a safe place on the bottom you can start construction by placing a door just before a vertical wall then digging into the rock through the door. It is common for the sea bed to be gravel for 2-3 blocks so you should place a layer of solid blocks over top of the gravel to hold the water back as you remove the gravel. Once you have an entrance passage, you can place &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s (pre-Aquatic versions), or another door, banner, or gate (all versions) inside the first door, then remove it to make a flush entrance. You can even turn around to work backward out into the water to continue your base that way.\nFor an inconspicuous entrance, you can dig a 1\u00d71 shaft down from your safe air bubble until you hit solid rock, then build further however you like. Avoid the risk of falling into a cave by standing on the border of two blocks as you dig first left then right on your way down.\nTo prevent flooding in the event of disaster dig down a block from floor level before digging horizontally. If your block(s) holding back the water are somehow broken, the inflowing water will drop into the hole and stop there.\nAnother measure to prevent flood damage is to use light sources that water cannot wash away, like &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lanterns\"&gt;jack o'lanterns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;Torch&lt;/a&gt;es of course would be washed away if water ever flooded in; however, &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20torch\"&gt;Underwater torch&lt;/a&gt;es can be used aside from the given items. \nAnother useful measure to take is to construct an airlock at every door and to make windows double thick.\nClearing out water.\nTo make your base as a bubble under the sea you will need to clear &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; out of a fairly large volume. \nThe traditional method is to fill the space with a falling block (sand or gravel) and then dig it all back out. This method is well suited when you have constructed all of the walls and then cap them with solid blocks once the space is filled in. If you have &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; available in quantity they make a good filler as they can be insta-mined using just a fist and so can be broken even when you are fatigued by an &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlternatively, you can fill with a &lt;a href=\"flammable\"&gt;flammable&lt;/a&gt; block such as &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; blocks. Fire does not burn evenly so there will probably be some manual clean-up needed after the burn is done.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s is a great way to dry out a big volume of water. Sponges can be found inside &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. You can dry out ocean monuments using the methods above until you find some sponges; this is more time-consuming than swimming but eliminates the risk of drowning in case you get lost in the monument. When a &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt; is placed, it will soak up water in a 9\u00d79\u00d79 volume centered on itself, and become a wet sponge. Bring enough wood and cobble down with you to make a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; to dry the sponges.\nLarger spaces may be partitioned into smaller areas using fences, gates, doors, or whatever, and dried out a chunk at a time.\nMaking the walls and ceiling of a bubble base out of &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt; makes for a spectacular view from both the inside and outside of the base. Under the right conditions, a bubble base will be a beacon glowing beneath the sea to anyone who passes.\nIf you have a big, flat area to clear, it may be easier to build a device to clear the water for you (see the \"Videos\" section below).\nDrop-in construction.\nThis method is particularly good for building in very deep areas as it requires far less time working underwater.\nFind a fairly deep patch of water with a relatively flat floor. Then build a platform on or above the water surface out of any non-gravity block that is easy to remove such as &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;. Using a cavity block, like &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, build the shape of your desired building on the platform like building a \"sand castle\", but without the exterior walls. You won\u2019t be able to have any overhanging exterior features and the interior must be a solid mass. When the \"mould\" is complete, remove the supporting platform blocks to let the gravity blocks sink to the bottom.\nNow you go underwater to complete the build by constructing walls and ceiling around the moulded shape. Then you hollow it out and furnish it to taste.\nA tip for hollowing out: Take advantage of how falling gravity blocks break when they fall onto a non-solid block like a &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"stair\"&gt;stair&lt;/a&gt;. With practice, you can use it to dig out the block of sand at the bottom of a stack, and immediately place it to replace the gravity block. The rest of the column will collapse all the way from top to bottom.\nHiding your base.\nCamouflage is the best way to hide your ocean base. Make it as deep as possible in a deep ocean biome using blue &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; for exterior walls, or make it look like a &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; \"hill\". Prevent any light from inside getting out into the water by placing half &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s over any openings. If possible, keep your buildings small, separated, and in irregular shapes that mimic normal underwater terrain. Blue glass is the best transparent material for windows as it blends in best with water. \nAn interesting possibility is to hide in plain sight. Take over an ocean monument by drying out its interior and building a safe entryway from outside the protection zone of the Guardians. One could also use a submerged wreck as the entrance to one's base.\nA good test of your efforts to conceal your base is to drink a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20Night%20Vision\"&gt;potion of Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; while floating on the surface over it. Take note of anything that gives the base's existence away. Screenshots with F2 are good for this, and have another go at your camouflage.\nRaiding an ocean monument.\nAfter raiding an ocean monument, you can make it your underwater base. First, see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20a%20monument\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating a monument&lt;/a&gt; for advice on how to defeat the monument. After you have removed the threats, separate each room by using blocks or doors. After that, use sponges to clear out the water in the room. Finally, repeat doing this to each room until you have a whole ocean monument with no water inside. If you need to, you can also clear the water outside so no guardians spawn outside of the monument. You can build conduits to give conduit power to players. You may break the walls inside the monument, too."}

If need be, it is possible to change the used Java version in the profile options menu.\nWhat is Java?\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//java.com/\"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; is a programming language and computing platform. Unlike many other languages, Java does not run directly on the hardware, but in a virtual machine, called the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). \"Minecraft\" (Java Edition) is written in Java, and uses it for game logic, rendering, and networking.\nAs of September 19, 2023, the latest stable Java versions are 1.8.0_382 (OpenJDK) (Long-Term Support or LTS), 11.0.20 (LTS), 17.0.8 (LTS) and 21 (LTS).\nIf you use a custom JVM, you should notice that the official launcher only allow the custom JVM with the same primary Java version as the minimum required Java version to launch the game.\nWhy update?\nThe latest versions of Java contain important enhancements to help improve performance, stability and security of the Java applications that run on your machine. Installing the latest Java update ensures that \"Minecraft\" continues to run safely and efficiently.\nWhere to download.\nYou can get Java either from Oracle or from someone who builds OpenJDK. For the purpose of Minecraft they are essentially the same, but Oracle's \"OTN\" version (Oracle JDK uses \"Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions\" as of Java 17 LTS) requires a PAID license for &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.carehart.org/blog/client/index.cfm/2019/1/1/how_oracles_java_change_applies_to_any_production_use\"&gt;commercial and production&lt;/a&gt; purposes. If you make money from streaming Minecraft or running a Minecraft server (even non-profit), you MUST use OpenJDK unless you want to figure out how to pay.\nYou will see that Java is divided into LTS (long-term support) like 11 and STS (short-term support) version numbers like 16. An LTS version will be given updates for longer, so people tend to use them as a stable standard of \"modern, but not too new\" Java.\nOther VMs.\nSome other Java compatible VMs include:\nHow to update.\nWhen you install Java, go to your launcher, edit or create an installation, and in the Java Executable box, type codice_1 (Windows)\nor: codice_2 (Linux) or: codice_3 (macOS). The exact value depends on where your java is installed.\nYou must remove codice_4 from your JVM Arguments. This option is meaningless for Java 9 and newer, and will cause a launch failure if you keep it there."}

{"id": "98302", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=98302", "title": "Tutorials/Updating old terrain", "text": "From time to time, Minecraft &lt;a href=\"Seed_%28level_generation%29\"&gt;world generation&lt;/a&gt; is changed to introduce new features. Some of these changes are terrain-breaking (like &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;), while others keep the terrain roughly the same in terms of altitude. In either case, you may want to clear out &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s of your old world, so that the new world-gen kicks in to give you the exciting stuff. This tutorial explains how to delete chunks in an older world for them to regenerate in a newer version, so that you won't need to travel thousands of blocks into unexplored terrain to see the new terrains if the player have a huge world. This action is commonly known as chunk resetting.\nNon-breaking update.\nAn example for a non-breaking update is &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;. This version vastly changes the world generation of oceans, swamps and rivers by adding features like &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt;. However, the new terrain generation doesn't affect the biome type or terrain altitude (with a few exceptions, as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/u/bdm68\"&gt;u/bdm68&lt;/a&gt; pointed out.)\nIn the case of 1.13, we want to remove all chunks with an ocean, river, or swamp biome so that they regerate with the new features in 1.13. Since the biome types and altitude didn't change in 1.13, the regenerated chunks will seamlessly blend into the existing landscape, but they will generate with the new underwater features.\nUsing MCA Selector (any Java).\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/Querz/mcaselector\"&gt;MCA selector&lt;/a&gt; is a tool to do chunk-level operations on a Minecraft world, and that also includes deleting and filtering. It has a filter interface for you to check for coordinate, block type, biomes, as well as for chunks of a certain data version. It works on any version of Java Edition.\nYou can follow these steps to reduce world file size or delete chunks without accidentally removing any important part of the world:\nUsing MCEdit (1.7.2-1.12.2).\nMCEdit has a plugin to select chunks by biome so that we can delete them. It is also possible to protect regions of your world, in case you need to preserve existing builds in those biomes. As this method depends on MCEdit, it only works for worlds opened in Java Edition 1.7.2 to 1.12.2. If you have opened the world in 1.13, you need to retrieve the older save from the backups folder.\nThe plugin inspects each chunk of your world, and decides for each chunk whether it can be deleted. In \"Minecraft\", a single &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; can contain different biomes. For example, along the shore of an ocean, a lot of chunks will contain ocean biomes as well as beach biomes. Sometimes it is not obvious how these cases should be handled, so the plugin can be used in one of two modes:\nHere is an example to illustrate the difference:\nThere are four biomes present here: &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; (green), &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;es (yellow), &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s (light blue), and &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s (dark blue). If you were to delete all rivers, beaches, and oceans with the plugin, then all purple striped chunks would be deleted no matter which mode you use. But in aggressive mode, also the red striped chunks would be deleted.\nIn general, aggressive mode will lead to better results, especially if you want to regenerate river biomes. However, you may need to protect more regions of your world.\nTo protect regions of your world, you will need to modify the plugin by writing some Python code. Guides are provided so don't be worried.\nThe whole process may take a couple of hours.\nUsing the tools.\nProtecting regions of your world.\nOnce you decided which biomes you want to delete, make a (mental) list of things you built in those biomes, or near the edges of those biomes. Depending on the mode you use, the plugin may delete chunks even if they contain biomes that you did not want to delete.\nIf you haven't built anything in those biomes that you want to keep, skip to the next section. Otherwise, this section will teach you how you can modify the plugin to protect those builds.\nThe idea is similar with MCA selector, but only a top view is provided. You may want to go into the game (in a backup) so that you can use the x-z coordinates from within. Alternatively, it suffices in most cases to check for a 64x64 radius from a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; (Palette), the quintessential marker for player activity.\nExample.\nThere are two regions that you want to protect.\nThis is what the modified section of the plugin would look like:\n # Protected Regions\n # Any chunk region in this list will not be deleted.\n protected_regions = [\n # Use spaces to indent your lines so far that the 'c' in\n # 'chunk_region' is right under the # characters.\n # ----------- Add your protected regions below this line -----------\n chunk_region(-1, 4, 3, 12),\n chunk_region(33, 15, 33, 15),\n # ----------- Add your protected regions above this line -----------\nIf you're having trouble with this section, feel free to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/message/compose/%3Fto%3D25A0\"&gt;message the creator on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to include the modified part of the plugin in your comment. If MCEdit shows an error message, include the content of the error message, too.\nIn MCA selector, no code modification is needed. You simply need to roll the protected bits into the query parameter. For the above, you would do:\n (Original filter) AND (NOT((xPos &gt;= -1 AND xPos &lt;= 3 AND zPos &gt;= 4 AND zPos &lt;= 12) OR (xPos == 33 AND zPos == 15))\nRunning the selection.\nFor MCEdit: \nFor MCA Selector:\nAt this point, your world is ready to be opened in 1.13. Take a few minutes to check your world to verify that everything went well.\nBreaking change.\nIt is much harder to find a smooth transition among breaking-change versions. A tool called &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/hetmankp/mcmerge\"&gt;mcmerge&lt;/a&gt; (Java 1.7 -&gt; 1.8-1.12) can help by adding rivers around the transition, but you have to do some preparations on the old map before using it. If you don't want the preparation, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/gmcnew/bestofboth\"&gt;bestofboth&lt;/a&gt; (Java 1.7 -&gt; 1.8-1.12) simply looks for cliffs and fill them all in.\nSplicing by Y.\nThe changes introduced in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.18\"&gt;Java Edition 1.18&lt;/a&gt; additionally adds the use case of splicing the old and new worlds by Y value, so that an older map receives additional underground space. This can be done by pasting the &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Block%20format\"&gt;16x16x16 sections&lt;/a&gt; in from a new world of the same seed. MCA Selector allows for dealing with sections in this way.\nIn normal situations, JE 1.18+ is able to make the terrain blend where new and old chunks connect in the 0~256 Y range, so that the change is not quite \"breaking\". There will be a disconnect in terms of bedrock height, making it possible to mine into the void at these boundaries."}

It was first discovered in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, and has been used till &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13.2&lt;/a&gt;. The process was originally discovered and introduced to the majority by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/user/TangoTekLP\"&gt;TangoTek&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe video where TangoTek introduced the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; chaining concept.\nThis tutorial will teach you how to chain villages - typically used in the spawning part of large, efficient &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; farms - from scratch. If you only want examples, visit the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farming tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. This is also created specifically for . Info may be inaccurate when applied to other versions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2655986-village-info\"&gt;new village info mod&lt;/a&gt; will definitely help, as it is the only village info mod that helps you visualize villages while not being glitchy.\nClassifications.\nNon-Concentrical and Concentrical.\nNon-concentrical chained villages are the first to be discovered. Their component villages' centers is usually arranged on a line and are not put in the same position.\nOn the other hand, concentrical chained villages are discovered much later. They have all component villages' centers in the exact same spot.\nNon-Resettable and Resettable.\nBecause even the quickest reloading of &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt; (usually done in autosaving, and affects most kind of chunk loaders) will basically wipe all villages data in those chunks and recalculate everything, chunks containing chained villages must never unload as long as the game is open, or else the whole thing will merge.\nThe solution to this is either putting the whole chained village in &lt;a href=\"spawn%20chunk\"&gt;spawn chunk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Daeq5GZxRH9s\"&gt;its equivalent&lt;/a&gt;, then use a &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20chunk%23Other%20Dimensions\"&gt;little trick&lt;/a&gt; to continue loading the chunks even when no &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is in the same dimension as it (the non-resettable solution), or use redstone to rechain the village whenever the player needs (the resettable solution).\nThe resettable solution is primarily used when chunk permaloading cannot be achieved (for example in a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.spigotmc.org\"&gt;Spigot server&lt;/a&gt;), or when the chaining process is so complex it cannot be done manually (such as in concentrical chained villages).\nGame mechanics and mechanisms used in village chaining.\n\"Note:\n1. Before getting to the advanced, please visit the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Village%20mechanics\"&gt;tutorial on village mechanics&lt;/a&gt; first to learn the basics.\n2. Mechanisms discussed in this section are for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt; and above only, however game mechanics discussion are for all versions that have villages.\n3. To prevent itself from being unnecessarily long or wide, figures in this section use &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s to represent valid door positions and village radius, respectively. Side-view &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; represents a village center that contains a valid door, while top-view log represents a door-less center. The barrier icons just represent unimportant things. More important icons may overlay less important ones. The minimum village radius in those figures is 5 &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; and the merging range is radius + 5 blocks instead of 32 blocks and radius + 32 blocks like the real game.\"\nVillage merging priority &amp; Border extender.\nIf all the chunks containing villages are not reloaded, village merging will only be considered when a villager detects new doors (technically only the bottom block of the door is counted). If there are multiple villages in range, only the most eligible village to merge with a door will get merged with it. All the other in-range villages are ignored. Thus, villages with overlapping boundaries are possible.\nBefore 1.8, the older a village is the more eligible it is to merge with a new village. Consequently, village chaining back then primarily used the merging range to prevent villages from merging initially. After 1.8, however, the nearer a village to a door the more eligible it is to merge with the door. If multiple villages have the same distance between their centers and a door, the door will prefer the older village more. This makes village chaining tougher, but also much more predictable, allowing a village to extend from a far spot to overlapping with a preexisting village. It also doesn't break chained villages from older versions as long as it is kept loaded, but old reset mechanisms no longer work.\nBorder extender.\n\"The process of making village boundaries overlap, with the oak village getting closer and closer to the birch village each chaining cycle, until it cannot get any closer with this method. The oak village is created first, thus the game prefers it over the birch village. Note the rounding that shifted the center to the west. This is also almost exactly the same way TangoTek chained villages in his &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DSTs4wDJewNw\"&gt;Iron Titan&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe village border extender is a valid house that, as the name suggests, extends the border of a village so that the center is closer to the center of another village. The extender should always be placed as close as possible to the other village, but must still be closer to the village that needs extension. After that, the further door(s) to the other village's center is removed, so that the extender becomes the center of the village, allowing it to use another extender to continue the process until it cannot get any closer with this method. After the extended village has reached that spot, more doors can be added to it &amp; the other village so they both have enough doors to spawn &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nProperties of the village center &amp; Center anchor.\nThe village center is the centroid of the shape formed if all the valid houses' positions are connected, however it can also be confused with the center (or centroid, it is the same in case of a sphere) of the bounding sphere of the village (the smallest sphere possible that contains all the doors of the village). Consequently, the more populated with valid houses a section of the village is, the nearer the village center is to the centroid of that specific section.\nCenter anchor.\nUsing a big cluster of valid houses, one can \"anchor\" the village center so that it is more likely to be near the centroid of the cluster, then use extenders to extend the village radius way past the anchor itself. This technique is crucial if you want to make it so that an old village is completely inside another, new village, which in turn is crucial for concentrical village chaining.\nA good was to do this is to first create the extender along with a new village; then, use 1 small and 1 big anchor to help the newer village reach the other side of the iron farm, allowing for concentrical village chaining.\nOne villager in multiple villages.\nA villager can be inside multiple villages as long as they are inside the border of those villages, which is the prime advantage of concentrical chained villages over non-concentrical chained villages, and of any type of chained village over traditional iron golem farming. This can reduce the villagers cost from hundreds down to 30 or so.\nHouse detection mechanics &amp; Layered chained village + Keeping doors detected + Undetecting a door.\nEach villager have a hidden timer that counts down from a random number of seconds, the minimum being 2.5 seconds and the maximum being 6 seconds. After the timer reaches 0, new valid doors (\"houses\") are detected and old doors are re-detected in a 32 x 8 x 32 box. The center of the box is always on the north-west edge of the block the legs of the corresponding villager is in, and it is always on the same vertical level as the villager. Usually only the bottom block of a door is counted, however the bottom layer of the detection box is able to detect the upper block, however this cannot be used to detect a door twice, and only affects the center math. In both cases the door blocks have to be completely inside of the box to be detected. This limitation can be used to prevent new doors from being added, however as villagers cannot move vertically freely, the vertical detection range is more limited and houses that need to be separated are usually stacked on top of each other, only the vertical limitation is often used.\nAdditionally, after getting detected as houses, doors no longer need an \"outside\" or \"inside\" to be kept being considered as houses. This is especially crucial in stacking multiple doors.\nAside from having itself destroyed, or having the chunk it is in reloaded, a door can only stop being considered as a house if there is no villager that re-detects it for 60 seconds. This is both useful and harmful as it allows chaining mechanisms to be reused without player interaction, but can also break a chained village.\nLayered chained village + Keeping doors detected + Undetecting a door.\nKnowing these mechanics, making a layered chained village, keeping doors detected and undetecting doors is quite easy. These videos are example of those mechanics being used in practice:\nIn this video, despite solid blocks being placed, blocking the skylight from reaching the 1st floor (with already chained villages), the farm still functions properly. The main villagers are divided in 2 separate chambers so they can detect the doors properly. TangoTek can be heard mentioning the 6-second rule.\nThe Iron Phoenix uses slime blocks to separate the door layers because it is a transparent block that doors can be placed on.\nThe downward preference.\nAs the game's internal integer rounding always truncates integers, village centers are always placed further to the downward direction (negative Y direction) from the actual centroid of the village. This also affects the golem spawning box. The golems spawn inside a 16*6*16 box that has to fit perfectly into the block grid. As a result, the center of that box is never the center of the village."}

If the player has a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Villager%20trading%20hall\"&gt;villager trading hall&lt;/a&gt;, then the player must fill it with villagers and replace the ones that the player discards. It is difficult to do this through kidnapping villagers alone, so having an artificial breeder can be very helpful.\nAnother use is for an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt; as they work with a certain number of villagers; see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Iron golem farming&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nUnlike for other breedable mobs, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; breeding cannot be forced. However, the player can provide ideal accommodations (beds and food) to make the process efficient. The decision for a villager to show heart particles depends on how \"willing\" a villager is to mate. If two villagers nearby are willing at the same time, they meet and spawn a baby villager in between them, like other passive mobs. There are many factors of willingness, but it depends mostly on the food that the player feeds the parents. To feed villagers, the player must throw the &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; to them, and let them obtain it in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. A villager requires 12 food points to be considered ready to breed. Below is a table indicating the number of points for each food item. Any mix of the items mentioned can be used as long as they total at least 12 points.\nWillingness can be increased if the player trades with the villagers. Also, a farmer villager can throw excess food to other villagers. So, if the farmer has free access to crops, and they are within range of a village, then that village can support the autonomous feeding of villagers.\nThere are more parameters to willingness than just the food villagers have. Villagers take a census of the population of their village about every minute , comparing their population to the number of available beds. They become willing only if the population is less than 100%. This depends on the number of &lt;a href=\"beds\"&gt;beds&lt;/a&gt;. There must be at least one &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; for each villager, and each bed must be reachable by some villager. If there is an \"excess\" of beds, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; breeding commences. \nThe beds require a full two blocks of space above them; the bed itself counts as a full block, and so does any top slab that may be used for the ceiling. Essentially, the baby villager needs to be able to bounce on the available bed.\nA historical note: The current breeding mechanics were instituted by the the &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt; update; where the population limit is now set by number of beds, formerly it was set by the number of doors in the village, where there were various rules defining a valid door (roughly, there had to be an identifiable \"inside\" and \"outside\").\nAutomatic breeder.\nThe area around a villager breeder must be carefully scoured to ensure the breeder works correctly. The village must be small, so the player must ensure that no other villages exist within an 80-block spherical radius. No matter what the player builds, at least three villagers are needed to initiate the process. Here are the roles they play in a villager farm:\nIf the farmer is too busy collecting crops, it may take longer to get baby villagers. Increasing the amount of breedable villagers within the farm (by keeping bred babies inside), helps to solve that problem as well as increase breeding speed in general.\nManual breeder.\nTo make a manual breeder, you just need to build a space big enough for 3 or more beds. Then throw the food to the villagers so that they can breed."}

They also provide a way to quickly discard unwanted villagers and replace the ones that are discarded. They can take the form of a literal \"hall\", with villagers lined up and waiting for the player to trade with them.\nMechanics.\nThere are three parts to a villager trading hall: the input, storage, and output.\nInput.\nThe &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; for a trading hall generally come from a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Villager%20farming\"&gt;villager breeder&lt;/a&gt;. A source anywhere else is impractical given the amount of effort exerted to transport villagers out of a village. More advanced designs can include areas for players to reroll trades or permanently reduce their costs by &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;zombifying&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Curing%20a%20zombie%20villager\"&gt;curing&lt;/a&gt; them.\nFor a fully automatic system, the mechanism that puts the villager into the hall must be able to close off the cell once the villager enters to prevent more villagers from entering that cell, and to open the next cell to allow for a villager to enter.\nStorage.\nSometimes, the player will want to keep a villager because it has valuable or worthwhile trades. These villagers must be accessed, so they stay in separate \"cells\" until a better villager comes along; at which point the player may wish to discard them. They must be protected from &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and other things that could bring harm to them. The villagers must also have workstation blocks nearby, so that they can restock their trades.\nOutput.\nA villager may come along with undesirable trades, or no trades at all. Also, a better villager might come along that would replace one that already exists in the hall. At this point, the player may wish to discard the villager, and the trading hall must provide a way to do so.\nThis discarding mechanism must be able to remove the villager from the cell and then open it up to allow for more villagers to drop in.\nOnce a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; is discarded, it is up to the player to do what they want with them. The most common thing to do is move the discarded &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; into one area, where they are killed by whatever means suits the player. It is not recommended to kill them manually, because that will lower the player's popularity, and if the &lt;a href=\"popularity\"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; gets too low, any &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s of that &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; become hostile toward that &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. An alternative to killing the discarded &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; is to store them for an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt;, put them into a village, or put them to work in farms and breeders.\nLocking in trades.\nOnce a fresh villager has been placed into their new spot in the hall, it is possible to lock in a trade that is desirable. To lock them in, simply trade with them. If a trade is undesirable, reset trades by breaking and replacing the villager's job block. This can be done as often as needed until a satisfactory trade is offered at a good price. Once a villager has traded once, they will keep that trade forever. If you do not lock them in, their trades will reset every few minutes.\nDesigns.\nDesigns come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have the same basic parts, as described above.\nEggfur's simple trading hall.\nSimple 1.16.100+ design for Bedrock with automatic zombification of individual villagers.\nEggfur's advanced trading hall.\nAutomated 1.16.100+ design for Bedrock with automatic villager loading from a villager breeder, fast trade re-rolls and automatic zombification of individual villagers.\nIanXO4's design.\nJava 1.16 design that is extremely easy to build and expand.\nMysticat's design.\nHere is a 1.16 design that is super compact, low resource, and infinitely tileable.\nStandard design.\n\"Replace the crafting table with the villager's job site block.

The reason why they're called void trading is because the most common method of doing this trick is in the End, however, ianxofour has made a method without using the End.\nDesigns.\nMadman25.\nThis is the origin of the name of Void Trading. It uses end gateways to teleport players thousands of blocks away, making it faster than ianxofour's design.

By setting the render distance to 2, opening the trading UI and turning the railway on and letting you go to the other endpoint, you can do the trade and once you go back, the villager's trades aren't locked, allowing you to do this consistently. You can also have another villager waiting in the 2nd endpoint, making this more efficient.\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGFoCfRaljM&amp;t=168s"}

They result in a significant difference in the height of the ground on either side of the wall. There are several ways to implement a retaining wall but there are few visible differences between them because the parts that are different are usually buried. It's also possible to combine the following designs in various ways. \nRetaining walls may also use &lt;a href=\"%23Buttresses\"&gt;buttresses or counterforts&lt;/a&gt; for support.\nHa-ha.\nA \"ha-ha\" is a concealed barrier which stops livestock wandering onto the grounds of an estate without the need for obtrusive fencing. Because these are sunken walls they quickly become invisible when viewed from a distance. In \"Minecraft\", making them half a block lower than the adjacent earth conceals them very effectively. Note that some extra non-historical changes would be needed to stop spiders as well.\nBastion.\nA bastion is a wedge shaped, angled wall, designed to deflect cannon fire. In Minecraft though, these are purely decorative and unneeded.\nTapered wall.\nWhile the walls of an ordinary house can safely have the same thickness all the way up, the walls of grander buildings such as castles, cathedrals and other such structures should be thicker at the base and thinner higher up, as this increases stability and reduces the load on the lower parts of the wall.\nEmbrasure.\nIf a wall is partly hollowed out from the inside, this is known as an \"embrasure\". Embrasures may be used as a site for arrow slits, or to broaden the opening around an arch or doorway.\nInterior walls.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"%23Parts%20of%20an%20interior%20wall\"&gt;separate section&lt;/a&gt; for interior walls which describes the features most often found on them.\nButtresses.\nA \"buttress\" is a reinforcing structure that prevents a wall from bowing outwards and collapsing. They are a common feature on large, ancient buildings, where they counteract the lateral forces caused by roof structures designed without enough horizontal bracing. \nOn dams and &lt;a href=\"%23Retaining%20wall\"&gt;retaining walls&lt;/a&gt; the term \"counterfort\" may be used instead.\nFlying buttress.\nA \"flying buttress\" is an external wall support consisting of a normal buttress some distance away from the wall it is supporting, and an arched \"flyer\" connecting the two and transmitting the supporting forces.\nRemedial buttress.\nA buttress which is not part of a building's design, but which was added later to prop up a wall in danger of collapse may be termed a \"remedial buttress\".\nParts of an interior wall.\nIn modern times, many people still know what these parts of a wall are called, but there is much less appreciation of what they were originally for. As modern houses have damp-proof courses and are made of very uniform, mass-produced materials, some of the old practical reasons these features exist no longer apply. The main reason we still have them is becoming a matter of custom and aesthetics rather than actual need. The following features are listed from the floor upwards:\nCould you have all of these different features on one wall?\nThe answer is no, not normally. While most combinations are possible you should normally choose 1\u22124 possibilities and use those consistently throughout a design. However, a particularly large and grand room could use more. The picture shows a made of dark wood and a made of quartz; you can identify coving, panelling and skirting boards, and the presence of a chair rail and a picture rail are implied by the trapdoor/oak wood and oak wood/quartz borders.\nOther wall decoration styles.\nIn addition to the wall elements described above, which all have a historical basis, there are many other ways to liven up a dull building. A plain wall of any material is boring. This is fine if you have detail in other parts of your construction, or if you want a modern or utilitarian feel, such as for a warehouse or a factory. Plain walls have the virtue that they won't distract from whatever else you have built, whereas a 'busy' wall might. However, if there are large areas in the building where you can see nothing of interest but the wall, even some simple decoration will help a lot."}

{"id": "187185", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=187185", "title": "Tutorials/Warden farming", "text": "The &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most dangerous mobs in Minecraft, however they are the only renewable way to farm &lt;a href=\"sculk%20catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt;s. This tutorial shows the player how to farm the warden.\nWhy bother?\nWardens, despite being dangerous, drop a sculk catalyst when killed. The sculk catalyst can produce sculk blocks, veins, shriekers and sensors, but they cannot produce itself, therefore wardens are the only way to renewably farm sculk catalysts, which can be very useful for mob farms that kill mobs via fall damage or any other form that don't yield XP. \nSpawning requirements.\nWardens can be spawned only by naturally generated &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Shrieker\"&gt;sculk shriekers&lt;/a&gt;, which can be exclusively found in &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Sculk shriekers generated by catalysts or placed down by players do not spawn wardens. Wardens can spawn in any 1\u00d73\u00d71 block space in a 11\u00d713\u00d711 box centered around a naturally generated sculk shrieker. Wardens do not spawn if a warden is within a 48 block area centered around the sculk shrieker, and wardens do not spawn on slabs and stairs. Shriekers spawn wardens only after the player has gained 4 warnings, which can be obtained by alerting shriekers. Shriekers shriek for 4.5 seconds and have a 10 second cooldown after each shriek. The easiest way to activate a shrieker is to stand on top of it and wait. Wardens spawn based on 20 attempts in the spawnable area, meaning that wardens can be prevented from spawning by warden-proofing certain areas on a spawning platform.\nMechanics.\nLoud sounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Pistons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Note%20Block\"&gt;note blocks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bell\"&gt;bells&lt;/a&gt; linked to redstone clocks are overall the best method to move Wardens, horizontally. These can be used to lure Wardens into kill chambers, pitfalls and bubble column elevators.\nBubble column.\nWardens can be moved out of the non-spawning radius of a sculk shrieker using bubble columns, which then allow more wardens to spawn. &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;Soul sand&lt;/a&gt; can move wardens upward and &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt; columns can move wardens downward.\nMethods of killing.\nThe best way to kill wardens is to use . The default entity cramming limit is 24, and when there are more entities in a single block than the limit, any entities and players that fall in take damage. Hypothetically, can also be used to kill wardens, though wardens have extremely high HP and it would take a very long time to kill a single warden. Wardens could also die to dropped &lt;a href=\"Pointed%20Dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; or fall damage, though the latter is less effective due to the warden's high HP. \nLoot collection.\nPlacing &lt;a href=\"Hopper\"&gt;hoppers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;hopper minecarts&lt;/a&gt; feeding into chests is the best method to collect sculk catalysts dropped from wardens.\nAFK chamber.\nThe only way to automatically summon wardens is to stand on top of the sculk shrieker that the farm is based around. There is no reason to wall off the AFK chamber as Wardens can detect and attack players through walls, and most farms move the wardens before they could target players."}

Water gates are adjustable gates used to control water flow by either shrinking the stream, or by stopping it altogether. They can be made quite easily with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt;.\nWater gate.\nConstruction.\n \nThere are three parts to a water gate: The water source, the water channel, and the gate. The water source provides the water. The water source can be a lake, ocean, pond, or even just a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; dumped at the beginning of the channel. The channel is a small trench that guides the water where you want it to go. The gate itself is a device made of &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s that blocks the water flow. \nTo create a water gate, the first thing to do is to create the channel. This can be done by digging it out of the ground or by placing walls on the ground. The gate is simply two pistons facing into the channel that, when extended, occupy the channel and prevent water from flowing. &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20piston\"&gt;Sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s with an additional block stuck to them can be used for wider channels. Also, for a channel only 1-block wide, just one piston will work fine. The pistons are then wired to a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; signal that controls when they are on or off. The signal is commonly a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, so that when it is on the pistons extend, and when it is off they retract.\nUses.\nThere are a few things you can do with a &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; gate. One of the most useful ways to use a water gate is to harvest crops by channeling the flow of water over your mature crop and it will automatically pick your crops for you. By channeling the water, you can also designate a pickup area for the already harvested crops. Water gates could also be useful for &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; traps, water elevators, and safe passages up and down a cliff side.\nFlood gate.\nRequirements.\nThe purpose of floodgates are similar to that of water gates, but they are constructed differently. They are made using 4 types of items.\nGates\nSwitches\nActivators\nWalls\nOptional\nConstruction.\nBasic Structure.\nFirst, start out with the basic structure. Start making the wall. Only have it 1 block high for now, you can build it up higher later. Leave 4 or 9 blocks high, and 2 or 5 blocks wide depending on how big you want your actual gate to be.\u00a0\nThe Canal.\nDig 1 block down where you want the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; path. This can be used for a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; system, farm system, irrigation system, etc.\nLogic.\nMake a control panel. It can be on a wall, or 1-2 block high control stand. For 1 block high, place the &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; on top, for 2 blocks high put the lever or &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; on the side on the top block. Now, where you left space for the doors, place your &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt; where you left space."}
{"id": "3554", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3554", "title": "Tutorials/Water ladder", "text": "Water ladders were structures to facilitate quick climbing in a strictly vertical manner. The accessible portion of this structure was a 1\u00d71 shaft, but if created above ground would require 3\u00d73 blocks of horizontal space. \nStructure.\nThe ladder is essentially two shafts separated by a wall. At the top of the second shaft, a water source block is placed. The &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s are placed every other block. However the placement here is important; the first ladder must be placed in front of the hole leading to the water source block.\nFor every two blocks dug down, dig two blocks over and then one up to connect the water shaft. Place ladders in front of all of these openings to stop the water from flowing out into the ladder shaft.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.5\"&gt;Beta 1.5&lt;/a&gt;, you are now required to look at the corner between the water and the ladders to even go up the water ladder, and the bottom of the ladder now requires three consecutive ladders without a gap. Going up a water ladder is slightly slower than before, but it's still significantly faster than regular ladders.\nLadders vs. signs.\nIt has been noted that this can be achieved by placing &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s in front of the water outlets as well, but if the water is ever stopped, you can't climb signs back out.\nAnother reason to use ladders rather than signs is resource efficiency. It costs 7 &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s to make three ladders, or 1.17 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; for one, while a sign is comprised of 2.16 planks. Ladders also stack in larger bunches in your inventory, so you can carry more of them, or have more room for other gear (64 of ladders versus 16 of signs).\nHowever, transport down is faster when using signs, one can simply fall down the shaft and then land on a pool at the bottom. When using ladders, you'll have to climb down.\nHidden water ladder.\nIt was possible to make a hidden water ladder, but this was also affected by the Beta 1.6 bug-fix. To construct one, build your water shaft normally except put dirt or cobblestone where you would normally put the ladder. Then, move one space sideways, and dig a shaft upwards there. Face the corner where the water is and press up. Voila! Now hide your water source blocks and you're done. Using his method you can remove the usage of signs or ladders, but also makes it difficult (not impossible) to go downwards without damaging yourself, so this type is ideal for one-way up shafts. The other downside is that it only works when it is facing southwest (user facing the ladder).\nVideos.\nThere are a couple videos featuring the speed of a water ladder and also the creation of one."}
{"id": "14385", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14385", "title": "Tutorials/Water tram", "text": "The Water Tram is a fast travel creation which consists of streams of water flowing in the direction you wish to travel. Water trams are usually created using &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s. Since water flows in both directions, the pressure plates are necessary to break the water up into streams flowing only in the direction you wish to travel. Since the introduction of &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; travel, this method has become somewhat obsolete, as boats travel much faster on ice than in currents.\nConstruction.\nTo build the tram, first place two lines to contain the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; with at least two blocks of space between them. Next, at the beginning of the lines, place buckets of water stretching between the lines. At the end of the flow of water or somewhere before, place &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s to prevent a backwards flow. Right after the pressure plates, place more water and repeat until it becomes as long as wanted. Refer to the photo if you get confused. Making two parallel trams in opposite directions can allow easy two-way transportation. The pressure plates can be connected to &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; circuitry and act as motion sensors.\nPressure plate frequency.\nThe ideal frequency of pressure plates is unknown. The following paragraph contains some outdated information which may still be relevant. Note that boats are much more durable now and will not easily break when hitting a pressure plate or other block.\nThe best setup is to have 5 water blocks per section (1 source + 4 flowing); any more than that and your boat will hit the side of a pressure plate and break. It's also the fastest, traveling at about 7.7 blocks per second (192 blocks in 25 seconds) - 35% faster than sprinting, and without the hunger drain. If signs are used instead of pressure plates, sections can have up to 7 water blocks, but this does not significantly increase speed, and requires more resources. Making the sides of the road out of pressure plates as well is recommended; boats will break if they hit full or half blocks.\nWall materials.\nBy using &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone%20wall\"&gt;cobblestone wall&lt;/a&gt;s for both sides, it is possible to make water trams that have a one-wide water stream. This uses less pressure plates, but is really a matter of opinion.\nVideo.\nThis video shows the construction of a water tram, but it is very likely outdated, because it was made in 2010.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//m.youtube.com/%23/watch%3Fv%3DCGanG2KkAkw\"&gt;Random2251's version&lt;/a&gt;"}

Nether vines can also make a good aesthetic use for some builds and can be useful for hubs in the Nether, since there are no bubble elevators and nether vines are cheaper than ladders in most cases, and faster. Nether vines can be used to break your fall in the Nether if you have not acquired powder snow yet.\nManual farming.\nManual farming is very simple.

{"id": "56228", "revid": "48068652", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=56228", "title": "Tutorials/Witch farming", "text": "This tutorial is about farming &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es to get their incredibly diverse loot.\nPurpose.\nWitches are hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that drop all kinds of &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;. Their normal drops are &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s. The sticks are dropped twice as often as the others. Players can cause a witch to drop the &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; they are currently using, usually &lt;a href=\"instant%20health\"&gt;instant health&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; enchantment increases the chances and output of each drop. \nMechanics.\nWitches &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; as part of normal hostile mob spawning, exclusively in &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;s, as part of pillager &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s, or when &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;. They have 26 &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, which is higher than the typical hostile mob. They can regenerate their health and throw potions to attack. The best way to farm them is to kill them instantly, since working with player kills can end up being time-consuming.\nIn mob spawning, witches spawn individually at &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; 0. They do not spawn that often, and it is more worthwhile to allow witches to spawn alongside other mobs in a traditional hostile &lt;a href=\"mob%20farm\"&gt;mob farm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn witch huts, witches are the only mobs that are able to spawn in the small area around a hut. Witch huts are one of the best places to farm witches, but they require spawning platforms and light levels of 7 or lower. One single witch hut can support a maximum of three spawning platforms. Witch huts spawn in swamp biomes, but the witch-exclusiveness depends on the entire hut being inside a &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, the player can be extraordinarily lucky and have up to 4 witch huts within 128 blocks of a central point. This allows for 4 witch huts to be active at the same time.\nIn pillager raids, it is more worthwhile to simply build a pillager farm and deal with witches as they spawn. If they are spawned in a pillager raid, they may throw regeneration potions to the other illagers.\nWitches can be artificially spawned using a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt;. A villager breeder can provide the villagers, so when a thunderstorm comes around, the player can strike them with lightning and kill them to get their loot.\nDesigns.\nAll of these designs work with witch huts, since they are the most efficient way to farm witches.\nBedrock Edition.\nThis Witch is has remained functional since creation. All tweaks required are in the comment section.\nSimple.\nThis design originally comes from FastJaz. This simple design uses a minimum of redstone resources and is relatively cheap to build. The farm itself requires the following (Regardless of killing method used):\nThe Entity Cramming Grinder Requires:\nThe Looping Fall Damage Grinder Requires:\nPreparation.\nThe basic design starts as most Witch farms do, marking out the spawning platforms. Start 1 block below the lowest Witch hut blocks, which will be log blocks that mark the corners of the hut, and place 1 of your building blocks of choice on each corner exactly 1 block diagonally away from the log blocks towards the outside of the hut. Space the next spawn platform two blocks above the first and put permanent corner blocks there. Do the same thing for the third spawn platform. Due to the spawning mechanics of Witch huts you cannot place any more spawning platforms. Now that you have the basic corners of each spawn platform, carefully take down the witch hut proper with your axe and pickaxe. If you knock out any of the spawning area corner blocks by mistake, as long as the bottom-most one is there, you can measure and replace them easily. Once the Witch hut is taken down you are left with the markers for the Witch hut spawnable area for Witches. Remove 4 blocks around the hut's original area down to the level of the first level of the farm to make space for the farm's circuitry. This will make things easier to work with later. \nSpawn Platforms and Flushing System.\nConnect the four corner blocks of the first spawnable level with your building block of choice and fill in that platform with your block of choice. On only one of the 9 block faces of the spawning platform, which will become the \"back\" of the farm, place an extra row of blocks on the same level as your existing spawnable area. Mark one block above that area on either side of the 9 blocks you just placed and place one block each side, then place another row of blocks 1 block behind and upward from the 9 block row you just placed so there is a trough that water can flow from the trough to the end of the spawnable platform. Next, put trapdoors on all 9 blocks that are on the same level as the spawnable level and close them so that when you put water in, it will not flood the area. Put your two water buckets in with a space in between so all three will become water source blocks. Repeat this process with one water bucket after the initial source to fill up the trough. Extend the two blocks you put on the sides of the trough until they are at the same block as the corner of the spawnable area you made earlier. Count 1 block away from the trough on the sides you just completed and place one block diagonally outward from the initial wall. This should look like an L shape on the left side of the farm and a backwards L on the right side of the farm with the temporary block you placed to assist the process. Repeat the wall process again, drawing out both those blocks that you just placed in a straight line to the end of the spawnable platform. Place your tripwire hooks on the second block up from the spawning floor that now appears recessed. Then place your string so that the tripwire hooks are connected. Place a row of blocks on top of the tripwire hooks on every layer except the top layer where you will place slabs. Place blocks on top of the trough to seal it. Choose one side of the tripwire hooks to become the trigger side of the farm. Place Redstone dust on top of the block that the tripwire hooks are connected to and continue until you get to each end. On the end block, place a Redstone torch. Extend the back row of trough blocks so that Redstone dust placed there would connect to the Redstone torch. Finally place Redstone dust on the blocks you placed for the back of the trough and connect it up to the Redstone torch using the new blocks you placed. \nThe Other Spawn Platforms.\nSpawn Platform two is identical to the first platform. Repeat the above process. Spawn plaform three is also identical except to leave the blocks that cover the tripwire hooks off. For spawn platform three you should cover the tripwire hooks and the row of blocks above the waterlogged trap doors with slabs. Continue to the end of the spawnable area. Then, count one block inward from the outermost slab on the front of the farm and place a slab in front of that. Do the same thing on the other side of the farm. Repeat this process from both sides and you should have a two block wide overhang of slab blocks.\nThe Trench (Getting the Mobs into a 1x1 area).\nDig a trench 2 deep by 9 wide and 1 long. Place water source blocks at either end of the trench. Where the sources meet put 1 sign to prevent the water from flowing downward.\nThe Entity Minecart Grinder Tutorial.\nOne Option for grinding Witches is to use 24 Minecarts as an entity crammer trap. The downside is that Minecarts, especially 24 of them updating when the witches get killed create a lot of noise. In order to make this form of grinder, dig straight down 4 blocks and hollow out 4 blocks ahead of you to create a 2 tall, 4 block long corridor. Hollow everything except the block directly under the water streams by one block downward and place a rail on the block left behind. Place all 24 minecarts, then a full block in front of the rails so the minecarts cannot escape when the farm is closed up. Take the block underneath the block with the rail and 24 minecarts on it out. Dig 2 blocks down on every block except for the one where the 24 minecarts are now resting. Place the chests one block away and two blocks below the one that is holding the minecarts above. Place another rail on the hopper and a slab on each side of the rail. Place the hopper minecart on the rail. Place an upside down stair in front of the rail and there you have it.\nThe Tube style Fall Grinder Tutorial.\nThe other option for grinding Witches is a tube style fall trap. This removes the noisy minecarts, but at the cost of being able to see the sometimes ugly pipeline the witches go through before they take their fall and die. To make this grinder, dig 4 blocks straight down and dig out the bottom most block on the two tall pair facing the front of the farm. Place one water source there and hollow out 2 tall openings for three blocks ahead of you facing away from the farm. Put two signs and then hollow out two tall area 1 block in front of those signs. Dig 1 block straight down after the signs and put the soul sand in its place. Dig 32 blocks upward, adding water source blocks as you go, if you encounter the surface, put blocks around you until you reach 32 blocks. Then put 5 more blocks in front of you, facing away from the farm and encase the area with your building block of choice in a 2 high fashion so witches can get through and without drowning. Place a water source block on the 32nd block so water flows until the end of the 5 blocks you placed earlier. Break the 5th block and ride the water down to the surface. Place four blocks approximately where the bottom of the water column is and ride the water upward. On the 4th side block of the pipe's \"elbow\" section, use a sign to cut the water off. Ride the water blade downward to the land. Close up the pipe to the surface except for a two tall area to get back in. Make sure you count the blocks from that 32nd block downward to let you know how many more blocks you need to dig downward. If you did this right, you should only need to dig down 4 blocks below the surface to make a 32 block drop for the Witches. On the 4th block Hollow out a 3 long tunnel away from the farm and dig one down for all blocks except the one that should be 32 blocks down from the elbow part of the pipeline. Make sure you replace the two blocks on the surface you needed to get into the pipe earlier. Place a double chest sideways on and then take out the 32nd block and then take a hopper and put it in its place, place a carpet on top of the hopper to prevent witches from falling directly into the hopper. Close the pipe up, Hollow out the area around the chest, light it up and you should be good.\nClosing up the farm, spawn-proofing and the AFK Room.\nLook around the farm for any bare and exposed blocks without Redstone dust on it and that are not holes in the farm's structure. If you did the job right with your layers, you should have no air gaps between layers and only the front of the farm to seal up. For all exposed full blocks, place any kind of button on top of the block to prevent spawning there. Once all 18 buttons are put in their places, go to the front of the farm and seal it up with your building block of choice. It should be a tight seal where there is no light peaking in the farm. Also make sure that the building blocks line up with the slabs on the roof.\nOnce the farm is closed up you need to figure out where to set your AFK room. This is to ensure the highest amount of spawns and drops from the Witches without having to clear out a perimeter. This can be best found by finding the block above the upside down stairs and recording the Y value using the F3 Debug screen and looking at the coordinates of the \"looking at block\" space, when you hover over the block in question. If you are using the Tube style grinder, The hopper itself is the target you need to find the Y value coordinates. Finally add 128 to that Y value and create an accessible AFK room at that exact resulting Y coordinate number. For best results it is better to put your AFK hut in the middle of your farm so the spawning circle will be most effective at that farm.\nSelective flush design.\nThis design by xisumavoid uses &lt;a href=\"tripwire%20hook\"&gt;tripwire hook&lt;/a&gt;s to detect when a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; spawns and flush it off with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike some other designs, this one only flushes part of the platform. As &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es cannot &lt;a href=\"mob%23spawning\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; in water, this makes the design slightly more efficient.\nShifting floors design.\nThis design by ilmango uses &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s to cause the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es to fall through the floor. This has an advantage over water flush designs as the movement of the floors completes more quickly than the movement of water.\nTripwire shifting designs.\nThis design by JL2579 also uses shifting floors, but the design for the floors is outdated and no longer works. However, it should be possible to take design aspects from the previous video to make it work again. The use of &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt; to immediately shift the floor helps to ensure that the mob cap doesn't limit the efficiency of the farm. The video also provides recommendations for lighting caves to empty the mob cap further.\nNote that the information in the video to transport the drops upwards is out of date; for alternatives see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Item%20transportation%23vertical%20transportation\"&gt;item transportation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis other design is by ilmango, and it combines tripwire shifting design and the traditional shifting floor design (in case there is a problem with the tripwire shifting)."}
{"id": "88833", "revid": "54086488", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=88833", "title": "Tutorials/Wither cage", "text": "This tutorial seeks to teach you, the player, how to build a wither cage. A wither cage is a contraption to keep a wither in one location so that its block-breaking abilities can be harnessed in a controllable way.\nIdea.\nThe idea is to trap a wither in an inescapable room. Withers can shoot skulls, which break certain blocks. If they are damaged in any way, they can break nearly all blocks around them. No matter the cage, the wither can escape if it is not built correctly, or if the chunks reload and inaccurately place the wither. One small change in positioning can end up with a wither on the loose, which could wreak havoc on its surroundings.\nTrapping a Wither.\nTrapping the wither is often the most difficult process, but it is possible in all dimensions. This part of the tutorial is designed to keep the wither in one place. The best way to guarantee safety is to cleverly use the natural bedrock formations. The player can also &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Breaking%20bedrock\"&gt;break bedrock&lt;/a&gt; to make the formation desirable.\nOverworld.\nThis cage cannot remain stable if the wither is damaged.\nThe bottom five layers of the Overworld terrain is full of bedrock formations. Bedrock is unbreakable with explosions, so it is ideal to ensure the wither does not escape. One would need to find a bedrock formation shown below. The soul sand and skulls show the way that the wither needs to be constructed.\nBefore the wither is spawned, a piston needs to be placed facing down, above the \u201ctail\u201d of the wither spawning formation, with one block of space between the soul sand and the piston. Summon the wither, and then power the piston with a button. As the piston retracts, place obsidian in the space where the piston arm was. This must be done quickly, or the wither might float upwards and escape.\nOnce the wither is trapped, the player must ensure that the wither never gets damaged. If it does, it can break the obsidian, float upwards, and escape the cage.\nNether.\nOn the top and bottom of the nether, there are five layers of bedrock formations. There is no advantage to putting the cage on the bottom layers of the Nether. However, the top layers offer more protection against the wither escaping, and it increases the possibilities for breaking blocks.\nThe cage must be placed in a bedrock ceiling formation that looks like the blueprint below. The negative layers show what should go below the layer above it, since the player would likely be building this from the top down.\nThe wither can be safely spawned and allowed to float up. This way, the obsidian is never in range to be broken when the wither is damaged. This Nether design also has the benefit that if the wither escapes through the bedrock, it would end up above the bedrock ceiling. Unless the player built something above the bedrock, that wither will not cause problems, although it will likely never be seen again.\nBreaking Blocks.\nThe wither has two methods of block-breaking that can be utilized by the player.\nSkulls.\nThere are two types of skulls that the wither shoots: black skulls which come from the side heads, and blue skulls which come from the center head. Black skulls are able to destroy weak blocks like wood and dirt. Blue skulls are able to destroy stronger blocks like stone and iron blocks. In most designs that work with skulls, some of the heads are intentionally \u201cdistracted\u201d by other mobs. Keep in mind that the wither can sometimes hit itself with its own black skulls, which could cause unwanted block breaking.\nDamaging the Wither.\nDamaging the wither will cause it to break all the blocks in its hit box, including obsidian. This is why bedrock was used to trap the wither. The wither can be damaged in several ways, including getting hit by any projectile, explosions, suffocation. Suffocation and being hit by a projectile such as a snowball are the most common methods of harnessing this destructive ability. In fact, placing two &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Indestructible%20end%20crystals\"&gt;indestructible end crystals&lt;/a&gt; can be placed in front of the two side heads, which cause the skulls\u2019 explosions to damage the wither. Suffocation can cause problems because the pistons that push the blocks into the wither\u2019s suffocation line could end up pushing the wither out of the cage.\nDistracting the Wither.\nDistracting the wither in a safe way is critical for any wither cage. When the player moves around, it can allow the wither to escape. So, its three heads are often \u201cdistracted\u201d with various mobs. Placing a mob like an iron golem within two blocks of the wither\u2019s center head will prevent the launching of the dangerous blue skulls. The center head will look in the direction of that mob, independent of the other two heads.\nDistracting the other two heads depends on whether or not you want black skulls to be launched. The player can change the line of sight so that all three heads are distracted by the same mob. This prevents them from being launched entirely.\nIf the player wants the black (or blue) skulls to be launched, a mob must be placed between 3 and 10 blocks away. This is in the range to allow for skulls to be launched. Mixing the two techniques above gets a mob near the wither to distract the blue-skull-launching center head, and a mob farther away to make the black skulls launch. The tricky part is ensuring that line of sight is maintained, while preventing the skulls from hitting the mob it is targeting.\nDesigns.\nAn expensive wither cage utilizing a Shulker Box as a Head Lock, an ender chest to trick the wither and classically, cobblestone walls for a Ground Lock. Also comes with a piston hurting system.\nAnother very expensive wither cage that features a boat as a Head Lock, cobblestone walls as Ground Lock and indestructible end crystals as both a Fortification and hurting system.\nAn unstable, moving cage."}

{"id": "45188", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=45188", "title": "Tutorials/Wither skeleton farming", "text": "A wither skeleton farm is a mob grinder that involves creating a spawning pad inside a nether fortress, while removing all other mob spawning points nearby.\n&lt;a href=\"Wither%20skeleton\"&gt;Wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s have a chance to drop a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton%20skull\"&gt;wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt;, three of which are required to create a wither, which drops a nether star used to craft a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;. Wither skeletons also drop coal which meant this is also a coal farm, bones which can be turned into bonemeal and stone swords although there's not really much use to the swords.\nPreparation.\nIn Java Edition, you will need a variable amount of materials depending on the size of the grinder, but a small sized farm needs around:\n1. Begin by finding a nether fortress in the Nether, preferably with a large portion of the fortress over a lava ocean.\n2. Find and mark the bounds of the nether fortress chosen. Bounding boxes are only able to be made visible easily on Java edition.\n3. Destroy all of the platforms that make up the nether fortress to limit spawning. In vanilla, it's anything within a 250 \u00d7 250 area that's comprised of &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreation.\nA typical farm of this type usually means destroying all platforms on which the wither skeletons can spawn and replacing them with collection points (usually lines of blocks with pressure plates on them for pistons to push into a grinding point).\nBuilding the mob collectors.\n1. Create a line of a chosen building material (preferably cobblestone due to its common occurrence and resistance to &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;'s fire balls) from one end of the marked area to the other.\n2. Place pressure plates on the top of the line and redstone torches on one side of the line.\n3. Place a line of cobblestone on top of the redstone torches and then place another line of redstone torches on the outward side of that line.\n4. Place a third line of cobblestone on top of the second line and then place a line of sticky pistons that will push those above the first line of cobblestone.\n5. Place half slabs on top of the third line of cobblestone to prevent wither skeletons from spawning on top of the collectors instead of inside them.\nNote: In 1.16, &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s naturally attack &lt;a href=\"Wither%20Skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, and vice versa. You can use this to make an auto collector.\nGrinding Point.\nAfter the mob collectors have been made correctly and wither skeletons are being spawned, you will need to make a bucket shape of cobblestone under the collector so that all spawned mobs are at one main point. This can easily be achieved using the remaining cobblestone by making a tube from the collectors to the area chosen for grinding. Once the mobs are at the grinding point they can all be killed in one area simplifying collection and speeding up the whole process.\nVwoop's Design.\nThis design uses the ability to extend the nether brick platform of the farm area and spawn proofing the rest of the area, which allows more mobs to spawn in the area, allowing it to yield over 75 wither skulls per hour. It is designed on Bedrock Edition but can also be used on Java with it yielding about the same amount of drops, as long as you replace the trident killer with an entity cramming machine.\nThis farm does not work well below 1.16, however it does work on both 1.16 and 1.17.\nMikecraft\u2019s Design.\nThis design guarantees that the wither skeletons will drop their skulls 100% of the time, making for a very efficient grinder, however it requires a charged creeper. It is again primarily designed for Bedrock Edition but works on Java as well, however it is worth noting that only one head can be dropped per group of wither skeletons.\nThis does not work in versions previous to 1.13 Java, and 1.4 Bedrock due to lack of tridents.\nKkinders Method.\nIn this method you use an iron golem to lure wither skeletons into a falling trap. This trap can be upgraded with pistons to push wither skeletons through a portal and then be blown up by a charged creeper. This is a very cheap method but only gets about 5 skulls an hour but with the modifications it can get a skull every minute. It is meant to be used as an alternative to grinding for skulls and not meant for killing the wither multiple times. This method is for all platforms but the modifications with the charged creeper is more effective on bedrock edition.\nOther Addons.\nYou may want to add a cage of some sort around the farm to prevent ghasts from blowing up the structure during collection. As well as that, most wither skeletons only drop &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s and only when they are killed by a player or a tamed wolf is a wither skeleton skull dropped.\nAutomatic and AFK-able designs.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, one can make an automatic wither skeleton farm by having the player stand nearby. As long as the wither skeletons cannot reach the wolves, there is no chance of the wolves dying.\nXisumavoid's Design.\nThis design uses slime block machines to push mobs off the spawning platforms, sort them, and grind them.\nRay's Works's Design.\nThis design uses &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s' enormous hit box to push mobs off the spawning platforms.\nRay's Works's Design (Video tutorial by Shulkercraft).\nThis 2020 Java 1.16.4 design uses a spawn platform in the nether with wither roses and a piglin to attract them into a drop down chute."}

They can also help you find &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; rooms once you are near a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. If you are in the Nether, you can use x-ray glitches to locate &lt;a href=\"fortresses\"&gt;fortresses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bastions\"&gt;bastions&lt;/a&gt;.\nMake sure that you're allowed to use this glitch in servers, though. For most servers, this can count as cheating because you can see the surroundings for mobs, loot chests or precious ores. If others catch you cheating, they can forbid you to do something or even ban you off the server.\nGeneral approach.\nFor time efficiency, the game only renders block surfaces if there is a transparent block between the surface and the player. For this purpose, transparent generally means that the player can see through the block, although &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; is also transparent for this purpose. \nNormally, the camera is inside a transparent block, unless the player is suffocating, in which case the game renders blocks differently. However, it is possible for the camera to be inside a block, but the game does not register that the player is inside. In this case, the player \"x-rays\" through blocks immediately in the front.\nJava Edition.\nComposter and gravity block method.\nThis method works by putting the player into the &lt;a href=\"Crawling\"&gt;crawl animation&lt;/a&gt; using a &lt;a href=\"Falling%20Block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt; while inside of a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/yjSJIctdB50\"&gt;Lewis&lt;/a&gt;\nThe method requires the following:\nTo execute the glitch, simply position yourself inside of a composter and place the falling block above your head so it falls on top of the composter and puts you into the crawl position. It might be easier to see underground spaces if you dig a 1x1 hole downwards a few blocks before placing a composter down at the bottom and executing the glitch there.\nBedrock Edition.\nPiston and slab method.\nThis method works by pushing a &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; into the player's head. Since slabs are partial blocks, the game does not consider the player to be inside a block. This trick has two main variants: One for looking upward and one for looking downward.\nTo x-ray upward, you need the following:\nIt is recommended to have multiple slabs, so you can see more. The main setup is as follows, where everything is at head height:\nAgain, you may wish to surround your head with top slabs wherever possible, to maximize visibility. When you are ready, activate the lever, and the glitch will begin almost immediately.\nTo x-ray downward, you need the following:\nTo set this up, start with the same setup as before, but place 2 pistons (1 at head height and one at foot height). The lower piston has a solid block in front, while the upper piston has a bottom slab. Surround yourself with additional blocks, with slabs on top, to maximize visibility. After you pull the lever, the x-ray glitch does not happen yet. Therefore, you can destroy the redstone, including the pistons, and surround yourself further. For the location that was the piston head, placing the full block is tricky, as you cannot look at a suitable surface. Instead, place the sand above where you want it to land, then place the slab as normal. When you are ready to trigger the glitch, enter sneak mode, and your eyes will lie below the top of the slab.\nFalling snow method.\nThis method works by gravity-affected blocks landing at the player's feet and piling up to the player's eye level. It can only be used to x-ray downward. You need the following materials:\nTo begin, dig a 1-deep hole, and surround it with bottom slabs. Place a solid block above the hole, high enough that you can walk underneath. Next, place the sand on top, then stack the snow. Finally, stand in the hole, break the block, and enter sneaking.\nChain-lava method.\nThis method allows you to X-ray through a lava sea in the Nether.\nAll you need to do is place the chains sideways and you're done.\nPig method.\nAnother X-ray hack allows you to ride a pig in a 1 1/2 block high space. Place top slabs one block up from the floor, then ride a pig beneath them. This should glitch you into the ceiling. The only challenge about this hack is getting a pig down to the bedrock layer (which is most effective). It is easy to just push the pig down a shaft into a water landing at the bottom."}

You don't want to punch the wolves by accident. If you do, they will become hostile. You will need to find some animals in a couple of minutes. Take note if there isn't any water in sight.\nAchievements\nMinute Two.\n 2:00\u20132:10\nThe next step after finding wood is to make a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;. If you have not found trees yet (or a village) keep moving until you do. If you have not found either after 5 minutes, you should stop and make a basic shelter (see next section). \nTo make a crafting table, you will first need to open your inventory by pressing . Put one piece of log anywhere in the 2\u00d72 crafting slot and you will see near the top of your inventory. In the output box to the right of that, you will see 4 &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;. Take the planks, and put 1 in each slot of the crafting area. The output should now be a crafting table.\nPut the crafting table anywhere in your hotbar (the 9 slots at the bottom of your inventory), and place it down with a right-click, and right-click again to open it.\n 2:10-3:00\nMake a wooden &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; and a wooden &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. First, you will need to make sticks. (1 log = 4 planks = 8 sticks) This will let you get cobblestone and progress to better tools. \nYou should also make a boat if you're still on an island with very limited resources, which can be crafted with 5 planks.\nAdvancements\nAchievements\nMinute Three.\n 3:00\u20134:00\nDig down or into hills using your fist on the &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and then use the pickaxe to gather at least 19 blocks of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, which will drop as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; when mined. This cobblestone will enable you to build your first tools and a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis hole can be your first basic shelter if you want, so pick a suitable place. Remember to never mine straight down. Once you have stone tools, you will be able to explore caves, so be on the lookout for a cave opening. These are quite easy to find, occurring in every biome, and contain &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt;s, which give resources and are very useful. However, do not venture far into one this early in the game. If you see a monster in one, retreat right away, sealing the passage between you and the monster with basic blocks (dirt, etc.) as you currently don't have any weapons or armor.\nOnce you have cobblestone, place your crafting table again (if you moved it) and use it to make a stone &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; (Surprisingly, this item deals more damage ), a stone &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, and a stone &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;. You may have to convert more wood into sticks.\nIt never hurts to get more wood, so try to have at least 10 logs for the night. It's okay if you don't get enough. you can collect more in the morning.\nBreak the crafting table, collect it, and remember your spawn point. You can use the coordinates from the F3 menu and/or take a screenshot.\nAdvancements\nAchievements\nMinute Four.\n 4:00\u20135:00\nNow that you have a sword (or axe on &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;), you could start killing excess animals with it (any animals in excess of 2 of each type), and then collecting their drops, although food will not be a problem until your third day. When collecting meat exactly six of the same type is best for efficient &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;. Go after sheep if they're available because they drop wool, which is needed for a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, and also give &lt;a href=\"mutton\"&gt;mutton&lt;/a&gt; for food. If you see a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; then generally don't kill it. Leave it alone for now \u2014 it only drops leather which is useless before you have access to enchanting, and taming it is pointless until you find a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;. Don't waste your time if you are behind. Don't bother attacking &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, as they don't have any item drops, are rather dangerous if you attack when starting out, and can be tamed into dogs that will protect you using bones dropped by skeletons. If you are lucky enough to run into &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, then don't kill them either, or even scare them away, as they can scare away &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and can also be tamed with raw fish. Also, always make sure to leave at least 2 of every animal, so that you can breed them for later.\nTry to find &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; and a place for your first shelter. Hillsides are best for both. If you do not see coal, collect some more logs (and craft an axe if you skipped that earlier). If you are planning to grow crops at this shelter site, ensure there is &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nAdvancements\nMidday.\nMinute Five.\n 5:00\u20136:00\nLook for a hill or mountain near your pillar, as it will let you easily make a shelter and give you resources along the way.\nIf you see &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, kill 3 of them, all the same color, to gather 3 blocks of wool (to make a bed). If you want to have an easier time later on by breeding sheep, leave at least 2 sheep alive. (It is still advised to kill sheep whenever you find them until you have three blocks of the same color of wool to make a bed, since a bed is extremely important and extra sheep can usually be found by exploring further.)\nMinute Six.\n 6:00\u20137:00\nDig into that hill, or if you're in flat terrain into the ground. Don't get fancy if there isn't any water (or land), animals, or trees in sight because you won't be using it for more than one night. (An especially desperate shelter is a 3\u00d71 hole in the ground with one block covering the top.) If you find a village, you could stay in one of its houses. Be careful if you are on easy to hard difficulty, as you may have to deal with &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s if you are in a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinute Seven &amp; Eight.\n 7:00\u20139:00\nBuild a basic shelter (worry about the size and looks later, focus on functionality). For now, build it with &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;. If you have spawned in a desert biome (and collected sand during Minute One) &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; walls and &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; roof. \nIf you are in tundra and have a shovel, you can build with &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nAfter shelter, food, and a bed, your highest priority on day 1 is a source of light. With light, you can work usefully during your first night. Without it, it is possible but if you leave, mobs could spawn and anyways it will be hard to see what you are doing. \nIf you found and mined &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, craft some &lt;a href=\"torches\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt; to light up the shelter.\nIf you did not find &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, build a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; and make some &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; from wood logs. This is a higher priority than food, as you shouldn't get too hungry until later in the game. However, you should avoid excess sprinting and jumping.\nPlace the crafting table and make a furnace.\nMake your first charcoal (if needed) by smelting a log in a furnace.\nUse this charcoal to cook up to 8 more logs. You can keep using this method to get charcoal until you find coal ore. The charcoal will be used to make torches in the absence of coal (see the earlier torch recipe.) Make at least one batch of torches to keep your shelter lit at night, so you can work through the night. Make more batches if you plan on mining.\nMake some torches as per the preceding section. Once you have a source of light, you can stop worrying about the impending darkness and do other tasks all night long. \nEarlier, you hopefully collected some meat by killing animals \u2013 \"...at least three pieces of meat, exactly six is best.\" Now, it's time to cook it in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; with some planks:\nIf you spotted coal earlier, go and mine it while waiting for the meat to cook.\nA furnace batch always takes ten seconds to complete. Coal and charcoal last 80 seconds, and so do 8 batches. Planks last 15 seconds, so two can do three batches. This is consistent for all furnace recipes, even ones late in the game.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;Smelting&lt;/a&gt; for the details.\nIf you have additional wood, make a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20door\"&gt;wooden door&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s have the ability to break doors on hard mode, but if you are a beginner, you shouldn't be playing on hard mode anyway. Please keep this in mind when building your entrance/exit to your shelter. Place the door outside and place it on the outer side of the block of your entrance to the shelter.\nIf you are out of wood, just place a couple of cheap blocks in the doorway until morning. You can make a door tomorrow.\nAdvancements\nAchievements\nMinute Nine.\n 9:00\u201310:00\nGet ready for the night and craft a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; if you gathered wool. You will have to get three wool blocks of the same color.\nWhile you have this extra time, it would be a good idea to craft a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; to store unwanted and unnecessary items to carry around at all times such as seeds, eggs, leather, or extra food.\nMinute Ten.\n10:00\nGo to bed. If you have not gathered enough &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; to sleep in, or do not want to use one, first check to see if your base is secure (has all four walls, has a roof, a door or at least a blocked doorway, and ideally is lit). It is not recommended to add decorations to your house on the first day.\nIf you don't have enough wool (or wood) for a bed to sleep on, then, as long as you have a light source, you can use the night time more usefully by crafting or by starting to make a mine. From mines you can get lots of useful items such as &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;. Never dig straight down, as it is very dangerous. you could fall into a mob-filled cave, into lava, or fall into a large ravine. Mines are also a good way to find caves.\nIf you don't have enough coal or charcoal to make many torches for the mine, you can organize your items and house to make finding and moving easier, and do crafting (crafting is possible, though difficult, even in complete darkness). Also, if you managed to gather some leather (at least 4 pieces) by killing &lt;a href=\"cows\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, you might craft some &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt;. It's weak but better than nothing.\nAdvancements\nDusk.\nIf you decide to start making a mine, there are many methods to dig for resources. While a safe method would be simply to dig a large room, lighting it up as you dig while looking for ores, a more profitable (and risky) decision would be to look for a cave and start spelunking. If you decide to find and explore caves, a sword, food, enough wood (20 to 30 logs) and a light source (presumably &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es) are absolute necessities. If you come across any ore other than coal, or iron, get an iron pickaxe before you mine it, as using an inferior pickaxe will not only take longer to mine it, it will break the ore without dropping the resource. You will need ladders and a crafting table, just in case you find a good cave and decide to stay underground for long. \nIf you run short on food, you can survive on rotten flesh dropped by zombies, but it is not as nutritious and can poison you with hunger for 30 seconds. If you are living on rotten flesh, it is best to wait until the hunger bar is low and then eat multiple rotten flesh in quick succession, because the hunger penalty doesn't stack (If you do get hunger penalty, stay still to prevent hunger loss). \nBe prepared for hostile mobs, as it is a common but fatal mistake for starters to think that the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; spawns hostile mobs, and not &lt;a href=\"Mob%20spawning%23Mob%20spawning\"&gt;simply darkness&lt;/a&gt;. If you come back with enough iron, you will be able to experience many more features of Minecraft, mainly &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and much more. You have started on your path to your success in Minecraft, whether you have found iron or not.\nOther options.\nOne good idea is to chop an extra log and burn it for &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;. With practice, you can start a new game and as long as you are near trees when you spawn, you should be able to make basic tools, a furnace and have enough wood for torches before midday (codice_1).\nOften people would rather use up wooden tools before switching to your newly made stone tools, but the stone tools really are better \u2014 if you don't want to \"waste\" the wooden tools, you can use them as fuel to smelt single items.\nIf possible, and if you can spot a position where you would like to build a house when you spawn, try to gather the resources from nearby, and only dig where you would otherwise dig to construct your house to save time later. Replant all &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s (which have a chance of falling when tree leaves are mined) as soon as they fall if this is the case so that you have less distance to walk later.\nIf you are more adventurous, find an ocean. As soon as you have a lot of wood blocks, build the crafting table and wooden axe as above, then build 3 or 4 &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s and go sailing. Spend nights at sea while perusing the coastline for a nice place to make your base. Once you do, put ashore at dawn and proceed with the guidelines above.\nVideo.\n "}

{"id": "86696", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=86696", "title": "Tutorials/Zero-ticking", "text": "This tutorial seeks to teach the player how to make a redstone signal turn on and off in the same &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;, go over how this could be used, particularly with its uses on pistons.\nIntroduction.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Signals%20and%20pulses\"&gt;redstone signal&lt;/a&gt; is sent through a &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23Pulse%20limiter\"&gt;pulse limiter&lt;/a&gt;, it shortens the pulse. When the pulse is shortened enough, strange behaviors arise. If a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; is powered by a 2-&lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; pulse, it will start extending but after two ticks, the piston will drop its block and start retracting. If a sticky piston is powered by a 1-tick pulse, the same behavior will happen, but instead of happening after 2 ticks it will only happen after one tick.\nWhen a piston receives a pulse that turns on, and then off in the same tick, this is known as a 0-tick pulse. This will cause sticky pistons to instantly drop their block and start retracting.. Regular pistons will start retracting instantly when powered by a 0-tick pulse, but the block will not instantly teleport unlike sticky pistons. Because a 0-tick pulse turns on and off in the same tick, many 0-tick pulses will not render, but the pulse still exists. Due to how 0-tick pulses work, some 0-tick pulses are unable to bud-power pistons in some circumstances.\nZero-tick pulse generation.\nAll 0-tick pulses are created by powering a redstone line, and then using pistons to remove the power source later in the tick. \nOne method of doing so is using tile tick priorities. Since comparators are processed in a tick later than repeaters, one can generate a 0-tick pulse by powering a redstone line using this behavior. In this example, redstone repeater is used to power the output line, and a comparator is used to power a piston which will remove the block in front of repeater to depower the line. Since the comparator always powers after repeaters, the redstone line will always turn off after it turns on, creating a reliable 0-tick pulse. The advantage to this 0-tick generator is that it's 0-tick pulse is earlier in a tick relative to 0-tick pulses generated through other methods.\nAnother common method of generating 0-tick pulses is to use budded pistons. As budded pistons only retract when updated, this can be used to control which order pistons move and therefore controlling the order in which a redstone line is powered then unpowered. One example is to have a redstone line that directly powers a sticky piston and bud-powers two other sticky pistons. The piston directly powered by the redstone line will have a block on its face, and the last piston in the chain will have a redstone block on its face. A second redstone line will be at the bottom which is the output; it will be powered by the piston with a redstone block and is cut off by the solid block. When the redstone line on top is powered, nothing will happen. But when the input is depowered, then a 0-tick pulse is created. The redstone line will depower, but only cause the piston that is directly powered to start retracting. This will uncut the output line, turning it on. When this piston retracts it will then update the piston in the middle, causing that one to retract which will then cause the last piston to start retracting, which will remove power from the line.\nZero-tick chaining.\nWithin a tick, 0-tick pulses happen , but 0-tick pulses can happen after other 0-tick pulses while still being in the same tick. This is known as 0-tick chaining where two or more 0-tick pulses are activated in a row.\nOne method of 0-tick chaining is to utilize the fact that tileticks such as repeaters and comparators will process in a tick before block events such as piston extensions and retractions. In the shown example, when the input is powered, the quartz block will be 0-ticked by both pistons causing it to instantly move two blocks, ending up above the diamond block. The 0-tick generator to the right makes use of tileticks and will activate before the 0-tick generator on the left, which uses block events. This method of chaining is very compact, but it comes at a downside that this method can only be used once per chain.\nAnother method of chaining is to utilize the fact that update chains can be used to manipulate the order in which things are processed in a tick. In the shown example, there are two 0-tick generators. The one on the left has an update chain before powering it, while the one on the right is directly powered. When the input is depowered, the 0-tick generator on the right will activate first as it is directly powered causing its output piston to instantly drop its block. While this is happening, the update chain is retracting. Then, the 0-tick generator on the left will will activate causing its output piston to instantly drop its block.\nZero-tick repeaters.\nA regular redstone repeater can't be used to refresh the signal of a 0-tick pulse as they would extend the pulse to a length of 2 ticks. So one must use a 0-tick repeater. A 0-tick repeater works by receiving an input as a 0-tick pulse, which will 0-tick a redstone block that is inside of the 0-tick repeater. And right after that, the redstone block is 0-ticked back to it's original position. This can be used to repeat 0-tick signals, but one must note that they add block event delay.\nOne can also use 0-tick repeaters as a method of 0-tick chaining. This is possible because 0-tick repeaters add block event delay. 0-tick repeaters are very useful because they can be used to chain signals created by 0-tick clocks, as only 0-tick repeaters have the ability to reset fast enough.\nCreating a zero-tick clock.\nA 0-tick clock is made by putting two &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkBM7I6D59gI%26amp%3Bt%3D2208s\"&gt;0-tick block pushers&lt;/a&gt; facing each other and pushing a block between themselves, one line will appear on, while the other appears off, each has unique behavior, the \"off\" line is BUD-proof, while the \"on\" line allows for BUD pistons, and to set which is which, simply place a lever on the torch under the side you wish to be \"on\" and flip it twice, also this lever can turn it off. \nAnother thing to note is that if it is built right, the block WILL NOT seem to move while the piston heads will glitch through it, and the redstone lines WILL NOT pulse at all.\nUses of zero-ticking.\nSince a &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; does not react to a 0-tick pulse and the pulse will lose its effects if it goes through a &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;, most 0-tick uses involve &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt;. Pistons can be used to move blocks before the game has a chance to react as it normally would.\nEmbedding entities.\nNormally, when you power a sticky piston with a block on it towards an entity, and the entity has enough room to move, it will be pushed by the block. Zero-ticking a block places it over the space occupied by the entity without moving the entity. This can be used decoratively, e.g. creating 1-block glass 'display cases' with entities (mobs, armor stands) inside, or offensively, causing mobs to suffocate if using solid blocks, or in contraptions where you can overlay an armor stand and a solid block within the same space, e.g. for vertical signal transport using piston and tripwire, crossing with horizontal transport through the block. This can easily be done by placing a button on the side (not the back) of a piston. This will power the piston and the piston powering will instantly break the button causing a 0-tick pulse.\nFast block farms.\nFarms such as &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; farms, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; farms, and &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt; farms generate blocks. Using 0-tick pistons, one can create quick harvesting cycles, as well as quickly moving the blocks from the farm output into a TNT blast chamber or wither cage.\nZero-tick plant farms.\n\"These farms are patched and no longer function as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nZero-ticking allowed for incredibly fast farms of &lt;a href=\"Bamboo\"&gt;Bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;Cactus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chorus%20Plant\"&gt;Chorus Plant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kelp\"&gt;Kelp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20Cane\"&gt;Sugar Cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Vines\"&gt;Twisting Vines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Vines\"&gt;Weeping Vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe farms worked by exploiting certain buggy behavior. When the block supporting a plant is instantly replaced with another of the same block, the plant forcibly receives a &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;. Chorus Plants require only a single random tick to grow, plants like Cactus and Sugar Cane require 16 random ticks to grow, and still other plants react differently to random ticks. In essence, the exploit allows the plants to grow and be farmed at very high speeds for relatively low build cost.\nThe zero-tick plant growth exploit was observed October 2016 &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAr0Zve-AzeU\"&gt;by ToseRedstone.&lt;/a&gt; The corresponding bug was documented on the bug tracker February 2017. The bug was accidentally patched in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w06a\"&gt;18w06a&lt;/a&gt;, and it was officially patched in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w12a\"&gt;20w12a&lt;/a&gt; ahead of release &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt;."}

The rotten flesh and gold nuggets can be traded to cleric villagers in large amounts to gain emeralds easily.\nNether.\nTo construct a farm in the Nether, one can build platforms for zombified piglins to spawn on, with trapdoors on the edge, and place &lt;a href=\"slabs\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt; on the floors of all surrounding areas (or just fill them in), so zombified piglins only spawn on those platforms.\nSimple farm 1.\nThe simplest zombified piglin farm is to dig a 3x3x1 trench and make a layer of dirt leaving a 1 block space. Shoot zombified piglins and swipe at them with a sword on their legs after they jumped into the trench. Turn on subtitles, so you can hear when you can come out. To get maximum spawn rates, slab off the blocks in a 128 block diameter. It is done! You can also use magma blocks which only zombified piglin can spawn on (if you are on 1.16).\nPut hoppers connected to a large chest to collect the loot more easily rather than attaching a door to the trench since more zombified piglins might jump in and attack.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4unIJYkORYE%26amp%3Bt%3D234s\"&gt;Click here for the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;\nFarm with cactus.\nAnother strategy is to place cactus in the nether, and then stand on a block on top of it. Shoot ranged weapons at zombified piglins to anger them, and they converge on the cactus, which helps to kill them.\nianxofour's gold farm.\nThis farm is fairly easy to build, though it requires some digging so a Diamond Pickaxe enchanted with Efficiency II or up is recommended. The farm's optimal location is in a nether wastes biome below the nether roof. The zombified piglins are attracted to the turtle eggs hidden behind the portal and will attempt to crack them, only for them to be teleported to the overworld. In the overworld, 2 portals are built high up in the air, one where the zombified piglins came from and one where the killing chamber is located. The zombified piglins will gradually push each other to go to the second portal and go to the killing chamber, making it an easy kill for the player. The production rates are good, though the only problem for this farm is when another player is in the overworld, the piglins will despawn and the second issue is it has no dedicated storage, meaning players can either make a primitive one or an automatic sorter.\nIlmango's design.\nIlmango's design consists of 3 circular shaped platforms made from magma blocks. The donut-shaped platforms start at y= 247, then the 2nd and 3rd layers start at 250 and 253 respectively. At y= 256, build a circular glass platform to prevent ghasts from spawning. Also, the farm had satellite piglins stationed around the farm, so that when new piglins spawn, they instantly get angry at the player. The killing method is fairly simple but expensive. The piglins are killed using entity cramming, and because they're angry at you, they also drop XP. There are around 4 holes the piglins can fall on, and each hole contains 24 minecarts, for a total of 96 minecarts (requires around 480 iron to make). The average gold block rate for the farm is 130 blocks per hour, and can get you from level 0 to level 130+ in around 30 minutes.\n\"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/mZWlTU4gz3o%3Fsi%3DQ6u8oitXO956Q8Tv\"&gt;Click here for the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;\"\nGnembon's gold farm.\nGnembon's gold farm consists of 19 small circular shaped platforms. How it works is that piglins will spawn and attempt to crush the turtle eggs, but will instead fall to the killing chamber, where they are to be killed. The killing chamber itself has 2 modes, automatic and manual. In the automatic method, the piglins are killed with fall damage, which doesn't drop XP and it makes around 130 gold blocks per hour. The manual method meanwhile, gives XP and can get you to around level 130+ in 30 minutes. Aside XP, it also produces around 600 gold blocks per hour with a Looting III sword, making it one of the most powerful gold farms out there. The only issues with it are: its complicated structure especially the redstone system and it also requires some spawnproofing below the bedrock, which might take some time.\nRays Works gold farm 1.\nIn this design, there are 2 rectangle shaped platforms, with a slab roof on top to prevent ghasts from spawning. The AFK centre is connected by a path of slabs and the piglins are killed through entity cramming with minecarts. Unlike Ilmango's design, only one hole is present and is also extremely efficient, and you can reach Level 130+ in one hour. Also like Ilmango's design, there's one satellite pigman to order new piglins to attack the player, although only one is present.\nA slightly modified version is designed by Namiature. The difference is instead of entity cramming, the piglins will fall into a 3x2 area, with the players sweeping on the piglins with a Looting III sword to multiply its efficiency.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/OkUmVmCOfTI%3Fsi%3DqPClfaz8ScIbiHiz\"&gt;\"Click here for the tutorial\"&lt;/a&gt;\nRays Works gold farm 2.\nRays Works would later make another design consisting of only one layer. The zombified piglins are attracted to the middle of the spawning platforms by a turtle egg and either an iron golem or zoglin and are killed using fall damage (Using a zoglin is more efficient as they won't kill, whereas an iron golem will sometimes kill before they fall). The farm also drops XP as the zombified piglins are made angry by the iron golem/zoglin before they die. The farm is pretty fast in terms of XP, getting you to approximately level 80 in 15 minutes.\n\"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtu.be/5iT-D3KNuvE%3Fsi%3DCMY8Asf2STj3rNiO\"&gt;Click here for the tutorial&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDashpum's gold farm.\nThis gold farm is one of the most powerful gold farms out there, able to make 1600 gold blocks per hour. The farm consists of 34 circular-shaped platforms. In the middle of these platforms, there are 4 portals and an egg hidden in the middle to attract the piglins. They'll get teleported to the overworld and will float to another portal up in the sky using bubble elevators. The glass pillars are around 140 blocks long and it will take around 50 seconds for the zombified piglins to enter the second portal, which is enough time for them to enter another portal. The second portal leads to the killing chamber, which by the way had boats to have an unlimited mob cap of mobs. Just like the other designs, the spawning platforms had a glass roof to stop ghasts from spawning. Other bonus thing that are recommended although not necesarry is a beacon that has strength, regeneration and resistance effects. Strength speeds up the killing process allowing for more mobs to spawn and both regen and resistance are if you're gonna do long AFK sessions and will prevent you from dying from starvation. In 24 hours, it can get you from level 0 to level 862.\nOverworld - Java version.\nFor Bedrock specific farms see the next chapter below.\nTo build a farm in the Overworld, one can build a lot of large nether portals, interlocked to save &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and put signs or open &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s on the edges of the bottom obsidian blocks, so that zombified piglins (ZPs) will walk off. From here, one can use &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to collect them into a fall or suffocation trap. Snow golems can be an alternative for pushing them around, or at least getting them moving.\nOne fundamental problem with Overworld gold farms is that it is occasionally possible for angered ZPs to return to the Nether through a portal, and perhaps anger others while there. Without proper precautions, you may be ambushed by one or more angry ZPs when they return to the Nether though a nearby portal. You will need to make sure that all your farm portals lead into a containment area where the ZPs will be isolated. This area should have enough room for any mobs there to get away from the portal for their 15 second cooldown, so that they can then go back to the Overworld. (Also include a fence-gate exit, just in case you stumble in yourself!) Similarly, one must be careful not to use a portal in the Nether which takes them into the farm for the same reason. Returnees can be minimized by use of &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s to lure zombified piglins out of the portals. This ensures they will move and fall even without players nearby.\nSince the availability of larger portals, it is no longer \"necessary\" to make a prism of portals as large portals can do as well. However, the same practice can still be used to make a hyper-efficient farm by building portals in concentric rings (one open to each cardinal direction) from a small inner ring (usually 5x5, to have a single center block) out to the maximum of 23x23. Note that even the inner ring can be 23 blocks \"tall\" (more portal blocks mean more spawns). A ring of size \"n\" and height h will take 8(\"n\"-1) +4(\"h\"-2) = 8\"n\"+4\"h\"-16 obsidian, with 4(\"n\"-3) =4\"n\"-12 trapdoors (3n-9 logs) needed to line the inside. If all the portals are to be 23-tall, the obsidian cost can be simplified to 8\"n\"+76. \nRegardless, the mobs will be gathered to a central point, generally a 1x1 dropshaft. At the full scale of this farm, a complex grinder is unecessary: The farm can produce enough spawns that simply forcing them all into a single space will start killing them off through crowding (\"suffocation\"). They can be dropped onto a bottom-slab exposing their feet to you, with a hopper beneath that which can go to an item sorter. This setup has three main modes of operation:\nThis farm will reward at least a minimal item sorter setup, if only to divert the rotten flesh away from more valuable stuff. After that, separating out nuggets leaves the occasional gold ingots, and unstackable golden swords (and occasional armor). For the rotten flesh, it's likely worth setting up some system to automatically destroy overflow from the system. (Bringing in a cleric villager is also an option.) For gold nuggets, you'll just need to regularly check the chest, and craft the take into more compact ingots or blocks. Swords can be sent to a blast furnace by way of a double-chest; every so often check the chest and hoppers for enchanted swords you can feed to the grindstone (and then put back to be smelted). When enough swords have accumulated, drop some fuel in the blast furnace to clear out the chest.\nChanneling trident.\nA different way to spawn zombified piglins is to have a pig struck by lightning, meaning a trident enchanted with Channeling can be used in combination with pig breeders for an Overworld gold farm that requires no obsidian such as the design in this video: Note that this method will yield no swords.\nGlotz' gold farm.\nThis farm is arguably the most powerful one in Minecraft Java. It consists of 24 portals stacked together, with both zombified and normal piglins instantly spawning on the portals. Then they're gonna get teleported to the overworld (except the piglins, as they're gonna get teleported back to the nether). Once in the overworld, they will be attracted to the turtle egg in front of the portal and will fall to the killing chamber. In the chamber, there's an armour stand on which the player will hit to sweep the piglins and kill them. The rates of the farm is 44,000 gold ingots per hour or 4,444 gold blocks per hour, significantly more powerful than Dashpum's gold farm. Due to the sheer amount of loot you can acquire, a huge complex storage system is needed to be constructed, coupled with shulker loaders. A beacon is also recommended for long AFK sessions to avoid starving to death. A crafting system is also recommended to quick craft all the gold nuggets to gold ingots.\nOverworld - Bedrock version.\nFor Bedrock Edition there is only one way to make a portal system function properly in the overworld. You need a portal of 23x23 with an activation + deactivation system and a catch system for the zombified piglins to fall in.\nWe have two options at our disposal for the activation system.\nThe deactivation system has to be done with a dispenser containing a water bucket. A redstone clock will let the dispenser, dispense the water every self set amount of ticks.\nYou can make a cheap and simple manual farm, where you just catch the mobs as they spawn from the portal, then transport them to a kill chamber for manual killing. \nThis would be the cheapest way to construct the farm. \nWith the maximum looting on a sword, you'll get XP, gold nuggets, gold ingots, rotten flesh and gold swords. The swords can be smelted down to gold nuggets as well. \nSome swords are also enchanted and before smelting them, you could use a grindstone to un-enchant them and receive extra XP from them.\nThis video shows how to make a manual killing farm:\nThe next option that is fairly cheap to construct a farm, is a falling farm. We catch the zombified piglins after spawning and transport them to a drop chute. Where after a fall of more than 24 blocks they will die and drop gold nuggets and rotten flesh.\nInstead of letting the zombified piglins fall to their death, we can also use a fall breaker to make sure they get damaged, but don't die. \nThis allows us to use a looting sword to get XP, gold nuggets, gold ingots, golden swords and rotten flesh. Depending on the height of the drop, you can make sure that you could kill the zombified piglins with only one blow. Making it easy to kill and less hard on your sword in terms of durability.\nWhen we place a trident killer at the bottom of the drop chute, we instantly have a farm that kills the zombified piglins automatically. The trident killer consists of a kill chamber with pistons and a trident in the middle. The pistons push the zombified piglins around and against the trident. This way they get damaged each time they hit the trident, until they die.\nThis then gives us XP, rotten flesh, gold nuggets, gold ingots and golden swords.\nIf we hold a looting sword when in the area of the farm, the looting will be transferred onto the trident and we get more loot with each kill. \nThis video shows how to make a fully automatic farm with a complete sorting system underneath and furnaces for smelting the swords:\nItem filtering.\nIt is also possible to make a fully automatic farm using a more advanced setup. Because many of the zombified piglin farms produce a significant amount of &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;golden swords&lt;/a&gt;, which may quickly clog up a player's storage system, an item filtering system can be used to filter out the &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold%20nuggets\"&gt;gold nuggets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingots\"&gt;gold ingots&lt;/a&gt;. A redstone clock can be installed to a dispenser, and if hooked up correctly, the item filtering system can be used to spit the swords into a furnace which can then be smelted into golden nuggets. "}

They are broken instantly using any tool. They have a 33% chance to drop a single twisting vine when broken, increased to 55% with &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; I, 77% with Fortune II, and 100% with Fortune III (or higher). They always drop a single twisting vine when broken with &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; or with a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. Any segments left unsupported from below break with a 33% drop chance, regardless of tool used. Accordingly, twisting vines are best harvested starting from the topmost block.\nNatural generation.\nTwisting vines generate naturally in the &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; biome, either on the ground, or on warped &lt;a href=\"huge%20fungus\"&gt;huge fungus&lt;/a&gt; structures, and can be found only in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-generation.\nApplying &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;warped nylium&lt;/a&gt; occasionally creates 1-block tall twisting vines on any nylium or netherrack nearby.\nJust like &lt;a href=\"weeping%20vines\"&gt;weeping vines&lt;/a&gt;, twisting vines have a 10% chance of growing one &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; each random &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike weeping vines, however, twisting vines grow upward. At default random tick speed, each &lt;a href=\"plants\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; grows approximately every . Twisting vines stop growing once they reach the ceiling or when the block reaches an block state of 25, whichever is first.\nUsage.\nTwisting vines can be placed on any block \"except for transparent blocks\" (e.g. leaves and fences), and automatically begin to grow. Twisting vines can also be used similarly to a water bucket, as it can prevent fall damage. Applying &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; to any block of twisting vines causes it to grow immediately. It occasionally spawns if bonemeal is used on &lt;a href=\"warped%20nylium\"&gt;warped nylium&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; floors.\nTwisting vines stop growing if &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; are on the tip.\u200c\nClimbing.\nTwisting vines can be climbed by standing inside and holding the jump key. If there is a solid block behind the twisting vines, the walk forward key can also be used.\nCompost.\nTwisting vines also have a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1 if placed in a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;."}

It can be opened by a using a &lt;a href=\"trial%20key\"&gt;trial key&lt;/a&gt;, and each Vault in a world can only be unlocked once per player. They are only found in &lt;a href=\"trial%20chambers\"&gt;trial chambers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vu%20Bui\"&gt;Vu Bui&lt;/a&gt;, the host of Minecraft Monthly, stated that the purpose of Vaults are to reward players with loot if a fellow player has already looted the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nMining a vault with any items will drop nothing, even if mined with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, this makes vault unobtainable in Survival without glitches. Vault takes a long time to be mined, and will take the same amount of time regardless of the items used to mine.\nLocation.\nVaults only generate in trial chambers, where multiple can spawn in a singular trial room. Most have small areas designated to it, so it's fairly simple to find them. However, unlike ominous vaults, Vaults will only spawn in trial rooms. They will not spawn in any hallway, or even certain \"rooms\" that have &lt;a href=\"trial%20spawner\"&gt;trial spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, but are between rooms. \nFunction.\nVaults are able to be opened once per player, as the vault in question will register the UID of the player so that it cannot be opened by the player again. This allows for incredibly diverse potential concerning mapmaking, as since it can only be used once and its loot tables can be altered, mapmakers can randomize loot and materials given to a player for e.g. a jailbreak. To open a vault, you must click/tap on the vault while holding a Trial Key, which will close the vault's mouth and consume the key, implying that the vault literally eats the key. then, a random amount of loot will pop up from the hole on top, with a random number of each item. Some items that have been given are &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"steak\"&gt;steak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, etc. Much of the loot table within the vault seems to coincide with the trial spawner.\nAppearance.\nVaults appear to resemble a trial spawner or a regular &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;, with bars along each side of the block except for the front, resembling a cage. While the bottom resembles iron or stone, the top looks like it consists of copper, tuff, and deepslate. The three sides where the bars are have small, copper plates on the edges, and as the outer rim of the top of the block looks like deepslate, the middle of the top of the block resembles a spiral, with tuff being chiseled out (and polished, making it have the blueish tint) to spiral inwards, finally stopping in the center, where there is a hole, presumably where the loot comes out from. There is also a face on the front of the block, and its copper eyes, along with the three copper plates, are desaturated while \"dormant\", but saturate and gleam when a player comes within its radius. It then \"opens\", where it makes a sound as the face's mouth opens up, seemingly expecting a key. When in this opened state, the loot available will flash and rotate inside of the cage within the block, displaying the possible loot the player will receive."}

For example, &lt;a href=\"rd-160052\"&gt;rd-160052&lt;/a&gt; was released on May 16 at 00:52 (12:52 am Sweden time). The temporary name \"&lt;a href=\"RubyDung\"&gt;RubyDung&lt;/a&gt;\" (rd) was used in these versions; \"RubyDung\" was a game &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; previously worked on.\nClassic.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"mc-161648\"&gt;mc-161648&lt;/a&gt;, user fartron requested that Notch add a build count, which was added in the next version, &lt;a href=\"0.0.2a\"&gt;0.0.2a&lt;/a&gt;. This started the phase of what is now called &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;, and versions were labeled using three numbers followed by the letter \"a\", and bug fix patches were denoted by an underscore followed by a revision number (e.g., &lt;a href=\"0.0.18a_02\"&gt;0.0.18a_02&lt;/a&gt; is the second bug fix patch for &lt;a href=\"0.0.18a\"&gt;0.0.18a&lt;/a&gt;). The \"a\" stands for \"alpha\", which is what this development phase was originally called. (This \"0.0.\"x\"a\" versioning system was also used by Notch in a few years earlier in his game \"&lt;a href=\"Wurm%20Online\"&gt;Wurm Online&lt;/a&gt;\".) Notch mused simplifying the format to remove the redundant \"0.0.\" repetition, using the example of changing \"0.0.13a_03\" to \"0.13.3a\", but did not do so. During Classic version &lt;a href=\"0.0.23a_01\"&gt;0.0.23a_01&lt;/a&gt;, Notch announced that he was going to be changing the versioning system, removing one of the zeroes as well as the \"a\". This coincided with the development of &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt;, so versions during this time were appended with the word \"SURVIVAL TEST\" (which sometimes contained underscores, such as in version &lt;a href=\"0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST\"&gt;0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST&lt;/a&gt;). After &lt;a href=\"0.27%20SURVIVAL%20TEST\"&gt;0.27 SURVIVAL TEST&lt;/a&gt;, the survival testing phase was complete, and the version format now only had two numbers (the first of which was a zero) followed by an optional underscored bug fix patch (e.g., &lt;a href=\"0.28_01\"&gt;0.28_01&lt;/a&gt;).\nIndev and Infdev.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;, the version number remained at 0.31 for many versions. Midway through the development of Indev, Notch changed the version number from \"0.31\" to just \"Minecraft Indev\" (\"Indev\" is a portmanteau of \"in development\"). When &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; started, the version was just changed to \"Minecraft In\"f\"dev\" (\"Infdev\" is a portmanteau of \"infinite development\", as Notch added infinite world generation).\nAlpha.\nVersion numbers were re-added during &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; starting from version &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.0.1\"&gt;v1.0.1&lt;/a&gt;. The version format now was a \"v\" followed by three numbers in the order phase, major, minor. \"Minecraft\" was now in somewhat of a complete state, as it had left the \"development\" stages of Indev and Infdev, and as such the \"phase\" counter was changed to \"1\". An optional underscored bug fix patch was also used in this development phase. For example, &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.2.3_02\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.3_02&lt;/a&gt; is the second bug fix patch (\"_02\") for the third minor revision (\".3\") of the second major version (\".2\") of Alpha.\nBeta.\n&lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; reset the version number back to 1.0 after &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.2.6\"&gt;Alpha v1.2.6&lt;/a&gt;, and Beta version numbers now only had two numbers followed by an optional underscored bug fix patch (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.1_01\"&gt;Beta 1.1_01&lt;/a&gt; was released to fix a major bug in &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.1\"&gt;Beta 1.1&lt;/a&gt;). This format was inconsistent later in the Beta stage of development: for example, &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7\"&gt;Beta 1.7&lt;/a&gt; was followed by &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7_01\"&gt;Beta 1.7_01&lt;/a&gt; which was then followed by &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.7.2\"&gt;Beta 1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;. Beta also started releasing preview versions of major releases in the form of \"pre-releases\". These pre-releases took the form of the major version number followed by the word \"Pre-release\" and then a revision number. For example, &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.8%20Pre-release%202\"&gt;Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2&lt;/a&gt; was the second pre-release for &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;. Pre-releases for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;release 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, which was then called Beta 1.9, omitted the hyphen from the word \"Pre-release\". When it was decided that Beta 1.9 would be released as full version 1.0, future development versions were classified as release candidates, with &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20RC1\"&gt;RC1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20RC2\"&gt;RC2&lt;/a&gt; being the only ones.\nRelease.\nThe full release of , then known as just \"Minecraft\", reset the version number to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;. This version is the only release version to not omit the final \".0\" for a major release (such as in version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.1\"&gt;1.1&lt;/a&gt;).\nAfter the full release of \"Minecraft\", public development versions called \"snapshots\" have been published most weeks showing the development of that version at the time. Snapshots use a very different format to other releases: the format is the two-digit year, followed by the letter \"w\", the two-digit week of the year, and then a revision letter for the amount of snapshots released in that week. For example, &lt;a href=\"18w10d\"&gt;18w10d&lt;/a&gt; was the fourth snapshot (\"d\") released in the 10th week of 2018.\nPre-release versions between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.2.1\"&gt;1.2.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.4\"&gt;1.7.4&lt;/a&gt; took the form of full releases, which then incremented the minor version number for a new version. For example, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7\"&gt;1.7&lt;/a&gt; was a pre-release for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.6\"&gt;1.7.6&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13.2\"&gt;1.13.2&lt;/a&gt;, pre-releases were named as their full release counterparts followed by \"-pre\" and a revision counter. For example, &lt;a href=\"1.12-pre7\"&gt;1.12-pre7&lt;/a&gt; is the seventh pre-release for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.12\"&gt;1.12&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;1.14&lt;/a&gt;, the word \"pre-release\" was spelt out in full. For example, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14%20Pre-Release%203\"&gt;1.14 Pre-Release 3&lt;/a&gt; is the third pre-release for 1.14. Release candidates were reintroduced during &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16\"&gt;1.16&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"1.16%20Release%20Candidate%201\"&gt;1.16 Release Candidate 1&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.18\"&gt;1.18&lt;/a&gt; experimental snapshots were released before snapshots with &lt;a href=\"1.18%20Experimental%20Snapshot%201\"&gt;1.18 Experimental Snapshot 1&lt;/a&gt;.\nBedrock Edition.\nAlpha.\nOriginally subtitled \"&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", versions in this development phase took the form of a \"v\" followed by three numbers: phase, major, and minor, followed by the word \"alpha\". The phase number during Alpha was 0, and the major and minor numbers incremented each release (when the major version number was incremented, the minor version was reset to 0). Development builds in this phase were labeled as their parent version followed by \"build\" and the build counter. For example, &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20Alpha%200.14.0%20build%201\"&gt;v0.14.0 alpha build 1&lt;/a&gt; was the first build for Alpha version 0.14.0.\nRelease.\nRelease versions kept the same format as in Alpha, but incremented the phase number to 1. Development versions in this time were known as \"alpha\" versions (not to be confused with the development phase called \"alpha\") and took the form of the word \"alpha\" followed by a four-digit version number (major.minor.patch.revision). The first three digits are the parent version (&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20alpha%201.0.0.1\"&gt;alpha 1.0.0.1&lt;/a&gt; was a development build for &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;) and the fourth number is the build revision, which is not necessarily incremented by 1 each release.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.0\"&gt;1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the \"\"Pocket Edition\"'\" was dropped, and development versions were renamed from \"alpha\" to \"beta\"; the version number format did not change (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.8.0.8\"&gt;beta 1.8.0.8&lt;/a&gt; was a development build for &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.8.0\"&gt;1.8.0&lt;/a&gt;).\nStarting from and onwards, Bedrock Edition major version numbers match \"Java Edition\". Before this, Bedrock Edition updates changed the major version number for content updates and the minor version number for patches. So in order to keep the major version the same as \"Java Edition\", large minor version numbers are now used for supplementary updates. This allows space for platform-specific patches to be released while content updates are in development. The minor version segment now uses up to three digits to denote the content of that version. Incrementing the first digit (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.200\"&gt;1.16.200&lt;/a&gt;) represents a major supplementary content update, incrementing the second digit (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.210\"&gt;1.16.210&lt;/a&gt;) represents a minor supplementary update, while incrementing the third digit (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.201\"&gt;1.16.201&lt;/a&gt;) represents a bug-fix supplementary update.\nLegacy Console Edition.\nThe many different console versions use entirely different versioning formats. &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt; versions used \"title updates\": the letters \"TU\" followed by a number. &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox One Edition&lt;/a&gt; updates were called \"content updates\" and use the same format as Xbox 360 but with the letters \"CU\" instead of \"TU\". As mandated by PlayStation software, PlayStation Editions used a decimal three-digit version number (an integer followed by a two-digit number from 00\u201399, starting from 1.00; version 1.99 must be followed by 2.00), which may sometimes skip numbers. &lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt; versions are known as \"Patches\", and used the word \"Patch\" followed by a number. &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt; versions used a full three-digit version number starting from 1.0.1, but only incremented the minor version each release."}

They have cold and warm variants, and come in many different sizes varying from large villages to single ruined huts. They contain &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20block\"&gt;suspicious block&lt;/a&gt;s that carry a variety of loot.\nGeneration.\nCold ocean ruins generate in normal, cold, and frozen ocean biomes, as well as their deep variants. They are composed of stone materials and contain some suspicious gravel blocks that can be excavated using a &lt;a href=\"brush\"&gt;brush&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarm ocean ruins generate in warm, lukewarm, and deep lukewarm ocean biomes, and are composed of sandstone and stone materials as well as having some blocks of suspicious sand within them.\nOcean ruins may at times be at least partially buried, including with their airspaces. This means that their associated suspicious blocks will also be located under layers of usual &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough most ocean ruins generate underwater, they sometimes generate on land.\n30% of ocean ruins generate as large ocean ruins; the other 70% generate as small ruins. If the ocean ruin is large, there is a 90% chance for 4-8 (inclusive) small ocean ruins to generate around it in a cluster. If the ocean ruin is warm, large ocean ruins generate with a &lt;a href=\"structure%20integrity\"&gt;structure integrity&lt;/a&gt; of 0.9 and small ocean ruins generate with a structure integrity of 0.8. If the ocean ruin is cold, the \"brick\" variant of the chosen structure type generates with a structure integrity of 0.9 if large and 0.8 if small. The \"cracked\" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.7, and the \"mossy\" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.5, both regardless of size. Reduced structure integrity may also remove &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; and loot chests from the structures.\nDuring generation, all air blocks and structure blocks act as &lt;a href=\"structure%20void\"&gt;structure void&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStructure.\nThe shape and size of ocean ruins varies greatly, and they often generate together in groups to create ruined villages.\nAll but two of the structures contain a loot &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with loot inside. The chest contains loot for specifically either a small or large sized ocean ruin structure and may be buried by some sort of material such as &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;.\nCold ocean ruins are primarily composed of &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20gravel\"&gt;suspicious gravel&lt;/a&gt;, and also contain &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"polished%20granite\"&gt;polished granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bricks\"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone%20brick%20stairs\"&gt;stone brick stairs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and/or a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with loot in it.

The spawning occurs at the world's &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; (Y-level 63 per default) or at higher levels. Ocelots spawn as one or two adult ocelots in 95% of times or as ocelot kittens in 5% of times. There is a small chance for two ocelot kittens to spawn when an adult ocelot spawns naturally. Ocelots are found in all kinds of jungle biomes in \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\". Ocelots spawn as hostile mobs in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\"; as a counterbalance, there is a chance for a spawn attempt to fail in jungles and spawning does not occur in &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20jungle\"&gt;bamboo jungle&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sparse%20jungle\"&gt;sparse jungle&lt;/a&gt;s. Because of this, while ocelots are passive &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; mobs, they cannot spawn at all on Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nAdult ocelots drop &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Upon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped. Killing an ocelot kitten yields no experience.\nBehavior.\nOcelots are immune to &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt;, but still avoid falls. An ocelot attacks &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s and baby &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s. They &lt;a href=\"sneak\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; and stalk their prey before chasing it down. They can kill through a &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; if they are against it.\n&lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s stay six blocks away from an ocelot. A creeper within this range that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;Phantom&lt;/a&gt;s stay 16 blocks away from an ocelot in \"Bedrock Edition\".\nWith the exception of a faster movement rate, kittens have the same behavior as adults.\nOcelots are one of the few mobs that can &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; and sprint away from nearby players in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nOcelots approach players holding &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt; within 10 blocks. If the player moves, turns their head too quickly or stops holding the item while within 6 blocks, the ocelot flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.\nA player gains an ocelot's trust by feeding it raw cod or salmon until heart particles show, causing it to no longer flee from players. Each food item has a chance of gaining the ocelot's trust.\nOcelots that are trusting do not despawn (a bug in Java version leads to despawning&lt;a href=\"https%3A//bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-196031%3Fjql%3Dproject%2520%253D%2520MC%2520AND%2520status%2520%253D%2520Open%2520AND%2520resolution%2520%253D%2520Unresolved%2520AND%2520text%2520~%2520%2522ocelot%2522%2520ORDER%2520BY%2520updated%2520DESC\"&gt;MC-196031 see comments&lt;/a&gt;); otherwise, they may despawn when far enough from a player, similar to hostile mobs.\nBreeding.\nWhen a trusting ocelot is fed &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt;, it enters love mode. Breeding creates an ocelot kitten that trusts the player in \"Bedrock Edition\". The adults cannot breed again for 5 minutes once they have completed breeding. The growth of baby ocelots can be accelerated slowly using these raw fish. Each cod or salmon takes 10% off the remaining time to mature.\nSounds.\nOcelots use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nOcelots have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

The purpose of this world type was to provide smaller worlds on older or low-end devices that did not perform well with &lt;a href=\"World%20type%23Infinite\"&gt;infinite worlds&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreation.\nTo create an Old world, all the player had to do was select the \"Old\" type in the World Type drop-down of the world creation screen. Optionally, on low-end devices, the player could toggle \"Limited worlds\" in the Video section of the &lt;a href=\"Options%23Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;options screen&lt;/a&gt;. This sometimes failed due to limited access.\nStructure.\nOverworld.\nOld worlds consisted of a finite map with an area of 256\u00d7256 blocks with 128 maximum block height, but could be expanded in area using a NBT editor by changing the LimitedWorldDepth and LimitedWorldWidth values.\nBiomes that could not be generated in this world type:\nHowever, as a result of their limited size, only a few biomes could be generated per world. In addition, since dark forests did not generate, areas of specific lush biomes were shuffled slightly, compared to their placements in default worlds. Also, biomes that were generated here were shrunken 4\u00d7 (16\u00d7 area) to allow more biomes to generate. Due to this shrinking, a seed generated different terrain in an old world than in an infinite world, although with similar overall characteristics (for example, the \"Island Survival\" seed from &lt;a href=\"seed%20templates\"&gt;seed templates&lt;/a&gt; put the player on an island in the middle of the world, but the resemblance ends there).\nWhen creating an Old world, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; always spawned in the middle of the world. If the starter map was enabled, the map was in scale level rather than of . Additionally, the player respawn radius during world creation or world edit could be up to 256 blocks, rather than up to 128 blocks as in &lt;a href=\"flat\"&gt;flat&lt;/a&gt; and infinite.\nThe center of the world was rarely at 0,0, meaning the game found a valid spawn point, then it limited the world to 256\u00d7256 around that point, so the center of the world was the coordinate of that spawn point. It was possible, through NBT editing, to move the center of an old-world to another area in the seed.\nPlaying an old-world on the latest version of the game results in the world border no longer having collision, allowing players to explore beyond the 256x256 box. However, blocks outside of the border are not visible and cannot be picked up once broken. Mobs that wander into/outside the border freeze and can no longer move or be killed.\nSome &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt; never appeared in the Old world type:\nOther structures could generate in the Overworld:\nSome mechanics broke in this world type:\nDue to the structure limitations in this world type, many resources became unobtainable in survival, and some mobs could not spawn naturally.\nBecause of that, playing survival in this world type was challenging, due to the structure limitations reducing resources and also affecting mob spawning. While water and lava always generate in this world type, lava usually does not on the surface, although it always does, underground and always directly in contact with, the invisible bedrock in extremely small patches of 1\u00d71 block. If the Overworld didn't generate lava, then cobblestone would become non-renewable without going to the Nether.\nNether and End.\nIn Old worlds, &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; could not be accessed unless the world was converted to the &lt;a href=\"World%20type%23Infinite\"&gt;Infinite&lt;/a&gt; type, as detailed below.\nHowever, the Nether and End actually existed in this world type but the only way to access these dimensions was via command or with the corresponding portal, just like the Overworld.\nBoth Nether and End were also bordered with the size 256\u00d7128\u00d7256.\nThe Nether still generated normally, but the 8:1 travel ratio was maintained, meaning that returning to the Overworld may cause the player to become stuck (due to the Overworld being 256\u00d7128\u00d7256 in size).\nIf a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; was generated, it is most likely going to be cut down by the world border.\nDespite nether portals not being able to be activated, returning from the Nether to the Overworld caused a newly activated Nether portal to generate in the overworld (this is due to nether portals not counting when placed with commands).\nThe End in Old worlds generated only the central island without the outer islands. Sometimes the end fountain did not generate and the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt; sometimes got stuck at the border. End gateway portals also didn't work.\nConverting to infinite.\nTo convert an Old world to an Infinite type, select the pencil icon next to the old world in the world selection screen, then select \"Make Infinite!\". This creates a new world with all of the saved data (&lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, terrain, structures, etc.) of the old world, sets the world type to Infinite, and keeps the world name; the old world is then renamed codice_1.\nAfter converting to Infinite, the terrain copied from the old world has a terrain wall separating it from the added area, as infinite worlds generate larger biomes.\nThis process is not available in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20China\"&gt;Minecraft China&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

The settings change only the mountains and valleys of the landscape; structures and other environmental factors (which are set on page 1) remain unaffected.\n\"Minecraft\" uses &lt;a href=\"noise%20generator\"&gt;noise generator&lt;/a&gt;s, specifically those making use of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise\"&gt;Perlin noise&lt;/a&gt; to create the randomness of its terrain. Perlin noise is a method for generating noise that transitions smoothly and looks more natural than 'regular' noise.\nThe \"Minecraft\" world generator uses many Perlin noise functions to generate the surface terrain. Three Perlin noise functions are combined to form the standard hills: a main function (\"Main Noise\"), a lower limit (\"Lower Limit\") and a ceiling (\"Upper Limit\"). The world generator is calculated for each coordinate (X, Z) by comparing the average value between the lower limit and upper limit to the value of the main function. The base height (\"Depth Base\") determines the separation between the standard hills and valleys and is independent from sea level.\nThe default scenery is not seen in the finished world, because each biome has specific properties. Plains are flat, hills have small to medium elevations, extreme mountains are high mountain ranges, oceans have deep valleys, savannas and mesas have low mountains with flat plateaus, etc. Each biome type has an individual biome depth (\"Biome Depth\") and an individual biome factor (\"Biome Scale\") in order to perform the biome specific deformations.\nVideo.\n\"This video was made on Minecraft \""}

There are two variants in the biome family.\nDescription.\nAs the name implies, an old growth forest includes trees that have attained a great age, and therefore height. These biomes generate at very high &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; values, similar to &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt; biome, and are often surrounded by &lt;a href=\"grove\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s and dark forests. Due to their high humidity values, old growth taigas are almost guaranteed to have &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; generate beneath them. The two variants are often separated by &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpruce or pine grows all over the landscape, and most of them are the large 2\u00d72 trees that grow significantly taller than regular trees. Much of the &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s are replaced by large swaths of &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Forest%20rock\"&gt;rocks&lt;/a&gt; made of &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; frequently generate on the ground and &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es generate alongside the &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berries\"&gt;sweet berry bushes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"large%20fern\"&gt;large fern&lt;/a&gt;s and tall &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; on the ground. &lt;a href=\"Mushroom\"&gt;Mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s are more common than most of overworld biomes. &lt;a href=\"Trail%20ruins\"&gt;Trail ruins&lt;/a&gt; may generate here. &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn here. As the climate here is cold, &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;fall changes to &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt; above layer 200\u00b18, though in the old growth spruce taiga variant, snowfall forms at layer 160\u00b18.\nThere are overall more trees in old growth taigas compared to normal taigas, leading to increased foliage density. This makes wood more abundant, though as a large portion of it grows as part of tall 2\u00d72 spruce trees, it may be more difficult to obtain. Old growth taigas are slightly more difficult for survival than regular taigas for this reason, though aren't so bad once acclimated and strategies are used to clear the tall trees; they may offer more unique views compared to regular taigas as well.\nVariants.\nOld Growth Pine Taiga.\nThe standard biome variant, old growth pine taiga features both large 2x2 and normal-sized spruce trees, with the tall trees being mostly arrow shaped with few leaves at the top. Snowfall starts at layer Y=200\u00b18 in this biome. \nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nOld Growth Spruce Taiga.\nThe old growth spruce taiga variant resembles the old growth pine taiga at first glance, with the main difference being the shape of the giant trees. The giant trees in old growth spruce taigas have leaves surrounding much more of the tree trunk, the larger amounts of leaves increase the chances of saplings dropping when these trees are cut down, leading to easier sustainability. This variant is also slightly colder than the regular variant, which means that snowfall starts at layer Y=160\u00b18 instead of layer Y=200\u00b18. \nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Old Growth Taigas"}

Opaque blocks completely prevent light from traveling through them, while transparent blocks generally diminish the light by one light level per block (these value can be overridden however, and there are several &lt;a href=\"Light%23Light-filtering_blocks\"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block%23Spread\"&gt;growth of grass blocks&lt;/a&gt; is linked to the amount of light in the blocks directly above them.

In the overworld, underground deposits of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; are generated in this form, followed by the more precious ores, like &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; (in mountains biomes) and &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;.

Currently only ancient debris is generated in this form. Scatter ores also have a spawn size value. The maximum number of generated blocks in a scatter ore is just the spawn size.\nThere was also a deprecated ore type, which generates only one block in each generation attempt. It was used by emerald ore before 1.18."}

The four corners of the frame are not required, but portals created by the game always include them, resulting in 4 free/extra glowstone. Adjacent portals can share glowstone blocks. A other portal cannot be built horizontally like an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a frame is constructed, it is activated by &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; placed inside the frame. This creates portal blocks inside the frame, resembling a vortex. The water can be placed in any manner, including use of &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;, dispensed by dispenser or natural spread of water. Other portals can be activated only in the Overworld or the Nether; they cannot be activated in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"customized\"&gt;customized&lt;/a&gt; dimensions.\nThe water must be the last placed block in the structure\u2014a water on an incomplete frame does not result in the portal activating upon the placement of the last glowstone block.\nBehavior.\nWhen a player in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; stands in an other portal block for 4 seconds, the player is teleported 500 blocks in the air and codice_1 appears in the chat. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. However, in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;, the wait time is one game tick ( second) for the player to transfer between dimensions.\nMost entities can travel through portals, including mobs (except the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;thrown items&lt;/a&gt;, and transportation \"without passengers\" (neither mobs nor player), including &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike players, other entities travel through portals instantly, and once they reach the other side, there is a cool-down time for 300 game ticks (15 seconds), in which they cannot go through any other portals. Therefore, an entity can only travel though other portals again, once it is not touching any other portal for 15 seconds.\nIssues.\nOther portal is an unsupported &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt; due to being an joke, and therefore such issues relating to them will not be fixed."}

{"id": "13538", "revid": "54742070", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13538", "title": "Overworld", "text": "The Overworld is the &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; in which all players begin their \"Minecraft\" world. Most players spend their time in this &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreation.\nThe Overworld is the only dimension created when the player creates a new world. The other dimensions (&lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;) aren't created until a player enters the corresponding dimension for the first time.\nSeeds.\nA new world in \"Minecraft\" is generated through the use of a randomly generated seed, which is an integer used as a starting point for the world generation formula. The player can specify a seed or allow the game to generate one randomly. If given a non-integer input (such as the word \"Glacier\"), the game converts it into a corresponding integer (such as 1772835215). \nA given seed generates almost exactly the same world every time, provided the same &lt;a href=\"edition\"&gt;edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Version%20history\"&gt;game version&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"world%20type\"&gt;world type&lt;/a&gt; are used. Although the exact &lt;a href=\"spawn%20point\"&gt;spawn point&lt;/a&gt; varies, the &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt; of all terrain features are the same. All seeds within the 32-bit integer limit may also generate worlds with the same terrain shape and biome map, but the placement of terrain features, structures, and carver caves may differ.\nEnvironment.\nThe Overworld is an incredibly complex environment with a wide variety of features.\nBiomes.\nThe Overworld is divided into &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s of various types. A biome's type determines the basic characteristics of the terrain within it, such as the blocks composing the surface or the plants that thrive in it. The biome type also determines which &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; can spawn within it and affects how environmental behaviors such as &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; are expressed within it.\nNatural structures.\nThe Overworld is composed of a large number of terrain patterns, called &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;, whose arrangement varies widely from one seed to another. The exact structures are unique to each world, while the types of structures that can be generated at a given place are determined by the biome type. Structures are meant to represent real-world equivalents such as &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Impossible\" (in the real world) formations, such as &lt;a href=\"floating%20island\"&gt;floating island&lt;/a&gt;s, can also be found throughout the Overworld.\nAlong with terrain features, natural structures include naturally-generated buildings, such as &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDaylight cycle.\nThe Overworld is the only &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt; with a daylight cycle and the only one where the environment reflects the passage of time. In contrast to time zones in the real world, Overworld time is universal; it is always the same time for every player in the dimension regardless of how far apart they might be, even in an \"infinite\" world.\nDuring the daytime, the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; acts as a powerful &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; source, with a light level of 15, the maximum. &lt;a href=\"Sun%23Sunlight\"&gt;Sunlight&lt;/a&gt; is strong enough to grow plants and affect the way &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; spawn, among other interesting effects. During the nighttime, the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; is the only natural &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; source. However, moonlight is comparatively dim; the light level falls to a minimum of 4, allowing hostile mobs to spawn. Other than during &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s, nighttime is the only time players may sleep in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe daylight cycle can effectively be measured using a &lt;a href=\"clock\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to determine the approximate &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle%23Conversions\"&gt;Minecraft time&lt;/a&gt; anywhere in the Overworld. Time can also be changed or stopped with the use of the command.\nThe sun rises in the east and sets in the west, just as it does in the real world. Observing its motion is a simple method of telling direction without a &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;.\nMobs.\nThe Overworld is home to a wide variety of &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. Mobs vary greatly in behavior and the level of danger they present to the player. Different mobs spawn at different times and places depending on the light level and the biome, among other factors. On occasion, a mob can move between the Overworld and another dimension, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;, by using a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;, but this is uncommon. Boss mobs like the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; cannot enter portals.\nGeneration.\nAs with all other dimensions in the game, the Overworld can generate infinitely. However, there are some limitations, &lt;a href=\"%23Limitations\"&gt;as detailed below&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other dimensions, it is divided into 16\u00d7384\u00d716 block sections called &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Overworld encompasses a three-dimensional volume that extends vertically from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; up to the &lt;a href=\"Altitude\"&gt;build limit&lt;/a&gt; (y=-64 to 320), and horizontally for a virtually infinite distance in each direction. This volume is filled (virtually speaking) with air, terrain, and structures. Technically, the terrain is formed by generating multiple noise maps to produce differing elevations, general land shapes, and complex mountain and cave systems.\nLimitations.\nWhile the world is virtually infinite, the number of blocks a player may physically reach is limited with where the limits are depending on the edition of the game and the world type being played.\n, the map contains a &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt; located by default at X/Z coordinates \u00b129,999,984. The world border is an animated wall of blue stripes. Standing near the border results in a red vignette appearing around the screen. Most entities are unable to pass the border, except by &lt;a href=\"Commands/tp\"&gt;teleporting&lt;/a&gt;. Players who breach the border receive constant damage unless they are in &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"spectator\"&gt;spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode. The player can teleport past the world border and continue as far as X/Z \u00b129,999,999, where there is an invisible wall. However, the player can travel a few chunks further by riding horses, pigs, and minecarts through it. \nIn , &lt;a href=\"World%20type%23Infinite\"&gt;Infinite&lt;/a&gt;-type worlds have no fixed horizontal limits, but either generation stops or normal game behavior begins to break down at extreme distances; the exact details depend on the platform. However, experiments suggest that players can generally reach at least X/Z \u00b130,000,000 before such problems occur.\nTerrain features.\nThe Overworld contains numerous terrain features, at a wide variety of scales.\nBlocks.\nNaturally generated.\n\"Naturally generated\" includes blocks that are created through the &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;world seed&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaturally created.\nNaturally created means a combination of events that cause a new block to be placed by natural causes, not the player. Some of these blocks may also be created as part of world generation.\nStructures.\nSame as naturally generated, but these blocks are created only with the \"Generate Structures\" option enabled.\nTechnical information.\nFolder.\n, information on the Overworld is stored in the codice_1 folder of the codice_2 directory, with \"worldname\" being the name of your world.\nDeleting the codice_1 folder resets the Overworld so that all player-made changes and buildings in that dimension are undone.\nAchievements.\nSome achievements and advancements are obtained only in the Overworld, as their conditions cannot be replicated in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt; at all."}

The demo world, which uses the &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;seed&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 (or codice_2 when hashed), has been altered slightly to help guide newcomers to \"Minecraft\".

The color of the wool used does not influence the picture chosen when the painting is placed. Once placed, it displays a random painting.\nBreaking.\nTo remove a painting from a wall, the player can it, break one of its supporting blocks, cover one square of it with a block, hit it with an arrow, egg, ender pearl, snowball, or fire charge, or subject it to an explosion. The painting then drops as an item. Arrows that hit paintings disappear.\nTrading.\nMaster-level shepherd &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s sell 3 paintings for 2 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nPlacement.\nPaintings can be placed on the sides of &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"sculk%20vein\"&gt;sculk vein&lt;/a&gt;s. A small gap is visible between the painting and attachment surface. There are several different sizes of paintings (see below). When placed, a painting checks for the largest amount of space it has. It then chooses a random painting of that size. The player can add blocks around the painting to ensure it is the size wanted. When the supporting blocks are removed, the painting breaks after 20 game &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (1 second) if no supporting blocks are replaced during that interval.\nProperties.\nBeing an entity, paintings can simultaneously exist in the same space as blocks such as water or torches. Specifically, they can share the space with any block whose collision box does not intersect its hitbox.\nPlayers and mobs are able to walk through paintings, as long as the blocks supporting the painting allow it.

The concept of a hell world re-surfaced when the development of Alpha 1.2.0 began, with the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nHell resembled the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; of that time, only much more apocalyptic. Unlike the Overworld, \"Hell\" generated &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; in place of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. The sky would also appear red, instead of blue. This map theme made gameplay harder than if the player spawned in the Overworld, as lighting levels were lower than in the Overworld - this ultimately resulted in more &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; spawning. &lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt; also took much longer, as there were very few trees and a low supply of natural materials.\nMost \"Minecraft\" players never knew this feature. It looked similar to the Nether Waste (as it was the Nether\u2019s early development stage), but the Nether wasn't added at the time. Another key difference is that because of the lava and lack of water in \"Hell\", if the player got burned, there would be no place to cool off, and the player would eventually burn to their death there.\nDue to the many mobs that spawned here, mining trees in Hell was difficult due to interferences from hostile mobs. There was no way to build a hut or a house without mob interference."}

Chainmail helmets may be repaired in this way with iron ingots. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another helmet of like material.\nEnchantments.\nA helmet can receive the following &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s.

One supposed instance of these eyes was linked in the comment, which was a YouTube upload of \"13\" posted the previous day (the same day that the disc was added to the game), showing a &lt;a href=\"screenshot\"&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of a dark &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; with two white eyes in the bottom left corner. This story is the first known instance of the concept of a creepypasta regarding a white-eyed paranormal being in \"Minecraft\".\nThe following day, Forum user Endorphine posted a thread recounting a myth surrounding the &lt;a href=\"ambient%20sounds\"&gt;ambient sounds&lt;/a&gt; added to caves in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.3\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, in which \"a pair of white pixels\" would appear whenever these sounds would play. The same video was linked as an example of an appearance of these white pixels. The phenomenon was attributed to \"White Eyes\", a female creature who would stalk the player from afar with no visible traits other than her blank white eyes.\nHerobrine creepypasta.\nThe \"White Eyes\" story began spreading through the Minecraft Forum, either stemming from or being popularized by the aforementioned thread. On August 24, a modified version of the story appeared, in which \"White Eyes\" was now a default player model with whited out eyes.\nAt some point before August 19, a similar altered version of the story surfaced: \"White Eyes\" gained the name \"Herobrine\", and was now described as the deceased brother of &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; (in reality, Notch has never had a brother), taking the form of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; entity with white eyes. The exact origin of this version of the story is unknown, with the earliest known instances of it being from a comment in a Minecraft Forum thread on August 30, 2010, and a now-deleted image posted on 4chan's paranormal /x/ board on August 31.\nThe story details an encounter in \"Minecraft\" with a nameless human entity in a single-player &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; who displayed strange behavior such as stalking the player from afar, creating unnatural constructions such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; pyramids in the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; and long 2x2 tunnels, and removing &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s. The writer then attempted to start a topic about the encounter on the Minecraft Forum, only to have it be repeatedly deleted, followed by a private message from a seemingly nonexistent user named \"Herobrine\" telling them to stop. The 4chan post also contained a screenshot of the encounter, showing Herobrine in the distance amidst the &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrocraft streams.\nBrocraft streamer Copeland came across the Herobrine story on 4chan's /v/ board and took a liking to it. He edited Herobrine into several screenshots to show to his chat and, after getting largely good reactions, decided to stage a hoax; he changed the &lt;a href=\"texture\"&gt;texture&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; to display Herobrine and put it in a work-in-progress house in his world, planning to show it on a livestream. On August 30, Copeland played through the world as a normal player would, deliberately avoiding the work-in-progress room he had set up for the hoax, until about 20 minutes and 45 seconds in, when he entered the room and saw the re-textured painting. Copeland then screamed and ran out of the house, promptly ending the stream. He pretended to be shaken up in the chat and later posted a message onto the forums, linking to the video to spread it around in the hopes of getting similar reactions. Other users in the thread began debating whether Copeland's sighting was real and started posting their own screenshots with Herobrine edited into them. After a while, Copeland removed the painting and reverted to normal textures, then proceeded to stream further, pretending to be scared. He announced that he would delete the world to never meet Herobrine again.\nLater on, fellow streamer Patimuss made a stream showing Herobrine near a user-made &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pool. This Herobrine was free-standing, unlike in the previous stream, likely indicating that he was a re-textured &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; (most likely iron). The livestream went down after Patimuss ran away and saved his game, only to resume ten minutes later, where Herobrine had supposedly disappeared. Afterwards, during the second stream, Patimuss could be heard talking to his wife, stating he was trolling, which flooded the livestream chat with outrage. He then faked a game &lt;a href=\"crash\"&gt;crash&lt;/a&gt; and the stream proceeded later with no further Herobrine sightings. Copeland disliked that Patimuss outed Herobrine as a fake.\nAround the time of Patimuss' stream, Copeland posted links in chat leading to the website &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130710001351/http%3A//ghostinthestream.net/him.html\"&gt;http://ghostinthestream.net/him.html&lt;/a&gt;, which likely inspired the \"Him\" nickname. The page featured &lt;a href=\"Steve\"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;'s face, but with his original eyes made pitch black and replaced with real, frantically rolling eyes. Below the face, there was a jumble of characters and letters. After removing all non-alphabet characters, the text is revealed to be a slightly edited version of another creepypasta entitled \"Wake Up?\", which is written as a note to the reader explaining that they have retreated to a \"fantasy world\" due to suffering from torture (specified as rape in the original text) and that they need to \"wake up\".\nIncrease in popularity.\nFollowing these events, the popularity of the character began to increase, propelling Herobrine to meme status and making him an icon of the community. Numerous screenshots, animations, pieces of artwork, constructions, and videos of Herobrine were created, with the earliest among them being created on the same day as the original livestreams.\nNot long after the Brocraft streams propelled Herobrine into popularity, all of the Brocraft streams in which he was featured were deleted, and not archived elsewhere. Despite extensive searching, no footage has ever been recovered, and only a few screenshots and written descriptions of the contents of the livestreams still exist. Copeland continued to adamantly state Herobrine was real for about a year onward.\nAt &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202010\"&gt;MINECON 2010&lt;/a&gt;, the day after Herobrine's popularity boost from the livestreams, Notch confirmed Herobrine was a hoax, but jokingly alluded to the possibility that he might not be. The next day, Notch posted on Twitter about the subject of Herobrine: in reply to a tweet asking if Herobrine was a real entity in-game, Notch replied saying that he was not, but that he \"might be soon\". This further confirmed there was no Herobrine, but again suggested the possibility that Notch planned to add him at a later date.\nIn October 2010, due to increased drama surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Wiki%20%28website%29\"&gt;Minecraft Wiki's&lt;/a&gt; page on Herobrine, a wiki administrator asked Notch over if he would ever be added, to which Notch replied \"i have no plans of adding herobrine as is, but I do like the rumors, haha\". This showed Notch had decided against adding Herobrine, but the use of the wording \"as is\" suggested that something like Herobrine may be added, further fueling beliefs that he would be implemented. Once again, the same user asked for clarification, saying that the \"Minecraft\" community was \"getting frustrated by the hero-spam\", to which Notch replied that he had no plans for adding Herobrine into the game.\nModded versions.\nOn December 10, 2010, hMod Forums user tkelly released the earliest known Herobrine mod, a server plugin called \"iLoveYou\". In the plugin, Herobrine can be summoned by building an altar made of &lt;a href=\"gold%20block\"&gt;gold block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, and igniting the netherrack on top. The mod's version of Herobrine exhibits behaviors similar to those in the original creepypasta and livestreams, as well as new behaviors, such as placing redstone torches, building underground dungeons, teleporting behind players, and luring players into traps. Many YouTube videos from around the time of this plugin's release show players encountering or summoning this modded version of Herobrine on many different servers, indicating that the plugin was widespread enough to influence the playerbase's perception of Herobrine, and many of Herobrine's traits and abilities introduced in the mod became established in the community as part of the character. Updated versions of this plugin created by other users still exist on the Internet, but the original plugin from the original creator is currently lost.\nLater, on July 29, 2011, a more popular Herobrine mod was released by the Minecraft Forum user burnner. This mod also lets players summon Herobrine by building and igniting an altar made of gold and netherrack, though the arrangement and composition of blocks is different, and a new \"Herobrine Totem\" block is required. This mod's version of Herobrine retains many of his abilities from the canon sources and original mod while gaining many new ones, such as using &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s, placing &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, possessing &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, and spawning &lt;a href=\"undead%20mob\"&gt;undead mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Herobrine is much more hostile in this mod and will regularly directly attack players, unlike in the original mod where Herobrine is more rarely encountered and less overtly hostile. Many subsequent Herobrine mods have been made since, many of them employing numerous concepts that originated in these early examples. The use of these mods in servers and videos likely accounts for a substantial percentage of reported Herobrine \"sightings\", since they are the only way Herobrine can actually exist in the game.\nCurrent status.\nFrom 2011 onward, Herobrine's popularity continued to increase as more and more fan creations featuring the character were created. Many \"sightings\", modded gameplay videos, and animations featuring Herobrine would reach tens of millions of views on YouTube during the following years. Numerous imitation characters with varying levels of popularity were created with Herobrine as the main inspiration, but Herobrine would always remain by far the most popular.\nAs the role of lead developer of \"Minecraft\" was passed on from Notch to &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt;, the chance of Herobrine appearing in an update became unclear. On August 22, 2012, &lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt;, current joint developer of \"Minecraft\", tweeted \"We have no plans at all to add herobrine. I doubt this will ever change.\" This confirms that Herobrine will likely never see an official addition in \"Minecraft\", and that any claims of \"finding\" Herobrine in vanilla \"Minecraft\" in future updates are completely unfounded.\nDescription.\nCanonical.\nHerobrine is said to be Notch's deceased brother, somehow embedded into \"Minecraft\" as a human entity with the player skin of Steve, but with completely white eyes and no visible irises or pupils. His appearance differs between the canonical sources; in Copeland's livestream, he had the beard seen in Steve's original design, while in the original 4chan image and Copeland's edited screenshot, the beard appears to be absent.\nHerobrine is able to build and destroy in the game. The original story states the player found long 2\u00d72 tunnels, small pyramids in the middle of the ocean, and trees with no leaves. The full extent of his building capacity is unknown, but the given examples indicate Herobrine has awareness of shape, and can differentiate materials from each other. Herobrine shows a lot of characteristics of being a form of virus, such as manipulating game worlds, deleting Minecraft Forum topics and sending messages to forum users. He is not seen to communicate with players in-game, but does have the ability to communicate through the internet.\nHerobrine seems to solely target players. He did not seem to interact with any other &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s nearby in the Brocraft streams, some of which were &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. His canonical relation to further mobs added since he appeared is a complete mystery. His interactions with other mobs are not mentioned in the original image. While there is a &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt; present in the image, Herobrine does not seem interested in it at all, and is solely focused on the player.\nIn both the original creepypasta and the Brocraft streams, Herobrine appears in the world without any apparent cause, and his presence is not implied to be due to a player's actions. In the creepypasta, he seems to avoid the player and appears to only be active in unexplored areas, whereas in the streams he seems to intentionally get close to players and appears mainly near player constructions.\nCommunity.\nThe pronounciation of the name \"Herobrine\" is not specified in any of the canonical sources, leaving it as a subject of debate. Most pronounce the \"Hero\" part of the name as either /h\u026a\u0279\u0259\u028a/ (as in the word \"hero\") or /h\u025b\u0279o\u028a/ (\"Heh-roh\"), while the \"-brine\" part is commonly pronounced as /b\u0279a\u026an/ (as in the word \"brine\"), /b\u0279\u026an/ (\"brin\"), or /b\u0279i\u02d0n/ (\"breen\").\nThough his hands are usually empty, Herobrine is sometimes depicted holding tools, such as &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s. This stems from the widespread community belief that Herobrine is a dead miner, killed long before the player's arrival. His appearance does not suggest this is the case, though with Minecraft's &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as mining being a large part of the game, the game itself has shaped public perception of the character to suit this persona.\nHerobrine occasionally interacts with other mobs. He is sometimes able to take control of passive animals, causing them to also exhibit his blank white eyes, and revive/spawn undead mobs. He seems capable of drastically changing his environments with no viable source of resources to do so. Most expansions to his abilities involve &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; placing, dungeon building, using redstone torches and setting traps. He exhibits all the behaviors of a &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode player in the game. While he is usually mute, some interpretations have him communicating with players, typically by sending them ominous messages through signs or &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; such as \"Stop\" or \"Only God can save/help you now\", or by screaming as he jumpscares them. While he usually cannot be killed, in some interpretations he can be defeated, at least temporarily.\nHerobrine's intentions vary, but they usually fall under two categories: the \"stalker\" variation, based on the original canonical events, and the \"vengeful\" variation, derived from community interpretation. In the \"stalker\" variation, he stalks the player, disappearing if approached. In the \"vengeful\" variation, he tries to ensnare the player in traps, presumably to steal their &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. He waits for people to enter his dungeons, then either seals them inside, or teleports behind them, presumably killing them. Some rarer variations of the latter state he breaks the player's creations and steals their items from &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. These ideas are likely inspired by &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Griefing\"&gt;griefers and trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nA popular idea in the community is that Herobrine can be \"summoned\" through the use of a special arrangement of &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s; such a structure is usually referred to as a \"Herobrine altar\", \"Herobrine shrine\", \"Herobrine totem\" or \"Herobrine spawner\". Typically, this is a 3\u00d73 horizontal square of gold blocks, with a block of netherrack placed on top and four redstone torches placed upright on each side. The block beneath the netherrack varies between versions, with common choices being mossy cobblestone, more netherrack, or more gold. Another common version is a 1 block wide, 4 block tall pillar with 2 gold blocks on the bottom and 2 netherrack blocks on the top. Some variations also include other blocks such as &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, and/or lava. Igniting the netherrack is supposed to \"activate\" the structure, which then supposedly summons Herobrine into the world. These concepts are likely stemmed from, or served as inspiration for, the mods featuring the character.\nOfficial cameos.\nHerobrine has appeared or been mentioned in official &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt; images and webpages as an inside joke. His first appearance in official Mojang images was with the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20210221084148/https%3A//notch.tumblr.com/post/8829997577/wedding-weekend\"&gt;Wedding Weekend&lt;/a&gt; in August 2011, in which he was just behind Notch's \"Minecraft\" character. He then made several appearances in material related to &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202011\"&gt;MINECON 2011&lt;/a&gt;: firstly the website header, where he was just behind Notch yet again. He then appeared in &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fgl%3DBE%26amp%3Bv%3D-y2NACUlwmE\"&gt;the official MINECON 2011 trailer&lt;/a&gt; created by Hat Films, at 3:11, though this was likely unplanned, as users were asked to submit their skins to appear in the trailer. In the convention itself, a Herobrine statue was present in the Xbox section, on the board behind the Xbox stations. During the closing of the convention, a user named Zaralith won the Herobrine statue by correctly answering the give-away question \"How many Fable games are there?\". Some users have pointed to this as proof of his future addition, however there is no proof he has been portrayed for anything other than baiting fans.\nHerobrine then appeared in the instruction booklets of some of the first &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Minecraft\"&gt;LEGO Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; sets, among other \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;s. He also appeared in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.facebook.com/minecraft\"&gt;\"Minecraft's\" Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; on the cover photo in summer 2012, although the image was created by a fan for a competition with the theme of \"summer picnic\", hence his inclusion may not be fully intentional.\nIn September 2013, developer &lt;a href=\"Marc%20Watson\"&gt;Marc Watson&lt;/a&gt; created a series of skins for the &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; model. These skins were made to ensure a stable skin for various official entities could be used without fear that the skin could change. Herobrine is one of the skins that can be obtained through this system by using the command (with \"MHF\" standing for \"Marc's Head Format\"). The skin used to show Herobrine without a beard and was originally taken from the Herobrine account. It was changed in December 2017 to use the same beard that Steve and the &lt;a href=\"Mob%20%28entity%29\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; had before the release of &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%203D%20Shareware%20v1.34\"&gt;Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34&lt;/a&gt; April Fools' update, \"Removing Herobrine\" is one of the episodes. On the \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Earth\"&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/a&gt;\" FAQ site, Herobrine used to be mentioned in one of the frequently asked questions about the game; the question was \"Is Herobrine in this game too?\" and the answer given was \"&lt;REDACTED&gt;\". This was later removed from the FAQ page. In the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//discord.com/invite/minecraft\"&gt;Official Minecraft Discord&lt;/a&gt;, there is a sticker called \"Him\", which references the image in the \"Him\" website linked to Brocraft viewers after the Herobrine stream.\nLegacy Console Editions.\nOne of the in-game &lt;a href=\"loading%20tips\"&gt;loading tips&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt;s references Herobrine: \"We think &lt;a href=\"4J%20Studios\"&gt;4J Studios&lt;/a&gt; has removed Herobrine from the [console] console game, but we're not too sure.\"\nHerobrine is part of the first &lt;a href=\"skin%20pack\"&gt;skin pack&lt;/a&gt; released on the Legacy Console Editions. Because of this addition, \"sightings\" rose drastically due to players using the skin. However, the skin was omitted from the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; version of the skin pack. Herobrine then made more appearances as a \"Zombie Herobrine\" skin in the third skin pack, a \"Party Herobrine\" skin in the first birthday skin pack, and an \"Xmas Herobrine\" skin in the festive &lt;a href=\"mash-up%20pack\"&gt;mash-up pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nChangelogs.\nHerobrine has been said to be removed from the game in numerous changelog entries. The first of these mentions was in &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.6.6\"&gt;Beta 1.6.6&lt;/a&gt;, as a joke referring to the partial removal of the human mob's essential code, making it unspawnable within \"Minecraft\". An ulterior motive may have been to troll the community, as this was around the time Herobrine had gained memetic status. After that, most \"Minecraft\" update changelogs since then until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.16.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.16.2&lt;/a&gt; included the entry \"Removed Herobrine\" at least once every update cycle as a running gag, with an exception, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.1&lt;/a&gt;. This changed after Java Edition 1.16.2, where he was never mentioned in any changelogs up until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.20\"&gt;Java Edition 1.20&lt;/a&gt;, where he was once again removed.\nIn the changelog of &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt; version &lt;a href=\"Launcher%202.2.176x\"&gt;2.2.176x&lt;/a&gt;, released soon after the &lt;a href=\"world%20seed\"&gt;world seed&lt;/a&gt; of the original Herobrine screenshot was discovered, the developers said that they \"removed Herobrine from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.16_02\"&gt;Java Alpha 1.0.16_02&lt;/a&gt;\", the version in which the screenshot was taken.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20120714105228/https%3A//www.mojang.com/2012/07/minecraft-xbox-360-edition-update-is-out/\"&gt;update for Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; on July 13, 2012 (&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU3\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition TU3&lt;/a&gt;), Herobrine was stated to be removed from the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt; of \"Minecraft\" for the first time. He was then removed again in &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU5\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition TU5&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the changelog for version 0.103.0 of \"&lt;a href=\"Scrolls\"&gt;Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\", another game by Mojang, Herobrine being removed was in the changelog's miscellaneous section.\nMojang reactions.\nMojang has, albeit rarely, shared their views on Herobrine. Their reactions have varied from plainly stating that he does not exist to Notch saying he appears only when players ask him.\nWhen asked if he would like to update his stance, Kappische replied:\nLost media.\nNo known archive exists of the earliest 4chan thread containing the original Herobrine story. The creepypasta image on this wiki was likely obtained from a 4chan thread from late August 2010, but it is unknown whether the creepypasta was originally presented this way, or if the image was created later.\nThe original Herobrine livestream was located &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.livestream.com/minecrafterryday/video%3FclipId%3Dpla_30d1b597-bc86-45c5-83d6-30527e2fd85e\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the second Herobrine livestream was located &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.livestream.com/minecrafterryday/video%3FclipId%3Dpla_7c528f18-2c03-4cb2-9e14-9ee8e4e7d312\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Both livestreams were deleted at some point during the following months, and no known backups are available. Copeland, the Brocraft founder, and Livestream.com have all stated that they do not have a backup copy of these streams.\nOn July 15, 2024, the original livestream by Copeland was found by a YouTube user Brutallillfjomp who stated that he had the stream downloaded from the original website since 2010 on his hard drive, he then uploaded the stream onto YouTube.\nThe earliest known Herobrine plugin was located &lt;a href=\"http%3A//taylorkelly.me/plugins/Herobrine/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This was likely also deleted at some point during the following months, and no known backups of any of the original versions of the plugin are available either.\nAny users who may have captured, recorded, or downloaded these media for personal use are encouraged to share them for future generations of \"Minecraft\" fans.\nStream recreation.\nA recreation made in collaboration with Copeland of the Herobrine scene from the first stream can be found below:"}
{"id": "36290", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=36290", "title": "Herobrine/StreamFAQ", "text": "1 - How did you decide to stage this hoax?\nI came across the original Herobrine creepypasta on /v/ and immediately liked it. The first thing I did was photoshop Herobrine into one of my screenshots and I posted it in the stream's chat. It got a pretty big reaction from everybody, ranging from laughs to people asking me through PM if it was real because they were scared. It was pretty great, so I knew the next step would be to include Herobrine into one of my streams. I spent a little while brainstorming different ideas, and testing out different things in game. Initially I wanted to do it on SMP (SMP having come out about 3 weeks prior) but SMP was very glitchy at the time, and too much could have went wrong. Retexturing blocks was out of the question since the wall 'Herobrine' was on was an outside wall, and could be seen easily. I ended up retexturing a painting since there were none in my world at the time and it looked pretty good at a glance. My world had both wood and iron doors at the time of the hoax, so those wouldn't have worked.\nI started the stream like normal and just played Minecraft like normal, except avoided going near the room the Herobrine painting was in. About 2 hours into the stream I went into the room pretending like I was going to furnish it but he was right in front of the door, just as planned. I screamed and jerked the camera away so nobody could get a good look at it. I thought it was pretty darn believable!\n2 - How many people were \"in\" on it?\nNobody. I was originally going to ask somebody to be Herobrine over SMP, which would have involved somebody else, but since that wasn't needed I didn't see any reason to tell anybody. I didn't admit he was real to anybody - even my closest friends - until almost an entire year after the incident.\nPeople often assume that Patimuss and I conspired together for our two different sightings, but that's not true. I actually wasn't even around when he did his stream, and didn't even know he did until I came on the site afterwards. \n3 - You had a lot of choice for your hoax. It could have easily been Slenderman, or a more notable meme. Why herobrine?\nLike I mentioned earlier, I liked the original creepypasta originally. Unlike Slenderman or anything else, it was Minecraft specific. I think that's what it had going for it, really. It just wouldn't be the same if it was just an old meme thrown into the Minecraft world. Nobody would care about a Slenderman sighting in Minecraft. \n4 - How did you think the community would have reacted to your stream?\nI thought a couple hundred people would enjoy it and it'd be forgotten about by the next week. I really didn't expect a whole lot to happen with him - if I had, I'd of put a little more effort into my first post and advertised the stream more in it ;]. \nBut, seriously, I did not expect it at all. Then again, Minecraft was a lot less popular back then - and I didn't expect the game to explode into the popularity it has now, either.\n5 - How did you react when the community started to really get into the video?\nYeah - surprised mostly. The whole thing just kept growing and growing. I loved reading all the posts people made in the original thread but then people started making their own threads, and then their own fake sightings, and then videos. It quickly went from me enjoying the few posts it got to it getting too many mentions for me to possibly ever read. It was pretty weird watching it grow like that. \n6 - Did this change anything with the stream, in regard to content, audience etc.?\nYeah, most definitely. For the first day or so you really couldn't go back 10 lines without somebody saying something about Herobrine. Then it started to die down on the second and third days, since all of the regulars in the stream had gotten bored with him, but then all these new people started coming by and talking about Herobrine again. We got a lot of new people into the stream after the hoax, but most didn't stay very long. We ran a pretty adult-rated stream, and I feel like a lot of the Minecraft Forum users were younger. I was unwilling to change my content for the new audience, so most ended up leaving pretty fast. Still, with the large number of new people checking it out a small percentage stayed, and our audience grew pretty significantly. \n7 - When Herobrine's popularity exploded, was there any form of spam? any backlash?\nTons of it. We had lots of new guys coming into the chat and saying stuff like \"Where's Herobrine?\", \"Is he real?\", \"So you did Herobrine?\". A lot of the older viewers weren't too happy with that. I Wasn't, either, to be honest, but there wasn't a whole lot I could do - our chat program was pretty limited. I also had a lot of people who blamed me for Herobrine's popularity, and got upset at me because they were tired of hearing about him everywhere. I understand that, but, the blame was definitely missplaced there. I couldn't stop it at that point, nor was I the one posting about him any more. \n8 - This hoax propelled your stream for a while, being a very popular source of mystery for a brief while. Did any of this newfound popularity stick?\nHaha, not really. After a few months with the video gone and the original post buried, seeing people asking about him only happened a few times a day. We did gain a small number of loyal viewers, though, and they stuck around. Then I had broke off with my partner on Brocraft and started a new stream, and while a lot of people migrated over and we kept the same chat and Livestream channel, we no longer have the old Brocraft URL or name - so after the move the number of people asking about him fell to almost none.\n9 - When you created this hoax, what did you see Herobrine as being? vengeful? or just creepy?\nI always kind of viewed him as being pretty scary, but not dangerous. I never thought of him as something that could hurt the player or even destroy their projects. To me he will always be off in the distance, watching the player from afar and leaving little clues about his presence, but never directly interacting with you. \n10 - Why do you think the community latched on to your stream so much?\nHonestly, I think the stream was pretty convincing. I had plenty of people who genuinely asked me if he was real or not. I even had people who knew me for a while saying things like \"Copeland never screams like that, it sounded like he was genuinely terrified\". Even the video seemed pretty convincing - so long as you didn't pause it. And since it was all done live, and the first 2 hours of the stream didn't even hint at what I was going to do, it all just seemed like it could have maybe been real. And I like to think that little bit of doubt people have is what helped make the video so popular.\n11 - Do you feel partly responsible for herobrine's popularity?\nNot really. Sure, I'm happy with how the stream went and I think it was pretty convincing, and I think that without the stream Herobrine would have probably stayed an obscure creepypasta - but it was the community that made it popular. After the initial stream and subsequent forum post I was done. I didn't do anything else at all to help Herobrine's popularity. I guess I sparked the popularity, instead of helped it. Maybe that's more fitting. \n12 - What are your thoughts on Mojang's stance on implementing Herobrine?\nI don't think Herobrine should be added to the game. I think that would ruin a lot of what makes Herobrine what he is. As soon as you make him canon you can't make legends or rumors about him any more, and that's most of the fun.\n13 - What do you think of the Herobrine mod that's floating about? Anything you particularly like, or dislike about it?\nI've actually never heard of it before right now. I found the most popular \"Herobrine mod\" on the forums - I assume that's the one you're talking about. I read about it and watched the videos and it doesn't seem like my version of Herobrine at all. But that's the beauty of urban legends; you're free to interpret it how you like, and expand on the story, give it your own twists. \n14 - What happened to Brocraft since the stream?\nI left the site a few months after the hoax. I ran the site with an ex-buddy of mine, and the two of us had a big argument over what's acceptable on the site and I ended up running my own stream. He kept the URL and the \"Brocraft\" name, but I kept the Livestream channel. I'm not really sure what's happened on there since then. \n15 - What are your current thoughts on Herobrine?\nHonestly, I don't really have many. Herobrine was fun for a while but got old pretty fast. I really haven't thought much about Herobrine at all in the past 2 years. If I happen to see him mentioned I think \"Oh, hey, Herobrine, I remember him\" and that's about it. Someone on my Steam Friend's list had to tell me about the Wikipedia page. It incorrectly said I had a wife for 2 years. \n16 - If you had a second chance, would you have done this stream any differently?\nHmm, not really. I probably would have plugged the stream in the original forum post, but that's about it. I'm happy with my contribution to the whole Herobrine thing, and I don't think I could have done a whole lot else, or even anything better."}

I ran it with a buddy of mine and streamed a lot on it, particularly Minecraft. \nI came across that creepypasta for Herobrine on /v/, I think, one day. I liked it. The next day I took a screenshot of my current Minecraft world and photoshopped Herobrine into it - just for funsies. I posted that picture in chat and got all sorts of reactions out of people. It was fun! I knew I had to do a stream involving him. \nI spent a little while in Photoshop putting an image of Herobrine on a painting (Yup - it was definitely a painting) and then put that painting up in a small room in one of my 'in-progress' houses. My map was small at the time, I think it only had 3 houses. Anyway, I started streaming and avoided that room for about an hour to 2 hours, to make it all seem more legit. I then happened to run into the room and directly in front of the door was Herobrine. I screamed and ran out of the house and turned off the stream. \nI pretended to be all shook up about it in chat and then shortly after posted that post on the Minecraft Forums, hoping to get a rise out of them, too. \nA few hours after my stream I got rid of the painting, reverted to the original paintings textures and streamed again. I pretended to do everything cautiously and scared like and entered in the same room, but no Herobrine this time ;]. I then deleted the world on stream and vowed to never play it again. \nAfter my stream another streamer on the site named \"Patimuss\" did *his* fake Herobrine sighting (In the lava field). I had no idea he was going to do this and he never asked or told me about it. Honestly, I was kinda sad he did. He was the one who admitted to his wife it was fake - something I disapproved of. \nI'm not sure if I put the \"Him.html\" page up before or after Patimuss streamed *his* Herobrine sighting, but I put it up either shortly (&lt;24 hours) before or after his stream. Either way, it was never a forced redirect to the page - I just linked it in chat for people to click on themselves. The eyes were pretty creepy though.\nAnd that's about it. After that people started doing their own Herobrine stuff and it exploded pretty fast. I kept pretending Herobrine was real for the better part of a year after the stream, and it was a meme in chat that my stream was real and Patimuss just faked a sighting to try to be popular. \nAll in all, pretty fun times. \n--Copeland"}

Disused textures which were used for a given feature in previous versions are not listed here, nor are textures which became used in a version after the texture itself was added, even if the texture in question was changed first (examples being &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, the original &lt;a href=\"end%20stone\"&gt;end stone&lt;/a&gt; texture, the original two &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; texture variants, and the pigman, which was later retconned to the &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;).

It may have been an early experimental &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; texture, as &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; had stated interest in adding snow and ice before this point, or it could relate to clouds, as they were added in the same version. This texture was removed from &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.15a%20%28Multiplayer%20Test%201%29\"&gt;0.0.15a&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrick texture variations.\nIn the versions of &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; used between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.26%20SURVIVAL%20TEST\"&gt;0.26 SURVIVAL TEST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.30\"&gt;0.30&lt;/a&gt; inclusive, there existed four textures very similar to the existing &lt;a href=\"bricks\"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt; texture, although with subtle differences. These textures were removed from &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; at the start of Indev.\nChair textures.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%2020100206\"&gt;Indev 20100206&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100627\"&gt;Infdev 20100627&lt;/a&gt; two textures were present in &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; which were based off of the oak planks texture. The first texture is commonly recognised to be the side view of a chair, and the other texture is often interpreted as being either the front view of a chair or a side a table, although the latter was never mentioned by Notch and as such this interpretation remains speculative.\nIndev 20100206 also added a duplicate oak planks texture. This may have been intended to be used for such blocks as well (as the back or seat portion), or it may have simply been the texture copied for the other two textures to be cut from,mars said textures are clearly oak planks derivatives. This was removed earlier than the other two textures in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100607\"&gt;Infdev 20100607&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100618\"&gt;Infdev 20100618&lt;/a&gt;, the chair texture specifically changed to be slightly darker, which was likely unintentional: the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; textures, which were relatively close to it on &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;, were also darkened in said version, and the second texture remained completely untouched.\nDuring the period of time where these textures existed in &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;, Notch made multiple statements of plans to implement chairs, alongside mentions of other furniture (like doors, signs, ladders and chairs).\nIntriguingly, these textures were added in the exact same version as &lt;a href=\"Wheat%20Seeds\"&gt;wheat crops&lt;/a&gt; and farming mechanics were. Crops of invalid data values (8 and beyond, as wheat normally only grows to 7) would overflow to the next line of &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;, due to how wheat models and texture selection were defined at the time. Data values 11 and 12 specifically happened to use the exact spots where these two textures were positioned, resulting in wheat with these data values appearing as rather broken chairs. It is speculated, although not at all proven, that Notch may have positioned these textures at these positions as an early test for their models, although given their buggy and unrealistic appearances this is rather unlikely.\nMojang have since rejected the idea of adding \"furniture\" blocks to the game, as their existence would \"inhibit natural creativity\".\nPossible coral texture.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100629\"&gt;Infdev 20100629&lt;/a&gt;, a texture was added to &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; of completely unknown use. This texture was composed of several transparent, black, white and various shades of gray pixels. This texture was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.4\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.4&lt;/a&gt; with its position being taken by the snowy &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; side texture.\nThe addition of this texture to &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; roughly coincides with Notch mentioning an attempt to add coral blocks to the game, according to a post on The Word of Notch documenting a failed attempt to draw a realistic-looking coral block texture. The texture's hyperbolic appearance does in fact resemble the early iterations of coral blocks showcased at Minecon in 2017.\nGrass block top texture duplicate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6%20Test%20Build%203\"&gt;Beta 1.6 Test Build 3&lt;/a&gt;, a duplicate of the grass block top texture was added to &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;. As this version also added &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s, which appear adjacent to this texture, it is highly likely that this texture was copied simply to pick the colors from during texturing, and was accidentally left in.\nInterestingly, in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease%205\"&gt;Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5&lt;/a&gt;, despite being completely unused in-game, this texture was actually changed alongside other block textures that changed in this version. The actually used grass block texture also changed in this version, however despite both textures being identical beforehand, the Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5 textures made the two textures visually distinct from each other.\nThe &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.2.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, being based off of the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;Java Edition 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, also includes this texture. It was also present in \"Xbox 360 Edition\" since its inception, due to initially being based on &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6.6\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.6.6&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe texture was eventually removed from \"Java Edition\" in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w02a\"&gt;13w02a&lt;/a&gt; and \"Pocket Edition\" in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.8.0%20alpha%20build%202\"&gt;v0.8.0 alpha build 2&lt;/a&gt; due to the deprecation of &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in those versions. It was removed from \"Xbox 360 Edition\" in &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU12\"&gt;TU12&lt;/a&gt; due to being replaced by the vertical &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; texture, although it still technically persists in the base game as the original &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; was never removed, despite never being used in TU3 onwards.\n\"Footprints\" texture.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8%20Pre-release\"&gt;Beta 1.8 Pre-release&lt;/a&gt;, a texture possibly composed of three footprints was added to &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"terrain.png\"&gt;terrain.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;. Its intended use is unknown. The texture was eventually removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w03a\"&gt;13w03a&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;'s deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and &lt;samp&gt;results.png&lt;/samp&gt;.\nThis texture also carried on to Pocket Edition in v0.2.0 alpha due to the &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; used then being based off of the one from Java Edition 1.0.0, before its removal in v0.8.0 alpha build 2.\nThe texture was also present in \"Xbox 360 Edition\" since &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU0\"&gt;TU0&lt;/a&gt; due to said version including a copy of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.2&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;. It was re-replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Placeholder%20texture%23Texture%20atlas%20blank%20spaces\"&gt;lilac placeholder texture&lt;/a&gt; in TU12.\n\"Village border\".\nThese textures, also added to &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in Beta 1.8 Pre-release, remained unused and were removed in 13w03a per &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;'s deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and &lt;samp&gt;results.png&lt;/samp&gt;. These textures were said to have been used to mark the edges of &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s as seen in the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt; PAX demo, however footage of these textures in action does not seem to exist.\nThe \"edge\" texture was carried to Pocket Edition in v0.2.0 alpha, however the \"corner\" texture was not, as its place was taken up by the &lt;a href=\"info_update\"&gt;info_update&lt;/a&gt; texture. The \"edge\" was removed in v0.8.0 alpha build 2 alongside many other such textures.\nBoth textures were present in \"Xbox 360 Edition\" since TU0 due to said version including a copy of Java Edition 1.2's &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;. In TU12, the \"edge\" was replaced by the bottom texture of the &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20quartz\"&gt;block of quartz&lt;/a&gt; (later known as the &lt;a href=\"smooth%20quartz\"&gt;smooth quartz&lt;/a&gt; texture), and the \"corner\" by the top texture of the &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeta/Release white texture.\nThe last of four unused textures added in Beta 1.8 Pre-release, this white texture was located alongside the three others. Its use is also unknown (potentially, it could be meant to be a \"snowy\" overlay for saplings), and was removed in 13w02a per &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;'s deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and &lt;samp&gt;results.png&lt;/samp&gt;.\nThis texture never appeared in Pocket Edition Alpha, as its position was taken by the texture for &lt;a href=\"info_update2\"&gt;info_update2&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe texture was present in \"Xbox 360 Edition\" since TU0 due to said version including a copy of Java Edition 1.2's &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;. It was re-replaced by a lilac placeholder texture in TU12.\nPaeonia.\nThe paeonia was a &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt; type originally planned for implementation in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;. Originally revealed by &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; in a screenshot, the flower was ultimately never implemented, ultimately superseded by the &lt;a href=\"peony\"&gt;peony&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the texture for the paeonia was still added to the game's texture files in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w36a\"&gt;13w36a&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;samp&gt;flower_paeonia.png&lt;/samp&gt;, alongside all the actually implemented flowers. This texture persisted in the files for over four years, eventually being removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt; without a doubt due to resource changes and &lt;a href=\"the%20Flattening\"&gt;the Flattening&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterestingly, despite the texture being completely unused throughout its presence in the game files, paeonias were redone in the &lt;a href=\"Texture%20Update\"&gt;Texture Update&lt;/a&gt; beta packs for an unknown reason.\nVine variants.\nThree unused &lt;a href=\"vine\"&gt;vine&lt;/a&gt; variant textures were present in early revisions of the &lt;a href=\"texture%20update\"&gt;texture update&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarrel variants.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.9.0.2\"&gt;beta 1.9.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, these two barrel top textures were added to Bedrock Edition's block textures, but were unused. The \"empty\" texture visually resembles the later-introduced open texture. What these textures were specifically intended for remains unknown, and it is not known if they have been removed yet.\nIt is extremely likely that the textures would be used as follows:\nWax block.\nA texture for a wax block was added to the game files in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2019w34a\"&gt;19w34a&lt;/a&gt;. This texture was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2019w42a\"&gt;19w42a&lt;/a&gt;, as it was never actually intended to be used.\nAs this was a lone texture, it is implied that it would simply be rendered as a full cube:\nCalibrated sculk sensor.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w49a\"&gt;20w49a&lt;/a&gt;, these two textures were added to the &lt;samp&gt;assets/minecraft/textures/blocks&lt;/samp&gt; directory. The top texture is a translucent version of the &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20amethyst\"&gt;block of amethyst&lt;/a&gt; texture, where the side texture is composed of the &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt;'s side texture overlayed on the amethyst texture. Interestingly, the amethyst textures are based on those from 20w45a, despite these textures being added in 20w49a after the amethyst block textures were redone twice, implying these textures come from a probably long-since-scrapped functionality of the sculk sensor coupled with amethyst. \nThe textures were removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2021w13a\"&gt;Java Edition 21w13a&lt;/a&gt;. The calibrated sculk sensor was later reimplemented on snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2023w12a\"&gt;23w12a&lt;/a&gt; with a new texture.\nPossible interpretations of how these textures could have actually looked in-game are as follows:\nRoot vines.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2021w05a\"&gt;Java Edition 21w05a&lt;/a&gt;, this texture called &lt;samp&gt;root_vines_head.png&lt;/samp&gt; was added to the &lt;samp&gt;assets/minecraft/textures/block/&lt;/samp&gt; directory. This was an early design for &lt;a href=\"cave%20vines\"&gt;cave vines&lt;/a&gt;. There is no known \"body\" texture despite this being implied by this texture being named \"head\" alongside the naming of existing cave vines.\nThe texture was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2021w16a\"&gt;Java Edition 21w16a&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiven its translucent appearance, it likely would have been rendered as a cross, similar to cave vines and &lt;a href=\"weeping%20vines\"&gt;weeping vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnused.\n&lt;samp&gt;debug.png&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;debug2.png&lt;/samp&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt;, these two textures were added to the game, where they remain to the current day. Given their name, they are used for debugging purposes by Mojang, likely for the creation and testing of block textures and &lt;a href=\"model\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;samp&gt;debug.png&lt;/samp&gt; could be made to appear in-game in certain &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; snapshots due to being defined as the particle texture for &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s, meaning actions that would result in the creation of particles (such as falling from a height onto the edge of a block next to a bubble column) would show particles with this texture. They could also be seen when the bubble column was pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being unused, both of these blocks were given new textures for the &lt;a href=\"Easter%20eggs%232018\"&gt;2018 April Fools&lt;/a&gt;' update:\nItems.\nRemoved.\nStudded armor.\nStudded armor refers to four armor item textures which were found in the initial versions of &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"items.png\"&gt;items.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;, alongside the leather armor, chain armor and plate (iron) armor sets. First appearing in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31%2020091231-2\"&gt;the second December 31, 2009 build&lt;/a&gt;, the sprites technically did see use in-game, but this is of little significance as all sprites on &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt; were used at the time, with basically no functionality. These textures were taken directly from one of &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch's&lt;/a&gt; games \"&lt;a href=\"Legend%20of%20the%20Chambered%202\"&gt;Legend of the Chambered 2&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe textures were ultimately removed some time between &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31%2020100204-1\"&gt;the 4th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%2020100206\"&gt;6th of February, 2010&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for the actual implementation of armor and its mechanics.\nQuiver.\nThe quiver was another item texture which existed in &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt; &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31%2020091231-2\"&gt;from the very beginning&lt;/a&gt;, but which persisted for much longer. Having its origins in &lt;a href=\"Legend%20of%20the%20Chambered\"&gt;Legend of the Chambered&lt;/a&gt;, one of Notch's prior games, the texture was also included among the first item sprites in the game. While it too technically existed as an item, it was also ultimately nonfunctional and only existed for testing purposes.\nIts texture was changed &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%200.31%2020100122\"&gt;on the 22nd of January, 2010&lt;/a&gt; by flipping it horizontally from its original orientation.\nThe texture remained in &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt; for as long as &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt; itself existed, and even outlived it, becoming an individual file in 13w02a with &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt;'s splitting, and still not being removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w24a\"&gt;13w24a&lt;/a&gt; with the advent of &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s despite many other unused textures being deleted.\nDespite the quiver texture continuing to exist in the game unused, &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; stated in 2011 he would not add quivers to the game as an item.\nDuring the development of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; posted a 2\u00d7204960 image on Twitter which could be reformed into a 854\u00d7480 Minecraft screenshot, clearly depicting the quiver as a usable item in the inventory, where it had what seemed to be a dedicated slot alongside a slot for &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. On June 30, 2015, Dinnerbone posted that he removed them again as holding arrows in the off-hand felt \"more natural.\"\nAs a result of this scrapping, with there no longer being any planned future uses for the texture, it was ultimately removed in 1.9's first snapshot: &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe quiver texture was also present in Pocket Edition's &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt; file and, reflecting the behavior of early Indev, was even unintentionally assigned to an invalid ID item. Its removal time is unknown, and it was later re-added. It was also present in the \"Legacy Console Edition\" from the start, being replaced by the &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt; item texture in &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU43\"&gt;TU43&lt;/a&gt; and equivalent versions.\nHandheld camera.\nBetween &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.1.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.1.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.2.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, there was an unused item texture resembling a handheld camera, next to the texture for the actual &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; entity.\nRuby.\nRubies were intended to be the original currency used for &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;. They could be seen in a screenshot released by Jeb on 21 May 2012, in which the trading system was first being tested. While it was later decided that &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s would take their place as a currency, a ruby texture still made its way into &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2012w21a\"&gt;Java Edition 12w21a&lt;/a&gt; alongside that of the emerald. The unused ruby texture which was present in the game differed from the version shown in the screenshot, however; both versions of the texture are shown below for the sake of comparison.\nAlongside emeralds, 12w21a also implemented &lt;a href=\"emerald%20ore\"&gt;emerald ore&lt;/a&gt; as a method of obtaining them. However, the intended emerald ore was accidentally left out of this release, and as such the emerald ore block instead used a texture clearly more reminiscent of something that would yield rubies as a drop. &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2012w21b\"&gt;Java Edition 12w21b&lt;/a&gt; was swiftly released to patch this, giving emerald ore its intended release texture. There were also translation strings in the game's language files referencing rubies and ruby ore, which were ultimately removed in the full release of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.10\"&gt;Java Edition 1.10&lt;/a&gt;:\nLater it was reimplemented as a joke feature in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2023w13a%20or%20b\"&gt;23w13a_or_b&lt;/a&gt; snapshot. \nEmeralds were decided upon over rubies as &lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt; stated he had difficulty distinguishing between ruby ore and &lt;a href=\"redstone%20ore\"&gt;redstone ore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being completely unused throughout its existence in the game files, it, like the quiver, inexplicably survived the splitting of &lt;samp&gt;items.png&lt;/samp&gt; and remained in the game as an unused texture file for much longer than expected. It even beat the quiver in longevity, remaining unused in the game for close to a decade prior to its removal in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2021w13a\"&gt;Java Edition 21w13a&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe texture was added to \"Pocket Edition\" in v0.8.0 alpha build 2, likely on accident, as all item textures from \"Java Edition\" at the time were likely indiscriminately copied over and stitched into &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"items-opaque.tga\"&gt;items-opaque.tga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; without concern for what was actually used. It was eventually removed in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.14.0%20alpha%20build%201\"&gt;the first v0.14.0 build&lt;/a&gt; (but later re-added). The texture was also added to \"Xbox 360 Edition\" in &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU9\"&gt;TU9&lt;/a&gt;, and remained in the console editions until &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU54\"&gt;TU54&lt;/a&gt; and equivalent versions, in which it was replaced by one of the textures used for &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; items.\n in the now-discontinued game \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Earth\"&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/a&gt;\", but with completely different textures from those present in the main game.\nBanner item textures.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt; snapshots, starting with &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w30a\"&gt;Java Edition 14w30a&lt;/a&gt;, there were two unused item textures, \"banner_base\" and \"banner_overlay\", probably intended to be used together as a recolorable inventory icon for &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s. The texture for \"banner_base\" was removed in &lt;a href=\"16w41a\"&gt;16w41a&lt;/a&gt; and the texture \"banner_overlay\" was removed in &lt;a href=\"17w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrystallized honey.\nA texture for a crystallized honey item was added to the game files in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2019w34a\"&gt;19w34a&lt;/a&gt;. This texture was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2019w42a\"&gt;19w42a&lt;/a&gt;, as it was never actually intended to be used.\nMask Spawn Egg.\nThere is an unused spawn egg texture in the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; files.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; 1.15, On pocket devices (PE) When moving the &lt;a href=\"Bee\"&gt;Bee&lt;/a&gt; Spawn Egg, The Mask &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Egg\"&gt;Spawn Egg&lt;/a&gt; Can be seen for a Split Second.\nUnused.\nUnused potions.\n&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; has unused &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; textures for several &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;s, along with their &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash&lt;/a&gt; variants. These effects are: &lt;a href=\"Absorption\"&gt;Absorption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blindness\"&gt;Blindness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Health%20Boost\"&gt;Health Boost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nausea\"&gt;Nausea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saturation\"&gt;Saturation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Levitation\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; potion textures also present in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;. These unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.1%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha&lt;/a&gt;, except for the potion of levitation, which was added in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;Pocket Edition 1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;. The textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the &lt;a href=\"texture%20update\"&gt;texture update&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.10.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.10.0&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely, the potion of levitation texture is a duplicate of the splash potion of levitation texture.\nUnused compounds.\nIn the chemistry resource pack folder of the &lt;a href=\"education%20edition\"&gt;education edition&lt;/a&gt;, there are numerous &lt;a href=\"compound\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; textures which are not used in the game, including a variant of the &lt;a href=\"bleach\"&gt;bleach&lt;/a&gt; texture.\nEntities.\nRemoved.\n&lt;samp&gt;2char.png&lt;/samp&gt;.\n&lt;samp&gt;2char.png&lt;/samp&gt; is a texture that was added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.20a\"&gt;Java Edition Classic 0.0.20a&lt;/a&gt;. The texture is mostly identical to that of Steve except for being entirely white. It was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.2.2\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2&lt;/a&gt;, which likely had something to do with the addition of texture pack support.\n&lt;samp&gt;char_2.png&lt;/samp&gt;.\n&lt;samp&gt;char_2.png&lt;/samp&gt; is a texture that could be found in the jar file for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%2020100212-1\"&gt;the first Indev build released on February 12, 2010&lt;/a&gt;. The texture is mostly identical to that of Steve, with the difference being the presence of two yellow pixels on the head, as well as hair being present in the hat layer as well as the base. It was removed &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Indev%2020100214-2\"&gt;two days later&lt;/a&gt;.\nDoor entity.\nOn 3 June 2010, Notch discussed on his blog plans to add different types of furniture to the game, which included doors. These postings include discussions of implementing said furniture in the form of entities as opposed to blocks, as was previously done for &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s in Indev, with Notch also stating his successful reimplementation of &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s the previous day as a &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt;. If implemented as a block entity, this would allow doors to have a smooth opening and closing animation, similarly to what was added for &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s a bit over a year later by converting them from normal blocks.\nDoors were ultimately added &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100607\"&gt;on the 7th of June, 2010&lt;/a&gt;, as a relatively normal block, which would instantly open or close when interacted with, having no continuous animation in the process as had been mentioned. However, the &lt;samp&gt;/item&lt;/samp&gt; directory in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;, which stored the textures for other non-mob entities at that time such as &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, gained a texture called &lt;samp&gt;door.png&lt;/samp&gt; in this same version, which is without a doubt linked to said opening/closing animation. An early iteration of the oak door can be seen in it, with empty space filled out in solid purple in a fashion resembling the &lt;a href=\"Placeholder%20texture%23Texture%20atlas%20blank%20spaces\"&gt;placeholder texture from &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;kz.png&lt;/samp&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as the checkerboard &lt;a href=\"missing%20texture\"&gt;missing texture&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn interesting thing to note about this door texture is the absence of any windows, a significant difference from the door actually implemented in the June 7th Infdev build, the top half of which does have a transparent window. The item form, however, still did not have a window in it until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.1\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, meaning said item form was likely based off of this early iteration of the door before the animation was scrapped and the now comparatively inanimate door being given a window.\nThis door entity texture was one of many unused textures removed in 13w24a with the reconfiguring of game assets and the introduction of resource packs as the successor to texture packs.\nPigman.\nAn unused &lt;a href=\"pigman\"&gt;pigman&lt;/a&gt; texture was added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.2.0\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0&lt;/a&gt; and later removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w24a\"&gt;Java Edition 13w24a&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;samp&gt;villager.png&lt;/samp&gt;.\nVillagers were added to Java Edition in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease\"&gt;the first Beta 1.9 prerelease&lt;/a&gt;, with their textures located together in a dedicated subfolder of the mob textures folder: &lt;samp&gt;/mob/villager&lt;/samp&gt;. However, another texture was added in this version, called &lt;samp&gt;villager.png&lt;/samp&gt;, which is directly in the mob folder itself rather than the villager subfolder. (It is not to be confused with the \"generic\" file also called &lt;samp&gt;villager.png&lt;/samp&gt; which is located in the villager subfolder, which was later used for &lt;a href=\"nitwit\"&gt;nitwit&lt;/a&gt;s.) This texture is completely unused, and closely resembles Steve, but with significant modifications to fit a different entity model.\nIf this texture is applied to a villager through use of a custom texture pack, the overall appearance is glitchy, implying that the model it was intended to be used for had changed since, and was eventually developed into the villager model that was actually released.\nAlong with many other unused textures, &lt;samp&gt;villager.png&lt;/samp&gt; was removed in 13w24a when texture packs were succeeded by resource packs.\nDuplicate ender dragon textures.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease%204\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4&lt;/a&gt;, two unused duplicate &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; textures, titled \"body\" and \"dragon\", were added, probably left over from an earlier phase in development, as they resemble other pre-release ender dragon textures that Notch shared on twitter. They were removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.6.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkis.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2012w50a\"&gt;12w50a&lt;/a&gt;, a snapshot for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.6\"&gt;Java Edition 1.4.6&lt;/a&gt;, a texture named &lt;samp&gt;skis.png&lt;/samp&gt; was added to the game. 1.4.6 was released close to Christmas of 2012, meaning this texture was likely decided upon due to the time of this update's release. The texture was never actually intended to be used, and instead added by Dinnerbone as a . \nLike many other unused textures, it was removed in 13w24a with the switch to resource packs. The texture was once again reimplemented as a joke feature in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2023w13a%20or%20b\"&gt;23w13a_or_b&lt;/a&gt;. \nParticles.\nRemoved.\nLight blue particles.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.4\"&gt;Beta 1.4&lt;/a&gt;, two blue particles were added to &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"particles.png\"&gt;particles.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; of completely unknown use. They visually resemble water droplets, possibly implying early plans to add the water dripping event later added in 1.0.0, or a change to existing water splash effects. These particle textures were eventually removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2019w06a\"&gt;19w06a&lt;/a&gt; due to the splitting of &lt;samp&gt;particles.png&lt;/samp&gt; into its constituent textures, with unused particle textures being removed outright.\nThe textures were also added to Pocket Edition in v0.1.0 alpha due to its &lt;samp&gt;particles.png&lt;/samp&gt; being the same as the version from Beta 1.4. It existed in Bedrock Edition up to release 1.16.\nIt may be worth noting that these two particles also closely resemble the existing used \"flame\" and \"lava\" particles in shape, possibly hinting at a planned connection:\nAngry villager head.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2012w34a\"&gt;12w34a&lt;/a&gt;, a texture resembling an angry-looking &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; head was added to &lt;samp&gt;particles.png&lt;/samp&gt;. However, it remained unused, likely superseded by the cloud texture next to it. This texture was also removed in 19w06a due to being unused.\nThis unused texture was added to Pocket Edition in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.12.1%20alpha%20build%201\"&gt;v0.12.1 alpha build 1&lt;/a&gt; due to it changing to use a &lt;samp&gt;particles.png&lt;/samp&gt; based on the one from 12w34a. It still exists in Bedrock Edition's &lt;samp&gt;particles.png&lt;/samp&gt; as of 1.16.\nUnused.\nElephant toothpaste.\nAn unused particle called &lt;samp&gt;elephant_toothpaste.png&lt;/samp&gt; was added to the chemistry pack of Education Edition in an unknown version. It appears to be a particle atlas similar to that of campfire smoke, recolored to appear lighter.\n is a popular demonstration in introductory chemistry, and as such was likely intended to be implemented among the other educational chemistry content, but was later scrapped.\nSoul lava.\nIn an unknown build of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.16.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.16.0&lt;/a&gt;, a \"soul lava\" particle was added to &lt;samp&gt;particles.png&lt;/samp&gt;. It can be seen that this particle is to the \"lava\" particle texture what the soul flame particle is to the ordinary \"flame\" particle. While likely added for consistency, it appears completely unused and whether it was actually planned for use at all is unknown.\nUnlike normal &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;s, soul campfires do not emit any type of ember. This is due to there being no defined particle for a soul ember, something which this texture would fill in. However, despite this, the texture is yet to make any appearance in Java Edition and remains unused in Bedrock Edition.\nMiscellaneous.\nwaterterrain.png.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100615\"&gt;the 15 June 2010 Infdev release&lt;/a&gt;, a texture file named &lt;samp&gt;waterterrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; was added to the jar file. Resembling &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt; in name, dimensions and the use of similar lilac textures in empty spots, it featured a multitude of different directional symbols.\nSince this was added in the same version that implemented new flowing mechanics for water and lava, it is extremely likely that this was used to test its flow directions: the presence of two sets of icons implies one set was used for water and the other for lava (further reinforced by one being blue and the other pink), the circle would represent still fluids, the eight orthogonal/diagonal arrows would correspond to orthogonal flowing, and the downwards arrow the sides of liquid (\"waterfalls\").\nIt is also possible that it was intended as a texture atlas for fluid textures, distinct from block textures, and that the textures present on it at the time were placeholders.\nUltimately, flowing liquids simply used a 32x32 texture each (which remained within &lt;samp&gt;terrain.png&lt;/samp&gt;), rotated accordingly depending on the flow direction (which could be orthogonal, diagonal or knightwise, the last of which this sheet did not account for), and this file fell into disuse. It was eventually removed in Alpha v1.2.2 with the addition of texture pack support.\nwatercolor.png.\n&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.6%20Test%20Build%203\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.6 Test Build 3&lt;/a&gt; introduced this file to the &lt;samp&gt;/misc/&lt;/samp&gt; directory in the jar file. This image was a color map intended to be used depending on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, similarly to the existing &lt;samp&gt;grasscolor.png&lt;/samp&gt; and &lt;samp&gt;foliagecolor.png&lt;/samp&gt;, where a color would be selected from a point on the image depending on temperature and humidity.\nIntended for use on water, with the game even containing unused code around the time of its introduction which would apply it to water, it ultimately remained unused, with water maintaining a constant color regardless of biome at the time. This may or may not be due to water's texture being blue at the time, rather than the gray or white required for an effective tint, and as such multiplying it with a color would yield undesirable results (tinting already-blue water with another shade of blue would just make it much darker and unsightly); since water's texture was &lt;a href=\"Procedural%20animated%20texture%20generation\"&gt;generated at runtime rather than defined as an image&lt;/a&gt;, actually making water's raw texture be gray would be a non-trivial task.\nBiome-tinted water was first introduced in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.9%20Prerelease\"&gt;Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease&lt;/a&gt;, but only to a very limited extent, as swamps were the only biome to have a tint defined, and as water's texture was still blue by default, swamp water had to be tinted green to make it appear browner.\nWhen procedurally-generated animated textures were replaced by texture files in 13w02a, the water texture was still inherently blue, even though making it gray or white would have been an easy task at this point and would allow &lt;samp&gt;watercolor.png&lt;/samp&gt; to be used for biome-dependent water colors.\n&lt;samp&gt;watercolor.png&lt;/samp&gt; was ultimately removed in 13w24a alongside many others due to it remaining unused.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w15a\"&gt;Java Edition 18w15a&lt;/a&gt; expanded on biome-dependent water tints (and made the water textures white to accommodate this), the subject biomes still remained limited, as swamps and different temperature oceans were the only biomes to have colors which differed from the default color specified. These colors were values explicitly specified per biome, rather than taken from a colormap like &lt;samp&gt;watercolor.png&lt;/samp&gt;. As a result of this approach, there are currently several oversights in the current game where special water colors have not been defined for certain biomes even when they should be.\nReimplementing and actually using this file for the majority of biomes, like is done for grass and foliage, with swamps and possibly a few other biomes being the only remaining special-cased biomes, would likely resolve this issue in its entirety, as there would no longer be a need to specify water colors in biome json files; a blank entry would cause the game to seek out a value from the color map, which is what happens currently for grass and foliage."}

Hitboxes are utilised in the calculations of collisions and targeting.\nUnlike with block models, all hitboxes are hardcoded and cannot be changed without modification, even via data packs.\nHitbox.\nCollision box.\nA collision box is used to manage collision with entities.\nA collision box is not present for all blocks, as all &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block\"&gt;non-solid blocks&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; have no collision box.\nOutline box.\nAn outline box is shown when looking at a given block. It becomes visible as a wireframe outline when a &lt;a href=\"Heads-up%20display\"&gt;crosshair&lt;/a&gt; is pointed at the block.\nInteraction box.\nAn interaction box deals with aiming at blocks. When the interaction box of a block is targeted, the block can be broken, placed on or interacted with as necessary.\nIts default is the same as the outline box. However, the interaction box is incapable of extending outside of its own block space, despite the outline box being capable of doing so visually. There are several instances where this can be seen: \nBlock.\nBlock support shape.\nA block support shape is mainly used to judge whether another attaching block (e.g. torches, doors, buttons, etc.) can be attached to it.\nIts default is the same as the collision box. There are some exceptions:\nEntity.\nList of entity hitboxes.\nThe hitboxes of all entities (except &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Item%20Frame\"&gt;item frames&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Painting\"&gt;paintings&lt;/a&gt;) are always shaped in cuboids (square base), which does not always overlap with the visual parameters of the entity. For example, the &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;'s hitbox does not include the top section of its hat, and the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;'s hitbox does not include the two heads on its sides. Because most hitboxes are cuboids, it is standard to measure them by their width and height, with the width being the size of the base (which is a square) and height being the number of blocks tall (so a width of 0.6 means the entity is 0.6 blocks wide).\nBelow is a list of every entity's hitbox size (as of Java 1.19.2). The hitbox sizes of entities in Bedrock Edition vary greatly from the information below, which only gives Java hitboxes.\nNon-constant hitbox sizes.\nThe size of an entity's hitbox is not necessarily static and may change depending on certain circumstances. For instance, a player's hitbox gets smaller while crouching, and the hitbox of a pufferfish changes while it's puffed out. Below is a list of all the entities who's hitbox can change sizes given specific causes. \nBoundary box.\nThe boundary box of entities can be viewed via the + debug shortcut. \nInteraction box.\nInteraction box deals with aiming at entities. When the interaction box of an entity is targeted, the entity can be hit or interacted with as necessary.\nEye level.\nThe eye level is outlined in red, and appears only on the hitboxes of all Entities. It is responsible for suffocation and drowning damage; a mob will take suffocation damage or lose air and drown if its eye level is inside a solid block or water respectively. Eye level also changes the rendering Minecraft uses if its eye level is inside water or lava respectively."}

Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.\nTilling.\nHoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;. To till, press on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.\nHoes can be used to convert &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt; into regular dirt by pressing on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.\nHoes can also be used on &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a &lt;a href=\"hanging%20roots\"&gt;hanging roots&lt;/a&gt; item.\nTilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.\nHoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.\nWeapon.\nHoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only damage . , hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 2 durability when used as a weapon.\n, hoes have an attack speed modifier depending on the material: wood and gold have a modifier of -3 (refill in 1s), stone has a modifier of -2 (refill in 0.5s), iron has a modifier of -1 (refill in 0.33s), and diamond and netherite have a modifier of 0 (refill in 0.25s).\nHoes always attack instantly .\nEnchantments.\nA hoe can receive the following enchantments and curses:\nFuel.\nWooden hoes can be used as a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1 item per hoe.\nPiglins.\n are attracted to golden hoes and run toward any golden hoes on the ground, and inspect them for 6 to 8 seconds before putting them in their inventory."}

A hoglin attacks by thrusting its tusks upward, which can also launch its target a short distance into the air. Hoglins are repelled by &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;warped fungi&lt;/a&gt; that is placed in the world as well as active &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Respawn%20Anchor\"&gt;respawn anchors&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaby hoglins behave similarly, but have a much weaker attack (the weakest attack in the game) with normal knockback, and flee when hit.\nSpawning.\nHoglins are found in herds of 3\u20134 in &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt;s, respawning over time. They can spawn at any &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; and on most solid blocks other than &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart%20block\"&gt;nether wart block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shroomlight\"&gt;shroomlight&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHoglins spawn in certain types of &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s upon structure generation. They spawn frequently in the hoglin stable variant (specifically the large and small stables in the \"lower\" area, but never in the \"upper\" area with ramparts), and sometimes in the main \"bridge entrance\" at the upper half of the rampart in the bridge variant. Similarly to the &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s there, these hoglins never despawn.\n20% of hoglins spawn as babies.\nHoglins spawn in &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, but are passive to players.\nDrops.\nAdult hoglins &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; when killed:\nBaby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins.

They naturally sink in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and eventually drown. They also sink in &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; and are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage. Hoglins can be led with a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; despite the fact they are hostile.\nHostility.\nHoglins attack any &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; within 16 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s with a reach of 1.9 blocks. An adult knocks its target upward. Players can still be flung even if they block with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Hoglins do not attack a player standing near &lt;a href=\"Tags%23blocks%20hoglin%20repellents\"&gt;a block that repels them&lt;/a&gt;, but run away from the block unless they have already chosen to attack. Hoglins are 60% resistant to knockback. Unlike other hostile mobs, they do not prevent a player from &lt;a href=\"Bed%23Sleeping\"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilarly to &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, a player or mob attacking a hoglin provokes all nearby hoglins. Attacking a baby hoglin does not trigger this behavior.\nIf a piglin attacks a hoglin, all the hoglins in the area retaliate. Hoglins also flee if outnumbered and make retreating sounds. If the piglins are outnumbered by hoglins, they flee and make retreating sounds.\nHoglins that spawn upon generation of &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s are not hunted by piglins.\nBaby hoglins.\nBaby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and normal knockback. If the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.\nBaby &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s run near and ride baby hoglins. If there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.\nZombification and Zoglins.\nIf a hoglin spawns in or moves to the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, it shakes and then transforms into a &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt; after 15 seconds. The newly-created zoglin gets &lt;a href=\"Nausea\"&gt;Nausea I&lt;/a&gt; for 10 seconds. This Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior. , any &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; attached to the hoglin breaks when it converts, even though zoglins can have leads attached to them.\nBreeding.\nOther than the &lt;a href=\"killer%20bunny\"&gt;killer bunny&lt;/a&gt;, the hoglin is the only hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; that can be &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;bred&lt;/a&gt;. Hoglins can be bred using &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;crimson fungi&lt;/a&gt;. It takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature. Baby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away. Feeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.\nHoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors or &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFeeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from &lt;a href=\"despawning\"&gt;despawning&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether the breeding is successful or not. The baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nHoglins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nHistory.\n \nGallery.\nDuring development.\nThese images were showcased at Minecon Live 2019 or afterward, but before hoglins were added in &lt;a href=\"20w06a\"&gt;20w06a&lt;/a&gt;."}

Honey blocks are sticky and can be used in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt; to move blocks and adhered &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nHoney blocks can be broken instantly, and always drop as an item, regardless of what is used to mine them.\nCrafting.\nThe 2\u00d72 inventory &lt;a href=\"crafting%20grid\"&gt;crafting grid&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient to craft a honey block.\nUsage.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;, the honey block does not carry a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; signal because it is a transparent block.\nRedstone.\nWhen being moved by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, entities on a honey block's top surface move with it. They are not launched in the direction of the push, as a slime block would do.\nWhen a honey block is moved by a piston, it attempts to move all adjacent blocks in the same direction. A honey block can move any block a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; can \"pull\", except for &lt;a href=\"glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s. The blocks that are moved may, in turn, push other blocks, as if they were being pushed by a piston. For example, a honey block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which pushes additional ground blocks in the direction of motion.\nWhen the adjacent block that is moved is also a honey block, that block \"also\" attempts to move all its adjacent blocks. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of honey blocks may be pushed or pulled as a unit by a single piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube.\nA honey block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons ignores the immobile block. However, if an adjacent block \"could\" be moved but is prevented by the presence of an immobile block, the honey block is also prevented from moving. &lt;a href=\"Liquid\"&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;s are an exception: they are not moved, but neither do they stop a piston from pushing or pulling blocks into their space (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-75581\"&gt;usually destroying the liquid, and in a rare case displacing it through the piston&lt;/a&gt;). Honey blocks, unlike &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s, cannot have a redstone signal sent through them via a &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nHoney blocks are not pulled by a non-sticky piston, nor are they moved if an adjacent (non-honey) block is moved by a piston.\nThe maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d73 of honey blocks may be pushed or pulled by a sticky piston as long as no other movable blocks are adjacent to it. However, the platform in which a honey block shifts is entirely dependent on the placement of the sticky piston, as well as placement of blocks too.\n honey blocks moved by pistons do not move entities that are touching the side or bottom of the block.\n honey blocks moved by pistons do move entities that are touching the side of the block.\nSlowing down entities.\nHoney blocks slow down &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; walking on top of them and prevent them from &lt;a href=\"jumping\"&gt;jumping&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Players\"&gt;Players&lt;/a&gt; walking on honey blocks move 2.508 m/s, about a 60% reduction from the normal walking speed. , players also slow down slightly if walking up against the side of it. Players, who can normally &lt;a href=\"Player%23Jumping\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s high, can jump about blocks high on honey; this is an 85% reduction. They can more easily step up onto other blocks than jump up onto them.\nThis effect applies even through other blocks on top of honey blocks, as long as they are half-block or less in height - so the player cannot jump on &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s, bottom &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"daylight%20detector\"&gt;daylight detector&lt;/a&gt;s that are placed on honey blocks.\nThis effect also applies regardless of a player's mode of movement, such as gliding with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;.\nSliding.\nEntities pressed against the sides of a honey block slide down at a slow speed and do not take fall &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, similar to going down a &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; but with a gradually decreasing horizontal momentum. This allows players to jump 2 blocks further by holding on to the walls. The slowdown induced by honey blocks also stacks with the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Falling\"&gt;Slow Falling&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nFalling.\nAs with &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s, falling onto a honey block reduces fall damage by 80%. For example, if a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; falls from a height that would normally cause fall damage, the fall causes damage instead.\nBees.\nWhen a honey block is near &lt;a href=\"bees\"&gt;bees&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;, bees occasionally fly close and attach to it for a few seconds, resembling an action of eating honey. When doing this, the bee stops fluttering its wings, and firmly attaches its face to the honey block regardless of whether flowers are nearby.\nCrafting ingredient.\nAlthough the 2\u00d72 inventory crafting grid is sufficient to craft a honey block, a 3\u00d73 crafting table grid is required to convert a honey block back into four honey bottles."}

A hopper can be locked with &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone power&lt;/a&gt; to stop it from moving items into or out of itself.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nTo obtain a hopper, it with a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Using any other item to mine a hopper drops only its contents.\nCrafting.\nA hopper can be crafted from 5 iron ingots and a chest.\nUsage.\nA hopper can be used as a container, as a crafting ingredient, and as a redstone component.\nA hopper has an \"output\" tube at its bottom that can face down or sideways and provides a visual indication of which block the hopper is set up to drop its items into, if that block has an inventory. To place a hopper, use the control while aiming at the surface to which its output should face (Hoppers \"do not\" orient themselves automatically). To place a hopper directly on the face of an already interactable block, the player can while placing the hopper. Attempting to place a hopper aimed on the bottom face of a block instead faces downward. With some blocks, such as the &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;, the hopper has multiple uses. A hopper does not change direction after placement, and it is not attached to the container it faces; the container can be removed or replaced, and the hopper remains unchanged.\nHoppers cannot be moved by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite not being a solid block, attached blocks such as &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; dust can be placed on top of hoppers, but not on their sides.\nContainer.\nA hopper can be used as a container and has 5 slots of inventory space.\nTo open the hopper GUI, use the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;. To move items between the hopper inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the hopper GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the hopper GUI, use the key, B button or circle button, depending on the device.\nBy default, the GUI of a hopper is labeled \"Item Hopper\". A hopper's GUI label can be changed by naming the hopper in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; before placing it, or, , by using the &lt;a href=\"Commands%23data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; command (for example, to label a hopper at (0,64,0) \"Steve's Hopper\", use codice_1).\n, a hopper's GUI can be \"locked\" (or subsequently unlocked) by setting the hopper's codice_2 tag with the &lt;a href=\"Commands%23data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; command. If a hopper's codice_2 tag is not blank, the hopper cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the codice_2 tag's text. For example, to lock a hopper at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"Steve's Key\" can access the hopper, use codice_5.\nCrafting ingredient.\nA hopper can be used to craft a &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20hopper\"&gt;minecart with hopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedstone component.\nWhile a hopper is \"not\" powered by redstone signals, it operates with three functions:\nA hopper first attempts to push any items inside it. Afterward, it checks if the block above it is a type of container. If so, it attempts to pull from it. Otherwise, the hopper attempts to collect item entities. Notably, hoppers can push to and pull from other hoppers, forming hopper pipes or hopper chains, which allow transporting items across several blocks and are further discussed below.\nRedstone signals.\nWhen a hopper receives a redstone signal (and is considered to be \"activated\"), all three functions stop. To avoid confusion over the terms \"activated\" and \"deactivated\", powered hoppers are often described as being locked and unpowered hoppers described as being unlocked. Hoppers can be powered by &lt;a href=\"Redstone_mechanics%23Power\"&gt;soft powered&lt;/a&gt; blocks, meaning a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; trail pointing into a block touching the hopper locks it just as effectively as a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20block\"&gt;redstone block&lt;/a&gt; or any other &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Power%20components\"&gt;power component&lt;/a&gt; touching the hopper. When the hopper is unlocked during a redstone tick, it does not push or pull/collect during the same tick, but has a delay of 1 redstone tick instead.\nWhile a locked hopper does not push or pull/collect items, it may still receive items from &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s and other hoppers, and may have its items pulled out by another hopper beneath it. Hence, the item flow in a horizontal hopper pipe may be stopped by locking just one of the hoppers, but stopping a vertical hopper pipe requires locking two adjacent hoppers at the same time, such that both the pushing of the top one and the pulling of the bottom one are stopped. \nA hopper does not output any redstone signals by itself, but its fullness can be read using a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;, which needs to be placed next to it and facing away from it. An empty hopper outputs a signal strength of 0 and a completely full hopper outputs a signal strength of 15. Notably, a single stackable item (16 or 64) outputs a signal strength of 1 and a single non-stackable item outputs a signal strength of 3. \n, if the hopper being read is part of a horizontal hopper pipe, the comparator can individually read each item passing through the chain, because items are pushed through the hoppers one by one at a speed that is manageable by the comparator. If there is an uninterrupted stream of items, the comparator does not switch off in between items. On the other hand, in a vertical hopper pipe, some of the hoppers may never produce a reading above 0, even with a continuous stream of items, because pushes and pulls both occur in the same game tick: The hoppers' items get pulled out a single game tick after they're pushed in and this isn't measurable by a comparator, because comparators need measurements lasting at least 1.5 redstone ticks to produce a reading. \nCollecting items.\nA hopper collects items dropped on top of it if the space above the hopper not occupied by a storage block. Items are gathered from the entire 1 block space above the hopper, meaning that items sitting on partial blocks such as &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; directly above a hopper can be collected. It is also possible for a hopper to collect items from inside a full, solid block, a situation that might come from items rising up through solid blocks or being &lt;a href=\"commands/summon\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt;. Item entities are not collected when they are outside of the collection area however; for example, items on top of a stone block directly above a hopper are not collected. Collected items are placed in the leftmost empty slot of a hopper's inventory.\n, if there is no container above the hopper, then the hopper collects dropped items in the order in which they landed on the hopper. This order is remembered even while a hopper is locked. For instance, if a hopper is locked under a carpet while a fully equipped &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt; is broken above it, then it always collects items in this order when it is unlocked: &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leggings\"&gt;leggings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chestplates\"&gt;chestplates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"helmets\"&gt;helmets&lt;/a&gt;. This is due to the order in which these items land. , hoppers do not remember the order in which items land on the hopper. Instead, hoppers with multiple dropped items above them collect the items in the order in which they entered the chunk in which the hopper is located. Items that drop from a broken armor stand are collected in a random order.\nHoppers usually check for dropped items every &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt; and they can collect items even before they are picked up by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or destroyed by &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. However, hoppers have a \"collection cooldown\" time. After collecting an item (or stack of items), a hopper waits (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before attempting to collect again.\nHoppers collect groups of items all at once rather than collecting them as single items one at a time. As a result, hoppers can collect item entities much faster than they can pull items from a container. Pulling from a moving &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20chest\"&gt;minecart with chest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20hopper\"&gt;minecart with hopper&lt;/a&gt; is even slower, since the minecart is not always above the hopper.\nPushing and pulling items.\nA hopper with a storage container above it (such as a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;, or another hopper) attempts to pull from the container instead of checking for floating items above it, and hence can not collect items. A hopper always tries to push or pull items using the leftmost available slot. When a hopper is removing items from a chest, the items disappear from left to right. Similarly, when filling up a chest, the chest fills up from left to right. Hoppers prioritize pulling from the first slot of a container over pulling into the first hopper slot. If a hopper has stone in its first slot and nothing in its second while the container it is pulling from has chicken in its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pulls the chicken from the first slot of the container into its empty second slot. However, if the hopper is unable to pull the chicken, such as if all slots are filled with stone, the hopper pulls the stone from the second slot of the container instead. Similarly, hoppers prioritize pushing from their first slot over pushing into the first slot of a container. If a hopper has stone in its first slot and chicken in its second while the container it is pushing to has chicken it its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pushes stone from its first slot into the second slot of the container.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; the checks done by a hopper while pulling generally require less processing than the checks done by a hopper attempting collection. Therefore, a chain of hoppers topped with storage containers rather than air/solid blocks has better performance (measured as milliseconds of processing per tick) and lower potential for processing lag. The performance improvement achieved is correlated with the number of storage slots the container has. Placing composters (with no storage slots but still with custom output logic) on top of hoppers provide the greatest efficiency, while double chests actually degrade performance, even when sharing each double chest across two hoppers. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; a chain of hoppers with air or non-container blocks on top has better performance than a chain of hoppers topped by container blocks. This may be because, even though hoppers with containers on top do not check for items, they do check for hopper-minecarts and chest-minecarts to pull from, and that involves scanning the chunk entity list.\nItem pushes and pulls are processed in the same game tick, but pushes are processed before pulls. In the schematic, the empty hopper first pulls an item from chest A as it cannot push anything into chest B. After the cooldown, the hopper first pushes its item into chest B before pulling another item from chest A, both pushing and pulling in the same tick, and the process repeats. The hopper stops pulling when A is empty, and stops pushing when B becomes full.\nHoppers also have a \"transfer cooldown\" time. After pulling and/or pushing items, a hopper waits (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before pulling or pushing again (a transfer rate of 2.5 items per second, barring lag). A hopper that has an item pushed into it from another hopper also starts a 4 tick cooldown period, regardless of whether it pushed or pulled items itself. Item entities can be collected at any time without affecting the transfer cooldown time. The transfer cooldown and the Bedrock Edition collection cooldown are independent of each other.\nContainer interactions.\nSome &lt;a href=\"container\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;s interact with hoppers in specific ways:\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA hopper has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block."}

{"id": "39488", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39488", "title": "Horse", "text": "Horses are &lt;a href=\"Mobs%23Passive%20mobs\"&gt;passive mobs&lt;/a&gt; that can be ridden when &lt;a href=\"Taming\"&gt;tamed&lt;/a&gt; and saddled.\nSpawning.\nHorses spawn in &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;s in herds of 2\u20136. For horses, all combinations of color and markings are equally likely. All members of the herd have the same color, but markings may vary. 20% of all individual horses spawn as foals.\n&lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;s naturally generate with stables and animal pens containing horses.\nAppearance.\nEach horse variant has unique features and markings, and a foal (baby) version. Adult horses are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Foals start at half the size of adults, and , get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, the appearances of horses do not change once they have been tamed, though tame horses may be differentiated by giving them equipment.\nHorses have a stocky build. They can have 1 of 7 base colors: white, buckskin, flaxen chestnut, bay, black, dapple gray, and dark bay; and 1 of 5 marking patterns: \"no markings\", \"stockings and blaze\", \"paint\", \"snowflake appaloosa\" and \"sooty\". In total, there are 35 possible horse coat combinations.\nUnlike almost all other mobs, horses with equipped saddles don't render these when under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nUpon death, horses drop:\nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped. \nKilling a foal yields neither items nor experience.\nUsage.\nTamed and &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;d horses can be used as a means of &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; in the game. When ridden, they are able to move faster and jump higher than a normal player. Horses can be used to climb hills and jump fences, as some can jump high enough to clear up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of about one (without jump boost).\nHorses cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\nHorses can be pulled along and tied up using a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;. They can be towed in two ways: Horses can swim behind a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; by using a lead, or a boat can be attached to a lead (before putting the horse in the boat) and the player can swim to tow the boat containing the horse. \nEquipment.\nTamed horses have the following two slots available:\nFoals cannot be equipped.\nEquipment can be placed on a horse by holding it and then on the horse, or by accessing its inventory. A horse\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the horse and using control, or by and then or pressing the \"open inventory\" button on the horse. A normal horse\u2019s inventory has two &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt;s, one for a saddle and one for horse armor.\nRiding.\nOnce a horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, , and the mouse. The player dismounts using the control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; while on a horse.\nA ridden saddled horse automatically runs up any one block high slope. The horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\nThe maximum speed of horses varies between 4.74\u00a0blocks/second and 14.23\u00a0blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.317\u00a0blocks/second). About 82% of horses are able to go faster than a minecart. Horses move backward slowly, about as fast as the player when moving sideways. A horse\u2019s speed can also be affected by potions. Speed has no relation to a horse\u2019s outward appearance.\nRidden saddled horses have the ability of \"jumping charging\". When the player rides them, the experience bar on &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled horse can be made to and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\nBehavior.\nHorses wander aimlessly, occasionally stopping to rear, flick their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. If a player comes near, the horses may turn to look at them. Any horse, even a wild or undead horse, can be attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; without protest, although an untamed horse rears and flails its forelegs if saddled. Horses remain passive, even when hit.\nHorses make neighing and whinnying sounds.\nHorses, like most mobs, can ride in a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. Adult horses cannot ride in boats. Unlike other passive mobs, horses slowly regenerate health. \nTamed (and untamed) horses can be led by a player holding a &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt;. Baby horses follow adult horses.\nTaming.\nTaming a horse is required to breed it, to give it equipment, or to control it while riding.\nA player mounts a horse by pressing on it with an empty hand, or while holding an object that cannot be used on a horse. A player tames an adult horse by repeatedly mounting it until the horse stops bucking off the player. Taming depends on the horse's \"temper\". Horses begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player first mounts the horse, a random taming threshold 0\u201399 is chosen. The horse becomes tame if the temper exceeds this threshold. Otherwise, the player is bucked off and the temper is increased by 5, to be compared against the threshold the next time the player mounts the horse. Temper can also be increased by feeding the horse.\nAfter repeated mountings, hearts appear above the horse, indicating that it is tamed.\n, like all tame animals, when a horse is killed, a death message is displayed to every player.\nBreeding.\nFeeding two tamed horses &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s activates &lt;a href=\"love%20mode\"&gt;love mode&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to mate and produce a foal. The foal appears more spindly than adult horses and grows in stages to full size with time. The foal can be fed to make it mature faster.\nDepending on the variations of the parent horses, the offspring can be one of several types. \nThis is a table representing the probabilities of the color and markings of the foal when breeding two horses A and B.\nFood.\nFeeding a horse food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health. The table below lists the effects of the various foods horses can take. &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Horse\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Horse\"&gt;skeleton horses&lt;/a&gt; cannot be fed, even if tamed.\nTo feed a horse, hold a valid food item and press use on the horse. Feeding invalid food causes the player to mount the horse. Horses can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\nStatistics.\nAll horses have three \"equine stats\" that vary from horse to horse: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump height. These stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\nSpawned values.\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20trap\"&gt;skeleton trap&lt;/a&gt;, or using spawn eggs \u2013 horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges.\nHealth.\nHorse's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt; ranges from 15\u201330, with an average of . Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart. One may test this by hitting a horse: if the horse has lost one-half heart from one punch, it has an even number of health points. Otherwise, odd.\nMovement speed.\nHorse's movement speed ranges from 0.1125\u20130.3375 in internal units, with an average of 0.225. For reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1. The speed listed does not include any &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; that affects the speed of the horse or the player.\nThe conversion factor between internal units and blocks/sec is roughly 43.17. However, horses instead travel at just shy of 42.16 blocks/sec times their internal attribute, putting the best horse's maximum speed at 14.23 blocks/second, and the average horse's speed at about 9.49 blocks/sec.\nSee also \"&lt;a href=\"Transportation%23Methods\"&gt;transportation methods&lt;/a&gt;\" to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\nJump strength.\nHorse's jump strength ranges from 0.4\u20131.0, with an average of 0.7.\nA jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear blocks.\nBred values.\nWhen breeding two horses, or a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by averaging both parent's stats and adding a random variation to it.\nThe variant of the child has an 11% chance to be a random base color, and a 20% chance to have random markings. Otherwise, it chooses the values from one of its parents.\nSounds.\nHorses use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nHorses have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

It has many different parts and sections to it. It is located at the Settings menu. To access the guide, go to the home screen with the options Play, Settings, and Marketplace, and click on Settings. On the next page, click on How to Play, which is the second selection shown. A list of topic links then appear on the left, with content on the right. These sections are reproduced below.\nThis content of this article reproduces the game's \"How to Play\" guide in its entirety, with some reformatting, rephrasing, and internal linking as needed for optimal presentation as a Wiki page. The table of contents on the right includes all of the topics in the game's guide, starting with \"What's new\".\nWhat's new.\nWhen viewed, this shows the patch notes, or opens up &lt;a href=\"https%3A//educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047556451\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; \nBasics.\nMinecraft is a game about placing blocks to build anything you can imagine. At night monsters come out, so make sure to build a shelter before that happens.\nControls.\nSneaking is incredibly useful in Minecraft. It keeps you from falling off of a block and hides your nametag.\nHUD.\nThe heads-up display (HUD) shows information about your status, your health, your remaining oxygen (when you are underwater), your hunger level, and your armor (if you are wearing any).\nIf you lose some health but have at least nine , your health gradually replenishes. Eating food replenishes your .\nYou must watch your hunger level while adventuring, your hunger level is represented on your HUD with . The hunger level decreases as you explore. Certain activities decrease hunger level at a faster rate, such as sprinting. You can replenish your hunger level by eating food. Some foods are more nourishing than others and fill up more . When you get your hunger level up to maximum, the last food you ate applies a saturation value. Saturation is a hidden number that gives you an extra bonus to your hunger level.\nThe experience bar is also shown on the HUD. The number shows your current experience level, and the bar indicates how many Experience Points are required to increase your experience level.\nExperience points (referred to as XP) are gained by collecting &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s. You can get experience orbs from activities such as killing mobs, mining certain blocks, and more! Don't leave any experience orbs behind, you're going to need them. Move near experience orbs to collect them.\nThe hotbar shows the items that are available to use.\nInventory.\nThe inventory screen shows the items that are available for use in your hand, and all of the other items that you are carrying. Your armor is also shown here.\nEducation.\nWorld builder.\nTo place or use certain \"Education Edition\" blocks or items, a player must possess a special ability called \"world builder\".\nWith cheats activated, the host can enable or disable the world builder ability for any players in the world.\nTo grant world builder ability to all players in the world, run the following command: \nTo quickly toggle your own World Builder ability, run either of the following commands: or \nTo query your World Builder ability, run the following command: \nPermission blocks.\n, special blocks make it easier for teachers to create and employ lessons. Only players with World Builder ability can place and destroy these blocks. Only players without World Builder ability are subject to the restrictions imposed by these blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Allow%20and%20Deny\"&gt;Allow and Deny&lt;/a&gt; blocks control where players can build in a world.\nPlayers can place or destroy blocks above Allow blocks. Players cannot place or destroy blocks above Deny blocks.\nAllow and Deny blocks do not affect the area below them.\nAn Allow block with a Deny block somewhere below it prevents players from building in the space between the two blocks. Above the Allow block, players can place and destroy blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Border\"&gt;Border&lt;/a&gt; blocks provide a force field that extends infinitely upward and downward, regardless of the presence of other blocks. Players cannot move through, over, or under a border block. Players cannot place or destroy blocks that are above or below a border block.\nChalkboards.\n&lt;a href=\"Chalkboard\"&gt;Chalkboard&lt;/a&gt;s are used to display text in the world. Chalkboards display more text than signs, can be edited after they have been placed, and come in three sizes: slate, poster, and board. The lock toggle allows you to prevent non-World Builders from destroying or editing your chalkboards.\nChemistry.\nStudents can simulate real world chemistry by using the Chemistry Equipment blocks. Build any of the 118 different elements by adjusting the sliders in the &lt;a href=\"element%20constructor\"&gt;element constructor&lt;/a&gt; or view the composition of elements by placing them in the element constructor. Combine elements in the &lt;a href=\"compound%20creator\"&gt;compound creator&lt;/a&gt; to produce chemical compounds. Put elements and compounds into the &lt;a href=\"lab%20table\"&gt;lab table&lt;/a&gt; to create Minecraft items. Reduce blocks to their component elements with the &lt;a href=\"material%20reducer\"&gt;material reducer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDownload the chemistry journal from the \"Minecraft: Education Edition\" website for a comprehensive guide to chemistry in \"Minecraft\".\nNon-player characters.\nA non-player character (NPC) can provide additional lesson information, hints, or instructions.\nOnly world builders can place, delete, name, or edit NPCs. NPCs can execute commands and link to websites. Commands can be assigned to buttons in the NPC's dialog window; website links always have a button.\nNPCs have a variety of skins to choose from and are immobile.\nCamera.\nThe &lt;a href=\"camera\"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; allows players to take pictures in the world.\nPictures can be viewed in the &lt;a href=\"portfolio\"&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt; or inserted into the &lt;a href=\"book%20and%20quill\"&gt;book and quill&lt;/a&gt;.\nPortfolio.\nPictures you have taken appear in the &lt;a href=\"portfolio\"&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen viewing the portfolio, you can add captions to pictures, delete pictures, or export pictures as a series of images.\nClassroom mode.\n&lt;a href=\"Classroom%20mode\"&gt;Classroom mode&lt;/a&gt; is an external application that provides educators with features designed to facilitate interaction with students. You can download classroom mode from the \"Minecraft: Education Edition\" website.\nAs the host of a world, use the command to launch the classroom mode app and connect it to \"Minecraft: Education Edition\".\nCode builder.\n&lt;a href=\"Code%20builder\"&gt;Code builder&lt;/a&gt; allows players to explore, create, and play in \"Minecraft\" by writing code using familiar learn-to-code platforms.\nFirst day.\nTools.\nThere are many tools in Minecraft that allow you mine blocks faster than your fist. Tools can be crafted from &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the right tool for the job not only mines that block faster, but also costs less durability. More complex tools must be created in order to mine rarer resources.\nAll of these tools can accept enchantments, either from an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are even more tools to aid you on your adventure:\nWeapons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is the primary melee weapon in \"Minecraft\". It can be made from &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt;. Jump attacks do critical damage! (Jump and press the attack button before touching the ground, if you did it correctly, particles should come out)\nThe &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; is the primary ranged weapon in \"Minecraft\". The bow requires &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s to fire.\nAn arrow shot from a bow deals more damage the further the bow is drawn back, so make sure to pull the bow all the way back. However while charging you will move slower and may leave you vulnerable.\nThe &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; is an alternate ranged weapon. The crossbow requires &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s to load. Once the crossbow is loaded, it stays loaded until it is fired, even if you put it in your inventory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; is a dual-purpose melee and ranged weapon. A trident is the best underwater weapon.\nThe sword, bow, crossbow, and trident have specific enchantments that you can get from the Enchanting Table or Anvil to improve damage, durability, and even light mobs on fire!\nNightfall.\nIn \"Minecraft\", the sun rises and sets as you adventure in your world. As the sun sets, you must take precautions. There are many dangers at night!\nIf you have not already, you need a place to take shelter from the dark and what lurks within it. This can be as simple as a hole in the side of a hill or a small cabin in the forest.\nBe sure to block off all entrances, you may want to use a door so you can go in and out. If you have made a bed this is a good place to put it along with your Crafting Table and Furnace.\nAlso be sure to light up the area with torches, it may save your life.\nNavigation.\nNavigation is an important skill that you must learn in \"Minecraft\", because it isn't always easy to find your way home.\nFirst of all, there are some basic tools that you should know about.\nTry to watch for landmarks as you explore. The more you play on a world, the more you can remember where you are. Another good trick is to place Torches as you go so that you may find your way back home.\nThe sun can also tell you what direction you are facing. Remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west! Clouds in the sky also move from east to west.\nThere are several places for you to explore. Find a village and look for a &lt;a href=\"cartographer\"&gt;cartographer&lt;/a&gt;, who can offer you a trade for an &lt;a href=\"explorer%20map\"&gt;explorer map&lt;/a&gt; that guides you to strange places far away.\nCrafting.\nCrafting table.\nThe &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; lets you craft more complicated recipes.\nFurnace.\nA &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; allows you to cook or smelt items. For example, you can smelt &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nYou need to put some fuel into the bottom of the furnace, and the item that you want smelted in the top. The furnace then ignites and start working. Lots of things can be used as fuel; try experimenting with anything burnable such as &lt;a href=\"Coal\"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt;!\nAnvil.\nExperience Levels can be used to repair, enchant, or rename items with the &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll items can be renamed, although only items with durability can be repaired or enchanted with &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn item can be repaired by placing it in one of the input slots on the left, along with either some raw materials of the item, like &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s for an iron sword, or combined with another item of the same type.\nCombining items is more efficient when done with an anvil.\nThere is a chance for the anvil to be damaged with each use, and it is eventually destroyed with enough usage.\nEnchanting table.\nThe &lt;a href=\"experience%20points\"&gt;experience points&lt;/a&gt; collected by picking up &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to enchant &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen an enchantable item is placed in the slot below the &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;, the three buttons to the right of the slot displays some enchantments with their experience cost and &lt;a href=\"Lapis%20Lazuli\"&gt;Lapis Lazuli&lt;/a&gt; cost.\nThe actual enchantment applied is randomly selected based on the cost displayed.\nIf the enchantment table is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; (up to a maximum of 15), with a one block gap between the &lt;a href=\"bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelf&lt;/a&gt; and the enchantment table, arcane glyphs are seen going to the book on the Enchantment Table and the potency of the enchantments increase.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20book\"&gt;Enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s are used at the anvil to apply enchantments to items. This gives you more control over which enchantments you would like on your items.\nBrewing stand.\nBrewing &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s requires a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;. Every potion starts off with a bottle of water, which is made by filling a &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt; with water from a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; or water source.\nA brewing stand has three slots for creating different potions. One ingredient can be used over all three bottles, so always brew three potions at the same time to best use your resources.\nPutting &lt;a href=\"netherwart\"&gt;netherwart&lt;/a&gt; in the top position of the brewing stand gives you an &lt;a href=\"awkward%20potion\"&gt;awkward potion&lt;/a&gt;. This doesn't have any effect by itself, but creates a base potion that can be used to create more advanced potions.\nThere are many potion effects to discover, experiment with different ingredients and combinations to become a true alchemist.\nBanners.\n&lt;a href=\"Banner\"&gt;Banner&lt;/a&gt;s are a cool way to decorate your house or castle with custom patterns and colors.\nAfter crafting a banner, you can put it on a crafting table or &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt; and add different dyes to create your own unique, cool design!\nThere are many different patterns that you can create with your dye such as:\nExperiment with different combinations to get even more patterns!\nA banner can also have multiple layers, allowing you to have more than one pattern on your banner. If you don't like the last pattern you put on a banner, you can wash the last layer off in a cauldron.\nIf you want to copy a banner, put it on the crafting table with a blank banner.\nCauldron.\nThe &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; is a container that can hold buckets or bottles of liquid.\nA &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; only partially fills a cauldron, so you must use multiple Potions to fill it up completely.\nDifferent kinds of arrows can be created by dipping them into a cauldron filled with an appropriate potion.\nApply dye to a cauldron of water as described below to change the color of the water inside of the cauldron, and then dip the &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; armor into the cauldron. If you want to wash the dye off, dip the dyed item into a cauldron of undyed water. This applies to leather armor as well as leather &lt;a href=\"horse%20armor\"&gt;horse armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBook and quill.\nThe &lt;a href=\"book%20and%20quill\"&gt;book and quill&lt;/a&gt; lets you record your adventures. Tell your story by entering text into the pages. You can even change the title and the author! Sign the book and quill to finalize your work. The book and quill can be edited until it is signed.\nLoom.\nThe &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt; is a fast and efficient way to apply &lt;a href=\"banner%20pattern\"&gt;patterns to banners&lt;/a&gt;. The loom uses one dye to apply a pattern. It can also use loom patterns to apply special patterns.\nBy placing a banner into the loom's first slot, and any color dye into the second slot, patterns can be added to the banner. Once a pattern is selected, take it from the output slot on the right and move it to your inventory.\nA banner can have multiple layers allowing you to experiment with many different banner possibilities. Up to 6 patterns can be applied to a banner to create a unique design.\nAdding a loom pattern to the loom's third slot allows the crafting of special patterns like a creeper face or a flower pattern. You do not lose your loom patterns when you apply these patterns to your banners.\nPlay.\nArmor.\nArmor is essential in combat, it can be made with &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, iron, gold, diamond or netherite. Additionally, there is chainmail armor, that cannot be crafted but it can be found in loot chests and turtle shells that can be crafted with &lt;a href=\"scute\"&gt;scute&lt;/a&gt;s. Armor makes you take less damage from players, mobs, etc, and turtle shells give you the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; status effect along with the protection boost. but it also has durability so be careful.\nTo craft a full set of armor, you will need 24 pieces of the selected material. :\nShields are tools that can protect you from incoming attacks\nYou can obtain them in many ways, you can craft them with planks and iron...\nJourneyman-level armorer villagers have 1\u20443\u200c chance of selling a shield for 5 emeralds as their sixth trade.\nShields are used for blocking incoming attacks. Sneaking causes a player to slow to a sneaking pace, and after 5 game ticks (0.25 seconds), attacks coming from in front of the player are blocked, dealing no damage. When the shield blocks an attack of or stronger, it takes durability damage equal to the strength of the attack rounded up.\nBlockable attacks include:\nThey cannot block:\nBeacons.\nActive &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;s project a bright beam of light into the sky. They are crafted with &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt;s (obtained by defeating the &lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;).\nBeacons must be placed so that they have an unobstructed view of the sky and must be placed on pyramids of &lt;a href=\"iron%20block\"&gt;iron block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gold%20block\"&gt;gold block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"emerald%20block\"&gt;emerald block&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"diamond%20block\"&gt;diamond block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe material that the beacon is placed on has no effect on the power of the beacon.\nIn the beacon menu you can select one primary power for your beacon. The more tiers your pyramid has the more powers you can have.\nTo set the powers of your Beacon you must use an emerald, diamond, gold ingot, or iron ingot in the payment slot.\nOnce set, the powers emanate from the beacon indefinitely. Powers are granted to all nearby players.\nTo change the color of the beam, place a stained glass block in its path.\nConduits.\nAn active &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; gives you powers when you are underwater.\nA conduit is crafted with &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Heart of the Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The conduit draws power from &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOnce activated, a conduit grants &lt;a href=\"Conduit%20Power\"&gt;Conduit Power&lt;/a&gt; to anything nearby. The more power it draws in, the further its abilities reach.\nBeds.\nSleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; passes the night and sets your spawn point. Sleeping can be done \"only\" at night.\nIf you are playing multiplayer, everyone in the world must be in a bed at the same time to pass the night.\nIf your bed is broken you return to where you first spawned into the world.\nBe careful when using a bed in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;; it's usually too hot to sleep.\nBlocks.\nThe world of \"Minecraft\" is made from millions of blocks. Each one is breakable, collectable, and placeable. There are almost no limits to what you can build!\nMost blocks are found in the world, but some can only be crafted such as combining other blocks on a crafting table like a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; block or smelted in a furnace like &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost blocks are not affected by gravity and can float in mid air, but some like, Sand and Gravel, falls if there is no block underneath.\nHere are some examples of the more interesting blocks:\nChests.\nItems in the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; are stored there for you to put into your inventory later. Two chests placed next to each other combine to form a &lt;a href=\"large%20chest\"&gt;large chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you have crafted a chest, you can place it in the world, open it, and transfer items between the chest and your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nDyes.\nDye is used to change the color of many things.\nSome dye materials are harder to find than others. While most Dyes can be crafted from flowers like Red Dye from a Poppy, some Dyes are found or created in more obscure ways such as: \nEnder chest.\nAll &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt;s in a world are linked. Items placed into an ender chest are accessible in any other ender chest. However, the contents of the ender chests are specific for each player. This allows players to store items in any ender chest, and retrieve them from other ender chests in different positions in the world.\nFarming.\nThere are a variety of different crops that you can farm in \"Minecraft\". Farming, while challenging, can provide an infinite food source.\nCrops require light, water, and farmland to grow. You need a hoe, a water source, and seeds to farm.\nBlocks next to the water need to be converted to &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;. Do this with the &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;. Dirt can be converted to farmland up to four blocks away from a water block.\nNow you can plant your seeds. Make sure your crops are protected as they can easily die from being trampled or lack of water or light.\n&lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;Fence&lt;/a&gt;s can help protect your crops from hungry rabbits or trampling toes!\nWhen the crops are fully grown they change in appearance and can be harvested.\nSome plants like &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"melon\"&gt;melon&lt;/a&gt;s grow on stalks. Be careful not to harvest the stalks!\nMounts.\nA player can ride any adult &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;. Only horses can be armored.\nMules and donkeys may be equipped with saddlebags (for transporting items) by attaching a chest. These saddlebags can then be accessed while riding or sneaking.\nHorses, donkeys, and mules must be tamed before they can be used. A player can tame a horse by riding it and being thrown off. When hearts appear around the horse, it has been tamed and no longer attempts to throw off the player.\nTo steer a ridable animal, the player must equip it with a &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaddles can be bought from villagers, found inside chests hidden in the world, or acquired by &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. While riding a horse, open your inventory and put a saddle in the horse's saddle slot.\nHorses and donkeys can be bred like other animals using &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFoals grow into adult horses over time, although feeding them &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s speeds this up.\nA &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s is another ridable mob which can be tamed and used to transport large shipments of items.\nLlamas can be tamed the same as horses. However, even when tamed, the player can't control its movements while riding.\nA lead can be attached to one, and when this happens, surrounding llamas (both tamed and un-tamed) follow, making a caravan.\nLlamas can be equipped with chests, giving it 3-15 slots of inventory space depending on the strength of the llama. They can also be equipped with carpets. Each carpet color yields a different pattern.\nPigs can be ridden as well, although they don't go where you want without a little incentive.\nEquip a pig with a saddle and point a &lt;a href=\"carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt; in the direction you want to go.\nNether portal.\nA &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt; allows you to travel to a different dimension.\nIf constructed correctly, the nether portal is lit and activated.\nExamples of portal construction are shown here:\nPets.\nThere are several mobs in \"Minecraft\" that you can tame to make pets. Each can be tamed by feeding it an item that it likes. Once tamed, you can cause the animal to sit and stay in place.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are a neutral mob that hunt in the colder climates. They attack rabbits, skeletons, and sheep but run away from llamas. They don't attack you unless you provoke them. You can tame them by giving them &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Cat\"&gt;Cat&lt;/a&gt;s are a neutral mob that can be found in villages. They attack rabbits and baby turtles. They also keep &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s away. They try to run from you so taming them can be tough. They like fish so give them &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt; to tame them.\nParrots are a passive mob that live in the &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;. They imitate any other mob in the area. Give them a few seeds to tame them. Parrots also sit on your shoulder... Yes, you can have more than one up there.\nRaids.\nWhile exploring the world you may encounter a &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt; encampment or &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt;. Pillagers seek villages to raid. Taking their banner gets their attention, and they may choose to attack a nearby village.\nBe sure to defend your village. The attack stops when you defeat all the raiders.\nVillagers are grateful when you have saved them from the raiders. Be sure to check back with them, you might get a good deal.\nRanching.\nIn \"Minecraft\", you can have your own ranch filled with livestock! Ranching provides lots of resources such as wool, eggs, and raw meat.\nIn order to keep your livestock growing, you have to make baby animals. Adult animals must enter Love Mode for this to happen. Feed the animals their preferred food to get them to enter &lt;a href=\"love%20mode\"&gt;love mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen two like animals are nearby and in love mode, they kiss for a moment and then a baby animal appears! The baby animal stays with its parents until growing into an adult. After having a baby, adult animals must wait 5 minutes before they can re-enter love mode.\nCows, mooshrooms, and sheep all eat Wheat. Pigs can eat &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;. Chickens love seeds of any kinds. Rabbits eat carrots, golden carrots, or &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s. Cats and &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;s enjoy &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt;. Wolves like to eat any kind of meat.\nAnimals follow you when you hold their desired food item. This helps you lead them to your ranch or another animal.\nScaffolding.\n&lt;a href=\"Scaffolding\"&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; can help you create huge structures safely! You can walk inside scaffolding and stand on it. You can travel upward or downward inside a column of scaffolding.\nScaffolding needs support. You can place only so many scaffolding horizontally without touching a different block. When you attempt to place too many scaffolding blocks without proper support, it falls. Scaffolding can be placed like normal blocks, but it can also be placed on its own foundation to quickly build a tall tower.\nWhen scaffolding is broken, it also breaks every scaffolding block it supported above. This lets you quickly clean up your scaffolding by breaking only the supporting blocks!\nTransportation.\nThere are many ways to get around other than walking or riding a mount or flying.\n&lt;a href=\"Minecart\"&gt;Minecart&lt;/a&gt;s are ridable carts that roll on &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s. You can make the rails go wherever you want by placing them next to each other. Place a minecart on rails and you are ready to ride.\n&lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boat&lt;/a&gt;s let you travel across water. Place one on a water block and you are ready to go.\nVillager trading.\n&lt;a href=\"Trading\"&gt;Trading&lt;/a&gt; can be done in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s. Each &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; has a profession: &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"butcher\"&gt;butcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cartographer\"&gt;cartographer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"librarian\"&gt;librarian&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;. Some professions trade for items that other professions cannot. Explore and trade with many villagers to find all the trades.\nYou can find out what a villager is offering as trade by interacting with them. A villager may adjust the price of a trade whenever a player trades with it. A villager may run out of stock, temporarily disabling the trade if it is used too frequently. Trades usually involve buying or selling items for &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs you trade with villagers, they get better at their profession and start to offer better and more valuable trades.\nTake care of your villagers, they need to rest, work, and eat to thrive.\nOptions and cheats.\nGame settings.\nWhen creating a world, you have many options. Below are the various settings that can be used to fine tune your experience. Don't worry if you didn't set them when you created the world, they can be changed at any time.\nBelow are gamerules, cheats must be turned on to use them:\nDifficulty.\n\"Minecraft\" has varying levels of difficulty so you can tailor the game to your level.\nAdventure mode.\nAdventure mode is a &lt;a href=\"Gameplay%23Game_modes\"&gt;gamemode&lt;/a&gt; for world builders. In Adventure mode, players must use special tools to place or break blocks.\nTo get these specual tools, you must use with canplace or candestroy parameters while in creative mode.\nCreative mode.\n&lt;a href=\"Creative%20mode\"&gt;Creative mode&lt;/a&gt; is there so you can build the land of your dreams mob free!\nThe creative mode interface allows any item in the game to be moved into the player's inventory without the need for mining or crafting the item. the items in the player's inventory are not removed when they are placed or used in the world, and this allows the player to focus on building rather than resource gathering.\nIf you create, load, or save a world in creative mode, achievements and leaderboard updates are disabled for that world, even if it then loaded in &lt;a href=\"survival%20mode\"&gt;survival mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommands.\nCommands can be executed from Chat. Type / before you type the command.\nThere are multitudes of commands that allow you to do amazing things. There are many sources out there that provide you with all of the info that you'll ever need.\nHost and player options.\nWhen playing with cheats on, host options allow you to teleport yourself or friends, change the weather, set the time of day, and change the entry point or world spawn of your game. Once cheats are enabled, you can find these options in the chat window by pressing the [/] button next to the chat bar.\nCommand blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Command%20block\"&gt;Command block&lt;/a&gt;s are a powerful tool for map creators. They store an execute commands upon receiving a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20update\"&gt;redstone signal&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get a command block you must use .\nWhen a command block has either executed or failed to execute its stored command, it sends a redstone signal from the side where the arrow is pointing.\nYou can set the name of the command block in the Hover Note field.\nBlock type \u2014 There are three types of command blocks, each with their own color and behavior:\nCondition \u2014 There are two conditions, each affecting the behavior of the command block:\nRedstone \u2014 There are two redstone settings, each affecting the behavior of the command block:\nA command block also shows you its previous output. This helps you figure out if a command block failed to execute its command and why.\nEngineering.\nRedstone.\nRedstone Dust comes from Redstone that transmits an electrical signal. When it has power it lights up and transmits its signal to other Redstone items that are next to it.\nIn order for one of these items to be powered, it needs a power source such as a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. Experiment to find them all!\nPlace some &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; next to a power source and turn it on to power it.\nThere are many items that use a redstone signal to do something, such as a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedstone allows for endless possibilities! Try creating something useful for yourself like an automatic farm!\nHoppers.\nHoppers are used to automatically move items. Hoppers can be attached to some other items like containers such as chests or &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt;es.\nHoppers continuously remove items from a container placed above them and move them into the container they are pointing to.\nTo make a hopper point to a particular block, place the Hopper against that block while sneaking.\nIf a hopper is powered by redstone, it becomes inactive and stops moving items.\nJukebox.\nThe &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt; plays &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;s that you have found.\nWhile a jukebox is playing a music disc, it can power &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;.\nTry different music discs for different power levels.\nSee what happens when you let it play to the end.\nA hopper can put a music disc in for you, and take it out when it's done playing.\nThere are a couple of music discs that can be found in chests around the world. Others are more difficult to come by; creepers secretly appreciate music and occasionally drop a disc.\nThe End.\nEye Of Ender.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ender\"&gt;Eye of Ender&lt;/a&gt; is mysteriously connected to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; and behaves strangely when used.\nRumor has it that they can lead you to open another dimension.\nEnd Cities.\nAfter killing the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20dragon\"&gt;Ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt; appears. Throwing an &lt;a href=\"Ender%20pearl\"&gt;Ender pearl&lt;/a&gt; into the portal teleports you to the outer islands.\nThis alien new landscape must hide something interesting, and maybe something to bring back with you.\nShulker boxes.\nCombine two &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt;s with a chest to create a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;. Shulker shells are dropped by &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s found in End cities. Unlike other containers, shulker boxes keep their items when broken. Shulker boxes break and drop as an item if pushed by pistons, and can be placed using dispensers.\nEnhanced play.\nMultiplayer.\nMinecraft is a multiplayer game by default.\nYou can have local players join your game by connecting controllers and pressing any button on their controller at any point during the game.\nBy default, all worlds start with multiplayer enabled. If you would like to make the world private, go to world settings and select the multiplayer option, then toggle multiplayer off.\nTo join a multiplayer game, go to the friends tab. All joinable Realms, Friends, and LAN Games are shown here. Pick a game and select it to join.\nWhen you start or join an online game, it is visible to people in your friends tab. Once your friends join, the game becomes visible to friends of these friends.\nNote: You must have an internet connection and be signed in to a Microsoft account to play multiplayer.\nIf you would like to manage the permissions of individual players, player permissions makes it easy. Open the pause menu and on the right, you see a list of players currently in the world. Select their permission icon to adjust that player's permissions.\nRealms.\nRealms is an awesome place to host a multiplayer game that is always running. Even when you aren't playing, your realm remains running for your friends to explore!\nTo set up a realm, select Create New from the Worlds tab. Then select the New Realm button, then the Create New World button. Here you can name your realm, and set the number of players. Then you can add friends to your realm.\nOnce you have a realm created, select the Pencil button to change the realm settings.\nUnder the Game button, you can rename the Realm, set the difficulty and gamemode, turn on cheats, and download/upload the world.\nUnder the Members button you can manage all of the friends you've invited to your Realm, add/remove members, and set their permissions.\nUnder the Subscription button you can see when the Realm expires, extend the time until expiration, and open/close the Realm.\nServers.\nThe Server tab shows popular \"Minecraft\" servers.\nThe Marketplace.\nThe Minecraft Marketplace is a place to find new skins, worlds, textures, and mash-up packs by various talented creators.\nResource and behavior packs.\nYou can change the way that \"Minecraft\" looks and behaves using &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"behavior%20pack\"&gt;behavior pack&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the Settings menu, choose a pack from the available packs list and select the plus sign next to it. Now your pack applies its changes to the default \"Minecraft\" pack."}

There are two types of huge fungi: the huge crimson fungus and the huge warped fungus.\nGeneration.\nHuge crimson fungi and huge warped fungi generate in &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt;s, respectively. Huge fungi only generate naturally in their corresponding biome.\nStructure.\nThe trunks of huge fungi are made of either &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Stem\"&gt;warped stem&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Stem\"&gt;crimson stem&lt;/a&gt;s depending on the type. Huge fungus trunks can be either thick or thin: thick trunks grow up in a 3\u00d73-plus shape, with stray stems sometimes in the corners, while thin trunks grow straight up as a 1\u00d71 column. To determine the size of huge fungi, a random integer is chosen between 4 and 13 [inclusive]. There is then a chance of that integer doubling. The resulting value is the height of the trunk. A layer of wart blocks and &lt;a href=\"shroomlight\"&gt;shroomlight&lt;/a&gt;s is then spread around the trunk, being able to generate up to 3 blocks out from the trunk, and are the \"leaves\" of the fungus. There is a 3\u00d73\u00d72 hollow ring that surrounds the lowest block of a fungus where no blocks generate. Both variants have &lt;a href=\"shroomlight\"&gt;shroomlight&lt;/a&gt;s generate inside them, both replacing the wart blocks and stems. Huge crimson fungi may also have &lt;a href=\"weeping%20vines\"&gt;weeping vines&lt;/a&gt; growing replacing the same, or from the underside of wart blocks. In this way huge crimson fungi may grow the weeping vines lower than the stems as well as initially generate replacing the stems, when naturally-generated uniquely along the local ceiling.\nGrowth.\nWhen bone meal is used on a &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; that is planted on matching &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt;, this has a 40% chance to grow into its huge equivalent (similar to saplings and mushrooms). Crimson and warped fungi grow into crimson and warped huge fungi, respectively. The stem, shroomlight, or nether wart block may replace certain blocks including slabs and torches.\nA fungus does not grow by itself through random ticks, unlike &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHuge fungi grow even with blocks above them, and do not replace any solid blocks when grown; however, they do not grow if blocked by the world height limit, or if situated outside of the world.\nHuge fungi can grow up to 27 blocks tall. The maximum space they can take up is 9\u00d727\u00d79 blocks (partially hollow), and the average is 213 blocks of volume.\n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart%20Block\"&gt;Nether wart blocks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shroomlight\"&gt;shroomlight&lt;/a&gt; persist when the stem of the huge fungus is removed, unlike how &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; decay when &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s of a tree are removed."}

The volume the huge mushroom would generate in must be free of solid blocks, and a minimum of 5 blocks above the mushroom, although 7 blocks allows most to spawn. 13 blocks are required for all huge mushrooms to generate. Extra tall huge mushrooms have a ~5% chance of growing.\nA huge mushroom does not grow above the height limit.\nAny small mushroom placed does not grow into a huge mushroom naturally; bone meal must be applied.\nConstruction.\nA huge mushroom's height is normally between 5 and 7 &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; inclusive, but have a chance to generate twice as high (minus 1 block), meaning they can be 9, 11, or 13 blocks tall.\nTo grow, the block under the huge mushroom's stem must be &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;.

Each type of mushroom also has its own space requirements, which are described below.\nHuge brown mushrooms.\nHuge brown mushrooms consist of a single stalk in the center, with a 7\u00d77 canopy of brown mushroom blocks at the top with the corners missing. \nFor the mushroom to grow, the lowest four blocks of the stem (i.e. the three blocks above the small mushroom being grown) must be air or leaves, and a 7\u00d77\u00d7(height\u22123) region above must similarly be clear of anything except air or leaves. Due to the space requirement matching the size of the canopy at the top, it is possible for a huge brown mushroom to grow with its canopy directly touching a mushroom next to it.\nHuge red mushrooms.\nHuge red mushrooms, like their brown counterparts, have a single stalk in the center, but a different canopy, composed of five 3\u00d73 slabs of red mushroom blocks arranged above and around the stalk, forming a 'dome'. Unlike brown mushrooms, red mushrooms only check the blocks directly above the small mushroom, and do not require the rest of the dome to be clear of other blocks. Blocks that mobs can't suffocate in, such as slabs, end portal frame and end portal, are replaced; full blocks remain unchanged.\nData values.\nID.\nwhich are used in:\nwhich are used in:\nwhich is used in:"}

One half of a drumstick () represents one hunger point or half-unit of hunger, thus the full bar consists of twenty hunger points. It is replenished by eating &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, and decreased by a player's actions, such as &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"digging\"&gt;digging&lt;/a&gt; or attacking.\nVarious levels of a player's hunger control health regeneration (or depletion) and the ability to sprint. When hunger is at 18 (), the player's health regenerates. If it falls to 6 (), the player loses the ability to sprint. If the hunger bar is at zero, the player's health depletes. The specific effects are described in the &lt;a href=\"%23Effects%20of%20hunger\"&gt;Effects of hunger section&lt;/a&gt;. The hunger value does not drain on &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, and regenerates if it is not at the maximum value.\nAn important aspect of hunger not shown on the hunger bar is called food saturation, which controls the decreasing of the hunger value. It depends on what the player has eaten last. There is also a food exhaustion value that controls the decreasing of the food saturation level. How exactly they control the overall hunger value is described in more depth in the &lt;a href=\"%23Mechanics\"&gt;Mechanics section&lt;/a&gt;.\nCertain foods have a chance of inflicting the &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; effect on the player upon consumption, causing the player's food bar to deplete faster and turn a yellow-green color (). These foods are &lt;a href=\"Pufferfish%20%28item%29\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt; (30% chance), and &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; (80% chance). A &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt; can also give the player the Hunger effect upon being attacked by one.\nMechanics.\nThe hunger system utilizes four variables to control players' abilities, the values of which are stored in the &lt;a href=\"player.dat%20format\"&gt;player.dat format&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe above variables can be queried in-game with the following command: .\nAs a visible sign that the saturation is used up, the hunger bar starts to shake or jitter periodically. When the saturation level is at zero, once the exhaustion value reaches 4, the total hunger value is decreased by . Eating &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; replenishes both hunger and saturation levels (see &lt;a href=\"%23Food%20level%20and%20saturation%20level%20restoration\"&gt;Food level and saturation level restoration&lt;/a&gt; for specific values), with the hunger level being replenished first, which also increases the maximum allowed saturation level. For example, if a &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt; (giving and 14.4 saturation points) is eaten by a player whose hunger bar is at and saturation is below 1, its value increases to 15 (), and the golden carrot's saturation potential is fully used. However, if the hunger level is , its value increases to 14 () and only 14 saturation points are used.\nEffects of hunger.\nVarious hunger levels lead to various effects on the player:\nSwitching to Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; eliminates all penalties above, and rapidly restores the player's hunger bar and health.\nExhaustion level increase.\n\"Any action not listed here does not increase exhaustion level. For example, normal walking doesn't increase exhaustion, and therefore does not decrease saturation or the food bar.\""}

If mined without Silk Touch, the block drops nothing, and instead is replaced with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; if there is a block under the ice block.\nNatural generation.\nIce can be found naturally as part of the landscape in &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Snowy%20Biomes\"&gt;snowy biomes&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"River%23Frozen%20River\"&gt;rivers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ocean%23Frozen%20Ocean\"&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be found in &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Plains%23Ice%20Spikes\"&gt;ice spikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iceberg\"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt;, also on landscape of &lt;a href=\"frozen%20peaks\"&gt;frozen peaks&lt;/a&gt; biomes. They also generate in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-generation.\nSnowy biomes.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; source blocks in a snowy &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; eventually freeze into ice if exposed to the sky from directly above, the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; inside the water block is less than 10, and there is at least one horizontally adjacent non-water (and non-&lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;) block. This can happen at any &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;time of day&lt;/a&gt;, and in any &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; condition.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; also freezes into ice in cold biomes, as long as the &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; is high enough for &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIce formation occurs as part of &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Chunk%20tick\"&gt;chunk ticking&lt;/a&gt;, so it requires that a player is nearby similar to crop growth or grass spreading. The speed of ice formation is affected by the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; .\nIce bomb.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"ice%20bomb\"&gt;ice bomb&lt;/a&gt; is thrown into water, it transforms the water in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube centered around the projectile into ice. This works for source water or flowing water upon hit.\nUsage.\nCrafting ingredient.\nDespite being created by a 3\u00d73 recipe, packed ice is not a storage block, because it cannot be crafted back into ice. The same applies to the next tier of compression, &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeed.\nIce is slightly slippery, causing entities (excluding &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s) to slide, including &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. This allows for increased speed of items in water currents, by placing ice blocks under the water current. Items already travel at high speeds in water currents because they float, so ice block water streams are less necessary for item transportation.\nA player who &lt;a href=\"Sprinting\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Jumping\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt;s repeatedly on ice travels faster than on any other block type. The player can travel even faster if they sprint and spam in a 2-block-high corridor with ice on the floor, allowing the player to accelerate to extremely high speeds, although this will cost them a lot of &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;.\n, when a non-full block is placed on top of ice, the block has the same \"slipperiness\" as the ice below it.\nBoat highway.\nLike other entities, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s travel extremely quickly on ice/blue ice, where it can reach a speed of 40-72 m/s, much faster than the 8 m/s speed on &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. More beneficially, unlike water, ice can be placed in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, allowing players to construct boat highways made of ice/blue ice in the dimension, to make use of the 1:8 distance travel ratio, and travel at an equivalent speed up to 320-580 m/s (720-1300 mph) between locations in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreating water.\nIce can be used to create water either by its melting or being broken. If there is a non-&lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; block directly underneath the ice block, the ice becomes a water source block when broken. \nIce also melts into &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Light%23Block%20light\"&gt;block light&lt;/a&gt; level immediately next to it on any side is higher than 11. &lt;a href=\"Light%23Sky%20light\"&gt;Sky light&lt;/a&gt; level is ignored, therefore ice does \"not\" melt from &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;light. , ice also melts when near a &lt;a href=\"heat%20block\"&gt;heat block&lt;/a&gt;, though heat blocks do not produce light. \nCompared to &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, ice has the benefit of being able to stack in the inventory. Therefore, carrying ice instead of water buckets can be much more convenient, if the player wants to create a lot of water sources.\nIf ice melts or is broken in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, no water is produced (it sublimates)."}

All illagers are hostile toward &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"villagers\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt; (excluding baby villagers), &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClassification.\nThere are five specific criteria for a mob to be considered an illager:\nRavager Jockeys.\nA ravager jockey is an illager that spawns riding a ravager. The riders can be pillagers, vindicators, or evokers. \nA ravager ridden by a pillager spawns at raids in wave 5. Ravagers ridden by vindicators and evokers spawn at wave 7.\nA ravager ridden by pillager spawns at raids in waves 5 and 7. Ravagers ridden by evokers also spawn at wave 7. The ravagers ridden by vindicators do not spawn in raids, and can be spawned only with commands.\nOccurrences.\nIllagers spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s. They always spawn naturally in groups while in patrols and raids, or inside their &lt;a href=\"Structure\"&gt;structures&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"Pillager\"&gt;pillagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;vindicators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;evokers&lt;/a&gt; spawn naturally.\nVindicators and evokers that spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s do not despawn or respawn.\n&lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;Ravager&lt;/a&gt;s spawn exclusively in raids.\nRaid Captain.\nIllagers sometimes have their own captain. Any illager has a small chance to be a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt; with an (even when using a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;, or when summoned by commands). Raid captains can spawn in raids and patrols.\n, the ominous banner equips on the illager's helmet slot. , the illager banner equips on the illager's chestplate slot.\nEvent.\nIllagers have their own in-game events, led by raid captains:\nEffects.\nMain Articles: &lt;a href=\"Ominous%20Bottle\"&gt;Ominous Bottle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt;\nKilling a raid captain in patrols, in a mansion, or in an outpost drops an &lt;a href=\"Ominous%20Bottle\"&gt;Ominous Bottle&lt;/a&gt;. When drunk, this triggers the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect. &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; triggers a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; when that player enters a village with the effect still active. The level of the effect increases the enchantment power of pillagers' and vindicators' crossbows and axes, respectively, and omens with a level higher than 1 cause an extra wave of raiders to occur .\nWhen all waves have been finished in a raid, the effect is given, which decreases prices when trading with villagers. The level of the effect scales with the level of the omen that triggered the raid.\nRune.\nIllagers have an alphabet called , a rune font from \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;\". This font is currently usable only via commands.\nJava Edition.\nAll illagers ignore baby villagers, but may still hit them by accident.\nIllagers do not retaliate when hit by a missed &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; shot by a pillager or illusioner. \nA vindicator can disable the player's &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; with its iron axe attack, even when riding a mob. If a player fails to land a melee attack on a vindicator that rides a &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt; during a raid in Hard &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, the vindicator rider can deal great damage to a player without protection from a shield.\nAll illagers, ravagers, and witches within 48 blocks of a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; that has been rung gain three seconds of the effect, effectively highlighting them through walls.\nReinforcements.\nOn all difficulty levels, damaged illager mobs call all other illagers of their respective type within an area centered on the attacked illager to target the attacker, as long as the attacker is a non-illager. For example, pillagers attack a skeleton that injures another pillager, but pillagers do not aid a vindicator hit by a skeleton.\nRaids.\nDuring raids, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicators&lt;/a&gt; can open doors like &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;villagers&lt;/a&gt;. They can break &lt;a href=\"Door\"&gt;wooden doors&lt;/a&gt; in normal or hard difficulty, if they cannot open the door successfully.Evokers and illusioners gain high movement speed without any effect.\nA raid captain spawns in each wave with other raiders, usually with a vindicator as the captain.\nIllagers pick up &lt;a href=\"Banner\"&gt;ominous banners&lt;/a&gt; dropped by &lt;a href=\"Raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captains&lt;/a&gt;, depends on how many raid captains die in this wave. If the raid captain is still alive, they do not pick up the banner from last wave remains or if thrown by the player.\nPatrol.\nAll illagers, ravagers, and witches join nearby patrol actively. If a \"Johnny\" vindicator joins a patrol, all patrol members assume the \"Johnny\" vindicator's aggressive behavior.\nBedrock Edition.\nVindicators and evokers do not despawn and are passive on Peaceful difficulty.\nAll illagers and &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;vexes&lt;/a&gt; ignore baby villagers, but pillagers and illusioners may still shoot them by accident.\nA &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; can equip an evoker, vindicator, or pillager with &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. However, no armor is visible on them and no armor drops upon death.\n&lt;a href=\"Pillagers\"&gt;Pillagers&lt;/a&gt; and ravagers do not purposefully attack other illagers. However, non-pillagers and non-&lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt; do attack pillagers who hit them with missed &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Vindicators and evokers retaliate against a pillager if the pillager accidentally hits the vindicator or evoker with an arrow, although the evoker fang deals no damage to pillagers. Vexes summoned by an injured evoker can still attack the pillager.\nA \"&lt;a href=\"Raid%20%23Raid%20wave%20composition\"&gt;ravager with vindicator rider&lt;/a&gt;\" is unused . It can be summoned by a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20event\"&gt;spawn event&lt;/a&gt; command without raid configuration.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Texture%20Update\"&gt;Texture Update&lt;/a&gt;, illagers still use the Java Edition 1.14 snapshot texture, including some of the Marketplace textures (for example, the pillager's arms). Also, a ravager's leg texture in Bedrock Edition is different from that in Java edition."}

It attacks using illusions and can also fire &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nAn illusioner has no &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. An illusioner can be &lt;a href=\"spawning\"&gt;spawned&lt;/a&gt; only using &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;s or the in-game &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition, &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs are dropped on player or tamed wolf kills.\nThe illusioner also drops one illager &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt; if it is a &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nAlthough they do not naturally spawn in raids, illusioners spawned by the player attack &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, adult &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s within a 16*4*16 cubic area. \nAn illusioner joins a nearby raid if it occurs or joins a patrol if sufficiently near a &lt;a href=\"patrol%20captain\"&gt;patrol captain&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe illusioner attacks with its spells and its bow, firing an arrow every second. Unless the illusioner is summoned using &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s, it cannot attack with a non-bow item in its hand, cannot use &lt;a href=\"tipped%20arrow\"&gt;tipped arrow&lt;/a&gt;s in its offhand slot (but can use &lt;a href=\"spectral%20arrow\"&gt;spectral arrow&lt;/a&gt;s) and cannot use enchanted bows. Also, it is the only illager that can see its target through walls. \nThe Illusioner moves quickly on a semi-circular fashion and always tries to maintain a consistent distance between itself and the player, strafing from left to right and vice-versa, retreating if the player gets too close or advancing if the player retreats. \nFinally, the illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent and a spell that summons visual pseudo-duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.\nCasting blindness.\nThe illusioner casts its blindness spell only if the &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is greater than 2. As result, the world difficulty &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;setting&lt;/a&gt;, the inhabited time of a &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;, the total daytime in the world and the phase of the moon from the day-night cycle affects its ability.\nAn illusioner casts a effect that lasts for 20 seconds upon first engaging a new player opponent. It signals this attack by raising its arms during a short-timed animation, making a low pitched sound and producing a black mist of &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; (). Other entities (typically a wolf, a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; or an iron golem) do not trigger this magic. The illusioner does not cast this spell more than once on the same player opponent, unless it has first shifted its attention to another opponent and then back to that original opponent. \nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the blinding spell to 9 seconds.\nSummoning duplicates.\nAs long as an illusioner is engaged in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, it casts an status effect on itself that lasts 60 seconds and refreshes the effect whenever the Invisibility's time runs out. The illusioner signals this spell by raising its arms, making a strange high pitched sound and producing a blue mist of particles called \"mirror\" ().\nWhen an illusioner becomes invisible through this or another method, it creates four false duplicates of itself. These hover and waver at short distances from the actually invisible illusioner, though they do not space themselves out until the first time the illusioner is attacked. They face in exactly the same direction as the illusioner and move somewhat in step with the original, appearing to no-clip through &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s like a &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt; does. Despite using the shooting animation whenever the original uses its bow, only the real illusioner can shoot and be damaged.\nThe clones move to new positions if they were not triggered and are still bunched together. The Illusioner can also do this once in a while to \"refresh\" the clones' positions.\nWhen the real illusioner is damaged, its duplicates all snap back to where the real illusioner is, then quickly snap back out to new positions, making a teleporting sound, signaling the hit.\nIf an invisible illusioner receives the effect, all of the duplicates glow, while the true illusioner remains invisible. Moreover, only the invisible illusioner burns when catching &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe duplicates dissipate once the illusioner's Invisibility effect ends.\nThis spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to 1 second and resets the cooldown for the invisibility spell to 17 seconds.\nSounds.\nIllusioners use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nIllusioners have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

Expert-level shepherd villagers have a chance of offering the same trade.\n, expert-level cartographer and shepherd villagers both offer to sell one of 16 blank banners for 3 emeralds as part of their trades.\nMob loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Illager\"&gt;Illager&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn carrying an ominous banner / illager banner always drop it upon death.\nUsage.\nThere are 16 colored blank banners, and numerous patterns each available in each of the 16 colors. A banner can feature up to 6 different patterns. The top layer of a banner (or the last pattern added) can be washed off by it on a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; containing water.\nBanners, much like signs, can be placed both on the ground facing in any direction, or on a wall. They gently sway as if affected by a breeze, regardless of dimension or location. \nBanners have no collision mask as they are completely non-solid, so &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; can move through them.\nOther blocks (including other banners) can be placed on any edge of a banner's hitbox, which is only one block high despite the banner appearing as two blocks tall. This makes it possible to overlap another solid block on the top half of a banner for floor banners, or the bottom half of wall banners.\nWhen a banner is placed on the side of a block, its position is set by the top block, and it is possible to place it so it appears half buried.\nBanners can also be placed in &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s, where they simply appear as their item model.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow around banners. , banners can be &lt;a href=\"waterlogged\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;.\nLava can create &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; in air blocks next to banners as if the banners were flammable, but the banners do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods). Banners also cannot be moved by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf a banner is renamed on an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, it retains its name when a pattern is added, but not when a pattern is removed.\nHelmet.\nWhile a banner cannot be equipped in the &lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;head slot&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt;s wear banners.\nChestplate.\nWhile a banner cannot be equipped in the &lt;a href=\"chestplate\"&gt;chestplate&lt;/a&gt; slot in Survival mode, equipping it using NBT editors causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how &lt;a href=\"raid%20captain\"&gt;raid captain&lt;/a&gt;s wear banners.\nCrafting ingredient.\n&lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;s can have patterns applied to them using banners. The shield pattern has a smaller resolution than the banner pattern, causing them to look different or offset. Banners that have more than six patterns, such as Ominous Banners or banners obtained through inventory editors, will be reduced to six patterns on the shield.\nCopying.\nBanners can be copied with a blank banner to make multiple identical banners. Banners with more than 6 patterns applied using commands cannot be copied in this manner.\nMap marker.\n, on a standing banner with a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; selected places a marker of the banner's position on the selected map, and on the banner again removes the marker. Note that wall banners cannot serve as map markers. The marker has the same color as the banner's base without decorations. The marker is removed if the banner is destroyed unless the map is locked using a &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;. If the banner is renamed, the name appears below the marker.\nPatterns.\nA banner may have up to six layers of patterns, which are overlaid with the last-crafted on top. A banner can have up to 16 layers of patterns with the use of commands. The total number of unique banners is approximately 2.3x10^16 (or 23 quadrillion).\nAny color banner can be used; the pattern overlays the color. , a &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt; is used to make patterns. However, , the patterns can be made in a &lt;a href=\"loom\"&gt;loom&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;.\nA banner can have more than six layers of patterns through the commands codice_1, codice_2 or codice_3. This only works in \"Java Edition\", as Bedrock Edition doesn't have any NBT commands. Here is an example of a mining banner with seven different patterns. There is specific codes for the and &lt;a href=\"Banner/Patterns\"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt; that you have to input. \ncodice_4\nRenaming.\n, a banner can be given a custom name that remains as the banner is placed and retrieved. The player can use an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; to rename the banner item, or may change the codice_5 tag using the command on the banner block.\nFuel.\nBanners can be used as a fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per banner.\nNote Blocks.\nBanners can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nData values.\nMetadata.\nItem.\n, banner items use the following data values:\nItem.\n, banner items use the following data values:\nBlock data.\nA banner has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block. \nItem data.\nBanners, as items, use an NBT tag codice_6 to indicate the patterns and details when it is placed."}

Barrier blocks cannot be destroyed by &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; explosions, or any other explosions.\nIn the player's &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, the block is displayed as a red box with a slash through it, but when placed it is completely invisible.\nBarriers are transparent to light and do not block a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;Fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s, and similar blocks do not visually connect with barriers. Barriers interact with blocks and mobs as a solid block. All dependent blocks can be placed on a barrier, such as &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, and it can suffocate mobs. Mobs cannot spawn on barriers. The red cross texture, however, is revealed as particle effects when falling or sprinting on them, regardless of what game mode the player is in.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, if a player is holding a barrier block in their hand, all placed barrier blocks display the barrier icon as a &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;. This effect is client-side, and if a player holds a barrier block in survival, the particle does not appear. Barrier blocks are not shown if the particle setting is set to \"minimal\". Furthermore, they have a greater amount of blast resistance than any other unbreakable block.\nBarrier blocks can be waterlogged by being placed into water source blocks on Bedrock Edition. See &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogging&lt;/a&gt; for more details on what blocks can be waterlogged.\nBarrier blocks are the most resistant blocks in Minecraft.\nPiston interactivity.\nBarriers cannot be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s."}

After the piglin takes the gold ingot and examines it for six seconds or eight seconds , it tosses a random &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; to the player. &lt;a href=\"Piglin%20brute\"&gt;Piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s ignore gold ingots and do not barter. Baby piglins take the ingot without giving anything in return, instead holding the ingot, which is dropped when killed.\nPiglins pick up many other items that are made of gold; however, gold ingots are the only items that piglins accept for bartering. Baby piglins are incapable of bartering and treat gold ingots like any other gold item.\nHitting a piglin while it is examining a gold ingot causes it to \"confiscate\" the ingot; the piglin does not complete the barter. It cannot be bartered with again unless it puts another item in its inventory. Piglins who are killed in one hit before they finish examining always drop the ingot.\nWhen a piglin is admiring a gold ingot, it can still be angered by the player breaking a container or a gold-related block nearby, although its behavior differs depending on the game edition. , the piglin finishes the barter on the original schedule, and only starts attacking the player once the barter finishes. , the piglin immediately finishes the barter and starts attacking the player, leading to a bartering transaction much shorter than the default 8 seconds. This allows piglins to barter rapidly when gold-related blocks are repeatedly broken nearby, or when a gold-related block is repeatedly pushed and pulled by pistons.\nBartering is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"loot%20table\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt; . If the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 is , piglins only barter when the player uses a gold ingot on them.\nIf a piglin is zombified into a &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; before the bartering is complete, the newly zombified piglin drops the gold ingot. \nThe player can only barter with piglins, not piglin brutes or zombified piglins, even if the zombified piglin was a piglin that was zombified in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a piglin is admiring a gold ingot while bartering, it does not run away from nearby &lt;a href=\"zoglins\"&gt;zoglins&lt;/a&gt; or nearby zombified piglins.\nItems bartered.\nThe item the piglin throws can be one of the following: \nBartering is the only &lt;a href=\"renewable\"&gt;renewable&lt;/a&gt; source of nether quartz, crying obsidian, soul sand, nether brick, gravel, blackstone, as well as the Soul Speed enchantment."}

Bastion remnants are the only place to find &lt;a href=\"gilded%20blackstone\"&gt;gilded blackstone&lt;/a&gt;, the Pigstep &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;, the snout &lt;a href=\"banner%20pattern\"&gt;banner pattern&lt;/a&gt; and armor trim, the &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;, and the netherite upgrade &lt;a href=\"smithing%20template\"&gt;smithing template&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneration.\nBastion remnants generate in all Nether biomes except &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;, although a bastion may extend into one. If a bastion tries to generate in a basalt delta, the bastion does not generate, leaving the region empty. To generate the structure, the game splits the Nether into regions, in which either a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt; or a bastion remnant can generate. The regions are 432\u00d7432 blocks and 480\u00d7480 blocks . Each region has a 4-chunk separation located on the south and east borders of the region in which neither a fortress nor a bastion can generate. This leaves only a 368\u00d7368 block section or 416\u00d7416 block section where a structure can generate. Two structures never generate in the same region, although they might overlap if they generate close to the separation border. , the chance of a bastion generating instead of a fortress is (60%), while the chance of a bastion generating instead of a fortress is (66.6%).\nPiglins, piglin brutes, and hoglins that spawn upon generation in bastion remnants neither despawn naturally nor do they hunt each other. Piglin brutes also spawn exclusively here upon structure generation, and do not despawn unless killed, or if &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is set to Peaceful (they remain but become passive in Peaceful difficulty). Like &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"end%20cities\"&gt;end cities&lt;/a&gt;, once these mobs are killed, they do not respawn, though the bastion continues to spawn normal mobs depending on the biome it is located in.\nStructure.\nBastion remnants generate as 4 types of structures: bridges, hoglin stables, housing units, and treasure rooms. Each type has its own set of structures that compose it. These structures may be supported by ramparts that contain cave-like paths. &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s spawn frequently throughout. Unlike &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es, when over the &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20features%23Lava%20sea\"&gt;lava ocean&lt;/a&gt;, they do not generate pillars of solid blocks down to the solid terrain beneath, but float above, entirely even.\nAll bastion remnant structures found below are located in the folder &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"client.jar\"&gt;client.jar&lt;/a&gt;/data/minecraft/structures/bastion&lt;/samp&gt;.\nBridge.\nThe bridge consists of a large ruined rampart structure with a piglin face carved into it. The inside of the \"mouth\" consists of multiple levels of walkways surrounded by lava. A damaged bridge goes out from the mouth, with a support pillar on the far side. \nHoglin stables.\nThe hoglin stables consist of a three-part rampart with damaged hoglin stables on either side. Hoglin stables' pieces are contained in the subfolder &lt;samp&gt;hoglin_stable&lt;/samp&gt;. They contain the hoglin stable chests.\nHousing units.\nThe housing unit consists of multiple ruined two-part ramparts arranged around a central courtyard with &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; growing in the middle. Housing unit pieces are contained in the subfolder &lt;samp&gt;units&lt;/samp&gt;.\nTreasure room.\nThe treasure room structure consists of a large rampart supported by buttresses, with a bridge going between it and the treasure room itself. The rampart contains several treasure chests and a handful of &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20gold\"&gt;blocks of gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe treasure room consists of many bridges suspended above a lava floor. At the bottom of a treasure room, there is a &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt; monster spawner, and a center loot area consisting of &lt;a href=\"blocks%20of%20gold\"&gt;blocks of gold&lt;/a&gt;, as well as 1 or 2 treasure chests. Additional chests generate in the bastion, but they use the \"generic\" loot table instead of the \"treasure\" loot table. Treasure room pieces are contained in the subfolder &lt;samp&gt;treasure&lt;/samp&gt;.\nLoot.\nBridge.\nThis loot appears in some structures in bridge bastion remnants.\nGeneric.\nThis loot appears in chests throughout all types of bastion remnants.\nHoglin Stable.\nThis loot appears in some structures in hoglin stable bastion remnants.\nTreasure.\nThis loot appears in some structures in treasure bastion remnants."}

Beaches sometimes can also generate bordering &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s or be completely landlocked.\nBeaches don't have many resources of their own. &lt;a href=\"Buried%20treasure\"&gt;Buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; often generates buried under most beaches, and &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s occasionally generate on beaches. &lt;a href=\"Turtle\"&gt;Turtle&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn on regular beaches, and along with rabbits in snowy beaches , they are the only &lt;a href=\"passive%20mob\"&gt;passive mob&lt;/a&gt;s that can spawn in beach biomes, although other passive mobs can wander into beaches from surrounding biomes. &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt; often spawn in the water surrounding beaches. &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20ruins\"&gt;Ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt; generated in the ocean nearby may spread onto beaches, causing some ruins to form on land.\nVariants.\nThere are a total of three different beach biomes in the biome family.\nBeach.\nThe standard beach-type biome variant, Beaches are composed of mostly &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, with some &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; patches under the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, similarly to &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s. Like the sand in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; generates underneath it. Beach terrain is usually a smooth descent into the water, though it can vary in steepness and width. &lt;a href=\"Turtle\"&gt;Turtle&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn here, as can &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nStony Shore.\nThe stony shore variant replaces normal beaches in areas with mountainous terrain at low &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt; values. They are made entirely of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, with long &lt;a href=\"strip\"&gt;strip&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. They are usually a steep drop into the water below. Stony shores may generate at high enough elevations to have snow on their peaks (above Y=120\u00b18), even when bordering warm biomes. Water and lava &lt;a href=\"spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt;s frequently generate on the sides of stony shores. , buried treasure can sometimes generate at high altitudes, and can even generate at Y=90; , it doesn't generate here.\nThe steep drops into the ocean below makes this variant dangerous, especially if the player is unaware of their surroundings.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSnowy Beach.\nThe snowy beach variant often generates around &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;, or any of their variants. Snowy beaches are the same to regular beaches terrain-wise, being made mostly of sand, though their landscape is covered entirely in &lt;a href=\"Snow\"&gt;snow layers&lt;/a&gt;. The water surrounding snowy beaches freezes into &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; due to the cold temperatures and these beaches often lead to &lt;a href=\"frozen%20ocean\"&gt;frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTurtles cannot spawn here, but &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s can. Shipwrecks and buried treasure may still generate in this variant.\nSnowy beaches have the same mob spawning chances as stony shores ."}

When destroyed by an &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;, the block always drops as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\n, beacons can also be &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; and conduct redstone power at the same time. When \"activated\", beacon blocks provide two unique functions: \nActivation.\nIn order to activate a beacon, the beacon must meet the following requirements:\nPyramids.\nPyramids are the structures required to activate beacons. There are four possible pyramid heights. More pyramid levels make more powers available in a wider affected vicinity. The type of mineral block used to build the pyramid is entirely cosmetic and has no functional effect. Several different block types can be mixed without affecting functionality. If the pyramid is damaged so that the beacon deactivates, the previously-set powers resume their effects upon reactivation when the pyramid is repaired. This applies to &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;-altered pyramids as well. \nMultiple beacons can make use of the same specific mineral blocks below them. Combined pyramids do not need to be symmetrical. The image to the right shows a 6-beacon (2 by 3) pyramid. It requires a total of 244 mineral blocks, with a base layer of 10 by 11.\nBeam.\nA vertical beam appears from a beacon if the beacon is activated, extending from the beacon block up to beyond the top of the world capping out about around 1024 blocks\nColors.\nThe color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; (or stained glass panes) anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as &lt;a href=\"Dye%23Color%20values\"&gt;those for the corresponding dye&lt;/a&gt;. This also works using &lt;a href=\"hardened%20stained%20glass\"&gt;hardened stained glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hardened%20stained%20glass%20pane\"&gt;hardened stained glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s. Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks.\nThe resulting beam color can be found as formula_1where formula_2 is the sequence of glass colors (formula_3 corresponds to the lowest block and formula_4 to the highest one).\nAs the blending algorithm is considerably simpler than that of &lt;a href=\"Dye%23Dyeing%20armor\"&gt;leather-dyeing&lt;/a&gt;, a much larger part of the sRGB space is available. A player may experiment with stacking glass, although programs that calculate combinations are also available.\nBeacon beams cannot go through most blocks, but can go through &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; (to allow beacons to be used in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"end%20portal%20frame\"&gt;end portal frame&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsing just 15 colors of stained glass, It is possible to make all colors, for example; red + white stained glass above a beacon will be pink; in addition to this, the more white that is added, the lighter the color will be.\nPowers.\nOnce the beacon is emitting a beam, it can then be \"fed\" one &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"netherite%20ingot\"&gt;netherite ingot&lt;/a&gt; to select the status effects given to players within range of the beacon. This is done through the beacon's GUI, displayed by pressing while looking at the beacon block. It doesn't matter which of the items is fed into the beacon.\nIn the GUI, the player places the item to be fed in the empty slot and clicks an effect from the \"Primary Power\" section on the left. If the beacon is sitting on a 4-level pyramid, the \"Secondary Power\" section on the right also becomes active. The player can then choose either to turn on the &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; power in addition to the Primary Power or to raise the primary power to Level II. The user clicks the \"Done\" button (green checkmark), the item is consumed, and the power(s) become activated. To change the beacon's powers, this process must be followed again, consuming another ingot or gem.\nIf the pyramid is broken, effects deactivate or weaken depending on the level of the pyramid that is no longer complete. Upon restoration of the pyramid, the originally selected power returns without the need to spend another item.\nThe five Primary Powers are: \nThe Secondary Powers available with a 4-level pyramid are:\n I: Regenerates health.\nIt is also possible to combine two different primary Level I powers:\nOnly one of the two powers appear to be selected, although both effects are active. Choosing a second primary power option replaces regeneration.\nEvery four seconds, the selected powers are applied with a duration of 9 seconds, plus 2 seconds per pyramid level, to all players in range. Thus, when powers are changed or a player travels outside the area-of-effect, the powers persist for 5\u20139 seconds, or 13-17 seconds with a full pyramid.\nRange.\nThe beacon affects an area in the shape of a square column, which reaches downward and out to each side at a range determined by the size of the pyramid base (see table below), and upward a distance of that range + 384 blocks. \nThe range of the beacon effect is limited by the simulation distance. As such, on simulation distance of 4 with a level 4 pyramid, the effect will not reach the chunks on the corners of the beacon range. \nThe distance from the player to the beacon block does not affect the intensity of the status effect.\nLight source.\nBeacon blocks can function as light sources, emitting a light level 15. Like other &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; sources, they melt &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nPiston interactivity.\nBeacons cannot be pushed or pulled by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA beacon has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block."}

Players can sleep during a thunderstorm even if they are in a biome where it does not rain (i.e. Desert). Attempting to use a bed at any other time results in the message \"You can only sleep at night or during thunderstorms\". A player sleeps in a bed for 101 in-game &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s, or 5.05 seconds before the time skips to the next day. Sleeping in a bed with the set to codice_1 results in the player being kicked out of the bed after the 101 ticks, but does not change time of the world to day.\nSleeping in a bed is possible only in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. Attempting to sleep in a bed in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"custom%20dimension\"&gt;custom dimension&lt;/a&gt;s in which they are disabled causes it to &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explode&lt;/a&gt; and set &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; to surrounding blocks; unless is set to . The explosion has power 5, which is stronger than &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; (4), but not as strong as a charged &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"End%20Crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt; (6). The explosion centers on the head part of the bed. &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s can sleep normally in any dimension without the bed being blown up. Upon death from a bed explosion, the &lt;a href=\"death%20messages\"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; \"(Player) was killed by [Intentional Game Design]\" appears.\nThe player must be close to the bed to sleep. If the player is close enough to click on the bed, but not close enough to sleep in it, the message \"You may not rest now, the bed is too far away\"/\"Bed is too far away\" appears. A player must be within 2 blocks of the bed or 3 blocks to use the bed.\nIf a \"monster\" is within 8 blocks of the bed horizontally (in the X- and Z-axis), and 5 blocks vertically (in the Y-axis), the message \"You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby\" appears and the player is prevented from sleeping until the monsters leave or are killed. Most hostile mobs, as well as some neutral mobs prevent players from sleeping, as shown in the table below.\nIf the player has not entered a bed and didn't die for 3 in-game days, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn unless is set to . , this can be verified by checking if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" &lt;a href=\"statistic\"&gt;statistic&lt;/a&gt; is greater than 1.00 h.\nA hostile mob can wake a player that is sleeping.\nThe player also cannot sleep in a bed occupied by another player, resulting in the message, \"This bed is occupied\".\nA player can, however, sleep in a bed being used by a villager. The player may first wake the villager (pressing on the villager) and then quickly enter the bed before the villager can lie down again. The villager reclaims the bed after the player wakes. The villager is kicked out of its bed when a player attempts to sleep there.\nA player also cannot sleep while on fire, while poisoned, or while starving.\nIf all sleeping requirements are met and the player enters a bed, the player is positioned in the bed. The player falls asleep as the screen fades to black. , the sleeping animation slowly lowers the player into bed.\nOnce all players in a world are asleep, after 5 seconds (100 ticks) the time of day changes to sunrise. (time 0)\nDuring this time, the chat window is focused, and the player can leave the bed by clicking the button.\n&lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;Waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; beds cannot be slept in unless the player or villager has the or status effects. Attempting to use a waterlogged bed otherwise does not display any message.\nBeds displaying an error above the hotbar is a feature exclusive to beds; other blocks that cannot be used do not display such a message.\nIf there are two or more blocks of space above the bed, then the player can wake up on the bed. If there is less than two blocks above the bed and there is room on the side, then the player wakes up on the side of the bed. If there is no space on the side of the bed and there is less than two blocks above the bed, then the player still wakes up on top of the bed, but suffocates if it's a solid block. \nVillagers always wake up on top of the bed, meaning they can suffocate if there isn't enough room above the bed.\nPassing the night.\nSleeping changes the &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;time of day&lt;/a&gt; to sunrise and resets the &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; cycle, changing the weather to clear conditions. , the weather cycle is only reset if it is currently raining or snowing. The player wakes up next to the bed, facing the bed.\nSleeping does not accelerate processes that take place over time such as the growth of &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;. If is codice_1, the player instead wakes up in the night.\nTo skip the night in multiplayer, all players in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; must be in bed at the same time. Pressing the button is not necessary in this case. The percentage of players that need to sleep to skip the night can be customized with the game rule .\nVillagers are unable to skip the night by sleeping in beds, unlike players.\nIf the bed is destroyed while the player is in it, due to for example an explosion or by another player, the player wakes prematurely and the night does not pass.\nSetting the spawn point.\nOnce a player has entered a bed (or right clicked the bed during daytime), their spawn point is set to the location of that bed. , multiple players can set their spawn point on a single bed. , the last player to use a specific bed is the only player who can respawn there, and players who had previously slept there respawn at the world spawn.\n a bed in the daytime likewise sets the spawn point, without actually entering the bed. \nWhen a bed explodes, it does not set the spawn point. \nThe message \"Respawn point set\" is displayed in chat when the respawn point is successfully changed.\nThe check for a bed is made only when the player respawns. This means that the bed can be destroyed and replaced or even reoriented, but as long as there is a bed present in the same location, the player can respawn there. If a player's bed is absent, or if the area around the bed is made unsuitable for respawning (see below), a message is displayed saying \"You have no home bed or charged respawn anchor, or it was obstructed\"/\"Your home bed was missing or obstructed\", and the player respawns at the &lt;a href=\"Spawn%23World%20spawn\"&gt;world spawn&lt;/a&gt; point. \nWhen choosing where to respawn the player, the northwesternmost (lowest X- and Z-coordinates) location of the seven blocks adjacent to the head of the bed is chosen first. If this location is obstructed, the next choice is to its south (+Z), rather than the east (+X). Only when all seven locations around the head are obstructed are the three remaining ones adjacent to the foot then to be considered. \nFor a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g. torches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed. It does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. Putting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall. The bed never spawns the player on or directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed. If a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn. That is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again. \nSpecifically, when interacting with it, the location of the \"head\" of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works. This can be observed by reorienting the bed with its head in the same location. Interacting with it does not produce a \"Respawn point set\" message as the game doesn't change the saved spawn point. If a bed is reoriented so that its foot is in this space, it still functions on the next respawn, but it can also be interacted with to update the spawn point to the new head of the bed and cause a \"Respawn point set\" message. Attempting the reverse, reorienting the bed so that it overlaps the original location of the foot, results in a respawn at world spawn. However, the location of the foot of the bed is also saved. If the bed is moved so that part of it overlaps the original location of the head, it can be observed that the same locations need to be obstructed to stop spawning. It is possible to respawn 2 blocks away from the bed this way.\nBouncing.\nFalling onto a bed bounces the player with 66% strength \u2013 the bouncing-up velocity is 66% of the impact velocity. The player also takes 50% of normal fall damage.\nBaby villagers bounce on beds during the day.\nIf the player is falling while sleeping requirements are met, and presses on a bed within reach before hitting the ground, the fall damage is delayed until the player wakes.\nA player can bounce on a bed while another player or villager is sleeping on it without waking the player or the villager up.\nVillagers can be pushed onto beds, as the bed is half a block tall.\nCuring.\nEach bed in the vicinity of a zombie villager has a chance to speed up the &lt;a href=\"Zombie_Villager%23Curing\"&gt;process of curing the zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;. Iron bars (such as in a prison cell) also have this effect.\nPlacement.\nBeds require two blocks of floor space. Placement requires at least 2 blocks from the player's facing direction. When placed, the foot of the bed is placed on the block selected and the head of the bed on the block farther away from the player. , beds require solid blocks below them when placed. However, the bed remains in place if its supporting blocks are later removed. , beds do not require supporting blocks and can be placed anywhere, provided there is enough room. \nData values.\nMetadata.\n, bed items use the following data values:\nBlock data.\nA bed has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\""}

It cannot be obtained as an item in Survival.\nObtaining.\nBedrock can be obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Creative%20inventory\"&gt;Creative inventory&lt;/a&gt;, or using &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nBedrock cannot normally be broken in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode with any tool. It can only be broken by hand in the oneblockatatime snapshot and has a hardness value of 600.\nHowever, it can be broken using glitches involving a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, but it does not drop as an item.\nNatural generation.\nBedrock comprises the five bottom-most layers of the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; in a rough pattern, although the top four layers are predominantly flat bedrock with only rare gaps, rendering the lowest, completely flat fifth layer (at Y=-64) mostly inaccessible.\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, bedrock comprises both the top and bottom four layers in a rough pattern. In both \"Java\" and \"Bedrock\" Editions, the patterns of bedrock are consistent in the Nether. At the top of the Nether, bedrock prevents the player from ascending above Y=127 without exploiting glitches, although in \"Java Edition\" the build limit extends to Y=255 in the Nether, meaning it is possible to build there. This space, known as the \"Nether ceiling\", consists entirely of flat bedrock and the occasional &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s. No mobs spawn here, as nothing can spawn on bedrock, although mobs can spawn on valid blocks placed by a player.\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, a single block of bedrock generates on top of each &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20pillar\"&gt;obsidian pillar&lt;/a&gt;, each topped with an &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;. The bedrock remains after the destruction of the crystal (because it is indestructible), and is lit on fire indefinitely. Bedrock additionally comprises part of the &lt;a href=\"exit%20portal\"&gt;exit portal&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the &lt;a href=\"central%20island\"&gt;central island&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike in other dimensions, there is no bedrock floor at the bottom of the End, meaning it is possible to fall into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; without exploiting glitches.\nAn unlimited number of &lt;a href=\"end%20gateway\"&gt;end gateway&lt;/a&gt;s generate randomly across the outer End islands, each consisting of 12 blocks of bedrock.\nPost-generation.\nIf the bedrock that makes up the exit portal is removed by any means, it regenerates when the ender dragon is defeated or re-summoned. \nAn end gateway is generated on the central End island upon the death of each &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, which is mostly made of bedrock. A total of 20 of these gateways generate in a circle centered on the exit portal in set positions. A corresponding end gateway is generated in the inner edge of the &lt;a href=\"outer%20islands\"&gt;outer islands&lt;/a&gt; after an end gateway on the central island is activated for the first time.\nUsage.\nBedrock generates at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent players from falling into the void. \nThe bedrock ceiling in the Nether was intended to prevent players from accessing the Nether ceiling, which was meant to be an empty out-of-bounds area where players cannot build. This remains true in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;\"Bedrock Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;. However, in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.2.1\"&gt;Java Edition 1.2.1&lt;/a&gt;, the world height was doubled from 127 to 255, a change which was applied in all three dimensions, allowing players to build on the Nether ceiling. Due to the amount of players taking advantage of this change, it was decided by Mojang that this was to be treated as an intended feature.\nBedrock generates as part of important structures in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, including crucial elements of the ender dragon fight, as well as the gateways and the exit portals, in order to prevent them from being broken and keep them accessible and usable.\nMobs do not spawn on bedrock. &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; are unable to place the block they are holding onto bedrock.\n&lt;a href=\"Beacon\"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt;s treat bedrock as a transparent block, meaning their beams can pass through it, allowing beacons to be used in the Nether.\nIn the End, any fire on bedrock never extinguishes naturally, similar to &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrapping the wither.\nSince bedrock is indestructible in Survival, it can be used against &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s. Certain configurations of bedrock (Such as that found under the exit portal) can be used to securely trap withers by spawning them below the bedrock. The wither can then either be easily killed, utilized to break blocks automatically, or used to farm &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEnd crystal.\nBedrock is one of the only two blocks on which &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s can be placed, the other being &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlacing an &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt; on bedrock in the End sets it on fire.\nNote Blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Note%20block\"&gt;Note block&lt;/a&gt;s can be placed above bedrock to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nPiston interactivity.\nBedrock is unable to be pushed or pulled by either of the &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; variants (regular or sticky).\nData values.\nBlock states.\n, bedrock uses the following block states:"}

This is in its early development stages, so as with any early release software, it may have severe issues. Due to this, support may be stopped at any time.\nConfiguration.\nBDS is a server hosting tool similar to the \"Java Edition\" &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;. Like \"Java Edition\", there is a and file. Instead of , permissions are stored in the file. &lt;a href=\"Resource%20pack\"&gt;Resource&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Behavior%20packs\"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt; packs are in the and directories. JSON files in the world directory set packs to be used, \"Minecraft\" clients generate them and can be uploaded to the server. Worlds are in a new world directory.\nConnection.\nXbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch users can only connect though a custom DNS or a LAN connection. To connect with a custom DNS to a Java server, you'll need an additional step. Besides the account on your respective console, you also require a separate Minecraft Java account. Essentially, this means that you need to have two accounts: one for your console and one for Minecraft Java edition. BDS uses UDP, unlike \"Java Edition\" which uses TCP. The default port for IPv4 is 19132, the default port for IPv6 is 19133; these can be changed in .\nBy default, Minecraft for Windows 10 does not support connections to a server hosted on the same machine (where you connect via ). To fix this, you must launch Windows PowerShell or cmd as an administrator and run the following:\nCheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n=\"Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\"\nAlternatively, you can grant loopback exemption by Security Identifier (as recommended in the codice_1 file bundled with the server download). Launch PowerShell or cmd as an administrator and run the following:\nCheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -p=S-1-15-2-1958404141-86561845-1752920682-3514627264-368642714-62675701-733520436\nWhitelist.\nTo use the whitelist, it needs to be enabled in . When enabled, the server will only allow selected users to connect, and you will need to know the Xbox Live gamertag and (optionally) XUID of all players who want to join the server; players without an Xbox Live gamertag will not be able to connect. If your server is public and you do not enable the whitelist, you will not be able to ban players from the server.\nTo learn more about whitelisting, check out the codice_1 file bundled with the server download. If you are having trouble with player behavior on a server that you own, whitelisting may be a good way to solve the issue.\nCommunity Resources.\nPlugin Support software.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDS\"&gt;LiteLoaderBDS&lt;/a&gt; is an unofficial plugin loader that provides basic API support for Bedrock Dedicated Server, with a massive API, lots of packed utility interfaces, a rich event system and powerful basic interface support. With LiteLoaderBDS and plugins, it is easy to extend the functionality of BDS, the associated development is easy to learn, and the development approach is flexible.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/bdsx/bdsx\"&gt;BDSX&lt;/a&gt; is a modification of Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server, supporting node.js. Because it is based on the offical BDS software, it includes all the features of vanilla \"Minecraft\", but includes other features as well, such as hooking functions and packets to change behavior.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone\"&gt;Endstone&lt;/a&gt; is a modern plugin loader that provides a high-level plugin API for Bedrock Dedicated Servers, supporting both Python and C++. It allows developers to extend Bedrock Dedicated Servers without the hassle of dealing with low-level hooks. Endstone users will benefit from all vanilla features and native support for both Windows and Linux.\nIssues.\nSince this server software is still in Alpha phase, therefore, it still lacks many built-in functions in the Java server, and there are many very serious problems:\nHistory.\nThe server follows the client's release cycle."}

Most stores have their own compliance requirements and subject the incoming edition to a series of certification tests before making it available for download. &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20Game%20Studios\"&gt;Xbox Game Studios&lt;/a&gt; attempts to synchronize availability across stores, but the certification process is not under their control and can delay an edition's availability on a certain platform, especially if it fails certification and has to go back to the developers for a fix.\nBedrock code is used for , , , and , as well as the discontinued , , and .\nNomenclature.\nUp until June 7, 2022, the name \"Bedrock Edition\" was not the official name of any edition of the game. Starting with the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;, all Bedrock editions of \"Minecraft\" have been named simply Minecraft. Before then, they each had a subtitle identifying the target platform, including (for all mobile platforms), , , and . The earliest of these was , also known as \"MCPE\" or \"PE\", and these names were (and still are) sometimes used to refer to all the Bedrock editions, possibly even including those that were introduced after the renaming occurred.\nThe renaming of the Bedrock editions to \"Minecraft\" with no \"Edition\" subtitles created confusion in the community for several reasons: \nTogether, these complications made the official name \"Minecraft\" useless for referring to the Bedrock editions collectively. The editors of this wiki, however, needed such a term in order to describe the functioning of the Bedrock Engine across all editions, so despite there not being a real Bedrock Edition, the wiki chose to use this as a . Subsequently, the community adopted it as well and it is now the de facto standard term for referring to all the Bedrock editions collectively. &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; employees have also used Bedrock Edition to refer to said edition in news articles, until June 7, 2022 where both \"Java Edition\" for PC and Bedrock Edition for Windows are sold under one bundle, titled Minecraft: Java &amp; Bedrock Edition for PC, marking the first official use of \"Bedrock Edition\" as a subtitle in any Bedrock editions.\nGameplay.\nThe objective of the game remains the same as its and counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. Like them, Bedrock Edition has &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; elements such as &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; dimensions. The &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode is cross-platform compatible between all supported devices.\nBedrock Edition differs from \"Java Edition\" and Legacy Console Edition in a variety of ways, such as more saturated graphics, different terrain generation, some exclusive items, and an official add-on system. The &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; and other elements vary for each relevant device. Players can interact with the game via a keyboard and mouse, touchscreen, or a gamepad. \nDifferences from \"Java Edition\" include: \nSome features of \"Bedrock Edition\" are available only on certain platforms. \nCompatible devices.\nSome devices below these specifications have been known to work fine either with or without custom ROM images, kernels, and of the CPU. The CPU is not supported due to its lack of the floating-point unit. The \"Tegra 2\" processor is also not supported because it lacks support for Neon.\nDevelopment.\nRelease.\nA video of an early prototype was released on Twitter (now X), showing the game on the Xperia PLAY. The Alpha version was later released, and was released for different platforms on October 7, 2011. The non-exclusive version was going to be released on September 29 for Android but there were several severe bugs that needed to be fixed; the release was delayed until October 7.\nA version for iOS devices was confirmed to be released before 2012 in an interview with Mojang Studios and was subsequently released on November 17, 2011.\nAlpha.\nAfter the initial releases for Android and iOS, updates were released in parallel, with the same features being added for both platforms. During the Alpha stage, various aspects of gameplay were introduced into the Bedrock codebase including: &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, more &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; and more game modes to bring it closer to the \"Java Edition\". As the \"Pocket Edition\" development team works closely, often blocks released on the \"Java Edition\" are released around the same time for \"Pocket Edition\". Certain features were also tested on \"Pocket Edition\" before their Java releases, such as &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s and their related items, and also &lt;a href=\"block%20model\"&gt;block model&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the Alpha phase, the Bedrock codebase was ported to more platforms: first, \"Pocket Edition\" was released for Fire on September 13, 2012, and for Windows Phone on December 10, 2014. The Beta was released on July 29, 2015, at a higher price than \"Pocket Edition\". was released April 27, 2016 for the same price as \"Pocket Edition\".\nTwo other versions of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" that are based on the Bedrock codebase, but separate from Bedrock Edition, were also released during this period. is a free and discontinued version of \"Minecraft\" for the Raspberry Pi, which was based on an old alpha version of Bedrock. was released for Windows and macOS on November 1, 2016.\nFull release.\nOn November 11, 2016, the full release of the game, version &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; (dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Update\"&gt;Ender Update&lt;/a&gt;), was announced. It was released on December 19, 2016, along with the and . \"Pocket Edition\" began to receive updates again for Windows 10 Mobile on February 22, 2017. \nFrom version &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.0\"&gt;1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;, the Bedrock editions no longer have the \"Edition\" subtitle and are renamed to simply \"Minecraft\". A port of Bedrock Edition for Xbox One was released along with the update, and one for the Nintendo Switch was released digitally and physically on June 21, 2018. PlayStation 4 users received the Bedrock Edition with the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.14.0\"&gt;1.14.0&lt;/a&gt; update on December 10, 2019. Owners of the original for these consoles are able to download the new version for free. In October 2020, the Gear VR and Windows 10 Mobile editions of the game were discontinued. In June 2021, the Fire TV edition of the game was discontinued.\nBeta and \"Preview\" test versions.\nStarting on November 22, 2013, &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; began to publicly release testing versions of full updates to Android users who opt into the beta program, in order to get major feedback, especially for bug reporting. This enabled the official updates to be considerably more stable.\nVersions from 0.8.0 to 0.12.1 required opting into a Google+ group to receive development builds. Players would then see development updates appear as normal updates in the Play Store. On July 17, 2015, the Google+ group was removed due to the amount of spam and advertisements that the group attracted. On November 3, 2015, the PE Beta team published a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//pocketbeta.minecraft.net\"&gt;dedicated blog&lt;/a&gt; that was subsequently used for users to opt into the 0.13.0 beta program and to display changelogs for these development builds.\nThe Xbox Insider Hub app is used to opt into the beta program on Windows since July 31, 2017, and on Xbox One since August 24. Before the release of the Better Together Update, the Xbox One beta was available only to owners of the digital version of the original , and not owners of the disc version.\nStarting on January 31, 2022, the beta program was expanded to other platforms, starting with iOS and iPadOS, with \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Preview\"&gt;Minecraft Preview&lt;/a&gt;\". The previous beta program through Xbox Insider Hub has been phased out and replaced by \"Minecraft Preview\".\nPlayers can also test unfinished or work-in-progress features using &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Gameplay\"&gt;Experimental Gameplay&lt;/a&gt;, a toggle that can be turned on through world settings, but once on, it cannot be turned off again in that world.\nPrice.\nAlthough all Bedrock editions are nearly identical, the price varies depending on the platform. The Android, iOS/iPadOS, and Fire versions cost 6.99 (6.99), while the ChromeOS, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 versions cost US$19.99 (\u00a319.99, \u00a316.74, and \u00a312.99 respectively). The Windows and Nintendo Switch versions are the most expensive, both costing US$29.99 (\u00a324.99 and \u00a319.99 respectively), though the Windows version includes \"Java Edition\" and the Nintendo Switch version includes some DLC. DLC purchased from the &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; on one platform is usable on all other platforms, but the game itself is sold separately on each platform. Xbox &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; are not shared between platforms and buying the game on one of these platforms does not get the game on the others. The Xbox One and Windows versions are also playable to Xbox Game Pass for Console and PC Game Pass subscribers respectively, with both versions playable to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions are playable on the and respectively via backward compatibility. As with all other versions of \"Minecraft\", updates are free of charge. On Windows, the game can be launched via the \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSales.\nAs of December 2013, \"Pocket Edition\" (the only Bedrock Codebase edition at the time) had sold 16.5 million copies, while at the same time, the had sold 13 million. These calculations came out after the 0.8.0 update. This was considered a huge success, with \"Pocket Edition\" outselling both \"Java Edition\" and &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt;, despite being considered to be the least-developed at the time.\nOn December 2, 2016, &lt;a href=\"Marsh%20Davies\"&gt;Marsh Davies&lt;/a&gt; announced that \"Pocket Edition\" had sold over 40 million copies (at the time, \"Java Edition\" had sold over 24 million). This statistic included and .\n\"Minecraft\" is also usually in the top 10 and regularly #1 in the Apple App Store's and Google Play's \"Paid Apps\" Section in the \"Top Charts\".\nPlatform differences.\nThere are several features in Bedrock Edition that are exclusive to certain platforms due to capability restrictions on different platforms. Here is a table of the features that are available only on certain platforms."}

{"id": "88883", "revid": "51780602", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=88883", "title": "Bedrock Edition 1.2.0", "text": "1.2.0, the first release of the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;, is a major update to &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Edition&lt;/a&gt; that renamed it to simply \"Minecraft\", added support for the Xbox One, introduced cross-platform gameplay, and leaped the game much closer to feature parity with , adding features such as new world options, &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s, and more. It was released on September 20, 2017, although the full rollout took a few days due to a large number of distribution channels and target devices involved. Support for the Nintendo Switch was also added to the game, however it was not deployed to that platform initially due to problems with cross-device connectivity and upgrading of old worlds. The target date for Switch deployment was postponed until June 21, 2018.\nThis update represented an important advance in the history of computer gaming in that it extended \"crossplay\" (short for \"cross-platform gameplay\", the ability of players on different platforms to play interactively in the same world) to virtually all of the newest-generation gaming platforms. Previously, the \"Pocket Edition\" had supported cross-play between mobile, Windows 10, and VR platforms. This update added support for the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, drastically increasing the number of devices that could participate.\nThe updated game was also designed to work with the Sony PlayStation 4, but Sony had previously declined to participate. Mojang said that it was in ongoing talks with Sony about a possible future agreement. Mojang also stated that it will consider porting this update to Macintosh, Linux, or any other platform with sufficiently strong demand, further expanding the crossplay concept. It wasn't until &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.14.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.14.0&lt;/a&gt; that the PlayStation 4 got support for Bedrock Edition.\nWith the unification of so many different platforms under one version of the game, the nickname \"Pocket Edition\" became increasingly outdated. From 1.2.0 onwards, Mojang referred to this version as the \"Bedrock Engine\" or \"Bedrock Edition\" when distinguishing it from either the game as a whole or other versions of Minecraft. The name \"Bedrock\" came from the internal name for its source code database. To emphasize the broad range of supported devices, \"Minecraft: Bedrock Edition\" became known simply as \"Minecraft.\" The original Java version of Minecraft, which had formerly held that designation, was officially renamed \"Minecraft: Java Edition\" to avoid confusion.\nVideo.\nVideo made by &lt;a href=\"slicedlime\"&gt;slicedlime&lt;/a&gt;:"}

This edition was bundled with seven add-on packs, and sixteen additional packs were also available as downloadable content. Exclusive content based on Nintendo properties was also available for the game: a mash-up based on the Super Mario franchise was released in May 2016. Due to the Nintendo eShop for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS no longer allowing the purchasing of titles as of March 2023, this game can no longer be purchased on the Nintendo eShop.

There was some limited touchscreen functionality, allowing players to select items on their hotbar, navigate through the Crafting menu, and more. When asked about whether the Wii U GamePad could be used as a second screen for full inventory management, &lt;a href=\"Owen%20Jones\"&gt;Owen Jones&lt;/a&gt; stated it was not at the moment, but it would be cool. The Wii U GamePad was never usable as a second screen. Mii characters were used as the player's in-game username. In addition to the Wii U GamePad, the game was also playable with the Wii U Pro Controller, the Wii Classic Controller, or the Wii Classic Controller Pro.\nDLC.\nThe \"Wii U Edition\" came with six of the \"most popular add-on packs\" included.

This can allow the player to continue to \"bounce\" on a player or mob with a chain of smash attacks one after another.\nEach level increases the \"rebound\" height by 7 blocks.\nWind burst will not save you from fall damage.

Thus, if you are not confident in your ability to break your fall on your way down, you might want to opt for a lower level.\nTo activate Wind Burst and start a chain of smash attacks on relatively flat terrain, one can launch themselves upwards with a &lt;a href=\"wind%20charge\"&gt;wind charge&lt;/a&gt; or even jump from a one-block height before hitting their target."}

It was stated that two Minecraft projects were being made, one being \"a toy\" and the other being \"closer to the game.\"\nA and a Surface Pro 3 could be seen at Microsoft's segment at the E3 2015 convention, wherein both devices demoed were running the \"Windows 10 Edition\" of Minecraft and were seamlessly playing together.\nTwo different playable modes were shown, one being a \"wall\" mode where a player can use an Xbox controller to interact and play with a conventional Minecraft world that was being projected holographically onto a wall. It is possible to resize the projection and also to fix the projection into place which allows for peering through from the left or right to get a different perspective similar to that of a window without the need of a controller. The other was a \"reality\" mode in which players are able to project a world in 3D atop of real-world objects such as a table without the need for a controller.\nIn reality mode, players are able to use voice commands and hand gestures among other features of the headset to interact with the world. It is possible to target specific areas of the map with voice commands by glimpsing towards them, for example looking directly at an object and using a command such as \"lightning strike\" would summon a lightning bolt relative to that area. Another example is the ability to \"markup\" an area by looking at an object which creates a vertical beam of light similar to &lt;a href=\"Beacon\"&gt;Beacon&lt;/a&gt;s. Voice commands can also be used to change the view of the world and allows for following a player with modes such as \"close up\" or \"overview\" to change how close the camera is to the player. Hand gestures such as pinching can be used to zoom into a particular area, pan around the world and also to move the world vertically.\nOculus Rift.\nThe Windows 10 Edition can run on the Oculus Rift, via a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//oculus.com/experiences/rift/741306562635466\"&gt;free download from the Oculus Store&lt;/a&gt; .\nOn September 24, 2015 it was announced that \"Minecraft\" would be coming to the , and would be available in the spring of 2016. Oculus Rift support was launched on August 15, 2016."}

There are three variants in the biome family.\u200c\nDescription.\nWindswept hills generate in areas with high &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt;, high &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Weirdness\"&gt;PV&lt;/a&gt; and high &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Continentalness\"&gt;continentalness&lt;/a&gt;, which means that the terrain is usually flat, but sometimes hilly and shattered. The cliffs of the windswept hills generally and peaks at roughly Y-level 140. Above Y=120\u00b18, rainfall changes to &lt;a href=\"snowfall\"&gt;snowfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the hills becomes snow-capped, along with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; freezing into &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; are an aqua color. These are the only biomes, besides &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; biomes, where &lt;a href=\"emerald%20ore\"&gt;emerald ore&lt;/a&gt; is found. Like &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"infested%20block\"&gt;infested block&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; can be generated underground below the sea level. &lt;a href=\"Oak\"&gt;Oak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt; trees occasionally generate here, with a bit of &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"poppies\"&gt;poppies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s on the ground. &lt;a href=\"Llama\"&gt;Llama&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn in these biomes.\n&lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; in windswept hills can be challenging to beginners, due to the heights often risking heavy fall damage and higher elevations bringing snow and ice, but can be fairly easy once the player has acclimated to the area and found or made a flat-enough space for shelter. &lt;a href=\"Llama\"&gt;Llama&lt;/a&gt;s can also serve as useful pack animals when tamed. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; must be protected by light or a roof to prevent it from freezing when above the &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Precipitation\"&gt;snowfall line&lt;/a&gt;, however, and the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; must be aware of their surroundings to avoid falling off steep cliffs, especially when fighting &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Care should also be taken when mining in windswept hills, due to infested stone occasionally generating; the player might get swarmed with silverfish if they're not prepared.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nVariants.\nWindswept Hills.\nThe windswept hills biome is the regular variant, which has sporadical oak and spruce trees. This biome features the stony and grassy terrain surface. \nWindswept Forest.\nThe windswept forest variant lacks stony terrain surface. The tall grass and trees generate more often, forming sparse forests. While the increased wood supply can be useful, the risk of fatal fall damage still exists, especially if this variant generates on the edge of a tall hill. This variant generates in areas with high &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt;, which means it is usually surrounded by forested biomes like &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWindswept Gravelly Hills.\nThe windswept gravelly hills variant has sporadical oak and spruce trees. This biome replaces the top few layers of stone, grass block and &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; across its landscape. Due to the gravel replacing most of the grass, trees generate far less often, making this variant relatively barren. Players should be careful when surfacing from underground in this biome, as the top layers of gravel can pose a suffocation hazard. This variant generates in lower humidity values, mainly next to &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;."}

Every &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt; spawns a witch and a &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; inside during world generation both which never despawn. Otherwise, witches spawn in the hut. , only witches spawn in the 7\u00d77\u00d79 volume that is the hut, which is the size of the roof and one block over the porch, from one level below the floor of the hut to two blocks above the roof. , the hut has a hardcoded spawn spot on which witches spawn: the spawn spot is the same for every hut.\nSome witches always spawn as part of raids starting from wave 4 or wave 3 or 4 depending on the world &lt;a href=\"Difficulty%23World%20settings\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. A villager transforms into a witch when lightning strikes within four blocks. The witch transformed from a villager does not despawn and cannot be changed back into a villager. This witch attacks the player with its potions even if the player &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; with it before.\nWitches are a source of potion ingredients and are the only mobs that are able to spawn in the small area around a swamp hut. These huts are the best place to farm witches, but they require spawning platforms and light levels of 0. A hut can support a maximum of three spawning platforms. Witch huts generate in swamp biomes sometimes, but the witch-exclusiveness depends on the entire hut being inside a swamp biome. In raids found in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, it is more worthwhile to simply build an &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt; farm and deal with witches as they spawn.\nDrops.\nA witch &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Witches have the largest &lt;a href=\"loot%20table\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt; of any &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, making one to three &lt;a href=\"drops\"&gt;drops&lt;/a&gt; of zero to two &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s each, for a maximum of six items total. A witch may drop , , , , , or . The likelihood of a witch to drop sticks is 25%, while the remaining items have a probability of 12.5%. The odds of a witch dropping the maximum amount of items possible without a &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; enchantment are 1 in 81 (1.2%).\nEach level of Looting increases the maximum items dropped by one for each of the one to three drops, leading to a maximum of five items per drop and a maximum of fifteen items total. No Looting averages two items per kill, Looting I averages three, Looting II averages four and Looting III averages five.\nA potion has a 8.5% chance of dropping if a witch is killed while drinking the potion increased by 1% for every level of Looting. A witch drops one of the following in this case:\nBehavior.\nA witch is neither an &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt; nor a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;. Witches do not use housing, the equipment in their &lt;a href=\"swamp%20hut\"&gt;swamp hut&lt;/a&gt;s and cannot open &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s. Witches are peaceful toward villagers and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s when not participating in raids, although their potions can hit one by accident. , witches are given the &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;Glowing&lt;/a&gt; effect for 3 seconds when a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; is rung within 32 blocks of them. This applies to all witches, regardless of whether they participate in raids or not.\nThe &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"instant%20damage\"&gt;instant damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"evoker%20fangs\"&gt;evoker fangs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warden%23Attacks\"&gt;warden's sonic boom&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; magical sources are 85% less effective against witches. , witches are immune to poison, &lt;a href=\"fatal%20poison\"&gt;fatal poison&lt;/a&gt; and to their own thrown harming potions.\nWitches have a 1.5% chance every second to spawn 10 to 44 ornamental &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt;s above their heads, named \u201cwitch\u201d or \u201cwitchspell\u201d and purple in color.\nA witch pursues the player within 16 blocks and uses potions of the first level in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, throwing &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt;s offensively and drinking &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s defensively. These potions are the same as ones obtainable through &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;, with the same duration. A witch has an infinite stock of potions, even when transformed from a villager or not having had any potions equipped in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Each potion chosen by the witch depends on the circumstance and is thrown within ten blocks and in a three-second interval.\nA witch may choose to equip and drink a potion each &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt; ( second) if it is not already drinking a potion. Drinking the potion takes 1.6 seconds and slows down its moving speed. It does not attack during this time.\nAs a result, witches are difficult to kill via &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; due to their frequent use of healing potions, cannot drown underwater and require a long time to die in lava or fire.\nIf the raid members kill all the villagers in a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, witches jump in commemoration to their victory. \n, any witch can join a &lt;a href=\"patrol\"&gt;patrol&lt;/a&gt; if sufficiently near a patrol captain. These witches are hostile towards villagers, wandering traders and iron golems if in their sight. Witches that participate in a raid seek out &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s and throw splash potions of &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; of 45 seconds or &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt; if they have or less. \nWitches do not retaliate when attacked by evoker fangs, illagers, or harming potions from other witches. Instead, they drink a beneficial potion. , witches participating in a raid do not heal other illagers, but still attack the player, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Witches throw negative splash potions at any mob that attacks it, including other witches and illagers.\nSounds.\nWitches use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nWitches have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nHistory.\n "}

It is the only source of &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used to craft &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpawning.\nThe wither is spawned by placing 4 blocks of &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; in a T shape (see image on the right in the \"Behavior\" section), and putting 3 &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton%20skull\"&gt;wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt;s on top of the three upper blocks. The last block placed \"must\" be one of the three skulls and can be placed by the player or a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Air\"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; blocks are required on either side of the base soul sand or soul soil under the upper &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s (non-solid blocks such as &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s prevent the wither from spawning). The building pattern can have any orientation (including horizontal and upside-down) as well as the skulls; the wither always spawns at the foot of the pattern. When the wither has successfully &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;ed, it is angered and creates an &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; around itself.\nLike all other &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, the wither despawns when the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is changed to &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt;. Building the wither spawning structure in Peaceful difficulty does not spawn anything.\nDrops.\nThe wither always drops one upon death. The &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; does not increase this drop. A wither also drops experiences when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"tamed\"&gt;tamed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nWhen spawned, the wither grows larger in size as its health bar fills up. While in this state, the wither is invulnerable, and neither moves nor attacks. When this state ends (after 11 seconds), the wither creates a large &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing up to damage to nearby mobs and players, depending on difficulty. This explosion has a blast power of 7, more than that of a &lt;a href=\"charged%20creeper\"&gt;charged creeper&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;. It is accompanied by a loud gruesome sound that can be heard equally from across the map and in all dimensions. After this, the wither attacks nearby mobs and can take damage.\nThe wither has the greatest natural health of all mobs in \"Minecraft\" (exceeded by the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;'s wither still has the highest health), at in \"Java Edition\" or in Bedrock Edition. The wither is immune to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"freezing\"&gt;freezing&lt;/a&gt;. Like other &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mobs, the wither is harmed by the &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt; effect and healed by the &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Instant Damage&lt;/a&gt; effect as well as affected by weapons with the &lt;a href=\"Smite\"&gt;Smite&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. It is immune to all other &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s, like the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon taking damage, the wither breaks all &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s within a 3\u00d74\u00d73 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"ancient%20debris\"&gt;ancient debris&lt;/a&gt;, dropping them as &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; if possible. The wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian.\nThe wither \"cannot\" break the following blocks: \n, these blocks are listed under the &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe wither's block-breaking behavior makes &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocation&lt;/a&gt; ineffective under most circumstances. However, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them, can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.\nThe wither is hostile toward all &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s except:\nIf the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude. On Normal or Hard &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.\nThe wither's &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"health%20bar\"&gt;health bar&lt;/a&gt; color depends on the edition: Dark purple on &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, or pink on &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;. It appears only when a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; is looking in the wither's direction, including through walls. All withers display a boss bar on the screen. Renamed withers display the changed name above its boss bar.\nThe sky darkens when the wither spawns (a kind of fog).\n\"Java Edition\".\nUpon noticing a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black &lt;a href=\"wither%20skull\"&gt;wither skull&lt;/a&gt;s. Each &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/&lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s at the same time. The main head controls the wither's movement and has a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one.\nWhenever a wither kills another mob, a &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt; is planted if the ground is &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; on \"Java Edition\", or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls. Wither roses are planted/dropped even when the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to .\nThe wither has a &lt;a href=\"passive\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"regeneration\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt; rate of every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals .\nWhen its health drops below half (), the wither gains a natural \"wither armor\" effect, which makes it immune to &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s and thrown &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s and causes it to fly at the same height as the target. The armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.\nBedrock Edition.\nUpon noticing a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, the wither flies to a random location and hovers in place. It shoots 3 black wither skulls and one blue wither skull before flying to another location. The time between each shot decreases as the wither loses health. On Normal &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; or higher, if the wither has targeted an entity but cannot find a location to pathfind to, it shoots random blue skulls in a random direction along with the skulls directed toward the target.\nWhen a wither reaches halfway of its total health, it causes a large &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; that spawns 3 &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s (except on Easy difficulty), as well as gaining wither armor. Instead of flying to a random location, it dashes toward its target, destroying blocks and damaging mobs in its path. It also fires up to 4 skulls per burst: three black skulls followed by one blue skull. \nIt has different &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; and death animations, both of which involve the wither exploding. Wither roses always drop as an item when the wither kills a mob. Wither roses are dropped even when the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to . The &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt; inflicts the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28effect%29\"&gt;Wither effect&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of seconds when stepped on.\nThe sky &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level drops to 11 and dark clouds appear from the moment the wither &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;s until it is dead, preventing &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; from burning in &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;light.\nOn Easy difficulty, the wither does not inflict the wither effect or summon wither skeletons.\nWithers will retain their anti-projectile armor after healing it over 1/2 of its total HP (), though it disappears after the game is restarted.\nWither skull.\nWhen attacking, the wither rapidly fires explosive projectiles called wither skulls, which look like its own heads, at its target. There are two types of wither skulls: a fast-moving black one, and a slower blue one.\nIf either type of wither skull hits a player or mob, it does damage on Normal difficulty. It also inflicts &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither II&lt;/a&gt; for 10 seconds on Normal difficulty and 40 seconds on Hard, which turns the player's hearts black () and drains health, similarly to &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike Poison, it can kill the player.\nLike other &lt;a href=\"status%20effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt;, the Wither effect can be cured by drinking &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;.\n and &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the blue skull can be deflected by hitting it with an empty hand, weapon, tool, or throwable projectiles such as tridents, arrows, &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s, and throwable potions.\nSounds.\nWithers use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events. Wither skulls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nWithers have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nWither skulls have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

The variants are:\nNaturally-spawned wolves are untamed and become hostile if attacked by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen summoned in other ways (e.g. using the spawn egg or using the command), the variant selection follows the natural spawning biome rules with the extensions of the fact that rusty wolf, spotted wolf, and striped wolf are selected in all &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; biomes, &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biomes, and &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biomes respectively.\nDrops.\nAdult wolves drop &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed wolf.

It also causes wild wolves and standing tamed wolves in a 33\u00d733\u00d721 cuboid centered on the attacked wolf to become hostile to the attacker, allowing coordination for attacks and team hunts (only in wild wolves).\nIn \"Java Edition\", any tamed wolf attacked by a player/mob causes all standing wolves on that team to attack that player/mob who attacked the tamed wolf.\nIf damaged by a mob or entity other than a player or arrow, wolves of any type only take roughly half of the original damage (codice_1).\nSkeletons and their &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%23Variants\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;, foxes, baby turtles and passive rabbits actively avoid both tamed and wild wolves. &lt;a href=\"Killer%20rabbit\"&gt;Killer rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s attack wolves actively.

Sheep ignore tamed wolves but also do not flee from them.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; within 8 blocks holds meat or bones near a wolf, the wolf tilts its head as if to 'beg' for the food for 2 to 4 seconds.\nThe behavior of pups is the same as tamed wolves. Pups have larger heads, similar to other animal babies.\nWolves are 0.85 or 0.8 blocks tall and pups are 0.425 or 0.4 blocks tall.\nThe textures of the wolves are tinted dark gray once submerged in water.\nIn Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, hostile wolves deal no damage to the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nMovement.\nStanding tamed wolves wander randomly when near their owner, but follow if more than 10 blocks away and teleport to a nearby free block (if any) if more than 12 blocks away. Besides making travel easier, teleportation can be used to rescue them from &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or pits, as they immediately teleport to a safe area.\nTeleportation.\nTamed wolves &lt;a href=\"teleportation\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt; to their owner, if they are more than 12 blocks away, with a few caveats.\nAn angry or untamed wolf does not teleport.\nTamed wolves do not teleport if:\nWolf teleportation is completely silent; this is not an oversight.\nTaming, health, and feeding.\nA wolf can be tamed by feeding it &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s. Once tamed, a wolf does not accept any more bones. Note that the number of bones required is random \u2013 each bone has a chance of taming the wolf. If the wolf is tamed, it receives a red collar and, in \"Java Edition\", sits if not &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;. There is no limit to the number of wolves the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can tame.\nA wolf's tail rises and lowers depending on its &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. The exact health of an individual wolf can be determined by measuring the angle between its hind legs and tail. The angle indicates the percentage of health that the wolf has. Tamed wolves whine when they have low health (below ). Wild wolves have a maximum health of , so their tails always remain significantly lower than those of tamed wolves. Tamed wolves can be healed by feeding them any sort of meat other than fish; listed below, this restores as much of the wolf's health as the same food would restore hunger points when eaten by the player.\nThe wolf cannot be tamed if it is hostile or already tamed.\nWolves that are tamed by the same player can accidentally attack each other while attacking another mob, leading to a fight.\nWolves do not get &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;food poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, so they can freely eat &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pufferfish%20%28item%29\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt;. Feeding a tamed wolf that is already at full health usually starts the \"&lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;love mode&lt;/a&gt;\" animation.\nA tamed wolf's necklace/collar color can be changed by a &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; on the wolf.\nBreeding.\nTamed wolves at full &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; can be bred with any type of meat, including rotten flesh and raw chicken without causing the hunger &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;. There is a 5-minute cooldown for breeding, during which the wolf does not accept meat.\nThe growth of pups can be slowly accelerated using any type of meat. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up. Unlike healing, rabbit stew or any type of fish cannot be used for breeding or speeding up growth.\nBreeding two wolves that recognize someone else as an owner causes the pup to also be owned by the owner of the original two wolves. If two tamed wolves have different owners, their pups will randomly follow one of their two owners.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; attacks an untamed wolf and then feeds it, hearts appear as when entering breeding mode, although the wolf does not breed and remains aggressive toward the player.\nSounds.\nWolves use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nWolves have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

A mansion is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;s, and is one of the only places where a &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totem of undying&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained. Besides &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, a mansion's interior lighting is sufficiently low for other Overworld monsters to spawn. Woodland mansions can only spawn every 20,000 to 10,000 blocks. Some seeds allow mansions to spawn at 1000 - 300 blocks away (1 in 10 million chance of finding one closer than 1000 blocks)\nGeneration.\nWoodland mansions typically generate thousands of &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; from the spawn point. They can be located with &lt;a href=\"woodland%20explorer%20map\"&gt;woodland explorer map&lt;/a&gt;s, which are obtained from cartographer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, but a map may not always point to the nearest one. The nearest woodland mansion may also be located via the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; enabled by cheats.\nMobs.\nA woodland mansion naturally generates &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;s inside the mansion, but because the entrance is open and most rooms in the woodland mansion are dark, &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s sometimes spawn in these rooms or come in through the entrance at night. \nThe first floor of the mansion may only generate rooms that contain vindicators; from the second floor upward, some large rooms may contain both evokers and vindicators. Neither type of illager spawns directly in the hallways of the mansion, but they often wander into the hallways after spawning in.\nOnce any of the vindicators or evokers are killed in a woodland mansion, they do not respawn, unlike pillagers, who respawn when all of them are killed in a pillager outpost.\nStructure.\nAlthough their exact structure varies, all woodland mansions have some things in common: they all have three floors with a variety of rooms, and generate a &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; foundation underneath the entire structure if there are any gaps between the bottom of the mansion and the ground. The top floor is about half the size of the lower floors, but the size of each top floor is pretty random for each mansion, depending on how many rooms are going to be generated on the top floor. Each mansion includes a large foyer that leads to the corridors connecting the rooms, a giant staircase also generates there, which leads up to the second floor. The foyer is dark and many hostile mobs spawn under the staircase. \nRooms.\nA woodland mansion contains many types of rooms. Because the layout is randomly generated, some room types may not be present. Furthermore, certain rooms within the mansion are not readily accessible \u2013 some may have sealed entrances, while secret rooms have no entrances at all.\nOne may access the individual structures of a woodland mansion by using &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt;s to manually load room structures from the codice_1 folder in &lt;a href=\"minecraft.jar\"&gt;minecraft.jar&lt;/a&gt;. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter codice_2, and press LOAD. A list of possible rooms, the names of these structures, and small descriptions are provided in the table below. Note that the room names are conjectural.\nMain and secret rooms.\nA woodland mansion can sometimes generate secret rooms on each floor. A secret room can be one of the following type: \"X\" room, spider room, fake end portal room, obsidian room, birch pillar room, clean chest room, lava room, and attic room, with the 'X\" room being the most common, and the \"lava\" room being the rarest. A way to look for a secret room is looking for gaps between normal rooms, this way is the best on the first floor, as there are no windows. Another way is looking through the windows through the second and third floors of the mansion, since some secret rooms are exposed to windows. A last way to look for a secret room is cutting down the roof, which works best for the third floor alone. Then you can see any secret rooms from the roof of the floor, as the whole floor's layout. \nIn the table below, a indicates either a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with random loot, or the spawn point of an &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;."}

The wool damps vibrations, preventing activation of nearby sculk blocks. Ancient cities can also generate blue, cyan, and light blue wool.\nMob loot.\n &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; on an adult &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; yields 1-3 wool. If unshorn, sheep drop 1 wool upon death. The wool dropped is the same color as the sheep.

Baby sheep cannot be sheared.\nWhite, light gray, gray, black, brown, and (rarely) pink wool can be found naturally on sheep. Getting a sheep of a different color requires dyeing the sheep.\nTrading.\n, apprentice-level &lt;a href=\"shepherd\"&gt;shepherd&lt;/a&gt; villagers have a 50% chance to sell one colored wool for an emerald, giving each wool color a (3.125%) chance of being offered.\n, apprentice-level shepherd villagers have a chance of selling one or two colored wool for an emerald, giving each wool color a (roughly 1.786%) chance of being offered.\nVillager gifts.\n, a shepherd &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt; may throw a block of wool of random color at a player under the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nUsage.\nWool comes in sixteen colors, which are white, orange, magenta, light blue, yellow, lime, pink, gray, light gray, cyan, purple, blue, brown, green, red, and black. Unlike &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, the white variant serves as the undyed block. Wool of any color can be re-dyed into any other color.\nWool is weak, highly flammable, and offers little resistance against &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s. \nTrading.\nNovice-level Shepherd villagers offer to buy 18 wool for an emerald, with the color being sold chosen randomly from white, gray, brown, or black. \nThe villager has a chance of offering the trade again with a different color.\nVibration occlusion.\nWool can be used to block vibrations from reaching nearby &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt;s. If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect vibrations behind it. Similarly, if a wool block is placed between a sensor and a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;, the sensor is unable to alert the shrieker. \nSculk sensors are not able to detect the placing and breaking of wool, as well as entities &lt;a href=\"walking\"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"jumping\"&gt;jumping&lt;/a&gt; on top of it. They are also unable to detect &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; dropped on wool, or wool itself dropped in item form.\nSimilar to sculk sensors, &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s are also unable to detect everything wool-related as listed above.\nNote blocks.\nWool blocks can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce guitar sounds.\u200c\nCrafting ingredient.\nAny color of wool or wood can be used for paintings but it has no effect on the product's final appearance.\nFuel.\n, wool can be used as fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Furnace%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;their variants&lt;/a&gt;, smelting 0.5 items per wool block."}

{"id": "55690", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55690", "title": "World border", "text": "The world border is the current edge of a \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" dimension.\nAppearance.\nThe world border appears as a series of animated, diagonal, narrow stripes.\nThe world border is &lt;a href=\"tint\"&gt;tinted&lt;/a&gt; depending on how and if its size is changing. By default, when the border is not changing, the stripes are a translucent aqua color. If the border is expanding, the stripes appear green; if the border is shrinking, they appear red.\nThe world border appears different depending on the current &lt;a href=\"graphics%20setting\"&gt;graphics setting&lt;/a&gt;, which is very likely not intended; on Fast and Fancy it appears as light and translucent, but on Fabulous! it appears considerably darker.\nSize.\nThe world border is essentially a giant bounding box; by default, its center lies at coordinates \" above \"Y: 255\".\"\n&lt;a href=\"%23Commands\"&gt;With commands&lt;/a&gt;, the size and position of the border can be modified. The world border always behaves in full block increments, even if it is set to a partial block. Its size and location remain the same across all &lt;a href=\"dimensions\"&gt;dimensions&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\nOn entities.\nMost &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, with exception to , are unable to move through the world border.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; is placed so that it directly faces the edge of the border, then items, projectiles, TNT, etc. can be fired outside of the edge of the border. Any items fired out of a dispenser float in midair; if an item is dropped from the player inventory, the item falls normally.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; is spawned from a dispenser via a spawn egg, the mob behaves normally. &lt;a href=\"Spiders\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt; can climb the world border, and &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; can teleport outside of it.\nAny &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s on the outside of the world border (with exception to those in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode) take constant damage as long as they are outside the border. The amount of damage depends on the distance to the border.\nWhile players themselves cannot move through the world border, even if they manage to go ahead of chunk loading, they can reach the other side of the world border through other means, including: \nEntities cannot spawn naturally outside the world border. They persist without taking damage if they spawned before the world border gets shrunk by a command.\nOn blocks.\nPlayers cannot normally place and destroy blocks, nor interact with objects outside of the world border, as there are no hitboxes. It \"is\" possible to place blocks outside of the world border, either by placing the block against one that is inside the world border or by using commands.\nMost blocks still function outside the world border, and most &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; contraptions still function as well. Exceptions include falling blocks (such as &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;), which drop as an &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"pistons\"&gt;pistons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hoppers\"&gt;hoppers&lt;/a&gt;, which simply don't function. &lt;a href=\"Explosions\"&gt;Explosions&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; and other sources also work normally, destroying terrain outside of the border. &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es and other sources also remain unaffected.\n&lt;a href=\"Liquid\"&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;s can flow through the border and continue flowing until reaching their flow limit. Liquids cannot be placed on the outside of the border. Liquids placed via a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; flow as normal. Mixing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; with a dispenser results in the flow of each liquid abruptly ending, presumably because the &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; that would normally generate does not.\nWhen set to invalid values.\nThe world border size can be changed by manually editing the &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; file. In any case, there remains a &lt;a href=\"world%20boundary\"&gt;world boundary&lt;/a&gt; at 30 million blocks on both the X and Z axes. "}
{"id": "55720", "revid": "55898120", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55720", "title": "World boundary", "text": "The world boundary is the area defining the intended spatial edges of a \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" dimension. It is distinct from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20hard%20limits\"&gt;hard limits&lt;/a&gt;, which are defined by limitations of the programming language itself.\nDefinition.\nJava Edition.\nHorizontal limits.\nThere are several different intended horizontal boundaries in the game.\nFirstly is the maximum distance &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s can generate at in &lt;a href=\"the%20Overworld\"&gt;the Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, at X/Z \u00b129,999,872 blocks (128 blocks, from the 16 blocks per chunk multiplied by the 8 block multiplier). This limit prevents any surpassing of the next borders using &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; to multiply distance by 8.\nThe next layer is the &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt;, which lies at X/Z \u00b129,999,984 by default, and establishes an arbitrary (but capped at this default value) blockade to prevent the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; from advancing. There are &lt;a href=\"World%20border%23On%20entities\"&gt;several methods&lt;/a&gt; of bypassing this border.\nThe third layer lies exactly one &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; further, at X/Z: \u00b130,000,000. At this point, there is an invisible \"wall\" preventing the player from advancing by setting any players' positions beyond it to it, even in spectator mode. Using &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; like does not work, since the game does not accept any value beyond X/Z: \u00b129,999,999. This value is hard-coded into the game's source code. Other block interactions, such as TNT exploding or water flowing, affects blocks outside this limit. By using a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; (in a &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; preset with the top layer as &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s), the player can go even further, up to X/Z: \u00b130,000,256. At that point, the player is frozen in place until the minecart is destroyed, then they are teleported back to X/Z: \u00b130,000,000.\nAs the server thinks the player is still at X/Z: \u00b130,000,000, no more chunks generate past X/Z: \u00b130,000,256. This is considered to be the absolute edge of the Minecraft world.\nBy editing the source code for the game, it is possible to extend the terrain generation and world border past X/Z: \u00b130,000,256 (up to X/Z: \u00b12,147,483,647) and experience the game quite normally (no ghost chunks; mobs can spawn alright; commands accept higher values). The game performs normally even at distances of X/Z: \u00b12,000,000,000, as in modern versions most distance effects have been patched out of the game. It is advisable to take note of what distance effects do exist, as well as the hard limits present - notably the \u00b133,554,432 lighting stop and hard limit of \u00b12,147,483,647.\nVertical limits.\nThe player is able to build up to y=320, and down to y=-64. However, one can still fly with creative mode or elytra, or use explosives/slime blocks and pistons to get past y=320.\nBedrock Edition.\nHorizontal limits.\nBedrock Edition technically has no hard boundary, and the world at far distances is far too ravaged by &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20distance%20effects\"&gt;several distance effects&lt;/a&gt; to provide any semblance of reasonable gameplay. Nonetheless, there do exist intentional defined limits for some game functionality:\nVertical limits.\nThe player is able to go to Y \u00b130,000,000 but it is impossible to teleport beyond these coordinates without the use of external tools.\nEffects.\nJava Edition.\nGenerally, long server response times caused by massive distances produce unintended results, but most &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; behave normally, with a few exceptions:\nBeyond this, most of the unintended behavior of blocks and entities is caused by either the &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"World%20border%23Effects\"&gt;as detailed here&lt;/a&gt;) or being sufficiently far from the world origin (see &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20distance%20effects\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;). Some odd effects that are attributed to the boundary itself are as follows:\nHistory.\nOlder version effects.\nInfdev.\nOn February 27, 2010, version of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100227-1\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt;, many side effects would occur as the player walked thousands or even millions of blocks away. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Infdev%2020100327\"&gt;Infdev 20100327&lt;/a&gt;, walking off the edge would cause the player to become stuck in a glitched position, unable to escape.\nIn previous versions of the game, if the player teleported as high as they possibly could, they were sent to a Y-Axis of 3.4x1038. In this zone, the player floats without a purpose, and dropped items that slide with what appears to be no friction before suddenly stop after about 20 blocks. It has been reported that the X and Z-Axis sometimes flicker randomly in this zone. The memory pie chart also sometimes randomly jumps to 100% undefined memory usage, and then disappears upon re-entering the debug menu.\nFull release (1.0 - 1.6-1.8?).\nThere is a limit at \u00b12,147,483,647 where the rain stops and there is an invisible roof meaning you can't go further. Items don't drop nearby the 32-bit integer limit. Rain stops nearby the 32-bit integer limit. Strangely, the player still renders correctly. 1.4 shows error commands.generic.double.invalid with teleportation. Pressing F5 in 1.3-1.6 crashes the game.\nFake chunks.\nAs the player journeys even deeper into the Far Lands, the effects worsen to the point where the game is unplayable. At X/Z \u00b132,000,000, blocks are treated as permanently nonexistent, and do not generate even though they may appear to. When Minecraft generates and loads chunks, it loads an empty version of the terrain, complete with grass, stone and water textures that cannot be walked on. This map generates out to the 32-bit integer limit. The game can load chunks only out to X/Z: \u00b132,000,000, causing a problem between the noise map and the chunk generator. To fix this problem, \"Minecraft\" removes the chunks generated beyond X/Z: &gt;\u00b132,000,000 and generates only the noise map. If the player tries to walk on this map, they fall into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. This value is hard-coded in the source code of \"Minecraft\", meaning that it cannot be changed without editing the source files. Because chunks technically do not generate beyond X/Z: \u00b132,000,000, things like trees, falling gravel, falling sand, mobs, grass, and other entities do not generate either. This can make the map relatively stable and crashes can be somewhat rare; however, crashes can happen on low-end computers. In rare cases, if the player performs the \"ghost spawn glitch\" that worked in versions between Beta 1.6 Test Build 3 and Beta 1.7.3, the player can cause trees and plants to generate beyond \u00b132,000,000. However the framerate was actually much better the further one went because of no entities.\nConsole info.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 3 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Vita%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation Vita Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the Overworld is limited to 864\u00d7864 blocks. Additionally, in the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox One Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the player is able to further select the size of their worlds, from &lt;a href=\"World%20size\"&gt;Small&lt;/a&gt; (1024\u00d71024), &lt;a href=\"Medium\"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; (3072\u00d73072), and &lt;a href=\"Large\"&gt;Large&lt;/a&gt; (5120\u00d75120, except \"Nintendo Switch Edition\"). The edges of these worlds are surrounded by an invisible barrier with an endless sea of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; beyond it. Before being patched out over time, there were often several exploits that could be used to glitch past the border, such as using boats, or using hundreds of TNT Minecarts to blow the player above the world height ceiling."}
