Ramdisks are virtual file systems (unlike HDDs which are hardware) that live completely inside the computer's RAM. They offer significantly higher data transfer rates (between 3,000MB/s and 15,000MB/s) at the cost of volatility (data is lost after restarting the computer) and space (limited by the amount of RAM installed on the system, including swap space). Many utilities however make it possible to backup Ramdisk data at set intervals, and before the system is shut down, then load the last data when the system starts up.\nWhy it makes sense for Minecraft servers.\nIn a Minecraft server, one of the strongest bottlenecks are disk I/O related operations (e.g. chunk management). By moving the data into the RAM, access times are near instant and data transfer rates become significantly faster, making chunk loading and saving much faster operations. Since a Minecraft world currently consists of very many chunk files, seek time is equally, if not more, important for overall speed.\nBasic Minecraft and ramdisk setup.\nMake sure to back up your files before starting!\nGNU/Linux (easy way).\nA simple way to load a minecraft server into a ramdisk was posted on the Aimless Bits blog &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.aimlessbits.com/%3Fp%3D12\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on March 12, 2011. It involves modifying the server startup script available on the wiki and making some minor changes to fstab. This guide fleshes out the process and makes some minor changes to Aimless Bits' script.\nThis quick guide assumes you have a user for loading minecraft, a minecraft directory and a server running. It also helps to be familiar with the /etc/init.d/minecraft startup script.\nThen add this line, making sure that the path is correct (username, dir name etc.)\nThe size of the ramdisk MUST be larger than the minecraft directory world. Make sure that you give yourself some overhead.\nIt's now a matter of simply running a modified script that loads the files on the drive onto the server, copies them back on a timely basis to prevent data loss, and does backups. Again, this is a modified version of the script found at Aimless Bits.\nIf you have /etc/init.d/minecraft, delete it or overwrite it with this script. If you don't, make a new text file, call it minecraft, and copy this script into it.\nNote: This script misses the command option that the other minecraft init script has on this website, http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Server_startup_script. Therefore, the script is rewritten with the command code in it, so ramdisk servers can also use the command thing to sync things without having to get another plugin to schedule things: http://pastebin.com/4ynwL2js\nYou're almost done! This script behaves exactly like the standard startup script, only that it takes care of loading and maintaining the ramdisk. You can also modify the script to use rsync instead of cp\nIn case you want to do other things, such as remote copying, but performance differences are probably negligible unless you have very big worlds.\nThen add the line:\nThe number represents how often in minutes should you save the world. If you feel like you have a robust setup, power supply backups and the whole shebang, run this less frequently. Otherwise, stick to 5 minutes at the least! \nThe other line runs minecraft backup every 6 hours, at :20. Don't skimp on backups! You've been warned!\nHope this helps all those would be admins out there. Good luck!\nGNU/Linux (alternative).\nOn most GNU/Linux distributions there is already a ramdisk set up (usually mounted to /dev/shm (shared memory)) which defaults to using at most half of your total installed RAM. If there is not one already set up, resources on how to do it are widely available on the Internet.\nIt is possible to move anything into the ramdisk, but this tutorial focuss on just moving the map into it and leaving the server files on the conventional drive.\nGiven the following basic server directory \"minecraft_server/\", inside a user's home directory, containing the world \"world\" and all other required files\nWe want to move \"world/\" into the shared memory. Because of the volatility of ramdisks, we also want to create a new folder into which an automated script periodically saves the current snapshot of the world, called (for example) \"world_storage\" by copying the current world to a new name\nNow with the old world in a safe location, we can go ahead and move the world into the ram-disk\nBy now, the world is loaded into the RAM, but the Minecraft server doesn't see it in its directory anymore, causing it to recreate it when started. To stop it from doing that, we have to create a symbolic link to the world in the ramdisk by running\nThis creates a link to \"/dev/shm/minecraft/world/\" called \"world/\" in the server's directory, which the server uses like the actual world folder, but now inside the RAM.\nNow we need to take care of the volatility of the ramdisk, by periodically saving the world from the RAM into \"world_storage/\". I'm going to use cron for scheduling and rsync for synching here.\nFirst, we need a script that can be called by cron (it doesn't have to be a script, you could call rsync directly from the cron command line, but this allows for easy customizing later on)\nAnd then we need to make this script execute every few minutes (I'll use 5 minutes here, you can test out what works best for you)\nThis opens an editor (more precisely, the editor in your \"EDITOR\" environment variable) for editing your user cron table. Add the following line:\nNow if your server restarts, you must recreate the world folder (/dev/shm/minecraft) then (/dev/shm/minecraft/world) in the shared memory because the /dev/shm/ empties after restart. You can do this by making another similar shell script.\nSo make a shell script file like before:\nEvery time you restart you need to run this script to remount the Ramdisk. Do not add this to the crontab. You can add this to the start up if you figure it out.\nGNU/Linux (quick &amp; dirty).\nThis is a quick and dirty (but functionally identical) version of the GNU/Linux alternative listed above. Here, this technique is used with a Fedora-based server and it works great. \nStart from your working server directory and copy the existing world to a backup location:\nWe need the directory name \"world\" to make this work, so remove world/ from the working directory:\nNow, we want to redirect the server to a world directory in shared memory. Do this by creating a soft link from shared memory to your working directory:\nShared memory is volatile, so we need something to back up the world directory to disk periodically. A single line in crontab does the trick:\nNow we need a way to \"mount\" the world in shared memory. Create a start.sh file and include the following 2 lines:\nYou can use the start.sh script to mount your world in shared memory each time you reboot your server. Then you can start the Minecraft server as normal (or add a 3rd line to start.sh for convenience). If you choose to start the server with start.sh and use the screen command, be sure to start the start.sh script with screen. Using screen inside the script causes the server to run in the background, leaving you unable to run console commands.\nWindows.\nUse a Ramdisk utility like &lt;a href=\"http%3A//memory.dataram.com/products-and-services/software/ramdisk\"&gt;Dataram RAMDisk&lt;/a&gt; (freeware version available) to create a RAM disk and place the server files on it. \"Dataram RAMDisk\" has the option to automatically save an image every time it shuts down and also every few minutes. The free version restricts its maximum disk space to 1G. If larger Ramdisks are required, the \"Winramtech\" and the \"Softperfect\" Ramdisks seem to offer the best performance with similar features as Dataram RAMDisk.\nBefore you begin:\nSetting up your RAM disk (Simple usage)\nYour RAM disk now automatically saves upon shutdown, and is restored (with data intact) on startup. Boot and shutdown times get lengthened depending on the size you set.\nAlso, you may wish to adjust the AutoSave interval.\nIf you did not select \"Save Disk Image on Shutdown\", make sure continue reading especially!!\nYou need to follow these procedures every time you shutdown the computer to avoid data loss!\nWhen you wish to start the server next time, just start it like you did the first time. Do this only if you ticked 'Load Disk Image at Startup'.\nTo start it again, start your RAMDisk like you did the first time and copy all the server files into the RAMDisk, then start your server.\nmacOS.\nType this to create your RAM disk on macOS:\nIt's only one command line to write, quite fast and efficient.\nIf you've followed these instructions, your Ramdisk appears in /Volumes/ramdisk. After that, proceed as if you were on Linux, using Terminal and your favorite text editor."}

{"id": "98999", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=98999", "title": "Tutorials/Randomizers", "text": "Randomizers are &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt;s that generate random signals. They can be used in a multitude of things, from running a light show, to making a casino. Note that randomizers, like the majority of redstone circuits, will only work in active &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s. If this is wanted for a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Creating%20a%20challenge%20map\"&gt;adventure map&lt;/a&gt; or something where the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; may get far away, it may be desirable to build the randomizer in &lt;a href=\"spawn%20chunk\"&gt;spawn chunk&lt;/a&gt;s or a &lt;a href=\"ticking%20area\"&gt;ticking area&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical randomizers.\nDropper randomizer.\nThis randomizer utilizes the fact that &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s dispense &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s in random order. It will output a random signal strength of 1 or 3 whenever a signal is provided. To create it, place a dropper, &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; as shown. Then put items of varying stack size into the dropper, e.g. a sword and a piece of dirt. When you power the dropper, it will put an item into the hopper, turning on the comparator. Since the items take up different amounts of space, the power level will vary. It may seem as if adding items that stack to sixteen will allow an output of two, but unfortunately unless the hopper is weighted with items beforehand, items that stack to 16 only result a level of one.\nShulker box randomizer.\nShulker boxes have the ability to be placed by dispensers, broken by pistons, and retain their items. When a shulker box is randomly placed by the dispenser, a comparator can produce 15 unique redstone signals.\nMob randomizer.\nA mob randomizer is the general term for randomizers which use mobs to trigger &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; with their random wandering. This type of randomizer is best when several outputs are wanted and it doesn't matter when the signal occurs or for how long. Mob randomizers are usually created with either &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt;s. Using tripwire is probably the easiest method, but it requires more iron.\nThe type of mob used in the randomizer can create some important variations. Some common choices include:\nJukebox randomizer.\nThis randomizer uses &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s to generate a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; signal with a random strength from 1 to 12. This is unique because most other randomizers do not generate analog signals with so many possibilities. The two downsides to this randomizer are that it can only generate signals as fast as it takes for each &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt; to finish playing and that it can be somewhat expensive.\nRandomizers with analog signal output.\nAnalog 2-RNG.\nOutputs either power level 1 or 3 while on, power level 0 while off.\nWhen the input turns on, the dropper will randomly choose to push either the stackable item or the non-stackable item into the hopper, causing the comparator to output either power level 1 or 3. Because the powered dropper is a solid/opaque block, it will also deactivate the hopper, preventing it from pushing the item back to the dropper until the input turns off.\n\"Variations:\" If the dropper is powered indirectly (for example, by quasiconnecitvity or an adjacent powered block), the hopper won't be deactivated and will immediately push the item back into the dropper. This turns the circuit into a monostable rising edge detector with a 3.5-tick output pulse (still with a random power level of 1 or 3).\nWith only two items in the dropper, both output power levels will be chosen with equal probability. The probability of the output levels can be changed by adding additional stackable and non-stackable items to the dropper (which must all be different from each other so they won't stack). For example, with two different stackable items and three different non-stackable items, the RNG will output power level 1 40% of the time and power level 3 60% of the time.\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" March 14, 2013\nRandomizers with digital signal output.\nDigital randomizers work by randomly generating a binary number and selecting a corresponding output using a binary decoder. To achieve a flat probability the bits are randomly generated, typically using an analog randomizer with a 50% chance of activation and a red-coder.\nCommand randomizers.\nTick-based.\nThis randomizer uses a repeating command block adding 1 point to a score per tick, then another repeating command block truncating the value to its maximum. When a random value is needed, repeating command blocks testing for certain values are used. This setup is not completely random as it is based on the time is activated, but is random enough for most purposes.\nIn this example, the minimum value is 10 and the maximum is 20.\nTo start, a dummy scoreboard objective must be created to store the values: . Next, two repeating command blocks are needed, both set to \"always active\". The first one adds 1 point to the score every tick: . The second one truncates the value to the aforementioned minimum and maximum: (where \"21\" is the maximum exclusive value and \"10\" is the minimum value). Finally, a set of command blocks testing each value are needed, all attached to the single input; for example, will run (placing in chat) if the random value between 10 and 20 is 12. The following schematic shows an example setup where the command blocks testing each value are attached to an input:\nRandom target selector based.\nThe randomizer is based on the &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Selecting%20targets%20with%20a%20limit\"&gt;random target selector criteria&lt;/a&gt; (codice_1). It is a derivative of the idea by NOPEname.\nAt startup, run the following commands. You may wrap them in a &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28Java%20Edition%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; for convenience.\n scoreboard objectives add RandomBit dummy\n tag @e[type=armor_stand,x=0,y=-1,z=1] add RandomizerResult\n scoreboard players set @e[tag=RandomizerResult] RandomBit 0\n tag @e[type=armor_stand,x=0,y=-1,z=0] add Randomizer\n tag @e[type=armor_stand,x=1,y=-1,z=0] add Randomizer\nThe codice_2 part is not necessary, but it is helpful if you do wrap them in a function and want to invoke the function multiple times (e.g. for testing).\nEvery time you need to obtain a random bit (0 or 1), you can run the following commands, either manually, via a chain of &lt;a href=\"command%20blocks\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt;, or a function.\n tag @e[type=armor_stand,tag=Randomizer] remove PickedBit\n tag @e[type=armor_stand,tag=Randomizer,sort=random,limit=1] add PickedBit\n execute store result score @e[type=armor_stand, tag=RandomizerResult] RandomBit run data get entity @e[type=armor_stand, tag=PickedBit,limit=1] Pos[0]\nNow you have a scoreboard objective with a randomized bit. This method can easily be extended to generate a random number in a large range.\nScoreboard.\nThere is &lt;a href=\"Scoreboard%23Players%20commands\"&gt;native support&lt;/a&gt; of randomized scoreboard objectives in Bedrock in the form of ."}

During operation, processing units execute instructions stored in the computer's memory. For a good start on Minecraft computers you should learn computer science. There are many sources and tutorials to learn computer science but for a basic start, it is recommended to watch &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo\"&gt;Crash Course on Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; especially episodes 1\u20138.

It does not require any extensive knowledge of Computer Science but will delve quite deep into it.\nImplementations.\nComputers can be used in many ways, from creating a smart house to using it to run an adventure map. However, due to the limitations of computers in Minecraft, stated below, they remain an abstract concept and serve as good tools to understand lower-level concepts of CPU architecture and embedded systems.\nThe thing that sets apart computers and calculators are that calculators cannot perform multiple instructions in a row without user input. A computer can compare and assess instructions in a flow to perform tasks. \nHowever, in Minecraft, they are extremely slow and with their large size, redstone computers are difficult to find practical applications for. Even the fastest redstone computers take seconds to complete one calculation and take up a few thousand blocks of space. Command blocks are far superior to computers in Minecraft because of their speed and legible, higher-level commands.\nMods can change the computer's speed such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2421222-tickratechanger-change-the-speed-that-your-game\"&gt;TickrateChanger&lt;/a&gt; will change the tick rate of the game.\nChapter 1: Tutorial on Building a Computer.\nIntroduction &amp; Prerequisites.\nRedstone logic closely reflects simple binary logic, as redstone can be either on or off, and can, therefore, be interpreted as 1s or 0s. We will be referencing in this tutorial, basic binary logic and various simple computer science terms. There is an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/binary.htm\"&gt;excellent article which explains binary and conversion to binary&lt;/a&gt;. Please read the \"Architecture of building the Computer section\" as we will be following that to plan our computer, it is located in this article, thank you. \nThis chapter will focus on the application of the knowledge and manipulation of redstone to create a simple 8-bit computer, and will describe how to make one and how it works.\nAll subjects will be split into (THEORY) and (PRACTICE), THEORY will go in-depth of exactly what will go on. PRACTICE will cover how to build it in Minecraft, what it will look like and possibly world downloads.\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Redstone%20computers%23The%20MASIC%20Computer\"&gt;The computer we will be building (MASIC Computer)&lt;/a&gt;\n (NOT FINISHED)\n (NOT FINISHED)\n (NOT FINISHED)\nThere are three primary design objectives for a computer in Minecraft, to make your computer most suitable for your task at hand. There are trade offs to consider, such as the larger the computer, the slower it will get because the number of redstone repeaters will increase by distance. The more memory, the less speed and larger size.\nHow small is the computer? In Minecraft, designing a survival computer will most likely emphasize on this point. The number of repeats required will increase as size increases.\nHow much memory can it hold? How many bits and numbers can it count up to? This is important for large-scale computers, say ones which can do more complex algorithms and require larger instruction sets (e.g. doing square roots or trigonometry). The larger the memory size or bit architecture, the more complex the computer will get.\nHow fast can it do operations? Is it optimized to run its tasks? Custom designing and building a computer will significantly increase its speed as more redundant wiring and code could be switched to purpose-built hardware and software. This is apparent in some real-world supercomputers which are programmed to run one task very, very efficiently. The speed of computers in Minecraft is very slow, therefore a mod could be installed for the client to significantly increase the speed of the game, and therefore the computer.\nThe MASIC Computer.\nThe work in progress computer which we will be making in the tutorial.\n8 bits, 16 bytes of RAM. I/O is a seven-segment display (for hex and decimal) and a control panel which we will make.\nThe MASIC computer aims to be a one-size-fits-all computer and does not specialize in one task, so it is fully programmable by reading its own memory (explained in Section 2: instruction sets). The simple I/O is great for multipurpose use and the memory is sufficiently sized. It runs at quite a fast speed (because of its small size).\nStep 1: Memory and Address Decoders (THEORY).\nDecoders convert binary figures into decimals. For example, looking at the 8-bit decoder, 00 turns on the first lamp which stands for 0. 01 turns on the second lamp which is 1. 10 turns on the third which is 2. 11 turns on the last one which is 3.\nStep 1: Memory and Address Decoders (PRACTICE).\nAddress Decoder.\nThis is the design for the address decoder we are going to build.\nAbove is a simple 2-bit state, so it has two inputs (left and right) through the repeaters. The output is the redstone line above which will turn OFF when the state is met. The state is whether the redstone input will turn OFF the redstone line above; if so, the state is the redstone inputs. In the above case, the left must be turned OFF (0) and the right (blue) must be turned ON (1) to yield an OFF on the top redstone line. So it expects a state of OFF ON (aka 01 for binary).\nThey are colored blue for bits which should be ON (1) for it to stop powering the top redstone line. Once every bit stops powering the redstone line, it then turns off.\nThese are basically either one or two NOT gates feeding into a OR gate and then NOT the output.\nAbove is an 8-bit state, it expects 8 inputs in exactly the order 0000 1101. So that state it expects is 0000 1101. So the redstone torches power the inputs, and so we see the redstone line on the top turns OFF (only when exactly three redstone torches are placed in that exact order of 0000 1101).\nNow if we put multiple of these together, we can count up in binary with the blue bits to get all 255 states of 8 bits. The one below is 8 bits, and has four state expectations. See the right images to see it in action. Now each green output can be a memory cell, and if we continue counting in binary, it will reach 255.\nThe input is 0000 0011 (see the redstone torches for input) and where the blue bits match the current state, the green output is ON.\nSo now we keep counting up in binary to get up to 0000 1111 and stop there; we should now have 24 (16) state expectors. Now we're done with the address decoder. We do not continue counting up to 1111 1111 because of instruction set limitations, explained in section 3: instruction sets\nStep 2: Building an Arithmetic Logic Unit (THEORY).\nThe Arithmetic Logic Unit referred to as the ALU will compare and perform mathematical operations with binary numbers and communicate the results with the Control Unit, the central component of the computer (and Central Processing Unit but that is going to be as big as the computer itself). Many tutorials will want the reader to build an ALU first, and therefore the topic is covered very widely around the internet. \nThe ALU we will be building can perform four important operations on two inputs and return a correct output. A, B, being both 8-bit inputs\nThere can also be multiple ALUs inside a computer, as some programs require a lot of operations to run, which do not depend on the previous operations (so they can be threaded) \nso delegating them to different ALUs could significantly speed up the program.\nAdding two numbers.\nIn an adding unit, for each bit (for our computer, we require four, hence 4-bit), there is a full adder. The full adder will take three inputs, each input can be either 1 or 0. The first two will be the user's input and the third will be the \"carry\" input. The \"carry\" input is the output of the previous full adder, this will be explained later. The adder will output two statements: first, the output and then the \"carry\" output, which is sent as input into the next full adder, a place value up.\nFor example, I wish to add the number 0101 to 1011. The first full adder will consider the first place value, 1 and 1 as their two inputs (we are reading right to left). There is no \"carry\" input as there is no previous full adder. The full adder will add 1 and 1; which is 0, and carries a 1 to the next place value. The next full adder would add 0 and 1 and the carry input would be 1 which the previous full adder stated. The output of 0 and 1 would be 1 but there is a carry input of 1 and therefore will add 0 and 1 and 1, which is 0 and carries a 1 to the next place value. Reviewing addition in binary should resolve any confusion. \nAll ALUs, to perform adding operations, require the presence of multiple adders. Every two bits will feed into an adder which, when joined with other adders, will produce an output which is the sum of the two bytes added together. An adder has an input, an output, and two carry input/output as would a person carry when doing the addition of 9 + 1 or 01 + 01. The adders are made of logic gates which is possible by the nomenclature of binary.\n&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Arithmetic%20logic\"&gt;Tutorials/Arithmetic logic&lt;/a&gt; gives a very detailed look into full adders and half adders, for now, there is a schematic of how to construct one. It gives four inputs/outputs and should be connected with other adders to create a unit. For this example, we will connect four adders together in our four-bit computer so that we can take in all four bits to make an output. There will be an input carry missing from the first adder, this is because there is nothing to carry from the bit before it, it is the first bit. The input carry will remain at zero. There will also be an output carry missing from the fourth adder, and the output of this will be ignored as we can only support four bits. The additional fourth carry output is wired to the overflow flag to signify the operation couldn't be done. This is called a binary overflow.\nSo basically, go into Minecraft and build a full binary adder (picture show) and connect them up. There should be eight inputs and outputs. Try placing levers and redstone lamps at the respective ends to test your creation. So 0010 + 0011 should yield 0101 (2 + 3 = 5, we are reading right not left).\nFractional numbers.\nA computer takes care of numbers less than one by form of float-point arithmetic, it is only so useful in larger-bit computers (16-64 bits) and computers which do need to use numbers less than one. or are two ways to achieve this. Another simpler but less efficient way would be to assign all numbers a power of two so that they are 'bumped up' by the power of two chosen. The player must do this to every number and assume the one as one times the power of the two you have chosen. For example, 5 = 1012 so 5 \u00d7 = 1010002; five is bumped up by three. So now, one in your new system would be 1 \u00d7 = 10002 and that would leave room for 0.1, 0.01 or 0.001; 0.01 * = 102. This leads to a more complicated setup for your computer.\nSubtracting two numbers.\nThe subtraction of numbers is surprisingly simple. The ALU first must change the second number (the value subtracting by) and convert it from a positive number to a negative number. A two's complement is when you invert the binary number (so that all the 0s are 1s and 1s are 0s) and add one to it.\nExample: do 10 subtract 9\nThis poses the complexity of signed numbers. This is a weight to the binary number to assign it as a positive or negative number. Whether the result is a negative or positive number is determined by the overflow flag. If there is an overflow, this means that the number is positive and otherwise, negative.\nTo implement this, you can ask the ALU to do 3 operations. To do A subtract B, the operations are\nOperation: A SUB B\nMultiplying two numbers.\nMultiplication is repeated addition, so the easiest (inefficiently) is to add A to a variable B amount of times.\nHere's pseudomachine code for it\nOperation: A * B\nHowever, there are more efficient ways of multiplication. A good method is to repeatedly bitshift the first number to the location of each 1 in the second number and sum it.\nThere are underscores to mark indents, since padding with 0s are less intuitive. subscript 2 means in binary, and decimal numbers are also in bold\nso this is more efficient for larger numbers.\nOperation: A * B\nDon't forget that\n\u00ab A (bitshift to the left) is effectively, A * 2\nand\n\u00bb A (bitshift to the right) is effectively, A / 2\nIf the numbers are predictable or the CPU must do a lot of similar numbers in bulk, consider using a look-up table to quickly get results to frequently called multiplication. Is this a way of hard-coding your answers and is used in extreme cases.\nStep 3: Instruction set and machine architecture (THEORY).\nThis is pretty fun, this part.\nElaborating on Chapter 2: Instruction Set, we will be creating one for ours.\nFor the MASIC Computer, the computer which we are building, has an 8-bit system, so that means each instruction on each slot of the stack memory will be 8 bits. The stack memory is the memory where any information can be stored and is on the RAM. There will be a counter, called the program counter, which increments by 1 every cycle. A cycle is the CPU fetching the instruction, decoding the instruction (finding out what to do with the instruction) and executing the instruction (doing what it tells it to do). Then it moves on to the next one by incrementing the program counter and reading the information at that location in the stack memory.\nSo each byte in the stack memory has 8 bits for us to work with.\n0000 0000\nand some instructions require an address, say loading memory into a register so that we can perform operations (such as addition) on it. Each instruction will be split into two parts, each 4 bits. The first is the TYPE. the TYPE will specify what the computer must do and the ADDRESS will be where the value we will perform our operations are located.\nOPCODE OPERAND\nso 4 bits for the TYPE, we can have 2^4 types, so 16 different ones. Our computer will have two registers, so one bit will be for specifying the register the operation will executing on and is denoted by an x.\nInstructions are put in the same place as memory and as the ADDRESS part of the instruction is only four bits, we can only reference memory from 1-16 lines, requiring some clever programming to fit larger programs. Memory is also limited to 16 bytes per program. Values and instructions are essentially the same thing, so if you write an instruction to store it onto a line that previously-stored an instruction, that effectively overwrites the instruction with a value. Accidental execution of values might be a problem, so a STOP command must be used to prevent any errors. This is a whole lot to understand, so good sources are https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/high-low-level-languages and https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/881462/ &lt;-- really helpful actually. and also don't forget to take both CS and ICT for your IGCSEs.\nPrerequisites.\nThe section will cover simple topics and components commonly found in a computer, so information from chapter 2 will be used, such as the ALU, RAM, registers and binary manipulation.\nThe MASIC Instruction Set.\nSince the computer\nHere is the first draft of the instruction set, with only essentials. This is based on other assembly languages, but changed to adapt to our architecture. There are two registers, so we need instructions to perform operations on both registers.\nTo translate:\n1000 0011 means LOAD R2 3 because LOADR2 is 1000 and 0011 is 3.\nThese can be in a process so that functions can be performed.\nWriting programs.\nThis one does the Fibonacci sequence: (0,1,1,2,3,5,8... etc.)\nThe previous is an example of a low-level assembly language. If it was written in a high level language such as C++, it would look more like this:\n #include &lt;iostream&gt;\n using namespace std;\n int main()\n int n, t1 = 0, t2 = 1, nextTerm = 0;\n cout \u00ab \"Enter the number of terms: \";\n cin \u00bb n;\n cout \u00ab \"Fibonacci Series: \";\n for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i)\n // Prints the first two terms.\n if(i == 1)\n cout \u00ab \" \" \u00ab t1;\n continue;\n if(i == 2)\n cout \u00ab t2 \u00ab \" \";\n continue;\n nextTerm = t1 + t2;\n t1 = t2;\n t2 = nextTerm;\n cout \u00ab nextTerm \u00ab \" \";\n return 0;\nInstruction Cycle.\nThe instruction set is the lower assembly language, so we want to integrate that more with the hardware side. This revolves around the fetch-decode-execute cycle (explained above).\nIn the CPU, there will be 4 important registers, \nthe Program Counter (PC), \nkeeps track of which program the computer is currently on\nthe Memory Address Register (MAR), \nkeeps track of where the next memory location will be\nthe Memory Data Register (MDR), \nkeeps track of what the memory AT the location is\nthe Current Instruction Register (CIR), \nkeeps track of what instruction is currently being worked on\nand the ALU Accumulator (ACC), \nkeeps track of the input and output from the ALU\nThere are also four components to keep in mind, the Address Decoder, the memory, the Instruction Decoder and the ALU.\nFETCH\nThe program will get the next instruction.\nDECODE\nThe program will identify what the instruction is\nEXECUTE\nThe program will execute the instruction\nThe opcode is 'LOADR1' and the operand is '1'.\nNow four things could happen depending on what the instruction is.\nIf the instruction is an ADD instruction, the ACC will be told to receive the information from the information flow and the ALU will perform operations on it, outputting it to the ACC again.\nIf the instruction is a LOAD instruction, the CU will load the instruction to the register.\nIf the instruction is a STORE instruction, the CU will instead SET the data at the location specified by the MAR in the memory.\nIf the instruction is an OUT instruction, the CU will send the instruction to the output peripheral.\nREPEAT\nThe instruction cycle repeats itself until it reaches a STOP instruction or runs out of memory\nChapter 2: Planning a Redstone Computer.\nA redstone computer can be planned very much like a real computer, following principles used in computer design and hardware architecture. There are several key design decisions that will affect the organization; the size and performance of your prospective computer should be made concretely prior to the construction of specific components. \nBuilding a redstone computer will require an understanding of these five concepts and consider the most suitable approach, which would be most practical for your computer.\nand we will be applying this knowledge and plan the architecture of our CPU in the last section. This CPU will then be built in the next chapter.\nFundamentals of a Computer.\nA computer is a machine which has the ability to\nA very notable example of this is the most basic concept of computing, a , where the machine will read from one infinite line of code and instruction set in order to complete a function.\nDesigning and building a Turing machine in Minecraft is possible. This however, is not covered as we will be designing something more basic.\nMachine-Architecture.\nThere are five fundamental components in a basic modern computer. These are essential in order to produce a functioning computer and manipulate data by performing computations. \nArithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) (optional, but is normally present)\nControl Unit (CU)\nData Memory\nInstruction Memory\nInput/Output devices (I/O)\nComputer Data Storage.\nThere are many methods of storing data, in Minecraft or in real life. The states of memory usually are binary, either on or off and can be computed with boolean logic.\nOn a computer, there are three types of storage. Keeping in mind that increasing the device's capacity would increase its size, each type would have speed and capacity appropriate to it.\nPrimary Storage.\nThese are the storage which directly accessible to the CPU, referred to as memory and is fastest to access but usually is smaller in capacity for it to be addressed quicker.\nRegisters &amp; Flags.\nFastest is the memory stored within the CPU. These are registers and flags as they can be set almost instantaneously and do not require any address sent to it as there is only one byte stored in each register.\nRedstone bits that can be toggled are extremely large but can be toggled within 2 ticks. This requires a very large amount of space but is perfect for caches and registers. The redstone is also required for logic gates (not shown) to set the bit, as in the images, sending an input would cause the bit to flip. The gate would take up more space. Registers could also utilize locking redstone repeaters and timing them correctly. This is explained below, in RAM). With the use of a computer clock, it may not be necessary to build registers. Registers are useful when the data goes through the line before either the CU or ALU is ready to process it. It would save it to the register and wait until the CU or ALU can perform its function.\nCaches.\nSecond to those are caches, which feed information into the processor. In real life, they are separated into levels, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/45870/l2-cache\"&gt;each one with separate speed and capacities&lt;/a&gt;. It is useful for the same reason as the registers.\nRandom Access Memory (RAM).\nThirdly is Random Access Memory (RAM), this is much slower than the caches and registers as they have address systems. They are connected to three busses, data bus, control bus and the address bus. The data is sent through the data bus, either setting the RAM or getting values from the RAM. The control bus tells it whether it is being \"get\" or \"set\". The address bus tells the RAM where the byte is. Refer to the Architecture of the Computer to understand this more in-depth. RAM is very useful and could fully replace tertiary memory (explained below) because of its non-volatility in Minecraft. Volatile means that when power is lost, it will lose information. The RAM will not lose information unlike in real life, and therefore in an excellent method of storing information.\nThe RAM in the first case is utilizing the locking redstone repeaters with the correct timing. This requires a bit of a plan but is very space-efficient. The conversion of a bus to the lines in order to lock the redstone repeaters also requires setting timings. This is time-consuming, much more than the registers, however, it is very compact and efficient. The address bus (green) would turn in binary to \"unlock\" a certain byte, either to be read or set by the control bus (second line, on the left).\nMost often, making it volatile has no use in Minecraft, so the easiest way to make some is to use d-flip-flops and to add a reading and writing function. The bottom image shows instead of locking repeaters, it uses d-flip-flops which is much more space inefficient but simpler to build. D-flip-flops work more or less like locked repeaters, one input - if on, unlocks in until the input is off and the other will set it once unlocked. The output can be read as a bit and with a NAND gate, be ignored or put onto the bus. This is gone over in detail in the second chapter, \"Tutorial on building a Computer\". Excuse the texture pack.\nRandom Access Memory also known as RAM is a kind of memory used by programs and is volatile. Volatile means that when the power is lost, it will lose information. Most often, making it volatile has no use in Minecraft, so the easiest way to make some is to use d-flip-flops and to add a reading and writing function.\nSecondary Storage.\nThese are equivalent of HDDs and SSDs. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1zE_XZLTDBw\"&gt;There is a very compact storage technique&lt;/a&gt;, involving redstone comparators with the ability to store up to 1KB, being practically sized.\nTertiary Storage.\nThird and last, is a tertiary memory, which requires a lot of time to read/write but can hold massive amounts of information at the expense of speed. Real-world tertiary storage use a mechanism of mounting the memory which takes about a minute for each drive. This is used for archival purposes and for memory which is rarely used. In Minecraft, a system where shulker boxes are used and block in the shulker boxes must be sorted out by a sorting system to represent a form of data. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D34Fipr6vkeg\"&gt;This can also be used to create removable storage&lt;/a&gt;. The read/write speed is fairly slow due to the massive amount of comparators and a lot of time is required. The aforementioned mods could speed up tick rate and eliminate this problem, however. This is used for storing long-term data that needed to be loaded at the beginning of a program or rarely due to its poor read/write speed and large capacity. This is the equivalent of a real computer's hard disk or solid-state drive.\nExecution Model.\nThe technique of storing blocks of instructions called programs within memory is what allows computers to perform such a variety of tasks.\nThe apparatus employed by a computer for storing and retrieving these programs is the computer's Execution Model.\nTwo of the world's most successful execution models, Harvard and von Neumann, run on nearly 100% of the computers available today.\nHarvard.\nThe physically separates the apparatus for retrieving the instructions which make up an active program from that of the data access apparatus which the program accesses during execution. \nPrograms written for computers employing a Harvard architecture may perform up-to 100% faster for tasks that access the main memory bus. Note however that certain memory circuitry is necessarily larger for those who select a Harvard architecture. Harvard architecture is very important.\nvon Neumann.\nThe uses a two-step process to execute instructions. First, the memory containing the next instruction is loaded, then the new instruction just loaded is allowed to access this same memory as it executes; using a single memory for both program and data facilitates Meta-Programming technology like compilers and Self-modifying Code.\nThe von Neumann architecture was the first proposed model of computation and almost all real-world computers are von Neumann in nature.\nWord sizes.\nWord-size is a primary factor in a computer's physical size.\nIn Minecraft, machines from 1-bit all the way up to 32-bits have been successfully constructed.\nCommon word-size combinations:\nData-Word.\nThe amount of information a computer can manipulate at any particular time is representative of the computer's data word-size.\nIn digital binary, the computer's data-word size (measured in bits) is equal to the width or number of channels in the computer's main bus.\nData-Words commonly represent integers or whole numbers encoded as patterns of binary digits.\nThe maximum sized number representable by a Binary encoded integer is given by \n2data-word width in bits - 1.\nFor example, a computer with a data-word size of 8-bit will have eight channels on its bus (set of wires, connecting components) and therefore, we can count up to (28 - 1). 255. Counting further than 255 is not possible with eight bits, as the operation 255 + 1 carries over a one, which requires a ninth bit or what is called a \"binary overflow\" will occur, returning 0 as the answer, which is incorrect.\nThis is simply visualized;\nSome common Integer data sizes are:\nData-Word size also governs the maximum size of numbers which can be processed by a computer's ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit).\nInstruction-Word.\nThe amount of data a computer needs in order to complete one single instruction is representative of a computer's instruction word-size.\nThe instruction-word size of a computer is generally a multiple of its Data-Word size, This helps minimize memory misalignment while retrieving instructions during program execution.\nInstruction Set.\nThis is a collection of instructions the control unit (CU) can decode, and then execute.\nInstructions are essentially functions run by the computer, examples of instructions include:\nInstructions can be programmed into the RAM, loaded from ROM or directly activated by using a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;. Each instruction would have its own specific binary string assigned to it (e.g. 0000=Load data from register 0001=add A and B 1011=Save RAM into tertiary memory etc.) and would probably require its own binary to decimal or binary to BCD to decimal encoders and buses to the ALU/registers.\nArchitecture of the Computer.\nInside the computer, there is a Central Processing Unit (not to be confused with the Control Unit (CU), a component inside the CPU), which in real life, is a very small and powerful component that acts as more or less, the brain of the computer.\nIn Minecraft, it is difficult to compact it to the scale we see in real life so don't worry if it looks \"wrong\".\nWe will first be designing our 4-bit Central Processing Unit in the next chapter, as it is the most important thing in our computer with the Execution Model (the method of communication and organization of the CPU) in mind, (talked about in this page, before, in the Execution Model section) we can map out the construction of the computer.\nThe CPU follows a cycle four steps, fetch, decode, execute and (sometimes) stores to perform instructions. The CPU first fetches the instruction from RAM, decodes what it means (the instruction will most likely be a number, and the CPU must find out what number it is), and once it understands what the instruction is, it will perform that action. This sometimes requires the data to be put back into the storage, therefore it will store the data. The cycle is then repeated.\nBusses.\nThere are five busses in the CPU, each to carry information from one component to the next. Busses are channels of redstone connecting each component. Since we are building a 4-bit computer, we only need four channels in our bus. These are the red and blue lines connecting the components inside the CPU. Notice that the blue buses have less than four lines, this is because they do not carry data. Since busses can only carry data one way (in Minecraft, due to repeaters only working one way), there are two buses connecting the CPU to the outer computer.\nThe first bus is the data bus, this is to transfer information from the storage or I/O devices to the CU. Instructions are also sent through this line The CU can also use this bus to transfer data to the ALU. The ALU cannot transfer data onto this bus because buses only work one way and once the information is taken by the ALU, the bus cuts off beyond the ALU. Information from the ALU is passed through bus 2.\nThe second bus is the data bus, but returns the data from the ALU to the CU. The CU cannot send data through this bus to the ALU because the bus goes from left to right and works in one direction only. The CU can send information back to the storage units though, and is used to set values of storage devices.\nThe third bus is the address bus, which the CU can send the address of storage. This is where the information resides. For example, the CU asks for the address of the byte living in 0001. It sends the address (0001) through the address bus and the RAM will return the value of the byte through the first bus. 0001 is the \"location\" of the byte, not the value of it.\nThe fourth bus is the control bus, which the CU will communicate with the RAM with. For example, one wire could tell the RAM to set the byte to the value to the data sent to it by the CU. Another wire could tell the RAM to get the byte from the address sent to it by the CU.\nThe fifth bus is another control bus, linking with the ALU, which sends flags from the ALU. Flags are notes which could be error messages. For example, the CU could ask the ALU to add 15 and 1 in a 4-bit system. Adding 15 and 1 in 4 bits would yield 0 (explained above) and this is called a \"binary overflow\". This is an error and the ALU will tell the CU about this through the fifth bus as a flag. The CPU could also send data to the ALU and ask for it to perform an action with that data.\nComponents.\nControl Unit (CU) will fetch instructions from the instruction ROM (for other computers, instructions can be changed and therefore is RAM. For our case, we are running a fixed program and do not need to change the instructions. This simplifies the process entirely and the instruction is Read-Only Memory (ROM)). Inside the CU, it will then decode the instruction, which is normally a number, into a sensible action. It will then perform that action and if the instruction requires, store the result into the RAM. It communicates with the RAM through the control bus and receives flags from the ALU. It can also ask the ALU to perform actions on data it sends to the ALU (e.g. addition). To communicate with the RAM, for example, one wire could tell the RAM to set the byte (the location of it is specified through the third, address bus) to the value to the data sent to it by the CU through the second, data bus.\nArithmetic logic unit (ALU) will execute instructions sent to it from the CU and will compare binary numbers and communicate with the Control Unit. It can do simple addition and subtraction which can be repeated to do multiplication and whole-number division, outputting a whole number (then division). There are also logic gates for booleans, the fundamental &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Logic%20circuit\"&gt;logic gates&lt;/a&gt; are required, such as the \"NOT\" gate and the \"NAND\" gate.\nNow we can choose from a range of designs of busses, each contributing to the aforementioned three key designing goals of a Minecraft computer."}

Once you know the basics of redstone music, you can make an infinite number of songs.\nBasics.\nRedstone.\nBy placing &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s in lines, it is possible to play multiple times.\nAnother way is to put note blocks under &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt;s, so as you ride along you can play the song of your choice!\nTranslating real music.\nWhen making &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; music in vanilla Minecraft, it's very helpful to know how you can translate sheet music you find online into an actual note block circuit. The main two factors of music are rhythm and pitch. Rhythm is determined by how many repeaters you put before/after a note block, and how many ticks you set them to, and pitch is determined by how many times you right click a note block. Once you know how rhythm and pitches relate to ticks and note blocks, you can make an infinite number of songs.\nPitch.\nPitch is one of the most important factors of music. Here is a table of how all notes in music that are able to be played on Minecraft can be simulated with note blocks. The table shows how many times to press the noteblock to get the desired pitch.\nRhythm.\nRhythm is another important factor of music, which is basically how long a note is held for. The next table shows how many redstone ticks, using repeaters, must go after a note block, depending on the tempo of the music, and what kind of rhythm the note is. Remember; the maximum number of ticks for one repeater is 4, so if you need more than 4 ticks, you need more than one repeater. Also, the numbers you see on top is the tempo of the music, which is how many beats there are in a minute.\nIf you must have your song in a tempo where triplets have no exact match, you can substitute for 2 sixteenth notes followed by an eighth note, which sound similar to triplets at faster tempos.\nSounds.\nDifferent sounds can be made on note blocks by putting different types of blocks under note blocks. Here is a list of what block(s) you need to put under a note block to make it have a specific sound.\nSongs and sounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Note%20block\"&gt;Note block&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to make sounds that may benefit playing, or to make your favorite songs.\nNote: All of the songs listed here that can be made into note blocks are in the public domain, meaning their copyright has expired.\n\"Choo Choo\" Train.\nFollow these steps so that you can make a sound similar to a train whistle:\nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star.\nIf you follow these steps, you can produce the basic melody for the song: \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.\"\nThe Star Spangled Banner.\nThe following song is the first part of The United States National Anthem. Exact instructions are not included this time, so use your knowledge from the previous two songs, and look up notes/rhythms on the chart in the section titled \"Translating Real Music to Minecraft Note Blocks,\" so that you can figure out how to tune the note blocks, how many repeaters go in between the note blocks, and what delay they are set to.\nTip: The tempo is 75, meaning that a quarter note is equal to 8 ticks, or 2 repeaters, both set to full delay.\nThe only instrument that has the full range of the song is harp/piano. This means that the block under each note block must be something other than wood, sand, gravel, soul sand, concrete, glass, stone, brick, gold, clay, packed ice, wool, or a bone block.\nFollow the steps, in order, and use the chart in the section titled \"Translating Real Music to Minecraft Note Blocks\" to translate the pitches and rhythms into redstone music.\nExternal software.\nOne of the many ways to create note block songs is to use external software.\nNote Block Studio.\nYou can convert any song you want into a set of note blocks using an external application called &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs\"&gt;Note Block Studio&lt;/a&gt; created by Davve.\nThis method also requires &lt;a href=\"//www.mcedit.net\"&gt;MCEdit&lt;/a&gt; to import the result into your world."}

There are a variety of pages discussing how redstone works, mostly collected in the page &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Redstone\"&gt;Tutorials/Redstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlanning.\nThe first step in building a redstone circuit is to decide what it will do and how, in general, it will operate.\nSize.\nWhen making redstone, its important to make it a reasonable size.\nYou shouldn't use a huge amount of space for a single contraption. Large builds take up a lot of space and are inconvinent. However, you also shouldn't try to create a fully functional redstone circuit in a tiny area. Complex redstone circuits often need plenty of space to function. For example, you cannot create a redstone computer which can perform number operations and display multiple items on a screen at once in only 1 chunk.\nFor the best redstone results, make your contraption as small as you can with it still functioning, but if you find you're having any troubles with that size, make it bigger. Also, make sure to never underestimate how much time, space or materials you will need. It's much better to overestimate and bring more than you need so that you have extras for next time.\nCreative Mode.\nA complex redstone project for a &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; world can be designed in &lt;a href=\"Creative%20mode\"&gt;Creative mode&lt;/a&gt; first, before investing resources and effort in a survival world. It's handy to keep a creative-mode world handy for such laboratory work, usually a superflat with cheats on. You can also manipulate the &lt;a href=\"Game%20rule\"&gt;game rules&lt;/a&gt; for your testing world to your liking, such as to make it permanent day or avoid mob spawning. Creative mode is great for building, because you have an infinite number of &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;, you can break blocks right away, and you can fly around to look all around your structures. You can also press F3 + N to invoke spectator mode, then fly through look inside your circuit. \nOnce you have finished your &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; contraption and gotten it working, look it over to make sure you understand how it's working \"now\". You may be able to make some improvements here. But eventually, you go back to your survival-mode world, gather the materials, and just copy your design from creative mode. Optionally, you can count how many of each material you used when building in creative mode, so that you will know exactly how much of a certain material to gather when in survival.\nGathering Resources.\nWhen making very large redstone contraptions, you may need farms for renewable resources. Here are some materials you may need to farm:\nConstruction.\nIt can be helpful to choose a specific set of blocks the player uses to construct circuits. Then, when the player runs into these blocks during the excavation of new rooms in the base, the player knows they are about to damage a previously-built circuit. Common choices include &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;. (Using different colors of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; is also a great way to keep track of different circuits)\nBe cautious when building circuits near &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. Many redstone components will \"pop off\" (turn into items) when washed over by liquids, and lava will destroy any items it contacts.\nBe careful when building circuits to activate TNT (traps, cannons, etc.). Circuits in mid-construction can sometimes briefly power up unexpectedly, which might activate TNT. For example, placing a redstone torch on a powered block, it won't \"realize\" that it should be turned off until the next tick, will therefore be powered for one tick, and can briefly power another part of the circuit during that one tick. Placing TNT after the rest of the circuit is complete will help to avoid such problems and the destruction of the device itself. This also applies to any other features of the circuit that may be accidentally activated with such actions (e.g., activating a dispenser before the circuit is ready). Temporarily placing a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; can quickly test whether a given space is powered.\nColor coding.\nThis is a simple yet very effective tip, especially if you create &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; contraptions that have many different parts to them, such as &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; clocks mixed with other redstone &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;. It is best to use different colored &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt; for different parts of the circuit. If you build all the redstone using the same building block, for example, out of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;(which you shouldn't be using for redstone anyway if you are in Survival because an &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;Enderman&lt;/a&gt; may break it), soon you may completely forget how your redstone works due to not remembering where each circuit goes. Furthermore, this is important if you want to show off the redstone contraptions on YouTube, so people can copy your design in their &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; world or you want to be able to go back to your project and understand what parts of the circuit perform what function.\nIf you don't want to use wool, concrete, or terracotta, you can find other blocks that are different colors from each other. For example, you can use &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; variants and wood-related blocks. However, try not to use blocks of similar color, such as a block of coal and black concrete on 2 different parts of a circuit. You can also use different colors or variants to mark switch-supporting blocks (input) or potential output locations for a circuit, e,g, if most of the circuit is built on stone brick, you might choose carved stone brick for switch blocks, polished granite for output locations, and diorite for mobile blocks. Glass (which can also be tinted) can be used to display the workings of a circuit; it can also make sure that lava and water (e.g., in a cobblestone generator) are visible but not open to unwary players. \nAll this may take extra time and effort, but the benefits are worthwhile.\nTroubleshooting.\nWhen the circuit isn't working the way it should, take a look at it and try to find the problem. Work through the circuit and test various inputs to find where a signal is \"dropped\" or gained inadvertently.\nRefining.\nOnce the circuit is working, consider if it can be improved (without breaking it)."}

These methods work best on small circuits that run in loops, i.e. 4/5 clocks.\nThe Problem.\nCurrently, there is a glitch involving &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s. In singleplayer, when you save and exit, and then come back, any repeaters that were running in a continuous circuit will freeze. A block directly next to the repeater must be \"updated\" to jump start your circuit. This also appears to happen in multiplayer, if the chunk is unloaded from memory.\nThis problem has been mostly fixed in singleplayer in 1.0.0. Although, it may still exist in multiplayer, which these methods should still work.\nEDIT: This glitch still exists. This can happen in certain redstone setups. The repeater sometimes gets locked to on, and you have to break it to fix it. This has been tested on a modded 1.8 client several times, and the same thing has happened.\nWorkaround concept.\nChange at least one block that is adjacent to every repeater that you want to refresh. Or you can update Minecraft to 1.0.0 which might solve the problem.\nMethods.\nMethod: Automatic reboot using a minecart.\nThis method uses a small circular track with a &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s and some regular &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s. The powered rails must always be powered. The detector rail should be next to some redstone going to the side of the repeater (read: not connected to the circuit). When the &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; activates the Detector Rail, it will fire the redstone signal and launch the repeater due to a block update next to it.\nMethod: Reboot using a lever.\nPlace a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; beside the repeater that's frozen. You just need to toggle the lever every time the circuit freezes to reboot the circuit.\nMethod: Reboot using piston(s).\nPlace a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; on the block under a block beside every repeater and wire them all to a \"reboot\" button. When you push this the block updates will reset them all at once. It is recommended to have it reset every repeater to get a simultaneous restart of all systems. This is a handy method for advanced computers because it restarts everything at once, and will cause less glitches. The only downside is the extra space required to wire up the pistons without powering the clock with the \"reset\" button."}

{"id": "39602", "revid": "41414787", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39602", "title": "Tutorials/Roof construction guidelines", "text": "This tutorial will give you some basic guidelines when building a roof.\nRoof scale.\nHow big should a roof be? For \"inhabited\" buildings, a good guide is to make the roof between one and two stories tall. If a roof section does need to be much taller than that, consider making it into a tower, or use a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Roof%20types%23Mansard%20roof\"&gt;mansard roof&lt;/a&gt; containing multiple floors.\nThe height of a roof can often be adjusted by changing its pitch or by adding a parapet and/or a roof-level walkway. Whenever there is enough volume under a roof for another building level, it would be quite unusual not to put in some extra rooms to take advantage.\nFor example, a building 20m wide with a single 45\u00b0 gable roof would have a roof with a height of 10\u201311 blocks. Assuming 4\u20135 block stories, the roof would be 2\u20132\u00bd stories high. At that size, it would be advisable either to put an extra floor inside the roof volume, or else split the roof into two or three smaller sections so that the rise per section is around 5\u20137 blocks. Alternatively, by adding a 1 block high &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Roof%20decorations%23Parapets\"&gt;parapet&lt;/a&gt; and a 1 block wide walkway around the roof, it is reduced to an apparent height of 7 blocks, which falls roughly within the rule of thumb for roof heights.\nFor some buildings, a spectacular roof is part of the design. For these 'monumental' buildings \u2013 such as churches \u2013 making all the internal spaces 'livable' is not a concern, and architectural and aesthetic considerations should take precedence.\nRoof height.\nThese illustrations show the effect of adjusting the roof height of one section of a building relative to another. In the first picture, the main building has walls four blocks high and the side extensions have heights of two, four and six blocks. The white quartz steps mark the joining line between the main roof and the side roofs.\nIn the second picture, the side extension is almost a tower; it has a height of eight blocks relative to the parent building's four. The white quartz block marks the join as before, and the new sandstone bricks mark where the side extension's roof has been brought \"down\" to match the height of the main roof.\nThe final picture simplifies the join considerably by making the side extension into a tower.\nRoof pitch.\nAs a real-world rule of thumb, the more precipitation an area receives, the steeper the pitch of roofs in that region. In \"Minecraft\" it is easy to get a roof pitch with an angle of 63.4\u00b0, 45\u00b0 or 22.5\u00b0 \u2013 just use double blocks for 63.4\u00b0, steps for 45\u00b0 and alternate upper and lower slabs for 22.5\u00b0.\nNote in the two 'roof pitch' diagrams how the width of the building significantly affects the look of the steepest roof. When using steeper roofs, or if you want a central 'feature' that is an odd number of blocks wide (such as a door) make the entire building an odd number of blocks wide. That way the roof will come to a point exactly over the central feature. If the center of your building is to have a double door or some other feature with an even width, then the building width should usually be even too.\nOther roof pitches need more effort, and not every pitch will look good at every roof size. Try to use a repeating pattern of two or three blocks that generates roughly the right slope; for example, a sequence of slab, upside down stair, stair, slab, upside down stair, stair, rises five blocks vertically for every seven horizontally. As a general rule, the more complex the pattern, the bigger the roof you will need before you can use it.\nLarge buildings.\nOnce a building is larger than about 15\u00d715 blocks, it will begin to look increasingly strange (or, at best, barnlike) if it continues to have a simple roof. Large buildings usually have multiple roofs in different sections. Think of an English manor house with two wings as a common example. Trying to place a single gable roof over a building like that is likely to look ridiculous. It's at this point that more elaborate roof designs begin to be needed. The following Wikipedia article lists common roof designs and often provides pictures and diagrams: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_roof_shapes\nJoining roofs.\nIt's quite easy to combine the basic roof designs. For large buildings, mixing different roof designs is necessary to make the building look convincing. This illustration shows a building with a hipped roof and a gable end. The gable end uses red brick blocks so that you can see how the two roof sections merge.\nWhen roof sections are joined together, the combination that results is known as either a \"cross gabled\" or \"cross hipped\" roof depending on the basic roof types being joined. The resulting compound roof is usually shaped like a T or an L. More elaborate designs may form a cross shape, an H, or any of countless other possibilities. Newly-made buildings usually have a consistent design, but older buildings that have been extended over time are likely to end up with a mish-mash of different styles.\nHow to join roof sections.\nWhile a small building will usually look fine with a simple V-shaped roof, large buildings need multiple roof sections or they will look strange. That means you will need to design multiple roofs for different sections of a large building and join them together. You can use the roof examples from computer-generated &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village buildings&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration, but smoothly joining up roofs at angles to one another takes a little practice.\nIf you are new to roof construction, a simple building sequence is as follows:\nYou will quickly note that when roofs join, they usually do so along a V-shaped line, and roof blocks inside that V will be removed at the final construction stage. Once you understand this behavior, it becomes easier and quicker not to place the unneeded blocks to begin with. But whenever you are dealing with a complex roof structure, it is simpler to build the entire roof and then remove unneeded blocks afterwards.\nBuilding on a slope.\nWhen building on a slope, it is probably simplest to level the area for each building section separately, then build. For the roofs, the common choices are either to give each elevation its own separate section of roof, or to adjust the height of the shared walls to support a single unified roof.\nAngled buildings.\nIt is possible to make buildings in \"Minecraft\" that aren't aligned with the four cardinal directions. Unfortunately, except at very large scales, it is hard to make them look convincing. If you are constructing a metropolis, the occasional odd-shaped building helps enormously to add variety to Minecraft's regimented grid, but normally making these buildings is not worth the extra complexity. The example above is diamond-shaped and uses slabs for its roof. Normally, non-axis-aligned buildings should use slabs or blocks for their roofs, as stairs are often awkward to manage.\nThis building has walls 'stepped' so that they move 'two along, then one up'. This is approximately equivalent to angling the building at 63\u00b0. Note how most of the roof blocks are in parallel pairs, following the course of the wall blocks under them. Note also how filler blocks (quartz in this image) are needed to close off the holes in the sides of the roof. For clarity, the sidewalls of the gable roof use dark wood, and the end steps have been replaced with sandstone.\nThe filler blocks used here are not strictly necessary. By using corner stairs, upside down stairs, or full-sized blocks, the holes can (mostly) be avoided. It's then just a matter of which minor variation in roof design you prefer. However, depending on the roof design there may still be a small number of places where filler blocks are unavoidable."}
{"id": "39600", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39600", "title": "Tutorials/Roof decorations", "text": "Every part of a roof can be decorated. Here are some of the more common embellishments.\nRidges and parapets.\nTop ridge.\nThe top ridge of a roof is an obvious place for decoration. In this image we use a stone fence to top off a gable roof. Note that the building is an odd width so that its roof comes to more of a point. \nEnd parapet.\nWhere a row of buildings is split into several smaller habitations, as in this terraced row of houses, extending the shared (party) walls above the roof surface makes the separation between buildings visible. Note how the terrace ends have also been decorated to maintain symmetry.\nParapets.\nTo keep an inhabited building 'in scale', its roof should be in proportion with the building's other stories. Large featureless roofs tend to cover barns and hangars, and are rarely found covering dwellings. In practice, a good rule of thumb for roof height is to make it more than one story but less than two stories high. Hence with 4-meter stories, the roof should be in the range of 5\u20137 meters.\nWhenever a roof's volume is large enough, it will tend to be used for additional rooms, perhaps even additional floors, but that in turn requires dormers, skylights, and other adjustments rather than a large expanse of blank sloping roof area. Extending the parapet vertically is often useful on larger constructions, as it allows the roof size to be reduced. This helps bring it back into scale with the rest of the building.\nGables.\nStepped gable.\nThere are two common ways to 'end' a roof. One method is to extend it a way beyond the edge of the building. This helps keep the walls and ground around the building foundations drier. The other way is to extend some or all the parapet wall higher than the roof, allowing for various decorative finishes, and shrinking the size of the roof relative to the rest of the building. These designs include the \"Flemish gable\", \"stepped gable\" and some other variants.\nStepped gables are also known as \"corbie steps\", \"crow steps\" or \"craw steps\". This is a simple, effective and distinctive look for a Minecraft building.\nFlemish gable.\nA \"Flemish gable\" is a decorative end to a roof containing one or more curves, and it is hard to model these convincingly at normal Minecraft scales. It's probably best to consider them merely 'a decorative roof ending' rather than trying to make them accurate. This roof style is also known as a \"Dutch gable\". A similar design is the older \"clock gable\", which is slightly more bell-shaped and has a cluster of three windows in the top area of the gable.\nPatterned roof tiles.\nEmbedding a pattern in the roof tiles themselves is a simple way to add flavor. Even tiny decorative flourishes can add up to make a noticeable difference, especially if you apply them as a theme throughout an entire settlement.\nFacades.\nA \"facade\" is a way to add a decorative front to a plainer (and often cheaper) building. They are used to make a building look more attractive or grander than it really is, or to disguise a building's unusual shape (especially if its roof is the problem) so that it fits in better with its neighbors.\nIn Minecraft, redstone constructions may have all sorts of unusual shapes, and a facade may be a good way to disguise these workings.

{"id": "39599", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39599", "title": "Tutorials/Roof types", "text": "This tutorial lists many common roof types, roughly in ascending order of complexity, and gives examples of each one.\nWikipedia provides additional information and diagrams , and from that page there are links to other articles with lots more reference images.\nPlease note that roof terminology is not rigidly defined. Usages vary from place to place, and from one architect or builder to another. One person may describe the alternative mansard roof design shown on these pages as a 'bonnet roof', for example, and this is understandable given the similarities between the two roof shapes.\nRoof designs also vary, so that there may be no discernible difference between a 'hipped roof with a gable end' and a 'link dormer', or between one person's 'skillion roof' and another's 'shed roof'. Every element of every roof type may be adjusted, and most roof types can be combined in different ways, producing unlimited numbers of local variants.\nCommon roof designs.\nFlat roof.\nThis roof type may also be referred to as a \"parapet\" roof, meaning a roof with a parapet (a low protective wall) around it.\nMaking a flat roof is trivial, but making a flat roof that looks real takes a little more effort. Take a leaf from the blacksmith's book from the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; and add a border; that little extra effort greatly helps make this simple structure look more attractive. \nAlways try to use different block types for a roof border. Use slabs, as in the illustration, or backwards stairs, forming a gutter, or add a border of blank signs all the way round the building, or a parapet, thus making the roof area safe to use. The only thing you shouldn't do is to just use the same materials as for the rest of the building. \nThese roofs have one flaw: They are generally a good place for mobs to spawn at night if not lit up or covered in slabs, buttons, or pressure plates.\nTerrace.\nIf the design of a house offers easy access to an area of a flat roof, that roof area may be paved so that it is useful as an outdoor living area. \"Terraces\" may be large or small, covered or open, or a mixture of the two.\nA \"balcony\" may be very similar to some terrace designs, but it is not part of a roof, and the balcony may or may not have a roof covering over it; as a rule of thumb, the area under a balcony will also be outdoors, whereas the area under a terrace tends to be indoors.\nShed roof.\nA \"shed\" or sloped roof is sloped in one direction only. This design is rarely used as the main roof on inhabited buildings, although it may be seen on part of such a building. If it is a building's sole roof it is more likely to be found on cheap, simple or utilitarian buildings such as sheds, animal houses, outhouses or storage barns. \nGable roof.\nA \"gable roof\", also known as a \"pitched\" or \"peaked\" roof, is an inverted 'V'. This roof design is common in the original &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s produced by \"Minecraft\"'s terrain generator, and is useful for small buildings. The building in the image is 6\u00d710 meters. Allowing for the very thick walls one gets in \"Minecraft\" that give a usable internal space of 4\u00d78 meters; sufficient for one or two rooms. A building of this size integrates well with village buildings.\nSaltbox roof.\nA \"saltbox roof\" is a type of gable roof where one slope is much longer than the other. Buildings with this roof type quite often have two stories at the front and one at the back; adding a lean-to back roof to an existing structure in this manner is a simple way to extend a building. The front and back slopes of a saltbox roof may have the same pitch, but as the second picture shows this is not always the case. \nClerestory roof.\nA \"clerestory window\" is a window too high to see out of which lets light in to a building. Hence \"clerestory roof\" is a generic term referring to a roof shaped to include clerestory windows. This roof shape may also be referred to as a \"half-monitor roof\".\nHipped roof.\nA \"hipped roof\" (or \"hip roof\") is sloped in both directions. There is far less roof volume (for an attic) available under a hipped roof. Placed on a square building, a hipped roof produces a distinctive pyramid-shaped roof.\nHalf-hipped roof.\nAnother way to merge roof styles is to use a gable roof for part of the height of a roof, and then switch to hipped for the remainder. This produces two variant roof types, the \"half-hipped roof\" and the \"Dutch gable\" or \"gablet roof\", depending on which part uses which style.\nFor a half-hipped roof, you can 'switch style' at any point, producing a mostly gable roof with a very small hipped area, or mostly hipped. This half-hipped roof image shows 3 rows of gable roof and 2\u00bd rows of hipped roof above it (including the layer of slabs at the roof peak).\nNote how these buildings are significantly larger than the NPC village buildings, and yet if they were much smaller their variant roof styles would be difficult to recognize.\nDutch gable.\nThe \"Dutch-gable\" is a hipped roof with a (usually) small gable at the top. It's very common to put a small window in the gable part, but in this image we have used wooden planks for clarity.\nNote that 'Dutch gable' is the common US term for this roof type, but this may sometimes cause confusion with the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Roof%20decorations%23Flemish%20gable\"&gt;Flemish gable&lt;/a&gt; design described in the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Roof%20decorations\"&gt;roof decorations&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.\nSkillion roof.\nA \"skillion roof\" is a roof surface which slopes in a single direction. It may continue the slope of an existing roof, or be separate. A skillion roof may sometimes be called a \"shed roof\" or \"lean-to\". This image of a skillion roof shows a 1 in 1 pitch on the right hand side and a 2 in 1 pitch on the left hand side, allowing the roof to extend out over the porch without dropping to ground level.\nGambrel roof.\nA \"gambrel\" roof has two or three distinct roof pitches \u2013 steep lower down, and shallow or flat higher up. The result is that the usable volume under the roof is greatly increased. Some gambrel roofs may have one or more curved sections. If such a roof is partly curved and partly straight, it's usually the lower portions that are given curves first. These roofs would be hard to model well at normal \"Minecraft\" scales.\nGambrel roofs may also be known as \"kerb\", \"curb\" or \"Dutch Colonial\" roofs. \nGull wing roof.\nA \"gull wing\" or 'gullwing' roof has a shallow pitch lower down, and steep higher up. These roof designs often have extensive overhangs to help shade the building.\nMansard roof.\nA \"mansard roof\" is similar to a gambrel roof. It has two or possibly three distinct roof pitches. Most of the roof is steep, but it always has a shallow or flat section higher up, and like a hipped roof it has slopes in both the North-South and East-West directions. Some mansard roofs may use curved roof sections, more commonly on the lower portions. Hence the usable volume under the roof is greatly increased. Very large buildings may have several floors under a mansard roof.\nSome mansard roofs resemble bonnet roofs, having a shallow lower pitch which extends beyond the curtain walls. The key features of a mansard roof are its squarish profile and its increased volume of roof space compared to a gable roof and other simpler designs. Note also that as the main point of a mansard roof is to make the roof volume usable, it will almost certainly have &lt;a href=\"%23Dormers\"&gt;dormers&lt;/a&gt; built in to it to provide lighting.\nIn \"Minecraft\", buildings need to be quite large before mansard roofs begin to look appropriate, especially as it's common to have an extended parapet around them. The building shown on the left is about 16\u00d720 meters. With a parapet and just a 1m walkway all the way around, that would become 20\u00d724m.\nBell-cast roof.\nA \"bell-cast roof\" has two distinct roof pitches, but it is shallow lower down, and steep higher up. It may also be referred to as a \"bonnet roof\". Some bonnet roofs may be partly or fully curved, but this is hard to model at normal \"Minecraft\" scales.\nSaw-tooth roof.\nA \"saw-tooth roof\" has a series of ridges with dual pitches on either side. The steeper surfaces are glazed and face away from the equator to shield workers and machinery from direct sunlight. This type of roof is commonly used for deep plan buildings and factories. It may also be referred to as a \"northlight roof\". Note that to be a 'proper' saw-tooth roof in \"Minecraft\", the windows should all face North or all face South, and you should be consistent about which direction you choose.\nMonitor roof.\nA \"monitor\" is a raised structure running along the ridge of a double-pitched roof, with its own roof running parallel to the main roof. The long sides of monitors often contain louvers or to help light or ventilate the building. A monitor that runs the full length of the building is more commonly found on larger structures such as barns, warehouses and factories, and is rarely seen on domestic buildings. However, a monitor does not necessarily have to run the entire length of a roof. \nHelm roof.\nA \"helm roof\" or \"Rhenish helm\" is a square roof with four gable ends. It is commonly used on towers. The building in this picture is 7\u00d77 meters. To avoid gaps in the roof, slabs are usually needed under the main roof blocks. Here we use upper slabs made of quartz and lower slabs made of red brick. This design tends to work better with square towers of an odd width. Note also that the stair blocks should be placed to face in only two directions \u2013 North-South or East-West. Producing a good-looking helm roof with stair blocks facing in all four directions is very fiddly. For symmetry in both directions, it is usually simpler to just use ordinary blocks.\nButterfly roof.\nA \"butterfly roof\" is a dramatic V-shaped roof sometimes seen on modern buildings. The roof is usually extended beyond the edges of the building to provide additional shade.\nThis design was also used in some Georgian and early Victorian terraced houses, and it is quite a common design in central London. Note that for a \"London roof\", this roof shape is placed at the \"back\" of the property, usually behind either a conventional gable roof or a facade. The central gutters tend to be prone to leaks. In this image the main roof has been made of red brick, and the borders with adjacent properties have been marked with dark wood.\nOther materials.\nGreen roof.\nGreen roofs used to be more common millennia ago, although have been getting more interest in recent times due to their environmental benefits (such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/stormwater/toolkit/greenroofs.html\"&gt;stormwater mitigation&lt;/a&gt;, wildlife habitat provision, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.epa.gov/heatisland/mitigation/greenroofs.htm\"&gt;urban heat-island reduction&lt;/a&gt;). The city of Seattle has some notable examples that could be worked into an urban Minecraft world.\nHere are four variants of simple green roofs:\nThatched roof.\n\"Thatching\" is another ancient roofing style using materials such as straw, reeds, sedge, rushes or heather. While a thatched roof can incorporate most of the design styles used on this page, including &lt;a href=\"%23Dormers\"&gt;dormers&lt;/a&gt;, the main roof is usually made of a single uninterrupted layer to avoid water leaking through. Roof variants such as &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Roof%20construction%20guidelines%23Joining%20roofs\"&gt;cross-gabling&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"%23Monitor%20roof\"&gt;monitors&lt;/a&gt; are rarely seen on thatched buildings.\nWhere dormers are used on a thatched roof, they are almost always &lt;a href=\"%23Wall%20dormers\"&gt;wall dormers&lt;/a&gt;, but one may also see the occasional deeply inset \"eyelid dormer\", as in the picture.\nWhen thatching a roof, it's important to angle the straw so that water flows off as quickly as possible. In \"Minecraft\", a layer of yellow &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s may help with a roof's appearance.\nSome thatching techniques simply layer new materials on top of the old as the older thatch wears out. Over the centuries, such roofs can reach thicknesses of over two meters.\nDormers.\nA \"dormer\" is a structural element of a building that protrudes from the sloping plane of the roof. (C.f. &lt;a href=\"%23Monitor%20roof\"&gt;monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which straddles a roof ridge.) Dormers create extra space in the roof by adding headroom, and they allow the addition of \"dormer windows\". Dormers have their own 'mini-roofs' above them, and these can have almost as wide a variety of roof types on them as the buildings themselves, theoretically even including curved roofs.\nWall dormer.\nFor a \"wall dormer\", the wall below the dormer is extended upwards and given its own roof section. Most types of dormers can be wall dormers.\nBlind dormer.\nAn unsual type of dormer is the \"blind\" or \"false dormer\". This is a dummy dormer that is only visible from the outside of the building, and is there to make it look grander, more balanced, or to add interest to an otherwise featureless roof. A blind dormer can look like any other dormer type."}

You can also buy 2 rooted dirt for 1 emerald from a wandering trader.\nHanging root farming.\nAll you need to do is place a rooted dirt and bonemeal the bottom of it to produce a hanging root, which will drop if you harvest it with a Silk Touch tool or shears. You can automate the process with a redstone clock connected to a dispenser facing into the rooted dirt block."}

On this page are some ideas and tips that could make the machine one to be noticed.\nIdeas.\nMobs.\nSome mobs attract or repel certain other mobs. Villagers attract zombies, zombies attract iron golems, cats repel creepers, and skeletons attract dogs. Show off &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; pathfinding by making a small maze with a trapped mob at the end. Near the end, make the mob step on a pressure plate, tripwire, or have the mob die. You can have multiple mobs for a race.\nItem flow.\n&lt;a href=\"Dropper\"&gt;Dropper&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to shoot items over &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; that has &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; on top. Make an item slide onto a pressure plate that triggers another dropper to shoot more in a different direction. You can also use &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;s to crush a mob, and make its drops fall into a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; next to it.\nWater-torch.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; can knock out &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. Use a water device that knocks out a torch supporting sand/gravel, making it fall 2 blocks. This continues the water flow.\nCannonstone.\n&lt;a href=\"Sand\"&gt;Sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; cannons could be used to shoot a block over to an area that has a powered &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt; with a piece of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; missing. Once the block falls in place, the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt; is electrified and conducts power. The player could also shoot mobs using &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGreenstone.\nA neat type of wiring can be made with &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. Place a cactus, add sand on top, add a torch in the sand, and place sand on the torch. Right next to where the sand falls, add another cactus. Rinse and repeat.\nThis works because cactus cannot be directly next to a solid block, and breaks itself if a block ends up next to it. The sand is supported by a torch, which is supported by more sand on top of that cactus. When the cactus breaks, the sand is no longer supported and falls next to another cactus.\nSandclock.\nA &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; pushing a solid, gravity affected block (&lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; or both &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;s) over a hole, with a powered &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt; on one side of the sand's destination, before it falls and a line of repeaters on the other side can make some short pulses, and if a lot of the block is used can be used to unlock certain circuits. The powered repeater that transmits power though sand/gravel could be replaced with an observer block.\n\"Pistone\".\n&lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Redstone\"&gt;Redstone blocks&lt;/a&gt; are a source of power. To make \"Pistone\", make a piston push a redstone block into the rear end of another &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; that pushes a redstone block into another piston. Also, players could place a piston where the redstone block originally was, so when the piston pushes it, piston 2 unpowers. The player could make it a sticky piston that pulls a powered block away from another piston.\nPlayers could also replace the redstone blocks with opaque blocks with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; below, or opaque blocks that a gap between a powered repeater and the next piston. &lt;a href=\"Slime%20block\"&gt;Slime block&lt;/a&gt;s may also be used.\nOh, shoot..\nMake a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; shoot an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;, splash &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;, or anything else that is shot as a projectile when put in a powered dispenser at a &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;. This knocks it off. You can use this by making it fall onto a wooden &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; or into a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; next to it, or by having a comparator behind the block the frame is on, which removes the signal, if you have the comparator pointing into some redstone dust on top of a block with a redstone torch on the side, the torch will power back on. Or, you could simply use a target block, but this doesn't look as cool. Any way you do this will send a redstone signal to the next part of the contraption.\nWorth a shot.\nA &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; can be killed with arrows or an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, making its treasure fall onto wooden pressure plates and/or a hopper with a comparator next to it. This can be a funny way to add some depth into your complex device. The arrow can come from the \"Oh, shoot\" trick.\nVariation.\nProjectiles can also be used, for example, to knock a snow golem into water.\nHot gravel.\nPlacing a one tick &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"liquid\"&gt;liquid&lt;/a&gt; flow, that pushes away the &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; in front of it that has &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; on top can be useful. On this gravel, there is a torch on the side holding up another gravel, etc. You could even make a message with these, by stacking gravel and &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, to write something like \"THANKS FOR WATCHING\". This isn't visible when in its \"torches\" state, everything falls into place.\nMusic.\nYou can add music to your Rube Goldberg devices by using &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s. Even other blocks in Minecraft that make noises, such as &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s, can sound quite melodic when mixed in with note blocks. They could contain stuff in them to jump right into the N-ice items! trick. Also, shot arrows make a whole different sound, so you can leap straight into the \"Oh, shoot\" technique. You could go with the classic \"Worth a Shot\" technique. Keep in mind &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s are musical as well (carry on into Pistone), and so are &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s (release the zombie into a maze!)\nSee &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Redstone%20music\"&gt;Tutorials/Redstone music&lt;/a&gt; for more.\nMine-blowing carts.\nYou can make minecart &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s start them and &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt;s to power other things in the RGM. You could use them with &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;s to transport mobs around the RGM. For example, you could make a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; maze and put a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; at the end. When the zombie gets in, it is moved quickly along the rails. It might then hit an activator rail and chase after another &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;. The villager could have another minecart in front of it, continuing the cycle.\nYou could also make minecarts knock other minecarts into powered rails, shooting them down the track.\nJumps.\nYou could make the minecart jump over other minecart tracks or other objects to look cool.\nMinecart marble run.\nYou can use minecarts with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; and detector rails to change the path for every minecart that uses the rail. Each should end up at a different destination, and all of them must be there to complete the circuit.\nSource-ry.\nYou probably had that terrible moment where you were building a sink bowl in a mob farm when all the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; turned into source blocks. This source trick can be used as an RGM component. Make an almost-complete sink bowl, and then add a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; that adds water in the right way to turn the whole bit into a huge source. This allows the water to wash away a sand-supporting &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; on the other side.\nIt burns!\nA dispenser can use a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; to light &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; on fire, with sand or a redstone torch above the log or wool. Once the block disappears, the sand falls activating a redstone current. However, be careful when using fire, as players don't want to burn their creation down. This technique is risky, due to the chance the fire may run out before reaching the block; however, \"checkpoints\" (dispensers with fire charges in the middle of the fire track) and netherrack may make such occurrences less likely.\nUsing \"Minecraft\" as part of a machine.\nAlthough great on their own, implementing \"Minecraft\" (or indeed, any other sandbox game that allows the construction of these machines) into a real-life physical Rube Goldberg machine can add much more depth into both. Using an object heavy enough, such as a big marble, to activate a button that causes an action (for example, the mouse buttons), can achieve said effect. This can be seen in DoodleChaos's 23rd Rube Goldberg \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoH3VJuni9YU\"&gt;How to Kill a Creeper&lt;/a&gt;\", where a block is broken and a creeper dies as a result of this.\nWith more hackery involved, since some microcontroller boards like Arduino Leonardo or Teensy can take virtually any signal, electronic or otherwise with sensors, as an input and emulate a keyboard and a mouse using its USB connection, you can program it to spam some commands if triggered by an external source.\nIn the \"Minecraft Pi Edition\" for Raspberry Pis, since the Raspberry Pi board is, just like aforementioned microcontroller boards, takes any signal as an input, and runs a special version of \"Minecraft\" that supports scripting using the Python programming language, on a full-blown Linux distribution, more epicness can be achieved.\nOmniversial.\nThe aforementioned microcontroller board hacks can also be used with servers - this means you can connect your creative or survival multiplayer world with the real world! Also, the aforementioned Raspberry Pi can be used as a (albeit limiting) Minecraft server and the programming, which is still driven by external sources, though not through that Python interface within the game directly, is still possible."}

{"id": "6212", "revid": "5290187", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6212", "title": "Tutorials/Safe home", "text": "Unfortunately, there are many dangerous and scary things out there in the Minecraft world that would like to kill you. So here are a few ways to fortify your home and prevent that from happening.\nEnvironmental.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen you extend your base, be sure that nothing fragile like &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; circuits are on the floor in the area. If you strike a water source, it can wash such things away. If you are unlucky, you yourself can also be swept away (maybe into something dangerous) or drown. If you wish to be extra careful, you can place slabs around any redstone circuits you do not want to be accidentally flooded, as slabs block the flow of water.\nLava flows slower, but is much more hazardous, as it sets you and your &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;en items on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sand\"&gt;Sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Built on sand\" is a real life saying which means \"This won\u2019t last long\". This is true in Minecraft, too. Not only are sand and gravel subject to falls or cave-ins due to obeying gravity, but they also have less resistance to explosions than other materials. Additionally, both of these block types have sufficient other uses (such as sand for glass and gravel for &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt;, concrete or coarse dirt) that it is best to use them for those, rather than as a construction base.\nIf you have a floor of sand or gravel, be careful when mining \u2014 digging near sand that isn't supported from below WILL cause it to collapse. Be wary of placing torches on sand columns which may fall. If such a torch is destroyed, you may find a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; or other &lt;a href=\"Mobs%23Hostile\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=\"Spawning%23Mobs\"&gt;spawned&lt;/a&gt; in the darkness.\nIf you discover a natural cave with a roof of sand or gravel, be extra careful. Even if you don\u2019t choose it to become your new home, as soon as you place or remove a block near it, the loose sand or gravel will suddenly be affected by gravity and fall down, &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocating&lt;/a&gt; you, flooding the cave with lava or water and/or allowing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s to come in from the dark cave/&lt;a href=\"night\"&gt;night&lt;/a&gt; above.\nIn the same manner that sand or gravel makes a poor choice for flooring or a foundation, obsidian is particularly good, due to its high explosion resistance. While it is unlikely that you will be able to produce enough obsidian to build entire walls or floors out of it, it can still be used for foundations, wall trim, and entrance frames. If you are indeed going to use a large amount of obsidian, you may wish to see \"&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Obsidian%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Obsidian farming&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWidely considered to be the most dangerous mob(except the bosses) in Minecraft is the creeper, because of the damage it causes to buildings (they can effectively blow large holes in your structures). However, you are safe within your base if there are creepers outside, as they can't get close enough to you to explode. You might even be able to open your door and kill the creeper with a bow and arrows, as long as you keep your distance!\nAlso, be aware that creepers can detect you and start their fuse from one block away, even if there is a low wall or fence keeping them away. Ways to avoid this are: build a wall at least \"two full blocks\" tall (even if it is made of certain &lt;a href=\"Blocks%23Translucent%20Blocks\"&gt;translucent blocks&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"slabs\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt;, fence or &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;); or build your home with all spawning surfaces on all traversable paths sufficiently lit.\nDifferent blocks have different resistances to &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s. Dirt walls will be easily destroyed by creepers, while two block thick cobblestone will resist most creeper explosions. &lt;a href=\"Obsidian\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is explosion-proof with the exception of blue wither skulls, so you can laugh in the face of creepers trying to destroy walls built of this block.\n&lt;a href=\"Cats\"&gt;Cats&lt;/a&gt; are also a good defense, as creepers will run away if they are in a short distance of one. Even if you've attacked the creeper, it will run away as long as there is a cat nearby, so it is a good idea to put cats around your base.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpiders can jump 3 blocks, therefore 4 block wide ditches with over hangs won't protect you against spiders/spider jockeys.\nSpiders are two blocks wide, which means they cannot move through 1-block wide spaces. Spiders can also climb walls and fences, so you won\u2019t be safe in your walled garden anymore.\nTo effectively spider-proof your buildings, you\u2019ll have to do one of these things:\n&lt;li&gt; You can keep spiders from climbing walls using glass panes/iron bars to create an edge. example: \nSpiders can climb cactus fences, but they will suffer some hit damage doing so. Therefore, cactus fences only \"reduce\" the chances and speed of a spider climbing walls. Either make multiple fences or one fence tall enough to kill any spider that climbs all of them. Each fence only needs to be one row of cacti, because while cacti can\u2019t be placed next to each other, spiders are two blocks wide. Use the method in the &lt;a href=\"%23General\"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt; section for a version which works on other mobs too. (If you prefer a wall for keeping off all other mobs, you can use this cactus fence: )\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSkeletons are dangerous because they can fire &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s through gaps in your defenses. Wherever possible, fill open gaps with any of certain &lt;a href=\"Blocks%23Translucent%20Blocks\"&gt;translucent blocks&lt;/a&gt; such as slabs, fence, or glass to make windows.\nAdditionally, build low walls or &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s in places where you may be in the range of a skeleton since they will only fire arrows at you if they can see you.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider%20Jockey\"&gt;Spider Jockey&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpider jockeys are dangerous because of combining the climbing and tracking abilities of Spiders with the ranged attacks of Skeletons. You must combine your defensive strategies for both skeletons and spiders.\nThey're relatively rare, so it is unlikely, but not impossible, to encounter more than one Spider Jockey on the same night.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s.\nZombies are the simplest mob to defend against. With limited mobility and no ranged attacks, walls or pits will be enough to keep them at bay. However, zombies can break down wooden doors to reach you if you're in Hard difficulty. If you're in Hard, you can make a piston door so that zombies cannot get through, or you may make an iron door. Zombies very strongly prefer to smash the top half of a door, but can't jump and smash a door at the same time (jumping resets their progress smashing the door), so putting a 1-deep hole in front of your door should prevent zombies from breaking down the door while still allowing mobs (such as yourself) to enter when the door is open. To prevent other mobs from using the entrance put a two high pillar of sand above the door, though this won't stop or even hurt the offending zombie. A way to prevent zombies from breaking your doors is to put the doors in sideways, rendering them \"open\" when you close them. Or you could make an iron door with a button on each side. Zombies can break down wooden doors and not iron doors. Zombies will not jump over gaps, so you can use lava trenches. If you are starting/low on Iron, you can use a fence gate or place the Wooden door parallel to either side of the doorway (when you close the door, zombies will think it is open). \nYou can also use traps such as pits, landmines, etc.\nGhasts.\nIf you get lost in the Nether and have no choice but to start a new shelter there, or even if you just wish to try out Nether survival, your biggest problem is ghasts. They can fly through the air, shoot fireballs that explode on contact with the ground (although the explosion is fairly weak), and can spot you from 100 blocks away. Obviously, a simple fence won't suffice. The simplest solution is to build a roof over your entire living area, preferably fairly big, in case you feel like expanding your house later, and start building a house in it. The best material would be glass, as you can see through it and tell if any ghasts are nearby before leaving your dome, with the downside of breaking easily if a fireball hits it and not being a renewable resource in the Nether. A recommended material is to use &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, and any &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt; variant as they are highly defensive against the ghast's explosion, and very easy to obtain. (I have only tested this with &lt;a href=\"cobbled%20deepslate\"&gt;cobbled deepslate&lt;/a&gt;.)\nBecause ghasts require a 5\u00d75\u00d75 space to spawn, it is possible to create a large ghast-free area in a cavern by placing blocks so that there is never enough space for the ghasts to spawn. Start by walling in any entrances to the cavern so that ghasts can't wander in. Then, you need to place blocks within that cavern to prevent any new ones from spawning (this is easiest to do in Peaceful difficulty). The simplest method would be 1\u00d71 pillars of any material, placed in a grid across the entire cavern, with 4 clear squares in each direction between each pillar. A more complex method is to place glass blocks in a 3-dimensional grid to fill up the entire space rather than pillars. The only limit to how large an area you can protect is resources. Once you have protected a cavern like this, you can terraform it, and it is actually safer than anything you can build in the Overworld since the only mobs that can spawn are &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. But you can even prevent these two mobs from spawning in your cavern by covering the entire floor with a material that mobs aren't able to spawn on, such as glass.\nA harsh rule in surviving in the Nether is never to build a &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; house as netherrack is highly flammable and ghasts will probably tear apart your house before you can even admire your beautiful netherrack mansion. (Think: Breaking netherrack with fists is quicker than punching stone.) Another harsh rule to follow is not to leave ANY gaps near the bottom of your house, or else fire will be able to come in if ghasts attack the ground around your house. It's strange, but ghasts seem to not be able to see through glass.\nWith the addition of &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; it is possible to build ghast-resistant structures of material that is readily available in the Nether. You can easily create &lt;a href=\"nether%20bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; by smelting &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; and then using the nether brick in a 2\u00d72 square to make the block. \nMaybe build a full &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; bunker and an &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt; on the very front. &lt;a href=\"Obsidian\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is very hard to retrieve, so build a shell out of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and cover it steadily with &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Don't use a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; for your door, because if you have nothing to reset it, you can be permanently trapped in the &lt;a href=\"nether\"&gt;nether&lt;/a&gt; and can't come home! Although, you can use a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt; to relight your portal.\nVideo.\nHere are some building ideas to help you keep unwanted players and/or creatures from entering your base!"}

If you do not, you risk losing your progress or possibly corrupting your save.\nDownload and Install Dropbox.\nThe first step is to download Dropbox. Dropbox automatically syncs content to their servers and allows you to access it both online and through a client on your PC. Dropbox is cross-platform, plus available on the web and web-enabled smartphones.\nGo to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.dropbox.com\"&gt;http://www.dropbox.com&lt;/a&gt;, register for a free account, download the application and install it. You automatically get 2GB for free.\nOnce you have installed Dropbox, you'll need to know where the Dropbox folder is:\nWhichever operating system you are using, Dropbox has very good documentation and can assist you in finding help: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.dropbox.com/help\"&gt;http://www.dropbox.com/help&lt;/a&gt;\nMove your Minecraft Saved Data to your Mega Folder.\nNext, we will need to make a copy of your Minecraft data on the Dropbox server and then rename the original.\nWindows.\nOn Windows, your Minecraft data is saved in your application data (AppData) folder. You can access this by holding Windows+R or hitting Start &gt; Run and then typing %AppData%\\.minecraft in the box. If the folder doesn't open, click on the Tools menu on Windows Explorer, click the View tab, and under Advanced Settings, make sure \"Show hidden files, folders and drives\" is selected.\nCopy all the files in this folder to your Dropbox folder. For organization sake, I usually create a subfolder inside my Dropbox folder and title it \"Minecraft\".\nOnce these files are done copying, navigate back up to your AppData folder, and rename the .minecraft folder to .minecraft2 (for files that begin with a \".\" such as \".minecraft\" Windows may give an error message when renaming and refuse to rename. If this happens try to rename the file to \".minecraft2.\"; this will rename the file to \".minecraft2\" without the previously typed period at the end of the title.)\nThis step ensures that you:\nAlternate (command line) method.\ncodice_4\nNote: attempting to usecodice_5will give the errorcodice_6, as should be: codice_7\nmacOS.\nIn macOS, the Minecraft data folder is located in your Username &gt; Library &gt; Application Support folder. You can get here quickly by opening Finder &gt; Go &gt; Go To Folder &gt; type codice_8. For future reference, it's best to make an alias for this folder and copy it to your desktop. NOTE: Mountain Lion hides the user's Library folder. Hold down the option key and see the Library item appear in the GO menu.\nNow, copy the saves directory (~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/) to your Dropbox's Minecraft folder (~/Dropbox/Minecraft/), unless you already have saves from Windows or Linux there.\nAlternate (command line) method.\ncodice_9\nLinux.\nIn Linux, your Minecraft data folder is located in your user home folder. However, it may be hidden from view. If you are using a GUI, ensure that you choose View &gt; Show Hidden Files.\nCopy the contents of the .minecraft folder to your Dropbox folder. As mentioned above, I usually create a folder inside the Dropbox called \"Minecraft\".\nOnce the copy is complete, rename the .minecraft folder to .minecraft2\nAlternate (command line) method.\nOpen the Terminal and type in:\n cp -r ~/.minecraft ~/Dropbox/Minecraft\n mv ~/.minecraft ~/.minecraft2\nCreate the Symbolic Links.\nThis is the final step that will allow us to create links to the online versions of your files.\nWindows.\nSymbolic links are similar to shortcuts but are much more powerful. In Windows, the command mklink or junction will allow us to create a symbolic link. \nOpen an elevated command prompt. In Windows 7 and 8, you can do this by searching for \"Command Prompt\", right-clicking it and selecting \"Run as administrator.\" This is necessary even if you are the administrator on your machine. Otherwise, you will receive the response \"codice_10\", and creation of the symbolic link will fail.\nType the following command to set up the symbolic link:\nWindows Vista, 7, 8, and 10.\nWARNING: Use caution when creating or deleting hardlinks on Vista and before! Hardlinks create an alias reference to file data. Deleting a hardlink on Vista or XP will also delete the associated data.\nJava Edition:\ncodice_11\nIf you get the error codice_12, make sure the .minecraft folder in %AppData% has been deleted or renamed. codice_13tries to make a \"folder\" namedcodice_14and, if a file or folder of the same name already exists, can't replace it.\nBedrock Edition:\ncodice_15\nDeleting a Hardlink\nTo disconnect a hardlink on Vista or XP use this command instead of delete:\n \"fsutil reparsepoint delete &lt;path&gt;\"\nThis will remove the link but leave an empty file of the same name in its place which you can then safely remove. (Verify the folder is empty before you delete it.)\nOn Windows 7 and 8 you can safely delete a hard link with windows explorer.\nWindows XP (after installing junction.exe).\nIf you are running Windows XP, you first need to download junction.exe from SysInternals and place it in your root folder in order to enable symbolic links. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//download.sysinternals.com/files/Junction.zip\"&gt;http://download.sysinternals.com/files/Junction.zip&lt;/a&gt;\nOpen the command prompt and type in:\ncodice_16\nIf you are successful, the .minecraft folder should reappear in your AppData folder. When you start Minecraft after this, you should have all your previously generated worlds!\nmacOS.\nCreating symbolic links in macOS is easy thanks to a free application called SymbolicLinker, which will allow you to create a symbolic link via right-click in the Finder. \nDownload and install SymbolicLinker, available here: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//seiryu.home.comcast.net/~seiryu/symboliclinker.html\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (free). \nOnce installed, move your Minecraft folder (located in \"~/Library/Application Support/\") to a folder in your Dropbox. Rightclick on this new folder and choose \"Make symbolic link\". This will create a symbolic link in the same folder. Move this back to your Minecraft folder's original destination (make sure it has the same name as the original) and you are all set to pull your game data off the internet.\nAlternate (command line) method.\nOpen the Terminal and type in:\n ln -s ~/Dropbox/Minecraft/saves ~/Library/Application\\ Support/minecraft/saves\nLinux.\nTo create the symbolic links in Linux, open up the terminal and type the following commands.\n ln -s ~/Dropbox/Minecraft ~/.minecraft\nNow, the .minecraft folder should be listed in your home directory and your saved worlds should all be there when you start Minecraft.\n\"In order to link any additional computers you wish to play on, you just need to follow these steps - install Dropbox, and create the symbolic links. Voil\u00e0!\"\nNote on Multiple Operating Systems.\nIf you wish to sync your Minecraft files between different operating systems, you need to add a few extra steps to the method above. This is because the bin folder inside your minecraft folder, which contains binary files which run the program (as opposed to data files, like your saved games) has different files depending on your operating system. These files, however, have no overlap, and you can have a fully operational Minecraft folder for all operating systems (Windows, Mac OS and Linux). There are no known problems arising from different versions of the same operating system.\nTo make this work, take a look at the subfolder bin/natives. It has different contents depending on your Operating System.\nAll you have to do is to go through your different installations (in the operating systems you use) and put these files all together in the same existing natives folder, like so:\nThen sync it away with Dropbox, it works no problem! :)\nIf you use third-party mods to the game, you must install all desired mods only once, and then synchronize the patched result. In the unlikely (but possible) case that you run into problems, you should NOT share the bin folder (with its natives subfolder) anymore. Mods known to work cross-platform seamlessly include Zombe's modpack, Mine Little Pony, and MCPatcher.\nAlternate Method.\nGo to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/topic/814010-100how-to-play-minecraft-off-your-usb-drive-any-computer-any-minecraft-version/\"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and follow the directions, but instead of putting the \"minecraft\" folder on the thumb drive, move it to your Dropbox folder. Just run the .bat file when you want to play, and you're done! To install mods, texture packs, or maps, you must use the .minecraft folder in the Dropbox folder. "}

One pickle can be placed on live coral and then have &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; applied. After one bone meal is applied, three more sea pickles will be placed in the same block. The application of more bone meal causes them to spread to nearby live &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nManual farming.\nManually farming sea pickles can be done underwater near a &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;. Simply apply bone meal on as many live coral blocks and sea pickle blocks as possible, and the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; will soon have a lot of sea pickles.\nSemi-Automatic farming.\nTo make the farming process easier, a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; can be hooked up to a fast redstone clock.

Then, the block underneath the pickles can be moved, or they are directly broken with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;. The challenging part is that a block update detector cannot be used for this since water spontaneously causes block updates.\nAutomatic farming.\nThis takes advantage of the spreading mechanic of sea pickles. To build automatic sea pickle farms, have a dispenser apply bone meal to a block of 4 sea pickles, with another coral block nearby. The sea pickles will spread to this other coral block, which can be detected and broken."}

{"id": "14580", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14580", "title": "Tutorials/Secret door", "text": "Secret doors are concealed entrances into places created by the player. They are useful for a variety of things, such as protecting valuables on a &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; server, building an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Custom%20maps\"&gt;adventure map&lt;/a&gt;, or just for fun. Some hidden doors, such as piston doors, require a redstone opening mechanism to tell the door to open. This tutorial will attempt to cover the basics of a few different types of hidden doors. Note that some of the doors listed are well known so don't be surprised if someone spots it right away.\nHole in the wall.\nThis is among the simplest hidden doors as it does not require any special items or tools. Additionally, it can be completely hidden as it has a manual opening mechanism. To make the door, first find a location that is not a likely mining spot. Next, break a hole in the ground or a cliff side. This hole is the entrance, the broken blocks the door. Remember to 'close' or patch the hole or else others may see it.\nA few tips:\nHole in the floor.\nAlmost identical to the hole in the wall, this is exactly what it sounds like. To create it, simply dig a hole in the ground, add &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s to allow upward movement, and build a base at the bottom. It may be tempting, but remember to not dig straight down. This door has the advantage of only taking up one block of space and being able to be built anywhere, not just places with walls.\nTips:\nPainting door.\nThe &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; door is one of the most well known hidden doors in Minecraft. As such, players are likely to check for secret passages even if they are not trying to invade or thieve. To create the door, start by digging a hole in a wall. Next, replace the removed blocks with ones that can hold a painting but can also be walked through. Some commonly used ones are: &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s. Next, cover the entrance with a painting. To do this, look at the lower left-hand corner block of the area you want covered and place. Note that you may need to crouch place if placing on a door or fence gate. If the painting turns out to be the wrong size, break it and try again. In some cases you may need more than one painting to cover everything up.\nIf you use a door or other block which can be powered by redstone, you can 'lock' the painting with a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, or another opening mechanism. One opening mechanism unique to paintings is the use of a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;wooden pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. Since items can be thrown through 1 block holes behind paintings, the wooden pressure plate can be used to trigger a door.\nHidden piston door.\nFor secret doors involving pistons, see the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Piston%20Uses%23Doors\"&gt;Piston Uses tutorial&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Simple%20piston%20door\"&gt;step-by-step guide&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis first design is labelled for a hidden storage room, but you can easily use it to hide a full base instead.\nUnderwater hidden door.\nSince the player's visibility is limited underwater, an underwater entrance is easier to conceal. In fact, most players will not notice a 1 block hole underwater unless they are looking for something like that. Simply dig a 1 block hole from your hidden location to the water. For extra security, it can be coupled with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; and an opening mechanism. One simple mechanism for underwater is to use water stream to push an item onto a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;wooden pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;. It is better to have a separate entrance for the player and item so that the player cannot press the pressure plate themselves. A more simple method is to cover the entrance with &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt; and a warped trapdoor (as the green color blends in the water well).\nLava minecart entrance.\nWhen entering a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;, the player instantly teleports. Additionally, minecarts can be entered through &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. These mechanics can be exploited to get through a stream of lava. To build it, first, build an entrance and cover it with lava. Try to make it look like a natural lavafall. Behind the lava, place a &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; and put a minecart on it. If in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, be careful not to get burned by the lava.\nLava trapdoor.\nThis entrance can be a bit dangerous, especially if the player is low on &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. As shown in the schematic, after the player goes into the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, they sink through, fall past the &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, and into the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. This design can be expanded or shrunk as needed, however it may be tricky to make it more than 2 blocks wide. To ensure your health will not run out with your &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; settings and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, it may be a good idea to test it for the first time with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Some good hiding places for this: a beat up house with a single bucket of lava on the floor; a natural lava pool; in a decorational lava pool.\nCorner door entrance.\nThis door uses the fact that a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20door\"&gt;wooden door&lt;/a&gt; when opened covers up the wall it is against. This works best with &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dark%20oak\"&gt;dark oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crimson\"&gt;crimson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"warped\"&gt;warped&lt;/a&gt; doors as they cannot be seen through. It sometimes works best in a small closet, but be aware that if made too obvious, other players may discover it.\nOpening mechanisms.\nEvery good secret door has an equally great secret opening mechanism. Some doors, such as the painting door, do not require an opening mechanism. Others however, such as the classic &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Piston%20uses%23Jeb%20door\"&gt;Jeb door&lt;/a&gt;, require a redstone trigger to open.\nArrow plate trigger.\nUsing a hidden &lt;a href=\"wooden%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;wooden pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; can be fired at a predetermined location, activating a door. As arrows despawn after 1 minute, the secret doorway can close automatically. If this 1 minute period is too long, pressure plates can be added inside the door to close it prematurely. It can be difficult to hide a pressure plate. Some ideas include behind a waterfall, under a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pool, or in a fake minefield.\nAnother way is to place a pressure plate diagonally to a corner of a wall. When the player shoots the arrow, the pressure plate will detect the arrow through the wall, therefore opening the secret entrance.\nLava fishing trigger.\nSimilar to the above, this opening mechanism uses a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pool instead of a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. To create it, place a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;wooden pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; under a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; pool and connect it with &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; to a secret door. To open the door, fish onto the pressure plate and try to not look conspicuous. If the fishing bobber hits the plate, the plate should trigger the redstone, opening the door. The advantage of this over using arrows is that the door closes when you retract the bobber. Once you get good at it, the door can be opened and closed rather quickly. Additionally, other players are unlikely to waste their fishing rod's durability by fishing in lava. If someone asks why you are fishing in lava, you could use an excuse such as \"I wanted to see if fishing rods burn if you fish in lava\" or \"I wanted to see if I could catch fish in lava\" or even \"I wanted to fish my pet magma cube out of the lava!\".\nDaylight trigger.\nThe &lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt; can be used to open a door only at a certain time. This works well with piston doors such as a half Jeb door. Since it is unlikely you want the door to be in plain sight when open, this may be best combined with other mechanisms to use the daylight sensor as a lock. For example, the daylight sensor could be used to open a door behind a painting. It does restrict when the player can open the door, however. This could cause problems with frequent use.\nLectern trigger.\nThe &lt;a href=\"lectern\"&gt;lectern&lt;/a&gt; can be used to open a door when a &lt;a href=\"written%20book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt; with the correct number of pages is placed on it and turned to the proper page. This is similar to the jukebox trigger.\nBlock destruction trigger.\nIt is possible for a redstone output to be generated as a result of a block being destroyed. To achieve this, place a redstone torch on the side of a block facing away from you. Next, set up an inverter between the block and your mechanism. When the block is destroyed, the torch will fall, the lack of input will be inverted, and the mechanism will activate. Alternatively, an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; may be used."}

Those maps can be used to deobfuscate a version's &lt;a href=\"Jar\"&gt;JAR file&lt;/a&gt;, that is to say, replace obfuscated class names and class member names with their original (deobfuscated) names. Using a , it is possible to reconstruct human-readable code.\nDisclaimer.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Obfuscation%20map%23License\"&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;, decompiling \"Minecraft\" is allowed, but it is recommended not to release decompiled code. Furthermore, a suggests usage of the mappings inside of projects by the community, such as modding (using them to decompile \"Minecraft\" for usage with &lt;a href=\"https%3A//files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/\"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//fabricmc.net/\"&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//quiltmc.org/\"&gt;Quilt&lt;/a&gt; and other modloaders) or for usage in server software with plugins (such as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.spigotmc.org/\"&gt;Spigot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//bukkit.org/\"&gt;Bukkit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https%3A//papermc.io/\"&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt;, and others) is okay, and an intended use. It should be noted however that this tweet is not legally withstanding, so while it is probably fine to use these mappings for such purposes, you do so at your own risk. This can be extended to decompiling and accessing Minecraft's code as a whole, the only things you cannot do under any circumstances are releasing the code or releasing something that contains an exact copy of the code.\nDownloading obfuscation map.\nEvery &lt;a href=\"Client.json\"&gt;version's JSON file&lt;/a&gt; contains a link to the obfuscation maps for that version since 19w36a. The JSON file for a version can be found in the .\nOnce you have found the JSON file corresponding to the version you want to decompile, locate the or field (depending on which side you want to decompile) under the field and download the file from the URL inside the field.\nDeobfuscating JAR.\nTo deobfuscate a JAR file, you need a program that takes the JAR file and its corresponding obfuscation map as inputs, and returns a deobfuscated JAR file. A free and open source program you can use is &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/md-5/SpecialSource\"&gt;SpecialSource&lt;/a&gt;. You can download the latest version on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.md-5/SpecialSource\"&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou don't actually need to download every dependency to get SpecialSource to run. Here is the list of the dependencies required for version 1.10.0 to work:\nTo use SpecialSource to decompile a JAR file, download all the dependencies above in the same directory and run the following command inside this directory:\n java -cp SpecialSource-1.10.0.jar;*;. net.md_5.specialsource.SpecialSource --in-jar \"&lt;path to JAR file&gt;\" --out-jar \"&lt;path to deobfuscated JAR file&gt;\" --srg-in \"&lt;path to mappings&gt;\" --kill-lvt\nWhere:\nIf running under Linux or macOS, replace the semicolons with colons before running it. If running in PowerShell, place inside double quotes.\nNote.\nObfuscation maps provided by Mojang do not include local variable names. The (\"kill local variable table\") option tells SpecialSource not to try to remap local variable names.\nDecompiling JAR.\nNow that you have a deobfuscated JAR file, you can use a decompiler to reconstruct source code from this file. The produced source code should be valid Java code, but is not the original code of the game. A decompiler is unable to reconstruct the original code, it can only try to produce valid code that matches what the compiled file does.\nThere are many Java decompilers available. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.benf.org/other/cfr/\"&gt;CFR&lt;/a&gt; is a free and open source option available under the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\"&gt;MIT License&lt;/a&gt;. You can download CFR 0.152 on &lt;a href=\"https%3A//mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.benf/cfr/0.152\"&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/benf/cfr/0.152/cfr-0.152.jar\"&gt;.jar&lt;/a&gt;). 0.152 is the version that seems to give the best results when decompiling recent versions of \"Minecraft\". To decompile a JAR file with CFR, run the following command:\n java -jar cfr-0.152.jar \"&lt;path to JAR file&gt;\" --outputdir \"&lt;path to directory&gt;\"\nWhere:\nUseful tools.\nThe community has made some tools to simplify the process of deobfuscating and decompiling \"Minecraft\". For example, you can use &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/hube12/DecompilerMC\"&gt;DecompilerMC&lt;/a&gt; to decompile any version automatically."}

Do not \"move\" the directory as this might crash the server.&lt;br&gt;\nNo restart is required.\nManaging players.\nReset player.\nIf you want to reset a player's inventory, position, or any other related data about them, you can remove the player's .dat file. Navigate to the Minecraft server directory, open the world folder, open the player's folder, and delete the .dat file which has the UUID that corresponds to the player's current username. This folder is at \"minecraft\\world\\players\", where \"minecraft\" is the folder where Minecraft was installed on the server. This will cause the player to start over at the spawn point with no inventory and no items in their ender chest. The player's changes to the world will be untouched, along with any inventory stored in chests. This will not ban the player that has been deleted.\nBan player.\nIf you want to ban a player from playing on your server, edit the minecraft\\banned-ips.json\", where \"minecraft\" is the folder where minecraft was installed on the server and add the user you want to ban to this banned-ips.json file. To ban an IP address from the server, the full IP address must be specified; wildcards are not valid. Players who are banned through this method will see \"Your IP address is banned from this server!\" when attempting to connect. Alternatively, an operator can use the \"ban-ip\" command via \"\", where \"ipaddress\" is the IP address of the user you wish to ban. This can be undone via the operator issuing the \"pardon-ip ipaddress\" command or editing the server's banned-ips.json file.\nEdit player.\nIf you don't want to delete a player completely, but want to remove something from them or move them to a different spot, or even give them an enchanted item, you can edit the &lt;a href=\"Player.dat%20format\"&gt;PLAYERUUID.dat&lt;/a&gt; file with an NBT editor similar to how you would a level save (The player in question must be offline during this operation, but you do not need to restart the server afterwards). Note: If you open this file in Notepad on Windows for example, it will show symbols and random letters/numbers.\nSetting textures.\nSetting the server's &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can set a default resource pack for your server and the client has the option to download it and use it for your server. (Please note that the client can turn off the resource pack)\nSetting the server's icon.\nServers can have an icon that will show up in the Multiplayer list.\nResetting &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnsure there are no players in that dimension, stop the server.\n\"Delete\" the \"DIM-1\" folder to reset &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;, \"delete\" the \"DIM1\" folder to reset &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;. Any builds inside those dimensions will be lost, the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt; will also reappear for &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nRestart the server."}

For example, you would place the modpack \"FTB Beyond\" in \"/opt/minecraft/FTBBeyond\" (without spaces in the name).\nIf you want to run vanilla instances, just create a folder within /opt/minecraft and upload the minecraft_server.jar and create the eula.txt file (using: echo \"eula=true\" &gt; /opt/minecraft/vanilla/eula.txt).\nAfter you uploaded the minecraft server files, make sure, that \"minecraft\" is the owner and owning group.

Players over the internet cannot connect unless other workarounds (such as port forwarding or Hamachi) are set up.\nJava Edition.\nHosting a LAN server.\nTo open an active single player world to LAN:\nIt is also possible to start a LAN world by the command line with .\nAfter a world has been opened to LAN, a confirmation message will be sent in the chat, for example:\n\"Local game hosted on port 50000\"\nThis port may need to be provided to joining players to help them connect.\nOn the technical side, a Minecraft client with an opened LAN game sends a UDP multicast to the local address 224.0.2.60:4445 every 1.5 seconds. Other clients then listen for this multicast to show your game in their multiplayer menu.\nJoining.\nIf joining from the same local network, the game should appear in the multiplayer games list in the Multiplayer menu.\nIf the game doesn't show in the list, it might still be possible to join. One will need to find the game's port, and the local IP of the computer the host's Minecraft game is running on.\nThe game's port can be found in the chat message sent in the host world after it was opened to LAN.\nThe local IP of the host computer can be found in Windows 10 and Windows 11 by opening the command line (press Start, type \"cmd\" then hit enter), typing the command codice_1 and pressing enter, and finding the IPv4 address. (On macOS, the command is codice_2,to be typed in the terminal window.) Other operating systems will differ. The local IP should be formatted like 192.168.1.1 or similar, i.e. have '192.168' as the first two sets of numbers. When the local IP and port are found, type them into the \"Server Address\" field (under either Direct Connect or in the Add Server dialogue), formatted like IP:port (e.g. 192.168.1.1:5000) to join the LAN game.\nNote: Using one Minecraft account on two or more computers will not work to join the same world.\nPlayers over the internet can connect to a LAN game if one forwards the game's port on the host's router. If done, people over the internet can connect to your game using your router's IP (which can be found by googling \"what is my ip?\") in place of your local computer's IP.\nLog Me In Hamachi can also be used to play a LAN game over the internet. Hamachi simulates a LAN between people across the internet.\nBedrock Edition.\nOn Bedrock Edition, LAN gameplay is on by default. The option to turn it on or off is in the multiplayer section of world settings, you cannot change this while in a world. You can change the number of slots by using /setmaxplayers (a cheat) up to 30. To change the game mode, change it in world settings. "}

Please refer to this &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DsuZIQWd7Vnc\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you want a server with more customization features to use, and an easy to setup and use interface. You can try Spigot. This page will show you how to easily set up a server and have your friends come on, and a list of must-have plugins, or mods used on a server. Spigot is updated for full 1.18.\"x\" functionality.\nPlease note that this guide only covers Windows machines. If you are running macOS or Linux, please read &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.\nObtaining the files.\nFirst, download the latest BuildToolsGUI.exe from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/0uti/BuildToolsGUI/releases\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To use this program, you must have .NET 4.5 installed. If you have used your computer for a while, you probably already have it. If not, grab the installer &lt;a href=\"https%3A//download.microsoft.com/download/B/A/4/BA4A7E71-2906-4B2D-A0E1-80CF16844F5F/dotNetFx45_Full_setup.exe\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparing the server.\nNow that we have BuildToolsGUI, we are ready to start. Open the BuildToolsGUI.exe file, and if you wish, change the version with the drop-down menu. Click \"Run BuildTools\". It will start running, and you can wait a bit until it has finished running. Note that this may take a while, depending on your connection and your computer. Once it is done running, open the BuildTools folder created in the same directory as the executable. Next, create a folder on your desktop named \"Spigot\". Copy the file \"spigot-jar\" to the Spigot folder, and rename it to spigot.jar\nNext, open a text editor such as Notepad, and paste the following command in:\n @echo off \n java -Xms#G -Xmx#G -XX:+UseG1GC -jar spigot.jar --nogui\n pause\n(the # is your allocated ram, you can choose anything but 3 is recommended.\nIn your text editor, select File &gt; Save As, and navigate to the Spigot directory. Change the name of the file to run.bat.\nStarting the server for the first time.\nCongratulations! Your server is now up and running. To connect to it, open the version of Minecraft your server is on, click \"Multiplayer\", then \"Direct Connect\", and type in \"localhost\" as the server IP. You should connect to the world that was generated a moment ago. Now you can start to customize your server with the various options included and plugins that you can download.\nWARNING!\nNot many new server owners are aware of the effects of the /reload command.\nIn a nutshell, this creates a new instance of every plugin, and try to re-enable it.\nThis results in memory leaks, lag and potential destruction of the server.\nTl;dr: Only use /reload if you know what you are doing. Do a full RESTART otherwise.\nHow to check my IP to join from another computer?\nCustomizing your server.\nWith the Command Window still open, type \"op &lt;\"yourusername\"&gt;\" and hit Enter. You are now an operator and have privileges to execute commands on the server. Another file to play around in is the server.properties file. Open it up with a text editor and play around. There are many guides around the internet that show what these various options do, and one can be found &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. When you are done on your server, type \"stop\" into the console to stop the server. If you want to add plugins to your server, you can find some &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.spigotmc.org/resources/%3Forder%3Ddownload_count\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https%3A//dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To install a downloaded plugin, place it in the Plugins folder in your Spigot directory. To start your server again, simply double-click run.bat."}

The software may be installed on most operating systems, including Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux and BSD.\nFor more tutorials, see the bottom of this page or the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials\"&gt;Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; page. For more information on \"Minecraft\" servers, see the &lt;a href=\"Server\"&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; page.\nNotes:\n\"Note: There is also &lt;a href=\"Custom%20server%20list\"&gt;custom server software&lt;/a&gt; available, which most large servers use, but these applications are not supported by Mojang Studios.\"\nWarning.\nSince you're about to run your own server, you should be aware of the possible dangers. Running by the instructions below should not put you at any risk, but this is a wiki which everybody is allowed to edit, and we don't know about your system configuration, so we can\u2019t guarantee you'll be 100% out of danger. \nIn order to run your server and stay out of trouble, we highly suggest that you should at least know about the following:\nSome Security Information:\nJava.\n is a programming language designed to create programs for the (JVM). The JVM supports many different platforms. By doing this, developers write code for the JVM and any platform supported by the JVM can run the program. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.javaworld.com/article/3272244/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html\"&gt;Further reading.(Remote shell port)&lt;/a&gt;\nThis section is designed to answer some frequently asked questions about Java and guide you through some decisions regarding Java.\nOpenJDK vs OracleJDK.\nOpenJDK and OracleJDK are very similar. OpenJDK is the official open source of Java. OpenJDK is an open source codebase that almost all other JDKs are built on. Excluding packaging, cosmetic and license differences &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/oracle-jdk-faqs.html\"&gt;OpenJDK is the same as OracleJDK&lt;/a&gt;.\nDo note that OracleJDK (Oracle's \"OTN\") builds require a paid subscription for &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.carehart.org/blog/client/index.cfm/2019/1/1/how_oracles_java_change_applies_to_any_production_use\"&gt;commercial and production&lt;/a&gt; purposes. This likely includes running a \"Minecraft\" server even if it is non-profit. Oracle does provide its own OpenJDK builds, but they are not packed into an installer format for easy use.\nJRE vs JDK.\nJRE stand for &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.javaworld.com/article/3304858/what-is-the-jre-introduction-to-the-java-runtime-environment.html\"&gt;Java Runtime Environment&lt;/a&gt;. JDK stands for &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.javaworld.com/article/3296360/what-is-the-jdk-introduction-to-the-java-development-kit.html\"&gt;Java Development Kit&lt;/a&gt;. JRE is a package tool designed to \"run\" Java programs. JDK is a package of tools designed to \"develop\" Java programs. The JDK comes with the JRE which comes with the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.javaworld.com/article/3272244/what-is-the-jvm-introducing-the-java-virtual-machine.html\"&gt;JVM&lt;/a&gt;. If you have JDK then you have JRE and JVM. Vanilla \"Minecraft\" does not need JDK, but plugins may require it.\nHeadless Java.\nA headless Java installation is a trimmed down version of Java. It does not have a GUI or mouse/keyboard support. Headless Java is frequently used in Servers or other environments where a GUI is not needed.\nCommon instructions.\nThe general gist of running a \"Minecraft\" server is that you will need to install codice_1, run the server, accept the EULA, and run it again. Once you have installed codice_1 and opened up a command line, everything is basically the same.\nAt this point you should have a basic server running. See &lt;a href=\"%23Configuring%20the%20environment\"&gt;Configuring the environment&lt;/a&gt; for more information about configuring your server. One of the things you definitely want to do is &lt;a href=\"%23Writing%20a%20script%20to%20launch%20the%20server\"&gt;writing a script to launch the server&lt;/a&gt; so you don't have to remember the command line.\nJava options.\nJava options should be added between the and the on the command line, or in your startup script.\nTo sum up, a reasonable flag combination can be as simple as . That is it. There are bits that you can squeeze from complicated flags, but you would get much more from &lt;a href=\"Mods\"&gt;modified server software&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, all serious discussions (e.g. Aikar and brucethemoose) of server performance assume some degree of modding.\nMinecraft options.\nOptions for the server JAR go \"after\" the part. Run with codice_10 to see all available arguments that can be passed to the server. Below is a list of available commandline options for the server.\nThe following options are available from &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; too. It might be a better idea to edit that file instead for easier management:\nWindows instructions.\nInstalling Java.\nThe \"Minecraft\" server requires the Java Runtime Environment (also called JRE or simply Java). For your security, you should only use the most recent version of Java. To verify that you have the latest version, do \"one\" of the following:\nIf you don't have Java or your version is outdated, then download the newest version at https://adoptopenjdk.net/ (OpenJDK) or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/%23jdk17-windows\"&gt;http://www.java.com/download/&lt;/a&gt; (Oracle \"OTN\" JDK)\nmacOS instructions.\nKeep in mind that the server won't run correctly on macOS 10.4 and earlier and may crash your machine.\nInstalling Java.\nOpen the terminal.\nSetting up the Minecraft server.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Common%20instructions\"&gt;Common instructions&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing Time Capsule.\nSome homes use AirPort Time Capsule as a wireless router instead of other brands. This section will teach you how to set one up without messing up your file server. \nNOTE: Make sure you have your admin username and password.\nThat's it! You're now ready to &lt;a href=\"Setting%20up%20a%20server%23Configuring%20the%20Minecraft%20Server\"&gt;configure your server&lt;/a&gt;.\nLinux instructions.\nLinux comes in many different varieties called distributions (distros). Some of these distros are designed or better suited for running a server. If you are setting up a dedicated server it is recommended to use one of these distros. \nLinux, in general, is more welcoming to open source programs. So where applicable it is recommended you use open source programs, such as OpenJDK.\nInstalling Java.\nFor most distributions, it is recommended to install OpenJDK 16 (for 1.17+) or OpenJDK 8 (for below 1.17) from the official repositories. For Oracle Java refer to Oracle's &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp\"&gt;Download Page&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Note: While not affecting Minecraft server, JavaFX or other proprietary aspects of Java will need to be installed separately.\"\nSpecific instructions are included for each distro below, but not all have been updated to 1.17. If it only says to install OpenJDK 8, that means that it has not yet been updated to 1.17.\nSolus.\nRun codice_35 to install OpenJDK.\nFor OracleJDK refer to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//getsol.us/articles/software/java/en/%23jre\"&gt;Solus Help Center&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Note: OpenJDK 11 is not in Solus' repositories.\"\nDebian, Ubuntu, Raspbian.\n\"Note: You might need to install the package \"software-properties-common\" by running codice_36 and/or \"python-software-properties\" by running codice_37 to use the codice_38 command.\"\nDue to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.webupd8.org/2014/03/how-to-install-oracle-java-8-in-debian.html\"&gt;licensing issues&lt;/a&gt;, the repository frequently used to install Oracle Java has been discontinued. It is now recommended that you install OpenJDK 8 or above. \nOpenJDK can be installed with one command:\nRemoving the 'headless' part of the command will install all components of Java.\n\"Note: &lt;1.17 tested in Ubuntu 18.04, 1.17 tested in Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS\"\nopenSUSE.\n\"Note: Due to possible instability openSuse Tumbleweed is not recommended as a dedicated server.\"\nJust run the command from the terminal: codice_41\nJava should be installed.\n\"Note: Tested in openSuse Leap 15.1\"\nArch Linux.\nBoth java 8 and 16 are in arch linux's repostiory.\nJust run codice_42, For the OpenJDK 16 JRE, Remove \"-headless\" for the full JRE if you want to run with GUI.\nJust run codice_43, For the OpenJDK 8 JRE, Remove \"-headless\" for the full JRE if you want to run with GUI.\nIf you encounter issues it is recommended that you refer to the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/java\"&gt;ArchWiki&lt;/a&gt;\nGentoo.\nRun codice_44\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Java%23Installing_a_virtual_machine\"&gt;Gentoo Wiki&lt;/a&gt;\nOther distros.\nCheck your distro's documentation. It should have information on how to install OpenJDK.\nAlternatively, you can &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp\"&gt;visit Java's website directly&lt;/a&gt; to download the Java package for Linux. Most distros work with this (either 32 or 64-bit). Instructions for the installation of those different packages are given on the site.\nIf during installation, it asks for a password, enter your password. If you get asked \"Is this OK [Y/N]\" Enter Y and press enter if required. Java should now be installed.\nA simple installer script (also installs Java).\nhttps://github.com/silvertriclops/MCSLI\nNote: this is a very early project, designed with offline installation in mind, and will be updated periodically to make it more user friendly.\nFreeBSD instructions.\nThis part was tested with FreeBSD 10.0 amd64 and 'jre-7u65-linux-i586.tar.gz'\nInstalling Java.\nDue to performance and crash issue with OpenJDK and \"Minecraft\" server, we will install Oracle JRE made for linux.\nBefore installing this JRE, you have to install the linux binary compatibility on FreeBSD, you can follow this &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/linuxemu-lbc-install.html\"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nJave requires some information about the proc. You have to mount linprocfs, type:\nkldload linprocfs\nmount -t linprocfs linprocfs /compat/linux/proc\nand add this line to codice_45:\nThe Oracle JRE has a dependency marked as forbidden and the installation will fail. Go to codice_46 and in the Makefile remove the line which starts with codice_47.\nNext you have to manually get the linux tarball due to licence issue (like `jre-7u65-linux-i586.tar.gz') from java official web site and copy the file to codice_48.\nThen to install the JRE, go to codice_49 and run codice_50.\n\"Note: The previous version of this part, tested on FreeBSD 9.2 amd64, was explained like this: You may have to set JRE_UPDATE_VERSION variable in your Makefile to the actual number (e.g. 45 like in this example) and run 'make install NO_CHECKSUM=1'.\"\nTry running codice_3. You may end up with a message that it cannot find codice_52. One way to fix it is to add your java paths to the search explicitly.\nMake a symlink:\nln -s /usr/local/linux-sun-jre1.7.0/lib/i386 /compat/linux/usr/lib/java\nAnd in codice_53 add:\nRun codice_54.\nNow codice_3 should work.\nLaunching Minecraft Server.\nCreate a folder and copy the \"Minecraft\" server jar in it.&lt;br&gt;\nIn the actual version you will get this exception codice_56 if you run the server in the usual way, so we add this line to the command to fix that codice_57.&lt;br&gt;\nThe command to launch is like:\njava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -Djava.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider=sun.nio.ch.PollSelectorProvider -jar minecraft_server.1.7.10.jar --nogui\nPlan 9.\nPlace Holders have been used in this example shell script including PATH_TO_YOUR_JRE.deb and PATH_TO_SERVER_JAR.jar replace them with /INSERTACCOUNTREGISTERNAME/.../INSERTJRENAME.deb and /INSERTACCOUNTREGISTERNAME/.../INSERTJARNAME.jar\nHostman.\nHostman is an application hosting provider to host apps in the cloud. \"Minecraft\" is available as a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hostman.com/marketplace/minecraft-server%3Futm_source%3Dfandom%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dminecraft\"&gt;one-click app&lt;/a&gt; package on Hostman. Installation takes about 2 minutes, there's an instruction on how to configure the server and start playing. You can have multiple \"Minecraft\" services on one server. Try a free demo &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hostman.com/marketplace/minecraft-server%3Futm_source%3Dfandom%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dminecraft\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nCloudron.\nCloudron is a platform to self-host apps on your server. \"Minecraft\" is available as a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//cloudron.io/store/net.minecraft.cloudronapp.html\"&gt;one click app&lt;/a&gt; on Cloudron. It comes with a web interface to manage \"Minecraft\" from the browser. You can also have multiple installations of \"Minecraft\" on the same server. You can try a demo &lt;a href=\"https%3A//my.demo.cloudron.io\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (username: cloudron password: cloudron)\nDocker.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.docker.com/\"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; is a free container based platform which helps to isolate instances of a \"Minecraft\" Server from each-other and from the host system. \"Docker and the owner of the repository of the container are not affiliated with Mojang.\"\nGetting docker (for Linux, Mac &amp; Windows).\nRead https://docs.docker.com/install/\nUpdating Docker image.\nFor updating minecraft-server-standalone run \ndocker pull sirplexus/minecraft-server-standalone:latest\nDocker-Minecraft on Synology diskstation.\nNOTE: This is for self-hosted worlds NOT a standalone. You will need to download a server.jar for the official site.\nDocker is an \"Add-on Packages\" on many new Synology Diskstations, and many of them are powerful enough to run at least one Docker \"Minecraft\".\nBefore starting the docker, you need to make a folder containing the version of \"Minecraft\" you would like to play (It has to be named \"server.jar\") and an eula.txt (read about this under \"Common instructions\").\nThe way to setup a \"Minecraft\" server on a Synology Diskstation is to:\nYou will now be able to play \"Minecraft\" on your Synology Diskstation. The IP address it the IP of the Diskstation and the Port number is assigned undet step 5.\nConfiguring the environment.\nWriting a script to launch the server.\nIt's definitely boring to have to remember the command-line options for your server every time you launch it. Luckily, we can write it down in a file and just run that instead.\nOn Windows.\nThe windows version of a script is called a batch file. Create a text file in the folder where you put the jar as \"start.bat\", and then right click it to edit using notepad. Paste the following in:\n@ECHO OFF\njava -Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -jar minecraft_server.jar --nogui\npause\nDouble click the file to start your server. You may get a \"Class_Not_Found\" and ServerGuiConcole error, just ignore these errors\nand you should see your \"Server Thread/INFO\" dialog start the server.\nThe \"pause\" command is there to keep the window open so you can read what happened after the server stops.\nOn macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD.\nAll these systems use a common scripting language called the \"POSIX shell script\" on the command line. Create a text file in the folder where you put the jar as \"start.sh\" and write the following in:\ncd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\"\nexec java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar server.jar --nogui\nNow save the file. Run (or path to wherever you put the script) to make it executable. You can now run the file by double-clicking or by running in the folder (or using a whole path from outside there).\nIf you want to add a pausing part like the Windows example, remove the word, and add a line of to the end. This is useful if you are running the script by double-clicking on the GUI.\nStartup and maintenance script.\nAlternatively, you can manage/automate the startup and shutdown of the \"Minecraft\" server using a script such as the ones listed below:\nPort forwarding.\nPort forwarding is used when you have a router and you wish to let users connect to your server through it. If you wish to host your server for local reasons, it is not required that you do so. \"Keep in mind that port forwarding might cause security risks\".\nWhen port forwarding, it varies on how your router will ask you for the information. If you don't understand on how your router wants you to input the information, try visiting &lt;a href=\"http%3A//portforward.com/\"&gt;PortForward.com&lt;/a&gt; for a tutorial.\nOnce you have managed to locate your router's admin page, and find the Port Forwarding page; hit add new service \"(may not work)\" (if you use Belkin, this can be very difficult to perform) or custom service. When you get a page asking to setup the new rule, it should prompt you on what you want to call it. You may name it as you wish, but for simplicity, name it \"minecraft\". Then, you want to look for \"type\". If \"TCP/UDP\" or \"Both\" isn't an option you will have to create two rules for both protocols. For the ports (internal and external), enter 25565. If it asks for anything else other than output IP (or internal IP, server IP), leave it alone and continue.\nTo find your computer's IP address, use the following steps:\nNow it is time to &lt;a href=\"%23Configuring%20the%20Minecraft%20server\"&gt;configure and connect&lt;/a&gt;.\nSetting up a VPN.\nAn alternate way to set up a server between you and your friends is to set up a VPN (virtual private network). This method may be deemed unrecommended, and an inconvenience for many users due to the fact that all users who wish to connect to the server must download external software in order to join or create server. An alternative to this method is to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Setting%20up%20a%20server%23Port%20forwarding\"&gt;port forward&lt;/a&gt;. A free software utility that can be used to set up a VPN is &lt;a href=\"https%3A//secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/download.aspx\"&gt;Hamachi&lt;/a&gt; by LogMeIn. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//openvpn.net/\"&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; is another (free, open source) alternative that supports most OSes, but is a bit more difficult to configure. Free &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.radmin-vpn.com/\"&gt;Radmin VPN&lt;/a&gt; is another software with no need to register on the website and no limits per the number of users. The free version of Hamachi allows up to 5 connections (i.e. players).\nSetting up Radmin VPN.\nIt is very similar to Hamachi installation.\nConfiguring the Minecraft server.\n {\n \"uuid\": \"\",\n \"name\": \"\",\n \"level\": 4,\n \"bypassesPlayerLimit\": false\n]\nConnecting to the Minecraft server.\nFirewalling, NATs and external IP addresses.\nLocal network dedicated servers.\n\"This only applies to Classic (v0.30) servers.\"\nA common problem for server administrators is the inability to connect to your own server via another machine on your local network. A typical scenario for this is that you have a Classic server running on a dedicated machine, and you have your own machine which you play on. They're both connected to the same router/switch, and have internal IP's with the octets '192.168.x.x'. Normally, connecting via the URL generated for your server will result in an error message claiming that the server is offline.\nTo correct this, you must add a function to the end of your URL, bookmarks, or whatever else you connect by. The function is: ?override=true&lt;br&gt;\nExample: http://www.minecraft.net/classic/play/4c3bebb1a01816acbe31c5ece1570da5?override=true\nPreviously, (before the 1.8 beta and website update) this was &amp;override=true. This caused much confusion since the change was not announced by &lt;a href=\"Mojang\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt;, and wasn't announced on the website applet pages either. Before the update, connecting to your own URL via the website resulted in red text under the applet window saying \"If you can't connect, try \"this link\" instead.\" The link returned the same thing, with the &amp;override=true affixed to the end.\nNote: This situation does not effect Beta servers, and you should be able to connect via an internal or external IP.\nThe SRV record.\n\"Java Edition\" since &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.3.1\"&gt;1.3&lt;/a&gt; also supports using custom ports without requiring the player to type it. This is achieved by using a SRV record (for \"service\") in the DNS. The SRV record tells \"Minecraft\" the actual host and port to use; some DynDNS services and most static DNS services allow you to set it up.\nTo manually verify the SRV record, use (assuming the player-facing domain is \"YOUR.DOMAIN.com\"):\nFAQ (frequently asked questions).\nQ: I have a problem which is not answered in here! What should I do to?\nA: Go to the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/forum/152-server-support/\"&gt;Minecraft Forums&lt;/a&gt; and post your problem there. To help you, they need the following information:\nAnd please, if we were able to help you, post where the problem was exactly and what the fix was for that. Other people will appreciate that (and we will be able to get a grip on the common problems)!\nQ: On a Windows computer, when I double click the batch file it opens a command prompt window, but quickly disappears and the server does not start.\nA: Right-click your .bat program and hit edit; add a new line and type codice_67 save and run the file. If it says invalid path, it is probably due to an incorrect path to java.exe/javaw.exe or your \"Minecraft\" server jar file. You may just need to change codice_68 to codice_69 . Or search your system for java.exe/javaw.exe and adjust the path accordingly. (It's probably under codice_70 or codice_71.) Also, you must have the \"offline\" version of Java installed\u2014not just the Java plug-in for your browser.\nQ: Whenever I try to get the server up, it says \"Failed to bind to port!\".\nA: The most common reason this happens is because you put an IP address in the server-ip field in your server.properties file. If the IP you specify isn't the same as any of your network interfaces, (your wireless or wired IPv4 from ipconfig/ifconfig/ip a) \"Minecraft\" will throw the port binding failure message. By leaving it blank, you let it bind to all interfaces. You will then be able to connect using localhost and people on your wired/wireless network (in the same subnet) can connect using the computers/server's (private) IP address. \nAlternatively, the error can mean that you have tried to use a port that is already in use or that you do not have permission to use (ports &lt; 1024 are privileged and require root/Administrator access to bind to). You can try a different port by changing it in your codice_72 file in this line: codice_73.\nNote: You should avoid using the following ports for your server as some ISPs may block these ports for security reasons and you shouldn't be running the \"Minecraft\" server as root (in the case of a Linux type OS and ports &lt; 1024):\nGenerally avoid any port below number 1024, since those ports are generally referred as and are registered with the IANA for important services.\nQ: I tried to run the server with Solaris/OpenSolaris and got the following error:\n java.io.InterruptedIOException: Operation interrupted \n at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method) \n at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:129) \n at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:182) \n at java.io.FilterInputStream.read(FilterInputStream.java:66) \n at gq.a(SourceFile:131) \n at ji.g(SourceFile:197) \n at ji.c(SourceFile:17) \n at oq.run(SourceFile:84) \n 2011-05-31 16:57:26 [INFO] /:44673 lost connection\nA: For whatever reason, out of all of the operating systems, only Solaris throws that exception when a thread interrupts a connection. A workaround is to change the default behavior on the command line:\n java -Xmx1G -Xms32M -XX:-UseVMInterruptibleIO -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC \\\n -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:ParallelGCThreads=$CPU_COUNT -XX:+AggressiveOpts\\\n -jar minecraft.jar --nogui\nThis instructs Java to use an interruptible IO stack instead of the default IO that is sensitive to interrupted threads.\nQ: When I try to connect to my server this is what it says:\nA: This error is usually caused when the server sends an unrecognized function to the client, which may be caused by using unrecognized server software, unbalanced client / server versions or modifications to the client.\nQ: I cannot break/place any blocks!?\nA: This is most usually caused by interacting with blocks in a protected area. If you are trying to interact near spawn, most likely it has been protected, by the \"Minecraft\" server software; either build away from it or get &lt;a href=\"Operator\"&gt;operator status&lt;/a&gt;.\nQ: My server runs fine, but I cannot connect to it!\nA: This could be caused by a series of issues. Please post a thread using the template provided above.\nQ: How do you give a .jar server more ram?\nA: Change the numbers in the server launch command \"-Xmx1G -Xms1G\". The -Xms part specifies how much memory the server starts with, and the -Xmx part is the maximum amount of memory the server can use.\ncodice_74 = 1GB\ncodice_75 = 2GB\nAnd so on.\nQ: Why is the server CPU constantly at full load?\nA: Some users are experiences full CPU load on the server. This may be caused by the GUI (graphic user interface) window. Run the server with the codice_18 option to disable this window.\nQ: Help! How do you find out your server's IP address?\nA: Read &lt;a href=\"%23Connecting%20to%20the%20Minecraft%20server\"&gt;#Connecting to the Minecraft server&lt;/a&gt;\nQ: I port forwarded and allowed java.exe in my firewall and it's still not working!\nA: Your modem might be acting as a router as well. If you switch ISP's or upgrade your connection to the Internet, you may get issued a modem/router combination (which might explain why it worked in the past).\nYou can verify this by looking for the WAN IP of your router. If it's a private IP, you'll need to log into the modem/router your ISP issued to you, and configure port forwarding to the WAN IP of your router.\nQ: I turned off my firewall on my router/modem how does it still not work???!!! However, port forwarding sites report they can \"see\" me?? What's going on???!!\nA: Turning off your firewall on your router/modem means you essentially disabled port forwarding. Port forwarding is actually a subset of firewall rules. If no rule exists on that port (for example 25565), the firewall will ignore/drop the connection attempt (hence, you get a connection timed out). If there is a rule, it should pass on the connection to whatever computer is configured to receive the initial connection attempt.\nWhen you disable the router/modem firewall and test your public (non RFC 1918) IP address on a port forwarding-checking website, the website will hit your router/modem, and your router/modem will respond, yes you can see me. This is another reason why disabling your firewall is bad; you incorrectly believe that people outside your network can connect to your \"Minecraft\" Server on your computer, when really, they're trying to connect to the router/modem itself. \nTo solve this, the next step is to confirm if your port forwarding (rules) are correct. By Google-ing \"minecraft server checker\" you'll be able to check if you configured your network correctly such that users outside your network running the \"Minecraft\" client can indeed connect to your computer through your router/modem.\n\"Note: You may need to be careful about the \"Minecraft\" Query - It may use layer 4, the transport layer - UDP to query your server. Many Internet and Youtube guides will only tell you to port forward TCP (this guide outlines that you do both).\"\nQ: What is connection timed out and connection refused?\nA: Simply put, connection timed out is when a firewall ignores a connection attempt (ignores the intial connection packet with the SYN flag in the 3-way handshake). Connection refused is when there's no process listening on the port; therefore, the operating system lets the client (in the standard client-server model) know their connection attempt did not work.\nThe default configuration on all Windows computers (the home version) and (just about) all (SOHO) routers is to drop or time out the connections. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//superuser.com/questions/356043/windows-7-firewall-causing-remote-connection-to-time-out-should-refuse-connecti\"&gt;This is called \"stealth mode\" and you can read more about it on superuser.&lt;/a&gt; Here's a brief summary: \"The idea is that refusing a connection instead of timing it out will tell an attacker that there actually is a computer on that IP-Address. With the connection attempt timing out, the hope is that the attacker will ignore the computer.\"\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//serverfault.com/questions/725262/what-causes-the-connection-refused-message\"&gt;You can read more about connection refused on serverfault. &lt;/a&gt;\nSo if your error message is a connection timed out, it's usually a firewall problem - you either need to allow Java in the Windows firewall or port forward. If the error message is a connection refused, perhaps your \"Minecraft\" server has not started properly or you turned off the firewall on your router instead of port forwarding.\nAs always, you can always ask the Minecraft Forum if you are uneasy or unsure about something, particularly if opening the command prompt/terminal and running commands makes you nervous. \nConnection filtered and connection closed is another way of saying timed out and refused, respectively.\nVideo/Alternative Tutorials.\nHere are some other tutorials on how to set up a \"Minecraft\" server:"}

{"id": "40752", "revid": "53745723", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=40752", "title": "Tutorials/Settlement guide", "text": "This tutorial is for building a settlement (i.e. village, town, city). This is different to the \"&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Building%20a%20metropolis\"&gt;Building a Metropolis&lt;/a&gt;\" tutorial, as it is a guide to give you some ideas on how to classify different types of settlements, as well as what goes in each type. Also, it covers other aspects and focuses more on a modern-day setting. \nIntroduction.\nIn Survival mode, it is recommended to build a settlement in flat grounds, like deserts, plains, swamp and savanna biomes, unless extra commitment to terraforming is present.\nTypes of Settlement.\nIn our world, small and big communities have varying structures and features. A small community's appearance depends on how they live. How are you going to dimension your settlement? A preferred settlement is one where a visitor will not have to fly. So they have to walk, ride horses, use an elytra, or travel by railway. This may be a factor when you build your settlement. Additionally, consider if your community is supported by a bigger one, or if it is independent.\nNote: the types this guide mentions are suggestions to help you find inspiration for your settlement. \nIt is best that you choose between three main types of settlements: villages, towns and cities. There are also other types suggested like hamlets, boroughs and conurbations. However, it is up to you how you distinguish them. It is easier to start by building your house. Then, you can build a house for a neighbor, then a neighborhood, then businesses, and gradually expand to a village. This can then expand to become a town and even a city.\nVillage.\nThis is a typical village. They have about five to ten houses, a community house for parties/festivities and a library. Notice that all buildings are connected to the street, but not usually to each other. The streets all connect to a village center, which is a well. These are important characteristics of a village.\nA pre-generated village makes an easy starting point for a settlement. You even have residents that you can farm.\nAs you grow and get inspired while building your village, it is important to add some structure to the road. One method is to form a main street, with good lighting, which runs through the village to the center. Community buildings may face each other in that street. Other streets that branch out from the side may have residential houses connected. This gives the impression of an organized village. These villages have a more unique style and culture (e.g. the way roofs are formed, community \"attractions\", etc.)\nBusiness-wise, small settlements look genuine if it has a market place. If that is not possible, add primitive small shops like bakery, blacksmith, school, and forgery. They should have their respective buildings. In order to establish these, make sure that the village has become \"wealthy\" enough, in terms of village habitants (say 30 people = 9 houses can support these services).\nTown.\nIf you continue to expand your village and make it a town, you might discover that there are so many residents that the distance to the services is too long. Visitors who explore the city by walking may find it easier to navigate if you use all the available space inside the village, while at the same time increase the size of the buildings. One way to do this is by placing the houses together in one building, with 2 - 4 floors. This would essentially be called a \u201c'residential building,\u201d which have the volume of about 4 houses. At this point, the bakery, blacksmith and schools in village do not have to be placed in individual buildings, but in the same building on the first floor. This gives more space for niche markets to appear (wool shop, jewelry, cloth store, meat restaurant, fish restaurant, etc.) in the same building. This would essentially be called a \u201cdepartment store.\u201d Now you have centralized the society and it stimulates activity in the core of the town.\nWhile the community grows, there should be a wider range of services and attractions. As it becomes a primary destination on highways, the need for community services intensifies. It must have dedicated structures for hotels, hospitals, museums, social places.\nThese are important characteristics of a town:\nCity.\nThe city has a lot of resources. It is because it is normally the \"capital\" of a region. The ways to show this is by building vertically through offices and skyscrapers made of materials such as terracotta and glass. It is basically an \"upgraded\" version of a town, and is usually larger. Cities are main hubs for everything. It becomes the attraction and therefore it must offer services most places do not give. To support the inhabitants, it must have at least 30 houses and 5 different commercial services. Otherwise, have at least one of the following: a large religious building, industrial center, or university. In a city like this, you could imagine a scenario where the inhabitants and visitors come to work, on trips, holiday, or to party. They usually have homes in a suburb some distance away. This means you will need a neat collective transit system and well-established roads.\nInstead of continuing to group and centralize the services in a town, the society has probably come to a point where the city itself gets so urbanized, that it needs some arrangement. Perhaps make zones to include residential, commercial, industrial places, etc. respectively. More details about this is in the tutorial for &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Building%20a%20metropolis\"&gt;Building a Metropolis&lt;/a&gt;. Cities are well known throughout the entire continent, and have connections with towns. Capital Cities also contain Government Buildings and maybe even a palace.\nThese are important characteristics of a city provided in this guide\nOther types of Settlement.\nHamlet\nSmaller than a village. A hamlet is simply a small group of houses with little or no commercial services. It may not even be named!\nBorough\nA very large town that doesn't have official city status. It must have at least 30 houses and can have some city characteristics, as well as be part of a larger city, but doesn't meet the requirements to become a city itself.\nConurbation\nMany towns and cities merged into a one really large urban area. Just build at least two or three different towns and/or cities close enough to each other to be seen as one.\nMetropolis\nA massive city with plenty of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. Usually a combination of boroughs.\nChallenge yourself by thinking socioeconomically; how do the resources available (cobblestone, wood, farms, etc.) appear visually on your settlement? You don't have to assess this beforehand. At least, for a visitor, it creates the illusion of a genuine place to be at. This comes naturally in Survival mode, but in creative, it may be a relevant question. Do you build your settlement out of stone, when there is no quarries, mountains, or access to a shaft nearby?\nNaming Your Settlement.\nYou can name your settlement before or after you have begun. \nOne of the easiest cues to names are the associations to the place. Town's and city's names derive from nature, region, other's name or a mix of these. Many places have same suffixes (word added at the end). You can use names from cartoons or video games.\nExamples:\nYou can name your place after it has taken shape so it looks thematically correct. Like if your place use a lot of stone material and have sharp roofs, it may be called \"Rocky Point Village/City/Town\". Ask yourself; why are the Rocky Mountains in North America called Rocky Mountains? \nIf else, look for names of real towns and cities (possibly around your area in real life) or dig through this &lt;a href=\"http%3A//fantasynamegenerators.com/\"&gt;fantasy name generator&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//universalnamegenerator.com/\"&gt;universal name generator&lt;/a&gt;. The fantasy name generator has an enormous name database, having 500 generators for names you could not imagine. Navigate to \"place names\".\nUsing Suffixes.\nYou can use them to mix and match suffixes and prefixes. Here is a list of some suffixes you can fit on the end of the settlement's name with all examples being names of real places in Great Britain.\n -ton (e.g. Northampton)\n -town (e.g. Newtown)\n -don (e.g. London)\n -dale (e.g. Rochdale)\n -ville (e.g. Bourneville)\n -chester (e.g. Manchester)\n -field (e.g. Sheffield)\n -gate (e.g. Ramsgate)\n -burg(h) (e.g. Edinburgh)\n -borough (e.g. Scarborough)\n -market (e.g. Newmarket)\n -port (e.g. Southport)\n -head (e.g. Birkenhead)\n -bridge (e.g. Cambridge)\n -mouth (e.g. Portsmouth)\n -ham (e.g. Nottingham)\n -ford (e.g. Oxford)\n -church (e.g. Whitchurch)\n -bury (e.g. Shrewsbury)\n -bourne (e.g. Eastbourne)\n -wood (e.g. Brentwood)\n -wich (e.g. Norwich)\n -sea (e.g. Swansea)\n -end (e.g. Southend)\nHighways and Route Numbering.\nWhen you expand your settlement, it will need systematic routes and highways for your visitors. Here are some methods, using a sign:\nSo if your visitor travels to your town, and not your city, they need to be able to easily orient themselves and find the correct line or route leading to that place."}

Obviously, these can vary, depending on how detailed you make them. Material collection time counts too!\nNomadic.\nThe easiest type of shelter to build. These are generally the type you would build if you cannot find anything else if you are nomadic or if you're in an emergency. They are fragile and you shouldn't spend too many nights in them. They take a few minutes to make.\nEasy.\nThese structures are a little bigger and more advanced than Nomadic shelters. They offer some basic degree of protection. They may take a bit longer to make than Nomadic shelters.\nMedium.\nThese are freestanding structures, capable of sustaining the player for extended periods. They offer a decent amount of protection. They take 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Measuring%20distance\"&gt;Minecraft days&lt;/a&gt; to make. \nHard.\nThese structures are often large and complicated in design and, as a result, can be time-consuming to make. However, they offer anywhere from a good degree to a great deal of protection. They take anywhere from a few Minecraft days to many days to make. \nExtreme.\nThis category of structures are renowned for being among the most complex and advanced constructions that a survival mode player can afford and take a long time to build and can, therefore, be considered late-game buildings. The protection offered by these building complexes is second to none. They will take longer than Hard shelters and in some cases, you will spend in total a real-world day to create.\nInnovative.\nThese structures focus more on feats of engineering rather than practicality and therefore offer relatively little protection relative to how challenging they are to build and many of them can even be dangerous to live in. They are, however, a sight worth looking at. These will take a varied amount of time to build, so you may not be ready to do these unless you have a large amount of time.\nAddons and renovations.\nWhile not full structures themselves, they are worth mentioning since they can be used to augment existing shelters.\nNomadic.\nGeneral tips.\n\"Nomadic Shelters\" are usually crude, primitive, and simple in design relative to other more advanced shelter types, often being the bare minimum of what qualifies as a shelter. They are, however, cheap and easy to build and can be constructed and set up almost anywhere, making them suitable shelters for use during the first, second and third days of \"Minecraft\", for nomadic players or as an emergency fall-back solution in dire situations.\nDescription.\nThe simplest, yet the fastest possible shelter can be made by digging 3 blocks straight down and then capping off the hole with a block of the player's choosing, like &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; for instance. This requires only a few seconds. While digging straight down like this is never recommended, it is highly unlikely to run into a cave when digging only 3 blocks from the surface. It is relatively safe to expand the shelter from thereon. This type of shelter can be done also when your base is already established, but you are caught by the night while far away from your base. This method is safer than it seems; zombies, skeletons, creepers, endermen and spiders cannot get in. A problem is getting out however; it is a possibility for the player to dig out of the base straight into hostile mobs such as creepers. One way to fix this is to build a little hut above it. This is not permanent; it is advised to seek a more sophisticated shelter after a few nights. Diagram below: To avoid mob spawning when sleeping through the night is impossible due to a lack of wool, one can light up their base using torches.\n&lt;br&gt;\nor you can expand it like this:\nLocation\nOn the ground level in a place with dirt.\nExtras\nBoat Shelter.\nNote: This shelter type will only work properly in Ocean biomes.\nMaterials.\nDescription\nSince most hostile mobs cannot spawn in liquid, it is possible to use a boat to survive your first night (note that drowned can spawn in water). If you are stuck on a small island out in the middle of an ocean with few (if any) resources around, a boat could be your salvation if you can find enough wood for it and the crafting table required in its creation. For this shelter to work properly, you should stay at least 42 blocks away from the beaches at night to prevent any hostile mobs from spotting you. If you need quick food, craft a fishing rod. Your hunger also does not deplete in a boat.\nOperation time:\nIt should preferably not be used longer than 1-3 Minecraft days (unless you like being nomadic).\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\n\"Cocooning\".\nDescription&lt;br&gt;\nLike how a caterpillar surrounds itself with a cocoon in order to undergo metamorphosis, this shelter involves simply surrounding yourself with a certain material to shelter yourself from the dark. \nMaterials&lt;br&gt;\nStructure: (As seen from the ground upwards)\n\"Budget Model\"\n\"Normal Model\"\nNote that the door here is to denote the \"entrance\" (that is, the blocks you break in order to get into and out of the cocoon.\nLocation&lt;br&gt;\nAnywhere\nExtras\n\"Crater Home\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nUse a creeper-made (or TNT-caused) crater or stone basin as a temporary (or permanent, if you want) home. While easy to make, it is not recommended for a long-term stay unless expanded and upgraded.\nLocation\nAnywhere with a crater/basin.\nConstruction\nEither...\nJump into the crater, and begin digging a 2 block high hole in the side (you may dig down 1-2 blocks if the crater is not deep enough) for the opening. Then go in and hollow out a small room inside of that. You may like to dig down a few more rooms, but it is not recommended if you have no lighting. Cover the opening with blocks (dirt or cobblestone works wonders.) \nor...\nIf the crater/basin is small enough and you have enough blocks to allow it, cover the whole crater/basin with a roof made out of dirt, cobblestone, etc., but leave a small entry hole, jump into the crater/basin and block off the hole, then light up the interior. This gives you a slightly more spacious home, but it requires you to have enough blocks to build a roof to cover the whole crater/basin.\nExtras\n\"Tree\".\nMaterials\nGlass, wood logs, leaves, stairs, wood planks, \nDescription\nInside a normal tree. It's a simple shelter and works best for emergencies, since it doesn't have much expansion possibilities in a short time(unless you put down some saplings and connect the trees).\nLocation\nAnywhere with a tree. Or just a sapling and bone meal and enough space.\nConstruction\nBreak the tree trunk and then use the wood logs to pillar jump up quickly until you are completely covered by leaves. Then put the 2 remaining blocks on opposite sides to avoid leaf decay and done, you got a practically perfect shelter that blends with the environment! You can get on top of the tree removing the logs and pillar jumping all the way up.\nExtras\n\"Cliff-side Cave\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nA cliff-side cave is probably the most popular shelter for the first night. It takes only a few seconds to make, and once inside, the creator is safe to expand it. It also offers good protection against most &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (excluding &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s - they can blow up your rock walls). Since it's a structure inside the ground, building material will be gained instead of lost when expanding it.\nLocation\nThe most common location for this shelter is wherever you mined your first &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, simply expand the hole you made to make it livable and, WHAM! you got yourself a cliff-side shelter.\nThe best part of this shelter is that you can build it anywhere there's a cliff. Make sure there's a solid wall (preferably straight up). Mining down does not usually make a good shelter. A cliff by a large body of water is preferred as hostile mobs cannot spawn in the water. Also, try to find a place with coal for torches.\nConstruction\nExtremely simple. Mine a 1\u00d71\u00d72 hole in the wall, then enter the hole and close it off. From there, you may start mining deeper.\nExtras\n\"Village housing\".\nMaterials:&lt;br&gt;\nDescription:\nClaim a village house for yourself and convert it into a home.\nLocation:\nA Village\nConstruction:\nThe first part is the hardest: first, find a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce you find a village, pick a house that you find suitable and claim it as your home, customize and upgrade at your leisure. \nIf you're just trying to spend the night in the village, the plains temple, taiga temple, or one of desert small house (tower house) is usually the best choice, because the door keeps you safe (except that &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s may spawn inside during &lt;a href=\"siege\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;s, or break down the door in hard mode) and because the building has a tower, you can be safe from a surprise &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; attack in the morning. Just before exiting the building, double-check that there is no creeper nearby from the top of the tower. Then go outside and do your things.\nOne major downside is that if the player is within the village during night, this is likely going to attract the attention of zombies which can easily lead to the whole villager population being wiped out over time, due to several different factors. Also, if a player has the &lt;a href=\"bad%20omen\"&gt;bad omen&lt;/a&gt; effect, then a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; can occur in the village and most likely will kill the villagers with the village, due some &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s being able to break or even open doors. \nIf you want to protect the villagers, but do not have enough materials to build a wall around the village and light up the whole area, simply do the following:\nExtras:\nImages\n\"Desert Temple\".\nMaterials\nDescription\n&lt;a href=\"Desert%20Temple\"&gt;Desert Temple&lt;/a&gt;s are not only good shelters, but also contain worthwhile loot such as emeralds, diamonds, gold, iron, and bones, but do look out for the secret chamber with a pressure plate and the 3\u00d73 grid of TNT!\nLocation\nDesert Temple, found exclusively in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; biomes.\nConstruction\nExtras\n\"Pillar (and platform)\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nA pillar of blocks, occupying a 1\u00d71 space with (optionally) a small platform at the top to improve safety. Great when you have lots of one type of non-entity block. Only use a block that is affected by gravity, e.g. sand, gravel; if you want to remove the pillar later on. Remember, do not build a short pillar. We are talking about a cloud-level pillar here. \nLocation\nAnywhere, but preferably a forest biome.\nConstruction\nFirst, equip your block. Then, point at the ground, hold your right mouse button and jump. Repeat until you are at cloud level or any other level that Skeleton arrows cannot reach you. After that, in order to minimize the risk of falling off, build a platform at the top of the pillar and light it up. It's all up to you on what you want to do with the shelter after that. For the Nomadic player, just stay up there until the sun rises. Dismantle the platform (if present) and mine the pillar blocks below you, until you reach ground level. \nREMEMBER: If you are planning on building a real shelter up there, do not build above layer 250 (as the height limit is just above you and could compromise your structure.)\n\"Watchtower\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nAn expanded version of the above pillar and platform, this shelter is now a proper tower, allowing it to be shorter in height without losing protective capability.\nA good shelter should not only protect you from any type of hostile mobs during the night, but also prevent a surprise Creeper ambush in the morning. This shelter type achieves this without the need for sophisticated materials such as glass or doors and can be set up pretty quickly.\nThe design is essentially a tower with a rim for night-time protection, but with some gaps between the tower and rim to see what is going on below in the morning, and have a slash at any assembled hostiles before leaving the shelter.\nLocation\nThis shelter is best suited for wide-open terrain or hilltops.\nConstruction\nStructure: (A seen from the ground upwards)\n\"Open-Air\".\nNot what you think.\nMaterials\nDescription\nSure, it might not stop invading spiders, (\"To stop invading spiders\": Get some extra blocks to go around the top level of your walls. Spiders may climb, but not upside down!), but at least it works for the first night! The Open-Air is basically walls surrounding you. No roof. This can easily transition into a permanent house. Feel free to add a roof after you build the walls, but it won't be an Open-Air any more at that point.\nLocation\nFlat, open ground. \nConstruction\nFirst, gather your dirt and basic necessities. Place your dirt in a (preferably, size is up to you) 5x5 area. Once you've built a 1-layer 'wall', build until you have a 3-layer wall. By this time, it should be sunset. Again, the time will vary, depending on the number of layers on your wall. After you have built your wall, jump down to your 'shelter'. Done! Note that spiders will be able to climb over the walls and enter your shelter, and phantoms will still fly in, but adding a rim will prevent spiders from invading your home. Enjoy your night. \nDon't fill the area! An optional way to do this is to instead dig a pit and dig out the blocks around where the wall is. This way you're gaining materials instead of using them.\nExtras\n\"Mushroom house\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nUsing a red huge mushroom, you can quickly make a tent to spend the night in. When you dismantle the shelter later by mining the mushroom blocks you can get more mushrooms that you can use to make more mushroom houses later, or some &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt; to eat.\nLocation\nPretty much anywhere flat. Or use a mushroom found in a swamp or dark forest biome and skip planting.\nConstruction\nFor a red mushroom tent, make sure there is plenty of flat space around, dig a 1-block deep hole in the ground, plant the mushroom in it, and use bonemeal on it. Be sure to stand only one block away so you will not be suffocated when it grows. Then, put a torch on the stem, and wait until morning, then, dig yourself out. If you do not dig a hole for the mushroom, there is a chance that the mushroom may leave a 1-block high gap that spiders can fit through, or sometimes even a 2-block high gap, just fill it in with dirt.\nFor a brown mushroom tower, just plant the mushroom and fertilize it. No need to dig the hole. Then, pillar jump to the top with dirt or sand, or to make it spider proof, place ladders up the stem and a hatch to stop monsters.\nIf you grow multiple mushrooms on top of each other, you can create a tower - see below.\n\"Mushroom tower\".\nDescription\nFor extra security and visibility, why not make your mushroom into a tower? Stacking both red and brown giant mushrooms can make a great instant landmark/safe haven while traveling (especially in forests or mountainous areas) by growing 3-5 giant mushrooms on top of each other.\nMaterials\nLocation\nA space with nothing above it for 12-15 squares, or the mushroom won't grow.\nConstruction\nWhen it's dark enough, plant a mushroom in a space with nothing above it, use bonemeal to enlarge, put a ladder on the stem, punch one hole at the top of the ladder. Put a square of dirt directly above the stem and repeat earlier steps two to three times. Since nearly any type of block or useful item can be placed on top of a mushroom safely, a brown mushroom can be easily used as a waystation, with torches to prevent enemy spawning and to aid in visibility, beds to sleep in, as well as chests and crafting table/furnaces. The extremely fast process can be used to escape enemies at sundown. Red mushrooms are best used as a visible landmark, but can be expanded using dirt or cobblestone to use as a waystation as well. \nPros and cons\nExtras\n\"Tree Home\".\nNo, not a Tree House. A proper Tree Home.\nMaterials\nDescription\nVery similar to a Mushroom Shelter, only using an Oak or Birch tree instead. Find any regular tree (or grow one by planting a sapling and using bonemeal on it, for larger trees, use 4 saplings in a 2x2 grid), and surround the area around the tree so that the leaves become a roof. Then, mine the log in the center to make space and gain some wood, but leave at LEAST 1 log in the tree to keep the leaves alive. This also has the advantage of telling you the time of day on the \"Fancy\" graphics option and getting you some wood for the first day. Here's how:\nLocation\nPreferably a Forest Biome.\n\"Emergency Treehouse\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nFind a &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; (the bigger the better, but more costly) and pillar jump up on it. This is a great nomadic shelter, as it takes seconds to build and has a nice view of the outdoors and you can shoot monsters down from it. The biggest drawback is the inability to mine, so a cliff-side cave or cave shelter may be preferable.\nLocation\nA &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;, in a tree. Jungle trees can grow to be the tallest trees in the game. Craft some ladders and make your way to the top.\n\"Compact\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nStand where you are right now, and make sure the 5x5 space around you isn't occupied. Right after you check, imagine you are an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;, and place the dirt blocks/planks as if they were &lt;a href=\"Bookshelf\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt;. Repeat this until you have some walls that are 4 blocks high and you used up exactly 60 blocks of material. With your remaining material, build the ceiling. This method gives you a 3x3x3 space- that means you have plenty of space to do a lot, and not big enough for &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation\nAnywhere, but not suitable for rough biomes, such as &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; (mesa) and &lt;a href=\"extreme%20hills\"&gt;extreme hills&lt;/a&gt;. Preferably &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;.\nEasy.\n\"Micro Mansion\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nThe tiniest, yet most useful house.\nLocation\nThis \"Micro Mansion\" can be built anywhere, provided you have a minimum of 5x5 blocks of space.\nConstruction\nExtras\nA &lt;a href=\"blast%20furnace\"&gt;blast furnace&lt;/a&gt; will come useful, same with a &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Treehouse\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nTreehouses provide a high base. They are useful, especially against &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, because most are too high for creeper &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s to reach. They are often used with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s because they are excellent sniping spots. Another advantage of treehouses is that they are a great lookout point. They give you a good view of the map, helping you find the place for your next shelter. Also, if you are thinking of making a treehouse as your permanent home, you could expand it by linking it to other trees, giving the player an extremely large and good lookout view. \nLocation\nThe best tree for this is the Jungle tree. This method of shelter does not only help you stay away from mobs at night- It's a great look-out position, especially if the Jungle borders a Desert or a Plains biome. You can even create bridge gaps from other trees to make a whole network of treehouses! An added bonus also comes with the location- an almost endless supply of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;!\nConstruction\nThe first thing you will build when constructing a treehouse is the &lt;a href=\"stair\"&gt;stair&lt;/a&gt;case. Without a staircase, you cannot reach the treehouse. The amount of stairs you build will vary depending on the height of the tree you are building in. Make these stairs and place them. Remember to place wooden planks under the stairs to support them. (Not only does this make them easier to build, it also makes the staircase look better.)\nNow, you should have a staircase that leads to the top of the tree. Climb this staircase and lay down a 4x5 base of wooden planks. One common practice is to remove a layer of leaves and then, build the base. This maintains the same level as you would have had without a base. \nNext, build a layer of outer walls. These should only cover the border. To be economical, you could skip the corners, as they are not necessary. Build two more layers on each of these. \nNow, you will construct a roof. You don't need to add another border level; this was compensated for in the last step. Instead, fill in the top border with wooden planks. This roof should block out most of the light - look in the \"Extras\" section for ways to counter this.\nAlternate No-Stairs Method\nA more effective and easy method to construct a pathway for access to the treehouse would be to use ladders placed on the trunk of the tree to reach the entrance of the treehouse instead of stairs to access the treehouse which makes it less likely for mobs to climb onto the treehouse and also the benefit of using this method is that it uses fewer materials. It is strongly recommended that you use a trapdoor at the top of the ladders to prevent mobs from gaining access to the treehouse via the ladders.\nAlternate roofless method\nThis method is best in high trees. Simply the same as before, but only build walls one high and then, place fences on top. It is useful when fighting mobs like creepers.\nIf you connect with other trees in a jungle you can make a large circular disk platform around each, allowing large, roofless, and safe \"rooms\". This method is only safe when you have plenty of torches.\nExtras\n\"Igloo\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nNot the strongest tower, but can be done if you live in a snowy &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation\nAny snow &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;\nConstruction\nFirst, get some &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, you'll need a lot of it. Use a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; to get &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s by breaking the snow. After you have collected enough, place them in a 2\u00d72 square in the &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; grid. Get the &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; blocks and build your shelter with them.\nDuring construction, it might start snowing. Note that snow can fall on &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;s, causing a snow layer to form on top.\nThese snow shelters often look great in snow biomes.\nIgloos can also generate naturally. These naturally generating igloos make great shelters, as they always generate with a door and helpful furniture such as a bed, crafting table and furnace, and sometimes even a brewing stand and a chest containing useful items.\nExtras\n\"Portable House\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nDon't want to spend 5 minutes in a hole? Build this mobile fortress that takes 5 minutes to build and 5 minutes to destroy!\nLocation\nA 6\u00d76 or 9\u00d79 flat space\nConstruction\nFirst, build a 1\u00d71 tower 6 blocks up on all the corners. Next, connect each corner together. Now, build the wall and dig a 1\u00d72 hole for the door do \"not\" use windows. Now, fill in the roof, but leave a 2\u00d72 space at a wall for the trapdoors and ladders. Place the ladders under the hole and then, on the roof of the house make some battlements. Now, place the trapdoor and you're done! You now have a mobile fortress that's safe from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and if a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; gets in, you can run down the hatch!\nExtras\n\"Camouflage House\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nA house made out of dirt that blends in with the environment. There are two main versions of this, a house of leaves in a jungle atop a tree, or a base on top of a hill that looks just like the rest of the landscape.\nLocation\nA forest, plains, or jungle &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;.\nConstruction\nUse the dirt to blend in with the environment. Make sure to adjust to elevations. The grass will grow on your roof, so it looks even cooler. For maximum security, conceal your door behind a 1\u00d71\u00d72 stack of dirt and don't add any windows. If you're really ambitious, make a piston door with dirt and sticky pistons. Hide the lever behind a block of dirt. This is perfect in multiplayer as it hides your shelter from griefers and thieves.\nExtras\n\"House\".\nThe expansion to the Open-Air, in detail.\nMaterials\nDescription\nYou've played the game with the walls, now, play it with the roof! A basic house.\nLocation\nFlat, open ground.\nConstruction\nFirst, build a wall, just like the Nomadic Open-Air. After that, close the roof, add windows (smelt the sand with your furnace), and you're set for expansion! If you like, dig your floor and replace it with any block you like.\nExtras\n\"Cave Home\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nA house constructed using a surface cave as its base structure. It can be dangerous due to its initially dark state, but allows for easy expansion. Being a cave, it will contain a mine already within itself.\nLocation\nThis type of house can be built in any surface cave one finds. It is a bonus if you find one with &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; already in it, as you have your supply of torches supplied by your house. A cave with multiple surface entrances can be used, but may prove more difficult to secure.\nConstruction\nOnce you have found a suitable cave, the first step is to seal off the entrances. Use any building material to create a complete seal to keep out night monsters. A wooden door may be added if you have enough wood and time. Otherwise, just seal the entrance off completely (make sure to use torches first, or you may find yourself in the dark) leaving no gaps.\nIf you proceed deeper into your cave, and monsters are found, it would be wise to seal off the rear end of your cave as well. That is unless you are able to deal with the monsters.\nAfter this, you can hollow out the cave to your liking.\nExtras\n\"Outpost\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nA nice house to build. Looks nice when built-in water and lava, if possible. Can also be used as guardhouses/lookout posts. You can also choose to take over a &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and make it homely!\nLocation\nIn a lake (of water OR lava) or simply on the land (high ground is recommended, using as lookout).\nConstruction\nOnce you have found a suitable place to build, start building the fences up from the bottom of the lake on the corners of a 7x7 square, 3 blocks or higher above the ground. Now, start building the actual structure on the 'legs'. This should create a 5x5 interior. Then, Dig a hole in the floor wherever you like and extend a pillar of blocks downward. On those, place ladders and place a trapdoor at the top. Then, do whatever you want with the inside. Don't forget to add some light!\nExtras\n\"Water House\".\nmaterials\nDescription\nA house underwater, where no hostile mobs can get to it. Except for possibly ocean guardians, if you are near an &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20Monument\"&gt;Ocean Monument&lt;/a&gt;... (make sure to not make it so deep that you drown on your way back up!)\nLocation\nIn an ocean, river, or deepish lake, preferably not near an Ocean Monument.\nConstruction\nGo in the water and go about 5 blocks down. Then, mine into the side of the body of water and make a room (you can expand on it later) then, place a door down at the entrance, making an airlock. Then, place a torch down inside. expand on it any way you want to.\nExtras\nYou can use signs in place of the door.\nYou could use &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, or some other light-emitting block in place of the torches in case your house floods.\nMedium.\n\"Desert Shelter\".\nMaybe you ended up there because you got lost, or maybe you wanted to explore. Whatever the reason, you are trapped in a desert and you are in need of shelter for when night falls.\nDay 1 Desert Shelter layout.\nBase square.\nFirst lay out an 11x11 square by digging a 13x13 trench, 2 blocks deep. Dig the square one deep, then go back and dig it 2 deep. \nStart by putting down a marker, then dig one block at the marker, then dig 6 blocks in each direction from the marker. That's the first edge of your square. From the ends of that first trench dig up 12 blocks from each end. Check the lengths are both 13, then join the last side of the trench. \nDigging on a flat section of desert you will collect 93-94 sand digging these trenches. To complete this design you need another 22-23 sand. Getting 128 in total is not a bad number. You should also collect 12 &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, or an absolute minimum of 4. If &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; is available, collect 16 dirt, or an absolute minimum of 12. If dirt is available you need 64 less &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, so don't worry about sand, you will have plenty just from digging the trenches.\nLower walls and pits.\nNow in the center of your 11x11 square, build a 5x5 house. Start the doorway opposite your marker, 3 clear blocks distant. If you are in a hurry skip the corners (as shown). Build the walls 2 high, out of sand. The pits are one deep. They are to stop zombie children coming through your open '&lt;a href=\"window\"&gt;window&lt;/a&gt;s' and '&lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s'. \nThe first level of the house (1 block high) is as below. Leave an open space for the two doorways. Dig small single-block pits beneath where the window openings will go. Dig semi-circular (5-block) pits around the blocks of sand that will form the lower half of the two 'doors'. \nUpper walls.\nThe second level of the house (2 high) is as below. Place cacti on the top half of the two 'doors' (maybe later when you are closing up for the night). Leave a one-block open space for the upper part of each of the doorways and for each of the 'window' openings. \nRoof and lintels.\nThe third level of the house (3 blocks high) is as below. Use &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; for these blocks above the doorways, window openings, and forming the roof, as they need to ignore gravity whenever there is air beneath them. \nIf you did not find dirt, craft some sandstone right away. You can easily create 16 sandstone from the sand you dug out of the trenches. You need a minimum of 12, but 16 is an efficient number (craft 64 &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;) and allows some spare in case you make a mistake. Running out of sandstone can get you killed on your first night!\nRoof defenses.\nIf you have enough time and materials, complete the 4 corners as 4-high &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; pillars (sticking up one block above roof level) and put &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; on the corners.\n \nIf you don't have time or materials to do the corners, don't worry about it, do it the next day. If you have even more time and materials, add a second set of 4 &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, each raised on one block of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; to match the others. This is so they are safe for you to bump into, but not safe for &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s to climb over. \nYou now have a spider-resistant roof that will grow into a semi-lethal spider trap in a day or so.\nInterior finish.\nIt's probably dark by now, so get inside, but you can make some finishing touches on the inside of the house for added safety. Dig down one block in each of the interior corners. This gives you stress-free space to hide if &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s get close, or from ranged attacks. Leave the blocks by the windows and &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s in place so you are able to look out. Leave the one &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; block in the center of the house in place so you can pillar-jump up through your skylight to take a quick, careful look around. \nKeep a few blocks of sand handy in your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; for pillar jumping. And in case you get really freaked out and just want to rest, you can block up the 'window' openings.\nDay 2 and 3.\nIf you develop your shelter by adding an outer ditch (spaced 3 blocks further out), and add denser layers of &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, and finally a pillar to help you navigate home, it will look something like this:\n\"Cobblestone spruce\".\nMaterials\n1 &lt;a href=\"Sapling\"&gt;Spruce sapling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;, 1 Fireproof block.\nDescription\nYou don't use many items to build this shelter, and this shelter is fireproof.\nLocation\nAnywhere where is a small amount of trees nearby and the surface under leaves of the spruce tree is on one layer.\nConstruction\nPlace Spruce sapling (Optional: Use Bonemeal to grow it faster). Place block on top of the spruce tree. Next, place lava on top of that block. Wait for lava to go to surface (you can wait longer than that, as well). Place water on block that you placed in point two. Wait to water change all lava to cobblestone. Take water. Mine 2x1 hole on the wall. Place door in it. Ta-da! shelter finished using 5 items.\n\"Freestanding\".\nMaterials\n64-256 &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;\nDescription\nThese Freestanding shelters are not usually the first shelter that the player builds, because it usually consumes the time fast. These shelters provide good protection against &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation\nYou can build these type of shelters anywhere where there is flat ground. You can also clear out a flat area, but this will consume more time and leave you vulnerable in the night if you don't have your house built in time.\nConstruction\nThe size of the shelter is decided by you, the player. The foundation can be any size you want, but a bigger building will take more time to complete and, hey, the sun doesn't stay in the sky forever! First, make the foundation of the building as wide as you want. Then, you can make a wooden floor, or you can just keep the ground as your floor. Jump and place a block underneath you to make the shelter taller. When your shelter is complete, you can make access to the rooftop, if you like. Placing a door or fence gate at the entrance is important because without one, the aggressive &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; can come inside your house and kill you. Also, make sure your shelter is well lit to avoid mobs spawning inside - the bigger your house is, however, the more torches you need. A &lt;a href=\"lantern\"&gt;lantern&lt;/a&gt; provide slightly more illumination than a torch.\nExtras\n\"GrieferProof Freestanding Protective+\".\nMaterials\nBasically the same as freestanding and many &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;\nDescription\nSame as freestanding, but more protective and can be used as a decoy for &lt;a href=\"griefer\"&gt;griefer&lt;/a&gt;s. This still retains the classic beauty of freestanding shelter. \"If\" you want to make this as your \"permanent\" shelter, consider adding some defense around the house.\nPros\nCons\nLocation\nAn open field or places that can easily attract griefers (for griefers decoy)\nConstruction\nFor the basics, it's the same as the freestanding. For additional protection, place the obsidian as the base wall. Then, cover the outer part with wooden planks or dirt (for attracting griefers to burn it or exploding it). For the inner part, you can either use planks or any other blocks. Don't forget to cover the exposed obsidian as it could alert griefers of your trap or reduce the beauty of your house.\nExtras\n\"Two-Story House\".\nMaterials\nAbout 6 stacks of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; and 28 &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;\nAnd plenty of torches. \nDescription\nA basic two-story house that has a deck. It provides protection, and the bed is on the second floor.\nLocation \nA flat area.\nConstruction\nMake a 6\u00d76 foundation and fill it with wooden planks. Then, make a simple frame for the first floor with wooden planks and cobblestone on the edges of the walls. Add 2\u00d72 holes in the center of each wall for the windows, but leave the front open with a 2\u00d72 hole for the 2 doors. Do the same thing that you did for the first floor, but put a single door on the left side of the front of the house on the second floor. Then, add a 6\u00d73 deck off of the front of the second floor. Add a railing and supports to the deck using fence blocks. Now, make a staircase to the second floor to the right of the door if you're looking at the doors from the inside. Adding torches is obviously recommended. If you want a bigger house, it is highly recommended to build a 7\u00d77. Just follow the steps giving to you earlier.\nExtras\n\"Hollowed-Out Mountain\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nThe title says it all: a mountain, preferably not too big, hollowed out and converted into a shelter! Good protection, as watchtowers and a moat can easily be added after making a basic shelter within the mountain.\nLocation\nA small, freestanding mountain, not part of a large mountain range, preferably 25-40 blocks tall. A good advantage is that as you build, you are gaining material, and not losing. Time: 1\u20132 days.\nConstruction\nFind a mountain that matches the description above. Bring along a pickaxe or two, depending on its size. Hollow out the entire mountain, add a staircase/ladders and some floors, and you are ready to begin customizing!\nExtras\n\"Floating\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nA house that floats in mid-air! Protects greatly, as mobs can't get in and spiders have nothing to climb on. However, it can take a bit longer to start building than freestanding structures, about 1\u20133 days.\nLocation\nA cliff face, preferably over water, is the best place to build the structure. Any large hill is a good starting point (this option is assumed for the construction section). With more work, however, it can be built anywhere, using a staircase or water elevator for access.\nConstruction\nNotes\nYou may have some trouble getting into your house. One thing to make sure of is the door. Since the hinge area is solid even when open, you should jump to the door from the side opposite the hinge. Simply widen the bridge at the end to do so more easily.\nThe area under the pit should ideally have some sort of fall-breaker in case misjudgment of the jump occurs. Once you are confident you can jump it consistently, you can build a mob trap for anything that approaches. Make sure that you can escape it if you DO fall, however.\nExtras:\nThese will be the same as a normal house- except anything to do with the underground. Just build that sort of structure on the area opposite the bridge/stairs.\nEven grass can be brought up with a stair of dirt. Do not use a full stair with lower support, as to prevent intrusion while you wait for the spread. You can also add nether portals for easy transport up and down. If you do, make sure to block it off or hide it so griefers and ghasts can't get to it.\nAlso, when playing multiplayer, cover the outside of the floor with white wool or possibly quartz. People that will look up at it will think that's it's a cloud! And you don't have to worry about griefers! Another way to conceal a sky base is to make it out of chests and trapped chests and place blocks temporarily because chestlike blocks don't render far away from players\n\"Bunker\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nThis is a relatively simple shelter to build, although requires a fair amount of gathering and smelting to obtain all the required materials.\nLocation\nIt can be built on any wide open flat space.\nConstruction\nThe bunker is a single-story shelter made entirely of stone, with the walls always being at least two blocks thick. Size is down to the player's preference, although a 12\u00d712 outer wall perimeter will provide ample space inside for a bed, workbench and multiple chests and furnaces. Ideally, an iron door should be placed on at least two sides of the building, in case a creeper remains to lurk outside one door in the morning. Stone buttons or levers can be used to control the doors both inside and out. With the walls being at least two blocks thick, the player can safely sleep in a bed at night without having to worry about being awoken by hostile mobs. Windows should be added on all sides so the player can be certain that the outside of the shelter is clear before venturing out in the morning.\n\"Underground Bunker\".\nDescription\nA place to hide out and undetectable from above ground mobs and players. Perfect if you need cobble and you gain materials not lose them.\nConstruction \nDig down 12-16 blocks dig out a room. Make an iron door at the entrance or you could build a house above that and make a piston entrance. Anyway, you're free to expand and decorate.\n\"Bunker#2\".\nMaterials\nDescription\nThis is a harder shelter to build, mainly because it requires lots of stone or exploring.\nLocation\nIt can be built on any wide open flat space.\nConstruction\nThe bunker#2 is a single-story shelter made entirely of stone, with the walls always being at least three blocks thick. Size is down to the player's preference, although a 12\u00d712 outer wall perimeter will provide ample space inside for a bed, workbench and multiple chests and furnaces. Ideally, an iron door should be placed on at least two sides of the building, in case a creeper remains to lurk outside one door in the morning. Stone buttons or levers can be used to control the doors both inside and out. With the walls being at least two blocks thick, the player can safely sleep in a bed at night without having to worry about being awoken by hostile mobs. Windows should be added on all sides so the player can be certain that the outside of the shelter is clear before venturing out in the morning. This is especially effective against armies of players, as iron doors and stone bricks are much harder to break, plus, there's the added benefit of having silverfish coming out and attacking the attackers every now and again.\nA good idea would be to put guards on a bunch of these outside your PvP base, with TNT in the tunnels if someone breaks through.\n\"Underground Base\".\nDescription\nIt's a good idea to make you one of these when you spawn because it can protect you from mobs, but you might have to make two stone pickaxes and shovels.\nLocation\nUnderground or in cliffs that are not hollow.\nConstruction\nFind a cliff that meets the above specifications. Dig a 1\u00d72 tunnel 4 blocks deep. Then, make a 7\u00d77 3-block high space here. Put up the door and some torches, and voila! Your cave is pretty much complete. Put all of your basic Minecraft home items on the floor next to the walls. You may also want to replace the ugly dirt and stone in the walls and ceiling with some more aesthetic blocks, like wood or (for a more dungeon-like feel) stone bricks.\nNotes\nYour cave's main weakness is that has only one exit. You may want to dig a 1\u00d72 \"emergency exit\" out of your base, so that you can sneak out if there are creepers patrolling your main one. It's also preferable to mark the base so that it can be seen from far away.\nExtras\n\"Circular Village\".\nThis kind of shelter/village is good on a multiplayer PvP server as it can be defended with a minimum of 3 people with little hassle if you can't defend it, then, you wouldn't be able to defend anything else short of a castle.\nThe one big drawback of this kind of dwelling is that it is highly visible, although it would be possible to create this in an underground cavern.\nMaterials\nIn singleplayer, it is possible to make this out of wood for aesthetic purposes.\nDescription\nLocation\nConstruction\nThis is the center of your village, around it you will construct your other buildings\nThere should be 2 L shaped ones and one straight one so that there are three entrances leading to your central building, like so:\nNotes\nExtras\n\"Fort\".\nA walled base capable of housing multiple players. It is built mostly for defensive values. It basically consists of a wall with buildings attached to it.\nMaterials\n128 to 1000 material of your choice.\nDescription\nA square of the wall with buildings attached to the inside of it. Towers can be put on the corners. Some designs have an open yard near the entrance with no buildings nearby. \nConstruction\nFirst, build a square or rectangle base with blocks. Then, build walls around the edge, leaving room for an exit/entrance. The next step is to plan the shape and build internal buildings, like towers, a bedroom, storeroom, etc. Give easy access to the walls, which should probably be three blocks high, so falling from them won't cause damage.\nIf you make your wall spider proof, make sure that you have a lip every second brick to prevent mobs from sneaking up on you as you leave. Not leaving gaps does have the advantage of making skeletons walk under it, rendering them unable to shoot you from the towers (though they will probably ambush you later).\nExtras\n\"Glass/Cobble House\".\nA nice looking house that stops all mobs and is somewhat easy to build.\nMaterials\nConstruction\nMake an outline of your building that is one block high out of cobble. Then, make studs with the cobble and the glass/glass panes like this: cobblestone, glass, cobblestone. Then, top it off with another layer of cobble. Once that is done, use the wood to make a roof and you are set. You can use the roof however you like, but make sure to prevent spiders from entering.\nNotes\n\"&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt; House\".\nA standard home having many different types.\nMaterials\nDescription\nThese homes depend on what you plan to build. How long they take to build will depend on what you plan to build. These are aesthetically pleasing homes, and don't require too many materials to construct them, depending on what you want of course.\nConstruction\nSee &lt;a href=\"Village/Structure/Blueprints\"&gt;village blueprints&lt;/a&gt; for construction details.\nNotes\n\"Tower House\".\nDescription\nThis is a tower that has several floors and isn't that hard to build, but takes a while to make and requires a good deal of materials.\nMaterials\nConstruction\nBuild a one-block layer of cobblestone or other good flooring material. Make it as big as you want, but smaller is better because it means you won't have to make each floor as big. Next, make four three-high pillars of cobblestone on the corners. Make more pillars if you are paranoid of creepers, but the cobblestone should help absorb the blast in case of creeper attack. Fill in the walls with your wood. If you really don't want any creepers or have too much cobblestone, use that instead. Fill in the top with wood for a ceiling\u2014two blocks high is nice, use slabs if you really want efficiency. Add windows. Use glass panes or iron bars. Repeat this until you reach your desired height.\nNotes\nSneak while you build this! Falling is fatal from the 7th floor or above. The original author died while building the seventh floor.\nJungle trees are quite helpful. You can get nine or ten floors from two trees.\nMake a quarry near this, especially if you are using several cobblestone pillars/cobblestone walls. Make it in the basement if you have a small area to build.\nTry to keep the size down. 8x8 is a nice size.\nAdd-ons\nTreehouse 2.0.\nDescription\nLike the treehouse, but better for surviving in.\nMaterials\nConstruction\nFirst, find a tree. A jungle tree works fine, but it looks better if made in a large oak tree. Then, use wood planks to make a staircase winding around the outside of the tree, so you can jump up blocks all the way up. When you are 4 blocks beneath the top, hollow out an area. If you are doing it on a jungle tree, this step is not necessary. Then, build out as much as you want, replacing the walls, floor, and roof with wood planks. Keep the space open for you to come up the staircase. Keep windows open, and add trapdoors where you enter from the staircase. Add a workbench, furnaces, torches, and a bed to complete your new home.\nNotes\nThis can be expanded upon. Simply build bridges to other trees and repeat this process. This is a good structure for avoiding monsters, but the trapdoors are necessary to keep mobs out.\nAdd - Ons\n\"Cottage\".\nDescription\nA medium-sized cottage.\nMaterials\nConstruction\nExtras\n\"Military House (Blueprint 1)(Incompleted)\".\nDescription\nThis house is from the map \"The Abandoned Military Camp\" from Flans website.\nMaterials\nNot adding until construction finished\nConstruction\nFirst Layer&lt;br&gt;\nHard.\nThese homes are complex and some may combine other shelters with large add-ons, making them different shelters like the ones below. \n\"Underground Shelter\".\nDescription\nThese shelters are built entirely underground, usually at a depth of 15-25 blocks under the surface.\nTools\nAdvantages of Underground Homes\nBuilding an Underground Home has several advantages, especially on &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDisadvantages of Underground Homes\nNecessary Materials\nLocation\nThe entrances to this shelter can be anywhere, but in multiplayer, care should be taken to avoid making your location obvious to griefers or thieves. The top of a mountain, the middle of a desert, or even inside another, well-defended shelter are great locations to place the entrance.\nConstruction\nDig a 2\u00d71 tunnel downwards, placing ladders on the walls every block, and Torches in small alcoves to the side. Once a suitable depth has been reached (20 blocks are recommended, but anything below 10 is acceptable. If you dig below level 16, the shelter will work as your mine.), hollow out a chamber. The size of this room is a matter of preference, but a 5\u00d75\u00d72 space is ideal. Light this area with torches, and your rudimentary shelter is complete. Add-ons can be expansions to the original chamber or separate \"rooms\" of their own. Separate some of the rooms with doors so if a monster does get in, you can hide in another room where you can figure out how to deal with the mobs.\nThis type of shelter can also be easily converted from the player's first shelter, provided it was built in the ground or in the side of a hill or mountain. The player can expand on this shelter, adding extra rooms and increasing the size of the rooms. Extra rooms can include a main hall, kitchen, bedroom and mine.\nExtras\n\"Island Stronghold\".\nDescription\nA large wall and ceiling over an island for lots of protection against mobs, similar to an Irish crannog.\nNecessary Materials\nAbout 100-2000 blocks of any building materials depending on the size of your island.\nLocation\nOn a small-medium island.\nConstruction\nFind a decent size island and get lots of stone. Then, you build a 6-9 block wall with your stone. After you've done this, place torches everywhere over your walls and floor and get rid of them afterward if you need to build. Next, you add your roof and you can live hostile free!\nExtras\n\"Underwater Shelter\".\nDescription \nAn underwater base for total protection from &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and other mobs, along with looking good. \nNecessary Materials\nAny block; preferably &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome form of light, &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, etc. &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;Torch&lt;/a&gt;es cannot be placed on the sides of glass, so be wary when utilizing glass for the walls.\nLocation\nIn a deep lake or in the ocean. Be careful to not build near &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monuments\"&gt;ocean monuments&lt;/a&gt; so that &lt;a href=\"guardians\"&gt;guardians&lt;/a&gt; will not spawn.\nConstruction\nStart by filling the space where you are going to build your house, then dig out the inside. Next, start removing the wall and replacing it with the block of your choice. Then, add your ceiling and replace the water on the top. For added ease build your house underwater out of wood then cover it with any \"non\"-flammable material. Now, dig one block under your house and burn it which will remove all the water. You now have a \"creeper proof\" house (unless it blows up the water without being in it, although this has only been proved with &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;). Make sure the surrounding area is lit up to prevent &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; from spawning.\nExtras\n\"Freestanding - Hard\".\nDescription\nThe freestanding shelter, just bigger and harder to build and also with extra floors.\nNecessary Materials\nLocation\nA large, flat area, with room for expansions, underground or to the side.\nConstruction\nThe size of the shelter is up to the player, however, the bigger your house is the more room you will have for expansion. \n1. Build the foundation of your house one block higher than the ground, so you can make a patio and as an added bonus you don't have to clear out the ground to make a floor.\n2. Next, build your walls 5 blocks high so the ceiling isn't too low, and the windows don't look weird. The house will also feel bigger that way.\n3. Make the ceiling. This means the inside of the house is currently 4 blocks high.\n4. Make any rooms you want (crafting room, brewery, bedroom, etc.).\n5. If you don't want a second floor, you're done! If you do want a second floor, continue on. Punch 1x1 hole in your ceiling. Pillar jump up on to your second floor, but as you keep going up and down you will have to destroy your pillar, so ladders are recommended here. For the second floor, repeat step 2, 3 and 4. If wanted, you can make glass skylights for both the roof and the floor of the 2nd level.\n6. If you don't want an underground floor, you're done! If you do want an underground floor, continue on. Dig down 5 blocks from your floor. Next, hollow out the area you want to use. Dirt and stone don't really make great d\u00e9cor, so wooden planks are the preferred building material. Hollow out the wall and replace it with the planks. You can make entrances to all your expansions here. You may use ladders or stairs to get down to your underground floor.\n7. If you don't want a balcony, you're done! If you do want a balcony, continue on. Go outside your house. Pillar jump to wherever you want to place your balcony. Use cobble or wooden planks. Extend your balcony about 3-5 blocks out. Add a fence and you're done! A nice extra is to put wooden steps and a sign by each side, so it looks like a chair.\nExtras\n\"Ravine Shelter\".\nDescription\nA shelter situated in a ravine. Rooms may either overhang on the side or occupy the entire ravine. These are easier to build if the opening is close to (if not breaking) the surface, and more difficult if deep underground. Sometimes a ravine may spawn above another ravine, so you can use the lower as your shelter, and upper as your farm(s). \nNecessary Materials\nLocation\nIn a Ravine\nConstruction\nIf there is lava on the bottom, freeze it with water. Any water/lava from the sides should be plugged. Make the floor flat, and then light up the ravine with as many torches as you can. Start the walls, and put in the items you want in the rooms (bedroom, craft room, furnace room, storeroom, minecart room). Rooms should be 3 - 4 blocks high (or if you're building a staircase, whichever suits the staircase best), and once all rooms are at the preferred height, build the next floor. Repeat until the house has as many rooms as you need.\nYou may want to seal off caves, but you don't have to smooth the walls. Farms can be easily built on the floor, too. A glass floor would also look interesting.\nExtras\n\"Castle\".\nDescription\nA castle capable of keeping out an army of monsters\nNecessary Materials\nAbout 1000 blocks of your desired block.\nLocation\nA large flat plains, a man-made flat area, or the world type Super-Flat. If needed use map editors, unless playing survival (legit)\nConstruction\nTake the cobblestone and make a 3 block wide, 1 block long, and 1 block high base. Continue across until the length stretches all across your flat area. Then, clear out a 6 block long section for a primary entrance. Make the walls about 20 blocks high and make ladders or stairs leading up. Add an overhang to the walls to keep out spiders. Make shelters and useless buildings inside the walls. This should take about 3-7 nights, depending on size.\nExtras\n\"Stronghold\".\nDescription\nA castle built using a village with enough add-ons to become its own mass shelter. It can house many players and animals.\nNecessary Materials\nLocation\nAny area with an NPC Village. The village will be a part of your home; keep that in mind.\nConstruction\nSurround the village with cobblestone. Be sure to add gatehouses so you can enter and leave your stronghold. Optionally, leave room for some more structures in the village. \nWhen surrounding the village, create a two-layer wall of cobblestone. Make the inner layer one block smaller than the outer layer. This will allow you to snipe mobs outside the castle. \nExtras\n\"Circle Shelter\".\nDescription\nA normal, circle shelter.\nNecessary Materials\nLocation\nA flat area that is over 15\u00d715.\nConstruction\nThe same process as a freestanding shelter, but with the walls formed in a circle instead of a square.\nExtras\n\"Nether Shelter\".\nDescription\nA shelter in the Nether.\nNecessary Materials\nLots of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation\nNether, preferably next to your portal.\nSafe construction\nIt is recommended to build a small shelter before you start any of your construction areas before starting to build your home, to ensure you won't get visited by \"unexpected guests\". If you build in the open, you can`t do this, but if you can you should.\nNether shelter types\nSafest, because you build it safely away from &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s and you are surrounded by walls. Making a Nether &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; home can prove much easier than building a similar home in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; because you won't be attacked by &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. The only mobs you will meet are &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; which will not attack without reason. You should still be careful around them, though. You should also watch out occasional lava pools while digging away.\nDifficult, as you are going to be attacked by &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s. Your walls must be made of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; or any other block with a &lt;a href=\"blast%20resistance\"&gt;blast resistance&lt;/a&gt; of 4.2 or higher. Be prepared to fight at any time, except in peaceful mode.\nThis one is fairly easy - just find a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20fortress\"&gt;Nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful, as fortresses will be hard to traverse. Be sure to clearly mark your designated \"home\" area, or spread your furniture around the entire building. &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;Ghast&lt;/a&gt;s may or may not be a problem, depending on the location. &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20piglin\"&gt;Zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt; won't be an issue unless you attack them first. &lt;a href=\"Magma%20cube\"&gt;Magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s will likely not be too much of a threat.\n Windows \nA &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; cannot see you through glass. Thus, you can build windows in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; as long as you stay inside it is safe, to protect your self and your windows, you might want to use &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s to put some &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; in front of the window, which can be relocated by pressing a button. Allowing yourself to be inside the home safely and have a good view of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. And when you go exploring you \"close\" the window, for in case you get hunted by a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtras\nExtreme.\nThese shelters offer the most amount of protection. Generally large and made out of obsidian combined with many add-ons.\n\"Bunker Alpha\".\nDescription\nThis is a \"very\" large bunker. It should have rooms for almost anything, and have enough space for many large building projects. It is dug almost down to bedrock so, if you build in the right area, there should be no danger of digging to the surface.\nNecessary Materials\nLots of pickaxes, supplies for building traps (such as &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nLocation\nAnywhere that you can dig down easily from. It takes a long time to build, so you should have a pre-existing base.\nConstruction\nFirst, dig a long hallway, with stairs going down 6-10 blocks every 30 blocks or so. Make the hallway big enough, so that lots of people can be in it at one time comfortably. Then, dig rooms off to the sides. If you did this correctly, there should be enough space for a couple of hundred rooms. Make rooms dedicated to various things, like an armory or forge. This base can hold lots of people and is hidden well, so feel free to build it in multiplayer.\nExtras\n\"Ultimate Siege Fort\".\nDescription \nThis is basically a castle, only much, much bigger. Its walls are lined with obsidian so you don't have to worry about creepers.\nNecessary Materials\n\"A lot\" of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; (About 100,000 to 1,000,000 blocks. So don't try to build this unless you have enough for a lifetime.)\nAbout \u2153 as much &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; to line the walls.\nLocation\nSomewhere flat (it is recommended to practice this shelter on super-flat on creative mode).\nConstruction\nTo start it should take up an area of at least a 5x5 chunks. Make walls, they should be at least 7 blocks tall and 3 blocks thick, mine out the middle layer and replace it with obsidian and break the top layer (to prevent unwanted tunneling extend the obsidian layer about 15 blocks into the ground). Next, make the towers, they should be 50 to 250 blocks tall, They should be hollow, but don't forget to line the walls with obsidian. Then, make the roof. Remember it should be about 2/5 wider than the circumference of the tower. Add the spikes. If you've done it right then the towers should look like those of one of the castles you would see on TV. That's just about it, you now have your own ultimate siege fort. You can personalize it in any way you like. Don't forget to light it with &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;. \nExtras\n\"Obsidian base\".\nDescription\nA large house made out of obsidian.\nNecessary materials \nLocation\nForest or jungle biome so the burning trees will increase the defense. Although, rather obviously, this might also be a bad thing, if you have enough materials for this thing, you should be able to survive.\nConstruction\nBuild a large skyscraper about 7\u00d77 blocks wide. Use the leftovers for the walls. Add lava at the walls to kill mobs and to set the trees on fire. Add towers the same as the ones in the ultimate siege fort and add lava to the walls.\nExtras\nPros\nCons\nSuper Extreme.\nThese shelters provide nearly perfect protection. These structures are massive, and have large amounts of add-ons, not recommended for any players who are not willing to spend many days constructing these.\n\"The Obsidian City\".\nThe second hardest and most protective shelter in \"Minecraft\".\nDescription\nA city under one gigantic obsidian shelter.\nNecessary Materials\nLocation\nIf you are able to clear all that land, then build it in a Forest or Tundra biome. Of course, these are only recommendations.\nConstruction\nMark out a plot of land at least 65\u00d765 chunks. It does not necessarily have to be square. (The one the author built was a dome) Then, raise the walls with obsidian at least 30 blocks. Then, add a roof of obsidian. Now, you can add 5 more layers of obsidian. Once you have got that done, install a 5 block high piston-operated door made of obsidian at least 2 blocks thick. Line the inside of the giant obsidian shell with stone and wood. You can build lots of things inside there! Finally, add an obsidian 'fence' about 2 blocks thick around the gigantic structure and put actual fences on top. Make the gate piston operated. Just build whatever you like in there!\nExtras\nPros and Cons\n\"Pros\"\n\"Cons\"\n\"World City\".\nDescription\nMake your own world into one big city. It should only be attempted by pro pros and map makers. \nNecessary materials\nA maniac amount of blocks of your choice\nVillagers\nA world with no mobs\nA couple of real-life months\nExtras\nYour choice\n\"Sky city\".\nDescription\nA giant island with a city on top.\nMaterials\nConstruction\nWith your 100 blocks, build up straight a pillar and go up. When you reach the 100 block mark, build a gigantic circular platform, using about half of your iron blocks. Build skyscrapers and houses with the iron and gold blocks, maybe a palace for you to rest, inns, shacks and huts with planks- and some defense. Now, decorate the houses and the palace, light up the entire city, build a garden and a farm, and enjoy your brand-new, cool-looking sky city.\nExtras\nPros\nCons\nImpossible.\nThese structures take a notoriously long time to build and may be impossible on survival mode. However, they offer perfect protection.\n\"Bedrock Cube\".\nDescription\nA gigantic cube of bedrock that can act as a shield for an inner base. Slits in it can accommodate TNT cannons.\nNote: You cannot obtain bedrock in Survival without commands. Even if you managed to break bedrock using glitches, the bedrock won't drop as an item.\nNecessary materials\nConstruction\nBuild a wall 100 blocks high and down to the bedrock layer. Make the base outline of a square and fill in all gaps with bedrock. Leave slits for TNT cannons. Then, turn the ground below the place where you are going to build the base into a crater and fill with lava before sealing it off. Then, build a column up and form a platform. Then, it's up to you.\nExtras\nThe dome.\nDescription\nThis is a gigantic indestructible dome made out of barrier blocks.\nNote: Barrier cannot be obtain without commands, so this is required to be built in Creative.\nNecessary materials\nConstruction\nFirst, build a massive dome out of barrier. This is difficult and time-consuming. The dome should has the diameter of at least 200 blocks. If you have mods that allow you to build beyond 256 blocks, the dome should has the diameter of 900 blocks. Then build a city (or a village, town, etc). You can also build a castle, palace, mansion under the dome. If you want to expand the dome city (without mods to build beyond world limit), build multiple dome cities, and connect them with roads under bedrock tunnels (so people from outside cannot go inside). Built properly, this could be beautiful and protective.\nExtras\n\"Dimension city for multiplayer\".\nDescription\nIt's basically a base for pro multiplayer pvp/faction server. The idea is to build a city like an entire dimension that contains anything a group of player could ever need in survival. \nYou either build a SUPER HUGE castle, or a SUPER HUGE sky city(most recommended if you have almost an infinite supply blocks), or a SUPER COMPLEX underground structure(easiest). The editor writing it have experience in building, and personally, I like sky cities most.\nCastle:\nMaterials\nConstruction\nBuild an outline for the castle at least 200 blocks wide.\nBuild the wall, at least 50 blocks high, 5 layers thick, at least 1 layer of water/lava and 1 layer of obsidian inside.\nThen build whatever you want inside.\nThen you can scroll down to see the hardest part.\nSky city:\nMaterials\nConstruction\nBuild an outline with obsidian that at least spans 300 blocks, Then use obsidian to build the main structure. Look at an endcity as reference. You can use endstone to do that (Endstone and endstone bricks are the strongest building blocks after obsidian, and they looks good, and you can have an infinite supply of then if gained access to the end outer islands.) \nMake it either looks like a flying platform in the sky or a flying tube system(Build your things inside the tubes.)\nThen scroll down to see the hardest part.\nUnderground\nMaterials\nConstruction\nDig.\nDig.\nDig.\nDig until you have a super upgraded version of a strounghold.\nReinforce the walls with a layer of lava outside a layer of obsidian wall.\nHardest part\nYou know what you can do? Go to youtube and search all sorts of redstone traps. The more, the better.\nIf you have a castle, encircle your wall with landmine and lava mounts, and most important of all: Mob turrets.\ntransporting mobs to a sky base can be very tricky, so before moving any mobs, build several water/minecart elevator systems.\nMake sure to nametag all the mobs(except wither and elder guardian) used in your turret, other wise they will despawn.\nIf you are building underground, everything is not necessary except the elder guardian and the warden turret(still optional). \nIf you have a sky city, then you will need redstone cannons everywhere that are all controlled in a control room.\nTips:(for castle and especially sky city) \nbuild many random glass panes and glass blocks in the sky in a sphere formation. When other players are trying to attack from sky, Most of them will be blocked and even killed by this simple trick as when they are flying at high speed, they won't notice the net in the sky until it's too late to turn. \nIf you are building an underground stronghold, make it as inconspicuous as possible(Best to build them underwater), and build it close to an actual stronghold so you can go to the end easily. \nExtras\nBuild whatever you like, and give a lot spaces to your teams. All 3 above are super strong fortress for multiplayers.\nInnovative Dwellings.\nThese types of dwellings are mostly to impress other players, or are amazingly dangerous to live in.\nDescription\nThis type of shelter can vary in location and security. For example, an innovative dwelling could be located within a double dungeon (with the spawners still there), built into the bottom of an overhang, or above a lava lake! Innovative dwellings are usually much more difficult to live in and build; however, they work with the map and are great for impressing other players.\nLocation\nThe location of this type of shelter can vary drastically, depending on the map, and on the player's preference. \nTypes.\n\"Jungle Treehouse\".\nThis type of house is hard to make, but almost no mobs can get you. First, find a jungle and either pillar up a giant tree or use &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt; (recommended.) Once on top of the tree, just make a house. It's an awesome idea to make bridges to other giant trees, to use either as a great lookout point or as extra rooms for your base inside the leaves of the tree. If you're feeling ambitious and have a lot of time, make a huge treetop village and invite your friends! You can keep adding more and more... the possibilities are endless!\n\"Dungeons\".\nDungeon dwellings require minimal preparation on the part of the player. They are small, and there is also the risk of spawned enemies as well as caverns nearby. Many are located deep underground, so they can be relatively difficult to locate and navigate to. Leaving the spawner in for decoration can serve as the player's death sentence.\nHowever, advantages of this type of home are little setup, free mob drops (if one decides to set up as a mob trap instead), and in multiplayer, difficulty by other players attempting to locate the home.\n\"Overhang Bases\".\nThere are 3 types of overhang base. The first is built into the underside of overhangs of mountains. Unfortunately, suitable overhangs and ones located in scenic or easy-to-defend places can be difficult to find. Building is another problem, as you would either have to pillar upwards to excavate the home or enter from the top and use water to build on the underside of the overhang. &lt;a href=\"Sand\"&gt;Sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; is recommended, as removing pillars made out of these materials is much easier and can be done directly from the ground.\nThe second type is built by making walls that go from the ground to the top of the overhang. You can put in many floors and have tons of stuff. You can also connect it to a hollowed-out mountain for even more space. The third is to find a wall (a ravine, maybe?) and make there your base as an overhang.\nAs difficult as this setup may be, one can use this type of base as a stealthy reconnaissance outpost, by dropping lava, arrows, or even TNT on unsuspecting players or just for viewing epic scenery.\n\"Future/Modern Water Homes\".\nThis is regular on creative, but is actually one of the BEST homes in survival. It looks nice and can be a dome if you are skilled it contains a lot of decoration and space. This is a modular home as well so can expand well.\nYou must make sure to use the base of the dome or cylinder as a walling material and this must be 4-6 blocks high as your lower floor remember to try to sink it into the ground and maybe connect it to a cave for a tunnel/mine. Then, make a walkway with a small hole in the middle to have as a second-floor viewing the water wonders. You can add pistons to part of the lower floor where it's above the ground to exit and do fighting in the water or underwater mining. It also creates lots of clay for you to use and is virtually fully mob-proof as mobs swim so will not be able to attack you and water protects from creepers.\nTime to make: Medium dome 2\u20135 days, large dome 4\u20137 days, supersized dome 2 weeks, Corridors (40 blocks long) 2\u20133 days.\n\"Lava Forts\".\nThese are arguably one of the most difficult bases to build, not only because above ground lakes tend to burn wooden homes down, needing a lot of lava as well as the fact that returning home with a stash of diamonds could quite possibly be riskier than hugging a creeper on Hard difficulty. As the player must use non-flammable materials, such as cobblestone, players may not like how the home would look. \nOn the other hand, the lava can protect against all types of mobs, allow animal spawns, and is relatively easy to spot from a distance during the night-time from a high perch.\n\"IceStone Tower\".\nThis structure makes an interesting-looking tower, but requires a few resources. First, make a sculpture out of ice (the design is your choice) that is about 3\u00d75\u00d79 blocks. Next, encase it in a structure made from non-flammable materials, with a 1-block gap between the ice and the structure, like this:\nMake sure to keep the top open. After the structure is complete, pour lava into the top. After the hissing noises have stopped entirely (3\u20135 minutes), use a bucket to get rid of the lava, tear down the structure, drain the extra water, and decorate your new house! Glass windows and doors are recommended. Try to get inside without breaking any blocks, only ladders.\n\"Mountain Bases\".\nThese bases are some of the toughest to build because they are basically on top of a mountain. You're probably thinking, \"That's easy to build\", but it isn't, because it requires a mountain range or at least two mountains. The idea is you link the two mountains together with 10 block wide bridge, and rooms inside the bridge. That's only the start, to make a proper base you could add a floating island around the base and make it better to look at. It's one of the toughest because it requires a lot of stone. It is suggested that you get 200 saplings and plant them around your base as well as in it. When all this is done it will look amazing and easy to protect from mobs because they fall off the edge of the mountain and plummet to their death, but it will take time to build, it takes a lot longer to build than a lava fort, but there is an easy way. If you clear the top of the mountain and make it flat, it will be easier and you can just build a simple house. Of course, this isn't as safe.\n\"Subterranean Stronghold\".\nThis type of base is hard to conquer (see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Defeating%20a%20stronghold\"&gt;Tutorials/Defeating a stronghold&lt;/a&gt;). One first has to find a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in their world (a difficult task as it is), light up the entire structure, patch any holes made by caves, and then make a safe entrance from the surface. You can also use a cave entrance, but this makes it harder to find when coming home after a long day of exploring. You also must be wary of &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, and be careful not to break any walls. However, once you do conquer the entire Stronghold, nothing can get to you. The main thing to be wary of are creepers waiting outside your exit, wanting to kill you as you foolishly walk up and out.\nExtras\n\"Obsidian Fortress\".\nThis will be a home where you shall never fear external damage. A griefer will never block the entrance with obsidian because the whole house is made of it. Best of all, it will be hidden with 2-4 layers of dirt and stone to cover it. This home will require huge amounts of time, space, materials, and hard work, but in the end, you will have everything you'll have ever wanted.\nThe layout is quite symmetrical except for the entrance. You should find a big hill or mountain to place the entrance. The actual entrance will a 2\u00d71\u00d72 square of stone that will open when the two sideways sticky pistons on either side revert to their normal position. The doors should open on both sides, but the outside switch will be in a 6\u00d71\u00d76 hollow space surrounded by dirt that you will dig through. You then build a 6\u00d725\u00d76 hallway entirely out of obsidian. It should be lit by a torch once every other block on both sides. This will lead to the grand entrance. At the end of the hallway, build an 8\u00d71\u00d78 rim on the blocks in front of where the hallway ended. This will create a big lip around the hallway. Continue building these rims until you finish the 14\u00d71\u00d714 rim. You then pick a corner of the 14\u00d71\u00d714 rim and build another identical rim including the corner of the original 14\u00d71\u00d714 rim. You then build the smaller interior rims just like you did with the first hallway. You'll be going backwards though, so instead of going 8\u00d71\u00d78,10\u00d71\u00d710, etc., you'll be going 12\u00d71\u00d712,10\u00d71\u00d710, etc. until you finish the 6\u00d71\u00d76 rim. Repeat for other two passage entrances until the result is a big square with symmetrical entrances on each side. Put a roof on the big square that is horizontal, not something that sticks out.\nFor the remaining entrances, build a 6\u00d72\u00d71 floor one block lower than the original floor. Make sure it lines up with the inner 6\u00d71\u00d76 rim. This will be the first of 25 \"steps\". The ceiling will also be one block lower than the top layer of the rim as well. The ceiling copies the floor, just 6 blocks higher. Make sure walls match the rim as well. Once the 25 steps are finished, repeat at other passageways.\nAfter finishing the stairways, decide what each one leads to. In the main chamber, find the center and make a 4\u00d74\u00d71 square. Make a hole to bedrock with TNT and build whatever you want down there. If safe way down there is not built, please put signs warning yourself and others to not jump in the hole.\nAdd-ons\nProjects Under Fortress\nMaterials\n\"Self-building house\".\nThis is a house that will build itself perpetually. It will rebuild itself after creeper attacks if the redstone circuits and pistons aren't destroyed. It's a good idea to make the entrance come from underground because doors are hard to keep permanent.\nUse an auto cobblestone generator (those above-ground ones that are piston-powered). Next, make a floating structure for your ceiling (the outermost block must be obsidian so you have an obsidian rim). Next, put upwards pistons on the ground under the obsidian rim. The cobblestone generator should push cobblestone onto the pistons. At the corners, you can either put a piston facing the next side, or another generator. On the area surrounding the wall, you will need a perpetual redstone circuit going to each piston. If the repeaters have the right delay, they should build your house.\n\"Skyscraper\".\nBuilding up has several significant advantages: A skyscraper house can be seen from a long way away, provided it is tall enough. Of course, this can be a mixed blessing in multiplayer, the bad side being griefers can also see it easily. In singleplayer mode, it can serve as a spacious establishment. Besides countless rooms for storage, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; generation (of course, if you do build something this big, you should have a lot of cobblestone), smelting, and such, it allows you to stack up farms in a small area so that all of them will be within chunk update range any time you're home. You can also use the roof, perhaps as a garden, or tree farm (a sufficiently large building can have the tree farm \"inside\"). You can also dig a quarry underneath your skyscraper to replenish &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nIt is important to ensure some practicalities are taken care of. For example, one must ensure the skyscraper's &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Elevators\"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt; allows the player to easily move between floors without taking up too much time\u2014otherwise, it is probably best to just spread your base out horizontally. To do this, it is advised that you either install a water elevator, using &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s to speed the player's ascent and descent, or a fast-acting piston elevator. Make sure a mechanism to stop the player at a floor of their choice is installed.\n\"Miniature Great Wall of China\".\nEven more pointless than a skyscraper, but in multiplayer, it will be ridiculously hard for griefers to destroy it whole, and also ridiculously hard to recover after griefer or creeper attacks. Like in real life and for safety, build it in the mountains biome. First, make a 6\u00d76 tower, then continue on the wall. Every 200 blocks, another tower must be built. You can even use the same technique used in the self-building/rebuilding house to make it even harder to fully destroy! Build until it covers nearly the entire biome if you wish!\n\"Huge Cruise Ship\".\nResources needed:\nExtras:\nAdd-ons.\n\"Forts / Walls\".\nThese are often just normal on-ground homes with walls around them.\nDescription\nThese shelters offer far higher protection, and if there are no dark places on the walls or inside, then, you can roam freely at night without fear of mobs (as long as you are inside the walls), offer a place to attack from, and allows you to build at night.\nLocation\nLarge flat area\nMaterials\nConstruction\nFirst pick a perimeter for the wall so you will have space to build in later on, then build a 1 block high wall there. After that, keep making it higher and higher until you have the desired height. Then, you will build a lip that is at least 1 block over on the top of the wall to prevent &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spider%20jockey\"&gt;spider jockey&lt;/a&gt;s from climbing over.\nExtras\n\"Ports/Harbors\".\nThese are quite obvious additions if you are by the sea, and can be quite useful if you happen to have many bases and mines offshore.\nWatch this video for an example:\nDescription\nThese are built next to water, by a natural sea or possibly a man-made channel, and allow the usage of boats to travel in and out of your base.\nLocation\nVirtually anywhere there is water, most usefully if next to a sea.\nMaterials\nConstruction\nFirst, pick a suitable area on the sea or dig a trench you can sail through and flood it. Once you have a waterfront ready, build as many units for boats as you wish. These are generally 2\u00d72 squares that can be dug into land or built into the water, and usually, have a double door at the front to stop boats from drifting out to sea. Place boats in each of these and make sure you can sail in and out easily. Place wool or stairs at the opposite side of the doors to stop high-speed boats from shattering when they hit the wall. Add storage, dispensers, or anything else you want.\nExtras\n\"Railway System\".\nThis is useful if you have several mines, bases, or other places of interest that are too far away to walk to from your shelter.\nDescription\nThese are built when you've got plenty of resources and you have need of getting somewhere regularly that is at least a few hundred meters away, or you simply don't have the patience to walk there and back.\nMaterials\nConstruction\nFirst, build a booster with three powered rails (for more information, see ). Connect the T switch to the booster and make a water timer. Wire it up to the track switch. When you enter you press a button to activate the timer. You may want to activate the button when you get in and add a wire to the powering torch. Now, make your track and repeat at the other end. If you have a 400-meter track, you'll want a 12-second booster. You may want to build the majority of the track a few blocks above the ground and have heavily-guarded stations to avoid mobs (particularly creepers) damaging it. With this track you'll go 8 meters/second (or 11.3 meters/second, if you're going diagonally), which, depending on the terrain you're traveling through, will make your journey 50-80% shorter.\nExtras\n\"Stable and Horse Path\".\nHorses are a faster alternative to walking.\nDescription\nIt's basically a house for your &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s and a path for them to follow!\nMaterials\nConstruction\nFirst, build a wooden or cobblestone 'hut' with a gate for the horses. Make it at least 8\u00d75. Next, make a path to whatever destination. Make it at least 2 blocks wide and light it! Once you get the &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, you can virtually ride wherever you want!\nExtras"}
{"id": "6875", "revid": "37816397", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6875", "title": "Tutorials/Shelters", "text": "Shelters are created by players to essentially pass the night and fend off mobs. A list of shelter design and tutorials are as follows.\nTypes of shelters to consider.\nGenerally you want to start basic, don't over-exert yourself on the first day!\nGet creative! Build a dock, or a town. It is fine to have useless buildings only for their looks. A collection of small builds can make something far greater than one, big building.\nShelters for the first night.\nHere are some options for a shelter on your first night that can be built with limited resources. \nHole in the wall.\nWhile you were gathering cobblestone and coal on your first day, you most likely dug a small hole in the side of a surface cave, or staircase down through the dirt. In either case, you can use that hole as a shelter. Dig a few more blocks into the hill or cave wall, then you can dig a small room (8\u00d78\u00d73 is the most recommended. It's not too small, but not too big.) Relocate your crafting table and furnace in here, and make sure to light it up!\nYou can place a door across the entrance to your shelter to protect you from mobs, while still giving you access. It is generally recommended to place it from the outside (go outside your shelter and place it while looking inside.)\nIf you don't have wood to spare for a door, simply cover your entrance with dirt or cobblestone when night falls, periodically breaking it to check for daytime (watch out for mobs though!)\nAtop a pillar.\nBuild a tall 1\u00d71 column under you, by &lt;a href=\"pillar%20jumping\"&gt;pillar jumping&lt;/a&gt;: look straight down, jump up, and place one of your blocks in the space you've jumped up from. By doing this repeatedly, you can get high enough above the ground that ground-based mobs are unable to detect you. You can make the pillar out of dirt, wood planks (remember, 4 planks to a log), or even cobblestone, but avoid using sand or gravel to make your tower (see below).\nGoing 10 or 12 blocks up will \"usually\" be enough, 16 is safer (skeleton range), and 20 or 30 is more certain. Zombies can track a player 30 blocks up, but they cannot reach the player. You can also use &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; (holding ) to lean over the edge to place extra blocks as a ledge. Then you can put your crafting table (and soon, your furnace) on the ledge and work overnight. Remember to retrieve them before you come down! You can look around and see what's happening overnight, but try to avoid putting your crosshairs on an enderman.\nIf you haven't slept in 3 or more in-game days, beware of &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s, which can reach you on a pillar. Otherwise, watch out for climbing &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s or even (unlikely) a &lt;a href=\"spider%20jockey\"&gt;spider jockey&lt;/a&gt;. To fend off spiders, you can break one of the blocks below your top block, or build a lip around the block you're standing on. You do either of these by crouching as above, and placing or breaking blocks. You will not fall unless you let go of the shift key while leaning over the edge\u2026 or unless you are attacked, so don't do this if a spider is actually getting close to you (or if your tower is under 20 blocks and a skeleton is at the base). If a spider does climb the pillar, they're fairly unlikely to actually reach you, but, just in case, keep your stone sword in hand and whack them as soon as they come into reach, \"before\" they get up to you. (Attacking them will knock them down, causing them to take damage from the fall.)\nOnce it is light enough, and the undead have burned, simply dig out the blocks you're perched upon, until you're back on the ground. (Check for nearby creepers and other monsters first!) \"Don't\" just jump off your tower unless there's water below you \u2013 if you're high enough to avoid mob detection then you're high enough to take damage if you jump, or even die if you're 22 blocks or more up. Also keep an eye out for spiders, which can meet you halfway and knock you off the tower. If a creeper is hanging out at the base of your pillar, and you have more blocks, try going even higher\u201430, 40 blocks, or even up to cloud level. This makes monsters on the ground despawn far more quickly (because they are now farther away from you).\nDo not use sand or gravel, because unlike most blocks, they are affected by gravity. You can't place a ledge with them, as they fall to the ground. (However, you can put a dirt block on the side of a sand pillar, and that will stay up even if the pillar doesn't. In particular, \"if\" a creeper does notice you, and blows up at the bottom of your pillar, the rest of sand you're standing on will fall closer to the ground, taking you with it\u2026 and apparently, you were \"already\" low enough for monsters to notice you. (Also, a passing enderman might pull a block out of your pillar.) If you're really stuck and \"only\" have sand or gravel, make the pillar extra-tall, at least 20 blocks.\nIf you are in a desert with only sand and cacti all around, and have no other blocks available, don't use cacti (they'll kill you). If you have time, try to gather a \"lot\" of sand to make &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;. If you got at least 40 or 50 sand (a full stack of 64 is better) by nightfall, you can make enough sandstone for a pillar, even without your crafting table: Press E for your inventory and crafting window, divide the sand among all four boxes of your crafting grid, and take the sandstone. (Use your pickaxe to take down the tower in the morning.) Unfortunately, you need 4 sand to get each block of sandstone.\nUp a tree.\nFind a single large tree and use dirt (or another non-valuable resource) to pillar up to top and stay up there until day arrives. Jungle, tall spruce, and large oak trees are recommended. Mobs will not spot you if it is a large enough tree, and if they do, just take evasive action and move to the other side of the tree. Spiders could give you a problem, but hopefully, they won't see you. If the leaf canopy is big enough, you can actually dig up \"into\" the leaves, where monsters can't reach you. If all else fails, jump between treetops. When night's over, you can chop down the tree. Take care not to chop it down before you are done using it as a shelter, or the leaves may start to disappear, leaving you with nowhere to stand.\nThree block high hut.\nBy making four three block high walls around you, you can simply hide from most mobs. Adding a roof (at the third block, that is 2 blocks high inside) protects against endermen (which can't fit) and spiders, which can otherwise climb the walls. You can make this out of almost anything\u2014cobblestone is more secure, you can use wood planks if you have enough, but even dirt will do in a pinch. You need 13 blocks as a bare minimum (four 3-block high pillars around a 1\u00d71 refuge), but two or three times that, or even a whole stack of 64, lets you build something you can actually move around in, and do some crafting and smelting overnight. (Note that you can use the crafting table and/or furnace as part of the walls.) Keep a block or few in your inventory as spares, in case of enderman theft (see below). You have two main risks: One is &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, which can both sense you through the walls, and \"climb\" the walls. However, they can't fit through small holes, and if you make a roof with only a one-block hole, spiders can't get through (but you can still tell when day returns). The other hazard is if an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; wanders by and takes a block out of your shelter. Wait for the enderman to wander away a bit, then replace the block, with one of your spares, if possible without letting your cursor cross the enderman (\u201clooking at them\u201d). When full daylight comes, mine a door in your wall, and exit. Keep a wary eye out for monsters, and in particular be prepared to run quickly away from creepers.\nIn a cave.\nIf you found a cave system you can fix it up into a lair\u2014a good one can make a base for the rest of your game. If it ends quickly, then cap off your entrance. If it does not end, then build a little shelter around you by capping off any extra exits or openings into the depths. Don't worry too much about the natural walls of the cave; monsters can still be heard through the walls pretty loudly, but they can't come through unless you leave an opening. \nTo block the cave off, for your first night you can use walls of dirt or cobblestone similarly to the \"hole in the wall\". If you have enough wood, you may be able to craft &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt; and place them across the entrance \"and\" any openings in back. Make sure you place the walls or fences behind the upper lip of the cave (or extend the ceiling over the barrier), or monsters are liable to \"drop in\" inside your barrier. Also, remember to light the area before you settle down. Likewise, remove any stray blocks, within two spaces outside the fence, from which monster could jump onto the fence (try the jump yourself). If using fences, also make sure you can retreat into the cave and away from the entrance (out of sight \"or\" 16 blocks away), or a creeper may drop by and just wait for you to come out. Later, you can be more sophisticated about sealing off and fortifying your lair.\nAs with \"Hole in the wall\", you can dig into the cave's wall while waiting for dawn, but keep some blocks handy to patch up any openings you might make into another cave while digging, which might have a hostile mob in it. If you place your &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; one of your hotbar slots (used to navigate quickly between items you are carrying in your inventory) and e.g. dirt is placed right next to it, you can quickly switch between your tool and that block type in order to close the hole you just made. This can be extremely handy when you stumble upon an opening which contains mobs.\nHill Fort.\nJust like cave systems and bunkers and Castle tower.\nHill forts are forts that can be made by strong or earth-made materials such as dirt or stone. Unlike castle or an outpost tower,hill forts have better defenses and you can create your own cave system for hidden base and hidden storage for your important stuff. You can also create your bunker directly within the fort or near the fort. Hill forts are better for PvP bases and raid farming since you can hide magma blocks under a trapdoor and make a lava flow. \nFor starter Hill fort, you can just make it out of dirt or any earth-made materials like sand and gravel. \nFor easy Hill fort, it will be made out of any wooden materials like oak log and oak planks. \nFor normal Hill fort, this can be made with any stone materials such as cobblestone and smooth stone. You can also install defenses using magma blocks and deep hill moat. \nFor hard Hill fort, it will be made out of obsidian so nobody could destroy it easily. You can install deadly traps such as night activating lava trap. \nFor advanced and intense Hill fort, it's still can be made with obsidian but with new cave system and maze system so raiders can't find you or your loot easily. \nAnyway, you can install any traps even if you're still starter. Cave systems and maze can be done two even when you are still in starter fort. Forts are amazing in raid farming since you can install traps in it to kill raiders (except vexes).\nOut to sea.\nIf you are near an ocean, you can make a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; (see that page for the recipe) and sail out to where you can barely see land (in any direction). If you can't make a boat, just swim out to the sea, holding the space bar all night to keep yourself afloat. Either way, you won't be getting any crafting or smelting done. Note that drowned can board your boat and cause damage, so getting to land and building a shelter is preferable.\nBreak the golden rule.\nWhen you're desperate, you can break the golden rule of minecraft (\"Don't dig straight down\"). Dig three blocks down, and put a block above you that is not sand/gravel. Congrats, you just made the fastest shelter in \"Minecraft\" possible. Since you probably don't have an in-game &lt;a href=\"clock\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt; yet, you may want to use a real-world clock to time the night (7 minutes, with up to 3 more to allow for dawn/dusk). If you have dirt or stone next to you, you can dig out a couple of blocks there, and place your crafting table and furnace. Sometimes keep the hole in the ground as a base. A torch makes your little hidey hole feel a little less like a tomb.\nVertical hidey hole.\nThis design allows you to see what is going on every time you come out, but it does require a bit of extra wood.\nOnce you reach &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, you can mine some of the stone, craft a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, make &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, and craft &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nThe next morning, check for mobs, particularly &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s, as you climb out.\nBlocks to use.\nThese materials are good because they are:\nIf you want a certain theme, such as &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, certain materials such as &lt;a href=\"Nether%20bricks\"&gt;Nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"End%20stone\"&gt;End stone&lt;/a&gt; from those dimensions can be used.\nIf you're in Creative or have easy access to &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; often looks nice, and you do not need torches. Use it for a greenhouse look, or just if you like the sunshine.\nCore rooms.\nThere are several things that are useful to include in your house in \"Minecraft\". \nFoyer.\nEvery house should have a main room with an entrance from the outside. You may wish to include a bed, a furnace, and a crafting table in this room. It would be convenient to connect all hallways or separate rooms to this room. Some tools, weapons, armor, and/or food stored in a chest can be useful, as then you can gather up some essential supplies quickly when coming to your home for a quick resupply.\nCrafting room.\nThis room is helpful to the player when crafting items. A crafting room may include a crafting table, at least one furnace, and a sufficient number of chests containing common crafting materials found while mining or exploring, such as &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any other materials that may be useful while crafting, such as &lt;a href=\"sticks\"&gt;sticks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt;. Labeling the chests will help to organize. There should be quick access to the storage room from here. Wood would be a nice material to use as it suits the theme.\nSmelting room.\nThis room is important if you are a big miner and/or adventurer as you can &lt;a href=\"smelt\"&gt;smelt&lt;/a&gt; large numbers of &lt;a href=\"ores\"&gt;ores&lt;/a&gt; quickly. Make a large room and line the walls with &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, possibly keeping a chest of &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt; inside as well (A bucket of lava is good too. It can smelt 100 items and also is a good source of light.). The benefit of having multiple furnaces is a faster overall smelting time, since each furnace is able to run independently. Having each furnace full of said fuel is also helpful. This room could easily be merged with the Crafting Room, and it may be most convenient to do so. Also, bear in mind that you can use &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s if you wish to automate your smelting operations.\nStorage room.\nA room full of &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s for storing all of the &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and other less-valuable materials that accumulates in your inventory while mining. You can also make a lava 'bin' to dispose of your unwanted items; this can be done by simply digging a hole (don't use wood etc. near it - the lava will ignite flammable blocks) and filling it with lava. You may also build another store room, with a guarded and hidden entrance though this store room is usually filled with more valuable and rare materials, i.e. &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, etc. Perhaps you even want to include a trapped room with trapped chests and &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, if you are in PVP.\nEntrance to your mine.\nIt's generally a good idea to put the entrance to your mine inside your shelter, simply so that if you return at night you won't encounter &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. It's probably a good idea to make sure your mine is well lit by &lt;a href=\"torches\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, redstone lamps, or &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;. If playing in a mode besides peaceful, you should put a door so &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; do not get in (use &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt;s when on hard - zombies on that difficulty can damage &lt;a href=\"wooden%20door\"&gt;wooden door&lt;/a&gt;s to the point of breaking). &lt;a href=\"Button\"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;s are useful for any barrier only opened by &lt;a href=\"Redstone\"&gt;Redstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nBedroom.\nSleeping in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; resets your spawn point to that bed. It's a pretty good idea to have this in a secure bunker. It's also a good idea to keep this room far from the outdoors, so a mob cannot prevent you from sleeping or blow up your bed. For added safety against &lt;a href=\"creepers\"&gt;creepers&lt;/a&gt; creeping up on you or PVP griefers in your sleep, use three-layered walls, with the middle one being &lt;a href=\"Obsidian\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrewery.\nOnce you've been to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and gathered some &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s, you can create a Brewery, which is simply a room with a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; (however an infinite water source works just the same and doesn't run out). It is great to be able to brew some &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s to prepare yourself for leaving your base. Include a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with some potion ingredients such as &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blaze%20powder\"&gt;blaze powder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spider%20eye\"&gt;spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fermented%20spider%20eye\"&gt;fermented spider eye&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glass%20bottle\"&gt;glass bottle&lt;/a&gt;s and a well as it is an unlimited water supply.\nPositive Effect Potions and an example of a brewery can be found, at the &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt; page.\nEnchanting room.\nAfter gathering some &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; (to make a book),you can build an &lt;a href=\"Enchantment%20Table\"&gt;Enchantment Table&lt;/a&gt;. This lets you enchant your items (See &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; for help on design), and since &lt;a href=\"bookshelves\"&gt;bookshelves&lt;/a&gt; give you higher level enchantments, this room could also be a good use for your &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;. It's also a good idea to keep this room close to your mob grinder for easily regaining your xp and to keep a chest with books in this room to enchant them and, of course, store &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFarm.\nYou need a source of food readily accessible from your shelter. &lt;a href=\"Wheat\"&gt;Wheat&lt;/a&gt; seeds are the easiest food to get, so start with them. Later, you can plant other crops, like &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s. The aforementioned crops can also be used to breed certain &lt;a href=\"Mobs%23Passive%20Mobs\"&gt;passive mobs&lt;/a&gt; for more effective food. You can also grow pumpkins, which are obtained from dungeon chests and/or found in the wilderness (Usually taigas, extreme hills, and forests). Melons seeds found in dungeon chests aren't a good source of food, but can be good for potions, via glistering melons. &lt;a href=\"Beetroot\"&gt;Beetroot&lt;/a&gt; seeds are also a choice, although you need to find a village or visit the End or get beetroot seeds which are obtained from dungeon chests first. \nLater in game, you may also want to build farms for other plants, such as sugarcane, cactus or chorus fruit, or even flowers and tall grass (details explained in the Expansions section).\nNursery/arboretum (tree farm).\nEventually, you will use up all the trees in your immediate surroundings, so you will want to replant them with saplings. Keep it well lit, both to keep away mobs and speed up the growth of trees. Birch is recommended, because it grows fastest, but oak and jungle trees are also a good choice, due to their &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s and immense size respectively. It is difficult to build an indoors or underground tree farm that will supply your wood needs, unless you use bone meal or keep it well lit. Create a room that is bigger than trees.\nArmory.\nAn armory is a room near the front door with &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s containing food, armor; and weapons, this is for easy access when you are going outside, and so you can quickly prepare yourself to explore and collect items. For an even faster alternative, this room consists of a number of &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, activated by a single button or &lt;a href=\"Pressure%20Plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, providing the adventurous player a way to get started immediately. This is useful for exploring dangerous caves and going on night expeditions.\nSmithing room.\nAfter building an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to make a room with a crafting table, a smithing table, a chest, easy access to an enchanting room, and of course the anvil. Handy if you fight monsters or other players a lot.\nNether portal room.\nOnce you have at least 10 &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, either from mining it in a cavern or obtaining it through &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; farming you can build a nether &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;. Once built, activate it with a &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, and you can travel to the &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;. This can be used for fast travel and for getting &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;Soul Sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20quartz%20ore\"&gt;Nether quartz ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;. Beware of &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20pigmen\"&gt;zombie pigmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s as well as &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s. Building another nether portal room in the nether for protection is a recommended idea. Please note cobblestone is a good block to build with in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; since ghasts can't destroy it with their fireballs.\nNote: the player can potentially create a cabin with all of these.\nExpansions.\nThese projects, while not entirely mandatory, make your base more useful and interesting.\nTrading Hall.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Villager%20trading%20hall\"&gt;Trading Hall&lt;/a&gt; is a location to gather villagers to trade with. This is the type of thing an advanced player with a lot of time on their hands, or a bored Creative player, would do. With a few farms, these can make perfect equipment and food with just a bit of time. \nKitchen.\nThis is basically a crafting room, but you only craft food. The chest(s) should contain most basic foods, including wheat, milk, eggs, etc. Many people, instead of having a kitchen, just craft food in the crafting room, but a kitchen is a nice expansion, because it separates crafting materials so that you don't fill your crafting room's chests with wheat instead of wood. You could also add a smoker if you want.\nThis is basically an expansion of a kitchen. You could build this and a kitchen, and just connect them. You would use this to make &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20pie\"&gt;pumpkin pie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;. Place a crafting table, chest, and, if you want, a display table for cakes. If you want to make a large amount of cakes, make a cake farm under or near the bakery.\nThis is also an expansion of a kitchen. Make sure that they are categorized so you don't get mixed up. You can use a chest or dispenser to use everything in them. Put some cooked meat, bread, cookies, cakes and melons in them.\nNote: If you are using a dispenser, you need to activate it with a redstone signal.\nControl room.\nThis is a common room to find in most advanced player's houses, but only if said advanced player uses a lot of redstone in their builds. It controls all of the redstone devices a player has and usually consists of:\nMaze.\nThis is mainly for if you get bored. It's quite simple and obvious how to build and use.\nMob XP farm/drop collector.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20grinder\"&gt;experience farm&lt;/a&gt; uses water currents to push most mobs into a central area. With mobs in the nether, pistons are used. Use a piston crusher or a long drop to get the mobs to a \u00bd heart. Mobs can be killed by hand or with a splash potion of harming (Healing for undead mobs) to get XP. Note: This is more efficient with multiple spawners, as more spawners mean more spawning opportunities. You also obtain drops from each mob killed. This can also be done with large dark rooms with platforms. The mobs spawn and fall into water currents, where you can choose what happens to them once they are out of the spawning chamber.\nRebuilding wall.\nIf for some reason you want to have a wall that you can\u2019t get rid of, you can make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone generator&lt;/a&gt;, and make pistons push the &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; (which reforms) up into the wall, unless there are no missing blocks in it. Look at Sethbling's channel for more information or Mumbo Jumbo's indestructible wall V2\nIn-Shelter Teleporter Room.\nIf you have Cheats enabled, you can create a room that teleports you to other rooms in your shelter. you will need &lt;a href=\"command%20blocks\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt; and basic knowledge of using &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; to make the room. A non-cheat method is to build an ender pearl stasis chamber, which can teleport you to any room. Note: This will require ender pearls so you need an enderman farm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_ngko21ZmQ\nRedstone lab.\nA laboratory is a large, clear, secure area where you can safely test designs without distractions. When building large redstone projects with complicated parts, it can save you time and effort if you test the ideas first. However, it's often best to test ideas in creative mode and implement them in survival.\nCake factory.\nA cake factory simply provides the avenue to quickly produce cake by having the necessary ingredients nearby and produced in a close area, most commonly in one large factory type building. To make a cake factory, make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Wheat%20farming\"&gt;Wheat Farm&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Sugar%20Cane%20farming\"&gt;Sugar Cane Farm&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Egg%20Farming\"&gt;Egg Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt; in a cage (make the cage so you can &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; the cow.). Place a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have enough materials from the farms, start making &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;s. This is a good thing to put under/next to a dining hall in &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nPath/road.\nConsider building a road or a path between your buildings or to the nearest village. Remember to keep it well lit so no mobs spawn! A good material is .\nCobblestone generator.\nA cobblestone generator provides a safe and convenient way to gather cobblestone. They typically involve mixing water and lava.\nBunker.\nSometimes called a panic room, a Bunker is a small room made of strong materials (obsidian for example) with an iron &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt; with the open/close system inside the room. This room must have a bed, a crafting table, a furnace and also a chest with the basic materials (food, tools, armor and weapons are a must). It also has to have a high interior luminosity to avoid monsters spawning inside. It should also be only two blocks tall so &lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; can't teleport inside.\nPanic room.\nA panic room is a place meant just for fun, where you put the entrance somewhere where you wouldn't go looking for another room, e.g. the drain in a shower because if using a trapdoor for the drain you can open it.\nScout tower.\nA cheap and safe way to survey the land. Note that these are mostly obsoleted by &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;s, should you have the resources to make them, although a map doesn't tell you if there are any aggressive mobs. Remember to keep a spyglass at the top!\nSeed and flower farm.\nYou can have a fully-automatic flower and seed farm with just a bit of Redstone and tons of &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;! Have an 8\u00d78 area of grass with some &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s at the end. Then, place a row dispensers at the back, facing the grass, and put buckets of water in them. Hook up some Redstone from a BUD switch at the end and delay with Repeaters. Attach another line of Redstone and hook it up to Dispensers, under the Grass and filled with bone meal while facing the Grass on top. If you do it right, automatic block updates should cause grass and flowers to grow and immediately be destroyed by the water flow and be carried along the stream and have the water automatically get sucked in. XisumaVoid made a good tutorial.\nBeacon/lighthouse.\nA tall tower with some sort of light source on the top means that you can see your base from a long distance away. Handy if you go exploring a lot, your spawn point is a long way from your base, or you have not made a bed yet.\nBeacon room.\nMake this room by digging a 6\u00d76\u00d76 hole and building the base pyramid out of your selected material (Iron is cheapest unless you have a Trading Hall, but you can also use Netherite, Diamonds, Emeralds and Gold). Also, you could put in a few chests with &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28disambiguation%29\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netherite\"&gt;Netherite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and/or make it look like an altar.\nGarage.\nIf you like cars, then you might want to build a garage. A garage is just a big room with enough space to build some cars and a garage door at one end so you can drive your cars outside. Some garages are really big and have lots of decorations, like workshops, car lifts, or crazy things like waterfalls or a secret underground garage. When you have finished your garage, remember to build a few cars to fill up the garage.\nKennel/pet area.\nIf you have tamed a lot of wolves, a kennel is a good place to keep them. A simple shed-like structure will suffice, but be sure to keep it well lit for the dogs' safety. A pet area is similar to a kennel, but keeps dogs \"and\" cats. For a more realistic feel, separate them.\nWell.\nA renewable water source is useful for a variety of projects. Put water in a 1\u00d73 ditch and you can take water repeatedly from the center! For a more aesthetically pleasing pool, a 2\u00d72 well works as well, and you can take water from any of the squares.\nMushroom farm.\nA big room with flat floor for growing &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s. You can light your farm by &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, placed on ceiling, to prevent &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; from appearing. Just make sure that there are no places on the floor where the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level is greater than 12. If you have the material, &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20torches\"&gt;Redstone torches&lt;/a&gt; are good for this. More about this can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mushroom%20farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Mushroom farming&lt;/a&gt; page. Alternatively, find a small &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; or make one, put some &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s inside and completely seal it off without &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es and check on it/clean it out. Also provides the drops from hostile &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;.\nSugar cane and cactus farms.\nEasier to manage but somewhat less useful than the above two projects, farming &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; underground requires little effort. A cactus farm requires &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; to grow, and &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; needs to be properly irrigated with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; within one block of it. If you don't want to spend lots of time harvesting your cactus, place a three-block-tall pillar next to where you want your cactus (See &lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt; for more info).\nIndoor animal farm.\nLight up a large area with a &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; floor. Then put two of the same kind of passive &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., two &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s or two &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s) inside. You can then &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; them together and you can gather &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pork\"&gt;pork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beef\"&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"raw%20chicken\"&gt;raw chicken&lt;/a&gt; safely. You might want to put trees inside so the animals feel more comfortable, or, if you're really ambitious, build a man-made forest.\nPond.\nThis is easy to make, and can be useful, especially if you don't have a &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; farm yet. Just make a hole long enough to cast your &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;, around 8 blocks long and at least 2 blocks deep, and fill it with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\nMusic room.\nA room filled with &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to enjoy melodies. This can be made with or without &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLibrary.\nNot only is it a great use for any excess &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, a library can also add a bit of class to your home. Can double as an &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; room.\nMinecart hub.\nIf you have active mines scattered over the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s to haul your stuff back to your base, dig out a universal stopping point under your base. Or, you could actually make a rail road hub outside or connected to your base.\nMinecart chest system.\nAfter a lot of days in \"Minecraft\", you will soon have the ability to automate everything (&lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.). The most useful automation you can make is a minecart chest system. You can simply craft &lt;a href=\"minecarts%20with%20chests\"&gt;minecarts with chests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s, and some rails, and you can make a system to send your ores from your mine to your base,\nGravel-to-flint room.\nOnce you have many stacks of &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, it can be useful to convert most (leave some for mining) of your &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt;. This is just a big empty room (a 4\u00d74\u00d74 space holds a stack of blocks), which you fill with gravel, before destroying the gravel, getting some flint in the process. It is most efficient to do this 10 - 15 times for every 20 stacks, though about 5 for 10 stacks, and 30 for 50 or so stacks. This room may include a chest with shovels, as well as ingredients and a crafting table for quick production of arrows, and flint and steel. \nThis is somewhat redundent, since a Fletcher can trade you 10 Gravel and an emerald to 10 Flint. A stack is 6 Emeralds with 4 gravel left over and if you have a tree farm, two logs, 10 gravel, and a bit of trading can get you 10 Flint.\nTarget practice rooms.\nMake this room dimly lit, so hostile &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; can spawn, when you enter this room, always close the &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s when entering and exiting, arm yourself and kill the mobs in there. &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; the entrance area with &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. This helps you gain experience and loot.\nTarget practice room (non-hostile).\nMake this room with a supply of bows, arrows, and several colorful blocks, such as dyed &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, (to determine distance rank) at different distances with buttons on each one facing you with each one hooked up to a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Target%20Block\"&gt;Target blocks&lt;/a&gt; are a good item to use, too.\nBridge.\nIf your base is near a lake, a bridge can help you cross to get resources and give you a safe spot to fish. Just create a 3-block wide path (using &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; would be a good idea) through the water, and you have a basic bridge! When you have time, you may want to add a ceiling+walls (for safety at night from &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; and during storms) and slits in the side (as either a dock or a place to fish.)\nBathroom.\nIf one wants to fish indoors or drown themselves, a bathroom is perfect for them! Make a bath, a toilet and if the player is good with &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, a shower with pistons is always a good idea for those who want to show their home to others. When the walls are made of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, make a hopper attached to a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; to make a sink (just add a lever pointing downward above) or a trash can. If the items cannot reach the outside for other players, add a \"remove items\" &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt; to empty the items out to a chain of &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s that lead to a public chest/thrift shop, or empties the items to something which destroys them(such as &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Attach a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;, then place the &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;. This will not work without &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;. One wise idea is to have entrances to secret rooms in this room.\nDye room.\nA nice room where you can store dyes and clay. Typically only has to have one chest, but looks nice with hardened-clay walls.\nBalcony.\nA nice place to enjoy the view and the nice open air. Also a nice place to pick off those pesky &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s hanging by your front door.\nIncinerator.\nA room with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, for disposing of unwanted materials. A good way to do this is to create a two block high corridor with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; at the end, and a slab block just before the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. This results in you being able to walk up to your incinerator but not into it, eliminating fear of death. Be careful with lava around flammable materials. You may replace the &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, or burning &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hopper\"&gt;Hopper&lt;/a&gt;s can be used for a \"hopper chain,\" which could lead to a thrift shop, where &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s can be charged for taking items. Adding this to the incinerator will attach a money source. If the hopper chain is full, items will be destroyed.\nMob farming.\nA safe, renewable source of &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s. This makes exploring much safer and can provide the means for large amounts of explosives. Also see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20grinder\"&gt;Mob Grinder&lt;/a&gt;.\nWater elevator.\nIf you live in any building that is more than one story, you might want a method to get up and down easily without stairs or a ladder. One way to do this is to make a waterfall that falls through the center of the structure. Make sure to have one block of space on any side of it so that your character can be outside of the water enough to breathe while climbing it. Simply hold down the jump button (the space bar) while inside the waterfall to ascend. This method can also be used to create an elevator to flying islands or houses.\nDefense.\nThese additions make your base safer and provide a certain amount of entertainment.\nSelf-destruct button.\nPretty self-explanatory, a button that blows up your base and kills the mobs and/or griefers in your house. Remember not to be near during the blast (or you can hide in your bunker with the switch inside)! Also be sure to have a world backup!\nArrow slits.\nThese are small holes in a wall that you can shoot arrows through but are small enough so that skeletons and other players have a hard time shooting back at you. This can be accomplished by stacking up cobblestone walls (the holes can be shot through) or simply digging a one-block hole through the wall and putting a slab on the bottom. Also, placing the non-block part of stairs facing each other, and using the upside-down stair function, you can make arrow slits almost impossible to shoot through unless you are close, so it is advised you put them far above ground.\nMurder holes.\nFirst, dig a 2 block deep hole in the ground. Dig another hole 3 blocks deep, 1 block away from the first hole. Dig out the block that separates the bottom of the 2-deep hole with the middle of the 3-deep. If done correctly, this should allow all mobs (except for spiders) to fall into the 2 block hole. Then, you simply go into the 3 block hole and attack their feet. Murder Holes often function best alongside a perimeter wall of some sort, with the 2 deep outside and the 3 deep inside. An extra addition to this is to make a large amount of murder holes, and form a tunnel system of sorts, so you can watch multiple holes at once. These were featured by Paulsoaresjr in his \"Minecraft\" tutorial videos. This works best before version 1.2 because the mobs have new coding that makes it hard to get them to fall in holes. They will simply navigate around holes deeper than 2 blocks. A solution to that is to put signs around the holes but is usually more effort than worth.\nSkylight.\nAlthough this may not sound like much of a defense, a small skylight above your entrance/exit allows you to easily see any mobs (especially spiders) waiting to pounce on you from above. Not recommended in multiplayer, as it acts as another way for griefers to find your base.\nAnti hostile mob passageway.\nYou can use the fact that snowballs push hostile mobs, by building a 1-wide bridge over lava and putting snow golems on the side (see gallery). The player and passive mobs can pass through safely, while hostile mobs will be pushed to the lava by the snow golems' snowballs.\nOverhang.\nSince &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s can climb walls, a base needs to have either a ceiling or an overhang along the outside walls to be safe. The walls must be at least four blocks high (since spiders can jump up to three blocks high). Of course, a closed roof with a lava pond on top is also nice\u2026\nPerimeter.\nAdding &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es around your base can reduce the amount of monsters that spawn nearby, so add some light to your lawn! You can also use &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, and burning &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; to keep enemies out. Just remember that spiders can jump your fences.\nFloodgate.\nUsing a fairly simple redstone circuit connected to a lever at one end, and one or more pistons at the other end, you'll be able to build some simple floodgates. If you extend the pistons first, and then place water, or even lava behind it, you can get rid of or even kill any mob passing by pulling the lever and letting the water or lava flow! For a quick morning mob clean-up and a strong sense of catharsis, you can place lava floodgates surrounding your entire shelter, facing out. One throw of the lever reduces the surrounding landscape to a barren wasteland! Not to be used in wooded areas.\nMoat.\nThe simplest of these is a \"dry moat\" or trench, a couple layers deep so that &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s can't get across. This can provide you with a reasonably safe area that is outside. This can be filled with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to push the enemies to a mob grinder, or simply filled with lava which has more dramatic and obvious effects. Please note: It might not be a good idea to use lava when having a shelter built out flammable blocks such as wood, wool or wooden planks. Tower shelters would do well to have a three-block deep water moat to break the player's fall so they can safely fall to the bottom.\nLake.\nIf a moat does not feel sufficient, build a lake around your base, preferably several levels below the entry level and with a bridge to allow easy access back and forth. Again, it can be water, or, if you want a dramatic flair, use lava. Remember to protect the bridge well, though, and be sure you are protected from within the island in case you miss a spawner. Making a drawbridge out of trapdoors is a fun alternative to the actual bridge.\nArchery tower.\nIf you have a plentiful supply of arrows, building a small tower to pick off nearby monsters can be fun and provide useful resources such as gunpowder.\nDispenser turret.\nPut a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; with some &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s at your desired location (preferably next to a &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;) and a &lt;a href=\"stone%20button\"&gt;stone button&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; attached to it. This is handy if &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; want to pay you a visit. Splash &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s can also be used as ammo, but are harder to obtain. The benefits of using potions is that they can affect a wider area than arrows.\nTraps.\nIf you're not satisfied with moats or a perimeter fence, consider adding a &lt;a href=\"trap\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; or two. If you're up to a challenge (and on a multiplayer server), you could even make an entire trap, designed to look like a base! Dark rooms with no way out for mob spawning, entire mazes made of glass, and traps using pistons and lava. The possibilities are endless.\nDrawbridge.\nUsing trapdoors, some redstone, and switches, a simple drawbridge can be made. Dig a moat around your base and make sure it is too long to jump across. Now, make short walls next to your entrance. Depending on whether you have a single door or double door, you will have to use one row or two rows of trapdoors respectively. Run redstone next to the trapdoors and connect them to switches inside your base, then cover up the redstone walls. This prevents mobs from getting close to your door while you are inside your base, but the bridge has to be left open while outside your base, otherwise you'll have to find another way back in. Alternatively, you can make a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuits%23T%20Flip-Flop\"&gt;T Flip-Flop&lt;/a&gt; gate and place another switch outside your house to trigger the drawbridge from anywhere.\nSticky piston drawbridge.\nIt is possible to make a drawbridge using sticky pistons that is difficult for a mob to cross. This draw bridge also involves the use of a moat or lake. A knowledge of redstone logic gates and how power is supplied to blocks is needed as the mechanism uses multiple redstone repeaters, NOT Gates and a &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Memory_circuit%23T_flip-flop\"&gt;T-Flip Flop&lt;/a&gt;. Using the T-Flip Flop one can wire the drawbridge so that it becomes accessible or inaccessible with the touch of a button from either side of the bridge. When the player(s) wants to cross the button is pressed causing both ends of the drawbridge and the center to be even allowing the player(s) to cross. When activated to keep mobs out both ends of the drawbridge are raised 1 block higher than the water level making it impossible to jump from the water to dry land and the center blocks are lowered 1 below the water level causing the center area to flood. Assuming both areas are properly lit and secured this creates an impassable entrance to one's base.\nSecure waterfront.\nBecause zombies and skeletons can survive sunlight in water and hostile mobs can swim, if you have a base on the coast it's a good idea to make sure it isn't vulnerable to mob attack. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; pose a threat in the water. Building canals, lighting nearby islands, and building walls on areas of water you don't use can stop rare, but still as deadly, attacks from the sea.\nLand mines.\nIf you like to blow up stuff, you might like this. All you need is a lot of pressure plates (wood) and TNT. Once you found your spot dig two blocks down. Then place the TNT then another block, then the place the pressure plate. You can have a big mine field but usually more effort than it's worth.\nTNT cannon.\nTNT cannons are a good destructive way to take out mobs. Make a TNT cannon (a chaos cannon is also nice) and have a chest full of TNT. For more detail go to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/TNT%20cannons\"&gt;Tutorials/TNT cannons&lt;/a&gt;.\nIron golem trap.\nIf you have a lot of iron, you can create a separate room containing multiple &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s. This can be opened via a piston door to allow iron golems into a courtyard or garden. This will allow them to be sent to kill zombies if your house is under siege.\nCactus wall.\nIf you have a small house near or in the desert, and you want some more protection because you're just starting out, or if you're a veteran and you want a cheap, effective wall, then this is the wall for you. It's basically composed of cactus blocks, placed about 3 blocks high, and all around your base in a way like this:\nand only make one path to your door, this trips up most mobs, other than skeletons because they shoot, and spiders, and they tend to jump over it, but it's an excellent defense for a beginner.\nSnow golem sentry.\nPlace a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; in a small booth and give it a hole to throw snowballs at mobs through. Elevate the golem so that &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s can't blow it up and zombies can't hit it.\nOuter walls.\nThe best material to construct these are &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone%20brick\"&gt;stone brick&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"brick\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Obsidian\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is harder to obtain but a lot better than stone-based blocks. They should be at least 4 blocks high and 2 iron doors for the exit. Make sure to build ramparts and cover walls, and fill with lava/water. Also have a 1\u00d71\u00d71 moat of lava/water with a torch in front like this:\nWeaponry room.\nThis is a room you can solely use to make weapons and store them. You'll want a crafting table and some chests for materials. This is useful since you can then use your original crafting room for things other than weapons, therefore leaving more space for such. Some holes in the side would be useful for sniping all the mobs and creepers outside.\nAlarm tower.\nThis can be used to signal if enemies are near your base. Using the &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;, you could make it so a message gets sent out when you pull a lever or press a button, and could also turn on a source of lighting so people can see the signal from far away. Can be fun on single player or LAN, but it is also quite useful for multiplayer.\nDrop trap.\nThis is useful for those short corridors from one part of your building to the other, as when you pull a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; at one side of the corridor, the floor would open making enemies fall down who are chasing you. Easy to make, all you need are a couple of &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, and optional &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, then you're set!\nRetractable blast shields.\nThese are an easy way to keep mobs at a distance, and are especially effective against mobs which use sight as a weapon, such as &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;, however it can be tough to collect the necessary resources for this mechanism. Say we're going to protect a window which is two blocks from the ground and four blocks wide. To start, count three blocks out from the window, and then dig a 6-block-wide, 3-block-deep, 3-block-thick (6\u00d73\u00d73) trench, and then line the far edge of the trench with pistons pointing upward. Next, place three blocks of gravel on each piston so that there is one block of gravel sticking up above the ground. Behind each piston, place a solid block that accepts &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, and then place a bit of redstone on each of these blocks, as well as the blocks behind them. From there, run a redstone line to the lever which we'll use to work the blast shields, keeping in mind that redstone can accept a signal from the block above it (making it feasible to have the lever inside your house, preferably near the window you wish to protect).\nThe final product should look like this (all the redstone should be off and the cobblestone is the window):\nAfter that, cover the redstone circuitry with whatever you wish to protect it against damage, and you're good to go!\nNote: If you're good enough with redstone, you can also have all blast shields around your house hooked up to a single lever, which you can flip whenever you need to.\nThis is a nice feature to add to the windows of your &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; bases.\nExploding statues.\nSurprising foes makes any weapon effective! No one will ever know when a fancy statue is a literal bomb! To make one, fill a statue with &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, then add some underground &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; leading to a button to activate it. Activating detectors makes this defense automatic,though beware of &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s setting it off! Building it near a base is not wise. Normal &lt;a href=\"rails\"&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; and one block of &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt; with some power applied can replace a large &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; usage if statue is lower than the shelter. Push a &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20TNT\"&gt;minecart with TNT&lt;/a&gt; down the rail to activate. Remember to add the &lt;a href=\"Activator%20Rail\"&gt;Activator Rail&lt;/a&gt; early on the rail if possible for a quick countdown!\nOther.\nThere are infinite possibilities in \"Minecraft\". These ideas are not always functional but can be fun to make and have.\nSecret room.\nFor your chests with many valuables, in case someone gets in base, they might not find your room to steal your stuff.\nNether railroad.\nEvery block traveled in the Nether is equivalent to 8 blocks in the overworld. So why not use it to save on materials for building a long rail? You can have a portal in your house and a portal somewhere else connencted by a minecart rail in the nether. This can connect to a village, some cool mountains, a mushroom biome, or another place of interest that would take way too long to walk to. Extremely useful on Large Biomes and island worlds. Plus, you only use \u215b of the materials you would use in the overworld.\nStatue.\nThis can be made out of any type of &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; you want, but usually people build statues of themselves. This serves no purpose in single player except decoration.\nTrophy room.\nA room with framed trophies from your many victories: your first &lt;a href=\"ghast%20tear\"&gt;ghast tear&lt;/a&gt;, the enchanted sword you killed a &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; with, your first &lt;a href=\"nether%20star\"&gt;nether star&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20emerald\"&gt;block of emerald&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Use signs as plaques to mark the origin and perhaps the date of your trophies, give it fancy &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; lighting, and have a pride-of-place shelf for a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton%20skull\"&gt;wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps even the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Egg\"&gt;Dragon Egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nCity.\nThis is a good way to put &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; to use. First, you should dig out a road (as wide and long as you want it) then fill the holes in with gravel, then build as many cabins as you want in each cabin put a table, a chair, and a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, then light it up and put a wooden door on each one. Then build a restaurant, this should have some chairs and tables, and in the kitchen put a chest full of food and &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt;, then put &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s in the kitchen, if you want to make it really nice add outdoor seating, and if you're on multiplayer charge people to eat there. Then add a store (only build this if you're on multiplayer). It should have lots of sorted chests. It's recommended you hire a guard to guard the valuables. Now add your house, this should have a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, and a chest, and anything else you want. Now add a fountain in the center of the city. Finally add a bunch of mini houses containing chests, and a crafting table.\nMuseum.\nThis can be about various things. Minecraft, you, your worlds, or a favorite mob can be among ideas.\nIf you want it to look grand on the outside, place large pillars around it. Also, a grand staircase to a large front entrance helps.\nIf you build this in multiplayer, hire guards/security to guard your beautiful creation.\nSecret base.\nIf you are in multiplayer, you don't want anyone getting into an underground base, right? Well, dig down at least three blocks and make a room. Then get out and put a piece of dirt over the entrance and place a &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;. Put &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt; on it. Then dig the piece of dirt out and make a hill one block away from the tree. Dig one block into the hill and place sticky pistons so that when they come out they stick to the tree trunks and pull it back or forth, thus opening the entrance and closing it. After that, you need to expand the base so it's actually useful!\nZoo.\nEver wanted an area to see all the mobs in their epic glory? Build this! It's best if you use &lt;a href=\"bricks\"&gt;bricks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone%20brick\"&gt;stone brick&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;. You'll also need fences or glass, and signs. First, build various pens for &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;. Place glass on all sides, or just one. Alternatively, you could make a deep pit and put mobs in it. Put a fence around the outside.\nWhen you're done with pens, place paths guiding players around. If you want it to look nice, place large fountains, flowers and hidden &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s around. If you want it realistic, build restaurants, statues, and gift shops around. If you have hostile mobs in your zoo, you can use a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; to rename them so that they do not despawn\nNatural vacation beach.\nThis is simple. Find a lake or beach, dig out a large area, fill it with sand, and your own touches, and tada! You're done. Here is one way to make beach chairs:\nNote: The terracotta can be replaced with wool.\nMan-made vacation beach.\nThis is a little harder than the natural version. Dig out a large area. Make it at least 60\u00d760 blocks big, slowly getting deeper. Fill the outer shore with sand, add your touches and tada! You're done! you can also blow up a large area to do it faster and make it look more natural.\nSand castle.\nBuild a big castle of sand and sandstone with many rooms, chambers and whatever else you may desire. Add a moat, sniping towers, or other defenses to make it a nice sand strong hold.\nCamouflage.\nThis really serves no purpose in singleplayer. Simply place &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt;, vines, leaves, trees, and water on and around your base(s). It can give it a kind of cool look, depending on how well you do.\nA water \"fall\".\nIf you have a tall base and you want to get down faster, place water on the ground to land on from a fall, so you can jump down safely. Or, if you have version 1.8, you can use a trampoline made of Slime Blocks to bounce between floors of your base.\nAdd underground floors to your shelter.\nUsing this gives you a chance to find resources, and in the case of invasion by &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, it will always provide a safer spot. Underground floors are also useful for making mob grinders or animal farms. If you're really good, add a whole back up shelter under ground. If you like to be safe, add multiple bunkers, but hide a super safe and secret bunker. You could also make a part of the floor out of glass in the same spot on each floor, so you can see all the way down, and it looks nice if you do it right.\nAdd above-ground floors to your shelter.\nIt is normally advised that you do this after building underground floors, especially if you have a ton of resources (after mining the basement out). These floors could even give you a chance to \"snipe\" some &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s in the morning.\nBalcony.\nPlace your balcony so that it has a nice view! Add a chest with bows and arrows for quick mob sniping. Useful for a variety of things, from providing a point for easy kills to enjoying views.\nLanding and takeoff platforms.\nIf playing with flying enabled (for example, in Creative Mode) you can create platforms at the same height on multiple buildings for easy flight between the upper levels of different locations. This works great in tree-forts, cities, and anywhere that multiple balconies are otherwise unconnected. Since 1.11.2, &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt; rockets have allowed the player to have a propelled flight with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, so these platforms should have water to slow the impact due to how fast players can fly, if these are meant for elytra.\nRemake it out of a different material.\nInstall luxurious violet carpeting for the bedroom. Give your craft room a nice &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; roof. Rebuild the armory out of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Redo your outer walls in smooth stone. Add a second story to your library.\nMake another base in a new location.\nHaving more than one base helps if you need to travel farther to get resources. A base next to your spawn point is helpful if you built your main base far away and you died at night. A base in a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; can provide &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, and a base in a tundra can provide &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;. A base hovering in the sky can provide entertainment, especially if mobs spawn on the edge of it. A great idea is to connect them with nether portals that have a secure hallway in the nether.\nAn emergency kit.\nIn case you need to quickly gear up and run back to get dropped gear or items. Perhaps a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; or a stack of &lt;a href=\"porkchop\"&gt;porkchop&lt;/a&gt;s, and stack of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. A more advanced kit can be made from dispensers that give you items at the click of a button or a step on a pressure plate, although arrows and torches still have to be accessed from a chest or two (if you want the whole stack) unless the &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt; is used.\nAdd an escape tunnel.\nYou never know, a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt; might one day get you. Build a tunnel to escape it. It could also be used to lead to a secondary base. Another idea is to have the tunnel lead to a central room with several other tunnels branching off of it, with tunnels leading to the surface, caves, perhaps even a secret hideout. If playing on a multiplayer server, maybe even add a few dead-end tunnels to confuse anyone who may be following you through the tunnels. \nLava lamp.\nSimply make a hollow space out of glass and fill it with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. An efficient method is to run a vertical column through many floors powered by a single lava block at the top. You can also make one of these high above your base to mark it from afar. If your house is made out of flammable blocks, this isn't recommended.\nQuarry.\nA &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%20techniques\"&gt;Quarry&lt;/a&gt; yields large amounts of materials such as cobblestone and dirt to make your buildings, and coal and iron to make tools and torches. It can require several days of game-play to finish building. Some rarer materials like gold can be found as well. See the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mining%20techniques\"&gt;Quarry&lt;/a&gt; page for instructions.\nMining shaft sunroof.\nMaking a sunroof that points directly down your mining shaft has its advantages: you can tell the time of day more easily, and burn mobs like &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. The sunroof can also provide enough light to discourage other mobs from spawning in your mine.\nLava beacon.\nMake a large pillar of stone or any non-flammable material and pour a lava &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; on it. It helps when you are a long way from home. Make sure not to build it too close to your base if it's made out of a flammable material.\nGlass/lava floors.\nNo mobs can spawn on glass floors, making for a handy alternative to a well-lit shelter. Light is still important, though - you could even have a 1 block high space below all glass blocks on the floor and pour lava there. This keeps your shelter visible and provide a fancy, creepy feel.\nDoorbell.\nPlayers (and mobs) entering your house without your knowledge is a pain, that's why you need a doorbell. When a mob or player steps on the &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; the note block will play a sound, and you can make this more sophisticated making chimes or even a whole song that play upon entering.\nIf you have multiple entrances to your base, place different blocks under each note block to make sure that if a creeper comes to your west entrance, you don't get blown up when you try to run away through that door.\nBlinker beacon.\nA more technical variation on the Lighthouse - the light blinks on and off like a real lighthouse.\nYou may also use a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; rail system, which can be made so you put down rails in a square(4 rails on every side), then put down a booster and detector rail, power the booster, and connect the detector rail to the torches you want to blink with redstone. Place a minecart on the booster and it will loop forever.\nThis can be used to blink multiple torches with the same system, and does not require maintenance. You can connect more detector rails for faster blinking speed.\nDock/harbor.\nIf you find yourself using &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s in a general area often, making a dock or two is a good idea. They can help prevent your boats from drifting off into the ocean, or slamming into a wall when you exit, thus breaking the boat. Dispensers can also be placed here and filled with boats for convenience. Chests filled with boats are a good idea too. There are several ways to make useful docks.\nWarning: it is recommended to only use this method on Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; and to land on the half blocks at a lower speed, since instant death is possible when landing on half blocks at a higher speed.\nFridge.\nCreate a fridge by placing a dispenser on the ground, a block on it and a button on the side of the block to quickly get something to eat when you're starved. Add a door in front of the dispenser if you feel it would look better, or if you just like the idea.\nMiniature zen garden.\nEither above the surface or underground, create decorative minimalistic works of art using water currents, plants/crops/&lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, clever use of &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; posts, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, etc.\nFountain.\nYou need 22 &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; and a bucket of water. Make a 5\u00d75 square with the nine in the middle taken out so the water won't spill, then make a 4 block high pillar in the middle and place the water on top of the highest block. Taking out the stone pillar in the middle of the fountain can look nice, and placing half-blocks around the stone blocks can look fairly cool. You can also make the fountain a source of light by replacing the stone pillar with &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;. After making a fountain like this, you could experiment with making fountains in other ways.\nPiston doors.\nThese look cool. Have these anywhere in your house: library, craft room, furnace room, you name it. All you need is redstone, sticky pistons, and levers. Be sure to keep them hidden if the rooms are secret - a good way to do so is hide the device you use to power the pistons.\nTunnel to a stronghold.\nAfter you find a stronghold, make a tunnel to it. This is an easy way to get to and from the End. Keep it well lit and defended so that if a creeper runs into you in the stronghold, it can't follow you back to your base and blow it up.\nAdd a carpet.\nYou can spice up your base by adding a carpet made out of colored wool. Make sure that fire and lava aren't within two blocks from the carpet, otherwise your carpet will go up in flames! Bright colors, like red, blue and purple are recommended, because black and gray carpets don't have the same feel. Try mixing colors together in cool patterns if you're looking to give a room a bit of flair. With the new &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s added in snapshot &lt;a href=\"13w16a\"&gt;13w16a&lt;/a&gt;, you can carpet the upper floors of your base without having your lower floors' ceiling made of wool.\nRoller coaster.\nIf you have enough resources, build a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Building%20a%20rollercoaster\"&gt;roller coaster&lt;/a&gt; out of rails. Add twists, turns, steep climbs and falls. Use booster rails to keep it running fast. This is a decent way to keep occupied while you have nothing else to do in the vast world of Minecraft. Useful in multiplayer - you can charge other players to ride. This could also be used as a monorail type of system. If you have a large base, this helps you get around it faster.\nSky base.\nCreate a base floating in the sky with no bridges or stairs connecting it to land. Of course, it doesn't have to be this way to build it! The no-connections idea can be accomplished with waterfalls, piston elevators, and nether portals. Add other sky islands nearby with bridges to connect them, and it'll be like you never left the ground! If you truly don't want any connections to land, even with the waterfalls and nether portals and elevators, gather up all the resources you'll need and seal yourself away in the sky. (But make sure you have a bed up there in case you die.) For extra entertainment, make a smaller island and plunge it into darkness, and watch mobs walk right off. To make it even more entertaining, place some arrow dispensers hooked up to pressure plates on the island, and even make signs all along the edge.\nBattle arena.\nThe first thing you must do is find a &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;. Then seal off any extra entrances and place a door at the last remaining one. Maybe make the dungeon a little bigger, to provide for more fun and monster spawns. Finally, make a lobby with chests full of equipment (&lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s), various helpful &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s, and food. Now you can fight that specific mob whether for &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; or drops for as long as you want! Include &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s if it is a long way away from your base, so that if you die you won't have to walk for ages just to find it again, or simply make a minecart track to take you there quickly. If in multiplayer, add a lock on the lobby and another lobby where other players can pay you to fight that mob and rent equipment and various supplies. This is handy to build in abandoned mineshafts, wherever you find a &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt; spawner, but if you do that make sure you have plenty of milk buckets on hand. If you want to give your arena a bit of a twist you could add challenges, like a room where the mobs spawn over your head or one where you have to solve a puzzle while fighting the monsters.\nRailway.\nMake a long tunnel to fit from one to any amount of minecarts, then use minecarts with furnaces to propel the 'train'. You can also use powered rails, but for that you'll have to find gold and redstone. Be sure to add emergency chests to the side of the track and fill them with coal to power your minecart so you don't get stranded. Adding food and weapons in these chests is a good idea, in case you get stranded and have to fight some zombies to make it to your shelter. This is fun for multiplayer and single-player and you can go across the land quickly. Don't make your railway above ground; you will constantly be attacked by creepers. However, covering the railway with blocks (such as you would make a house) can solve this problem. Alternatively, you could build a 3 block wide track that is elevated off the ground 2-45 blocks. This option provides great views but is not suitable for multiplayer. Make stations for your favorite landmarks (big mountains, your house, etc.).\nMinehouse.\nMake one of these if you have a long and deep mine and have to constantly run up and down long tunnels to drop off your bounty and sleep for the night. You need to make a small cottage in the middle of your mine, but digging out a room(s) in the side of a wall works fine as well. Adding a door, windows and plenty of light reduces the chance of being ambushed when you wake up in the morning. It must have a chest with food, picks, and shovels, as well as rare items that you don't want to lose while mining. Having multiple chests in a back room to store your excess dirt, gravel, cobblestone and ores is handy if your main chest is getting crowded and you'll be down in your mine for a while yet. A crafting table, multiple furnaces for quickly smelting items, and a bed are always good to have inside. You can also include an Enchantment Table for quick enchanting of tools and armor, especially if your favorite Efficiency IV/Silk Touch I diamond pick got burnt in the pit of lava that also stole some redstone.\nPool.\nMake a pit of any shape or depth, but something that's 2 blocks deep is recommended, so that you don't sink to the bottom and drown. You could also place half slabs on the bottom of a two block deep pool so that you get the feeling that you're fully immersed in the water but without fear of drowning. Fill it with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. And now you've got your own pool. And if you're extra careful, you can make it with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; instead. Also it lights up that area of your base and looks good. You can add &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; underwater as 'lights', or lava with glass over it to make it into a hot tub.\nPark square.\nMake fences around a 20\u00d750\u00d715 area, put a garden, and a wool statue with a stone base. You can use bone meal on the grass that makes up your square to make tall grass and flowers appear. Adding pathways of blocks like &lt;a href=\"stone%20brick\"&gt;stone brick&lt;/a&gt; shows players where they can go and adds a nice touch.\nWork tents.\nIf you feel that you're running out of inventory space frequently during above ground projects, build a work tent. Make a 6x6 fence box, add a door and wooden roof, and place lots of chests. Add a least 1 furnace and a workbench. Dig a little ditch in case a skeleton or spider appears. This can double as a safe-house/tent.\nMining rig.\nCreate a platform on top of a relatively flat surface or mountain. Dig out a trench in the middle of it and place redstone on either side. Connect the redstone to a single button and fill the trench with TNT. All you need to do is to press the button and you will begin a pit that leads to the bottom of the world. An automatic reloader can be added via sand and pistons. (This can be easily re-purposed into a cannon.)\nToilet.\nYou never know when nature will call. You can make a small toilet out of water and sticky pistons or trapdoors. It can be used as a garbage disposal or just for laughs.\nMob aquarium.\nA glass box with a mob spawning room above it with a connecting hole so mobs spawn and fall in.\nTesting room.\nSaw this great creation online but never knew how to build it? Following a guide how to build things without risks? Want to warm up on traps and other things with no damage to your shelter? A testing room has various things you have never hoped to build before. Cover it with obsidian to reduce damage to shelter, or make a new world to test new things.\nCanal.\nThis is a good way to get around if you live in the middle of a huge island. The best kind is a 2\u00d73 extending where ever you need to go.\nLanding site (literal).\nIf you have procured yourself some &lt;a href=\"Mods\"&gt;Mods&lt;/a&gt; you can actually make a real landing site. Once you've got a plane or two you will want to store them somewhere away from the creepers or other players. So behind your base, get black &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; flooring for at least a 30\u00d730 area and put &lt;a href=\"Nether%20brick%20fence\"&gt;Nether brick fence&lt;/a&gt;s or just normal &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s all around it. Then, build a dome out of glass blocks big enough to get a plane into it. Repeat the third step for the rest of your planes.\nWater elevator.\nIf you live in any building that is more than one story, you might want a method to get up and down easily without stairs or a ladder. One way to do this is to make a waterfall that falls through the center of the structure. Make sure to have one block of space on any side of it so that your character can be outside of the water enough to breathe while climbing it. Simply hold down the jump button (the space bar) while inside the waterfall to ascend. This method can also be used to create an elevator to flying islands or houses.\nWarehouse.\nThis is for huge things, such as giant iron golems or airplanes. Build a huge area with at least 40\u00d740\u00d720 with cobblestone or other high blast resistance/hitbox item, and then build your thing. You could also fill it with thousands of chests with your stuff!\nUnderground homes.\nThis is an efficient way to have a surplus of players, so you can have a large number of places to live! Furthermore, you lose virtually no items at all!\nHighway.\nAn extremely fast way to get from one place to another. A &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; could be used on a &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt; to speed up the process. It can also look good with a Station.\nCore control Room.\nIt's good if you like redstone use this to control all redstone circuits or only for decoration. You can place a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; in the middle with glass to make it fancier.\nExterior constructions.\nThese are mostly used for aesthetic purposes, but there are exceptions such as automatic farms located outside.\nLava pit.\nThis is just a hole in the ground that can be 1\u00d71 or 4\u00d74. Fill it with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and then you can throw items you don't need or items taking up space into the hole to watch them BURN! This isn't always outside your base but it isn't recommended if you have a floor or wall near if the base is made out of &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wood%20planks\"&gt;wood planks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; due to the risk of it catching on fire and your base burning down.\nSnow farm.\nThis is basically a caged &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; arranged so that you can dig at the snow trail beneath it. (See the snow golem page for plans and tips.) Unfortunately, this doesn't work in all biomes: In a Desert, or the Nether, snow golems will die quickly, and in several other biomes (Swamp, Mushroom Island) they will not form a snow trail. Remember to protect your golem from rain and stray mobs -- especially, block off their firing capability so they don't provoke passing creepers and skeletons! (You can also use snow golems for defense towers, but that's different from farming snow.)\nZen Garden (can be seen indoors sometimes).\nA Zen Garden is for aesthetic purposes only. A Zen Garden is made by choosing the place where you want it to be. Then make the walls surrounding the garden with any material you like. I like to use &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; or maybe &lt;a href=\"cobblestone%20wall\"&gt;cobblestone wall&lt;/a&gt;. Then fill the walled up space with any kinds of trees, &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s maybe &lt;a href=\"melons\"&gt;melons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushrooms\"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; and maybe even a small fountain. Do whatever but try to make it as natural as possible. I don't recommend to build this in multiplayer because griefers can find your house more easily but there is the exception of Faction servers in which you can claim land or servers in which you can buy a block that protects a radius.\nStable.\nThese are where you keep your horses for easy riding, and normally are about 10 blocks wide. &lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;Fence&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s can be used for keeping your horses in the stable.\nMultiplayer-only ideas.\nThese ideas are quite pointless if you play by yourself, but are fun additions to a multiplayer server.\nCornucopia.\nThe cornucopia is probably one of the most simple \"structures\" on this list. It basically consists of a storage area where anyone can give away and take any item for free, and can range from a single chest or barrel located off a main road to an elaborate structure of stacked double chests in a central square. Rules are optional but recommended; basic rules include prohibiting taking everything from the cornucopia, requiring each player to give an item of similar or greater quantity, value, or purpose to what they have taken (such as exchanging &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Cod\"&gt;cooked cod&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cooked%20Rabbit\"&gt;cooked rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; for miscellaneous potion ingredients), only giving and taking what a player actually needs, or limiting what is allowed in the cornucopia (such as prohibiting tools of &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and better, or limiting food to a stack of 16).\nParty room.\nThis is a large room (or multiple small rooms). You can have a table and chairs or a bar and you can charge people to have a party there. Include jukeboxes with music discs and perhaps colored carpet.\nMailbox.\nSimply put a chest/barrel on top of a fence post, then other players can give you gifts. Be wary of thieves! Alternatively, you can leave messages as books.\nBank.\nMake a bank to store items. Players could pay &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; to store their valuable items in a 'vault'. If you're really ambitious, the Vault could be lined with &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; if you're an &lt;a href=\"Admin\"&gt;Admin&lt;/a&gt;) to make it super secure.\nTollhouse.\nFor bridges/roads that lead to your property, or for entrances and exits to spawns and player hubs. Only works effectively with some sort of fence or wall around the area.\nInn or guesthouse.\nBuild a large and well-defended structure with private rooms each containing a bed and chest (possibly a furnace and crafting table too). For additional style points, decorate the rooms nicely. Use a locking mod, and charge people to stay at the inn; when they rent a room, add them to the list of people who can unlock the door and chest. You may want to hire people to man the front desk, keep records and collect bills. This is especially useful if you build it near a dungeon, as players will want to have a well-protected \"base camp\" when setting off to explore.\nArmy.\nMake an army from other players. People can pay the army in valuables to protect their homes. Charge based on location and how long.\nNational park.\nCorner off a \"huge\" area of land with big mountains and amazing caves on a multiplayer server. Put in information signs for landmarks and charge people to visit. Make some camp-sites to house players while exploring, and put chests with food or weapons in the camp-sites. Be sure that players give back any items they use.\nMultiplayer railway.\nCharge other players to ride on it, a perfect way to get coal or emeralds. Make a deluxe version for long journeys. Make windows in the tunnel. Another idea is to make a subway. See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Train%20station\"&gt;Tutorials/Train station&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nSpleef arena.\nGreat way to have some fun with your friends on multiplayer. You should make a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; room to be able to collect snow balls easy to craft into snow blocks. You can bet on games, build a score board and have stands for people to watch. You can also make it so the loser faces a little more punishment and humiliation by making the bottom out of lava so if someone falls they will burn to death. This makes it a little more fun and pleasurable to watch your opponent burn. You could also make a long drop that kills the loser, and the winner can take all the dropped items after the game.\nPvP combat arena.\nCreate a huge room and fill it with obstacles and platforms. Make a roof with beds on it, that players will respawn in, and chests to take equipment from. Make holes in the roof to allow players to enter the arena at different places. Use ladders or water holes to prevent falling damage. You can give the arena a theme, like a forest, and decide what equipment should be available when players respawn.\nCourtroom.\nUseful on any server with a problem with &lt;a href=\"griefer\"&gt;griefer&lt;/a&gt;s, stealing, or PvP (player vs player). If an admin is online (or with use of a command block), it is advised to turn everyone present to adventure mode and separate them, to prevent PvP and/or griefing of the courtroom. A courtroom usually involves a chair or place for the judge, the jury, the defendant, and other players wishing to speak. It is much easier to maintain a trial with everyone there in the Courtroom rather than just over chat, as there will be no distractions and the defendant and others can be kept under control. Depending on the government system chosen, the jury can vote on the punishment, or the final say can be up to the judge. Due to number restraints, it will often be hard to have a completely unbiased jury, but try to have at least one person who wasn't involved or biased. If the defendant is deemed guilty, a punishment will be decided, which can range from having to give back what they stole or repair the damage griefed, to a restraining order, a banishment from the town, or even being banned from the server. Optionally, you can have a Records Room to keep track of the trail using a &lt;a href=\"book%20and%20quill\"&gt;book and quill&lt;/a&gt; (just be wary of offenders trying to clear their name by destroying the book or editing it), but can also be tracked with .txt files outside the game (which might be a better idea if things are really getting out of hand).\nJail.\nThe jail is where rule-breakers or criminals go if the punishment agreed on is not an execution/banishment/ban. Build a secure room with traps outside cells to prevent criminals from escaping, via bugs and digging, like lava flowing from the top of the jail. It is difficult to make a secure jail without using Bedrock or obsidian. An alternative is to have the walls of the room constantly being moved by pistons, so the player has no time to break through them. However, this will create a lot of lag. You can make a regenerating wall using water and lava as well. Be warned, however, that if the spawn is outside the jail, the criminal can use the command to escape or blow themselves up with TNT. Also, remember to \"never\" send an admin to jail without reverting their admin status first or they can just switch themselves to creative mode and mine the thing you made the jail out of.\nRestaurant.\nThe restaurant can be a place where people pay in goods or money for you to give them food. You could plop a few chairs down too and make a kitchen full of furnaces and chests full of food. Farms for food and resources can be made behind, around, or even within the restaurant's kitchen area.\nShop.\nSimply put a pit with a pressure plate with redstone leading up to a dispenser above the pit where a shopper is standing and when they toss the item you're charging them, the item they want will fall down to them. This method is useful on a multiplayer server but can be made on a single player server to make it look nice.\nTrade routes and hubs.\nUse cobblestone or path blocks to connect trading hubs that you and your fellow players can use. For extra fun you can designate each other jobs and wares, such as merchants, armor makers, and butchers.\nUnderground tunnel system.\nDig a large series of tunnels underground (preferably clean, square-shaped, and free of obstructions or danger) and light it up to prevent mob spawns. The tunnel system can be built around a main tunnel or hub. Link the tunnel system with mines, caves, shelters, and landmarks that are frequented or owned by you or other players, providing an alternative to above-ground travel and quicker, easier access to mines and certain points of interest. Optional additions include beautification (such as different wall/floor materials or designs), minecart rails, boat canals, horse accessibility, displays (such as aquariums and dioramas), cave access points, designated mineshafts, simple shelters or work stations, and mob farms. This can technically also be built in singleplayer, in case you have multiple mines or places of interest across a wide area, but it serves more of a purpose in multiplayer.\nCentral tower.\nBuild a large, tall tower in a central area where most players are located. Players can live on each floor or store items there, but its primary purpose should be to mark the location of the central area. Higher floors may have glass windows or balconies to provide lookouts on each side; access to these top floors should be simple and easy. The top floor should contain an actual signaling method to help players locate it at a distance, such as a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Campfire\"&gt;signal campfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt;, blinking &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, or simply a tall spire made of blocks or fence poles.\nBasic housing.\nBuild a series of basic houses with the bare essentials (&lt;a href=\"Crafting%20Table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;). They should preferably be in the same vicinity, either across from each other or connected, and should be rather simple in design and material, with windows and even doors being optional in some cases. Their purpose should be to provide basic temporary housing for new players so they don't have to mooch off others as they start off, with the intent being for each player to eventually move out as they advance and build their own base; however, they may also be used as permanent housing, should a player become accustomed to it. The residents can optionally be taxed by the builder or server owner, who may require payment in (ideally cheap or common) materials or goods in exchange for protection or even the housing itself, with eviction or even the house's razing possible if payment is not given; however, this can be oppressive and unfeasible for new players and is thus not recommended.\nFurniture.\nIf you are bored, or want miscellaneous decorations in any place, add furniture! Tutorials for building furniture can be found at \"&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Furniture\"&gt;Tutorials/Furniture&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

They have three basic parts: the system to fill the shulker box, the piston to break the shulker box once it's full, and the dispenser to place a new shulker box.\nUnloaders.\nThe player might not find unloaders as useful, but they still have very practical purposes. If the player's base has a storage system, then the player can come back from a long journey and dump an inventory-full of shulker boxes with various valuables into a chest. A system could then unload the shulker boxes and sort out the contents.\nIn an automatic tree farm, several shulker boxes with bone meal can be unloaded gradually to be used.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Printing\"&gt;printer&lt;/a&gt;, especially 3D, it is easiest to program using shulker boxes to \u201cwrite\u201d the instructions and a shulker box unloader to \u201cread\u201d the instructions.\nSearch Engines.\nIf you end up with chests full of random shulker boxes and you can't easily find the ones you need, you might want to start using a machine that uses a shulker box search engine.\nWith these machines, you can store your shulker boxes without worrying about sorting them or even the items within them.\nThe machine uses a filter to look for a specific item in the shulker boxes you have stored in your system until it finds a shulker box that contains the item you are looking for.\nDesigns.\nLoaders.\nBelow are a few designs that use the same three basic parts of a shulker box loader.\nUnloaders.\nShulker box unloaders have the same basic parts, but the &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; need to activate when the current shulker box is empty. Below are a few designs of this kind. They are much less common than loaders.\nCombinations.\nAlthough hard to find, there are some designs that can load and unload with the same system, just pushing a few buttons to switch between the two \"modes.\"\nSearch Engines.\nAnother way &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; can aid shulker box storage is by making use of a so-called \"Search Engine\". This allows you to look for specific items in specific shulker boxes, even when the shulker boxes are stored in random order.\nThese machines can get very complicated very fast, which is why there are not a lot of working designs out there."}

The hit shulker must have its lid open to spawn a new shulker. The shulker spawns where the old shulker was before it teleported. The chance of this happening decreases with the amount of shulkers in an 8-block radius; when more than 5 shulkers are present in the area, no shulkers will spawn. The probability is reduced for shulkers with less than half their health remaining.\nThere are two main approaches to shulker farming, cell-based designs, and reactors. Cell based designs maintain a shulker in a breeding cell, removing the duplicated shulkers from around the breeding cell as quickly as possible. On the other hand, reactors rely on having a large number of effective breeding cells, and just let the number of shulkers naturally saturate, collecting drops from within the reactor as shulkers gradually die off. Both designs have their strengths and weaknesses, with reactors tending to be a lot simpler, but being larger, and usually requiring significantly more blocks placed for the same rates. In both cases, these farms are reliant on having a large number of teleportable spaces for the breeding shulker(s). However cell-based farms also need a way of moving shulkers away from the region around the breeding shulker.\nAnother key consideration is 2-dimension (2D) versus single dimension (1D) farms. 2D farms make use of portals, which are a highly effective way of removing shulkers from the region around the breeding shulker, and also provide for a large number of teleportable spaces (with relatively few blocks). However, 2D farms can only be built in the overworld, meaning a shulker has to be transported from the end through the main portal gateway. Additionally, portal-based farms can often be unsuitable for busy servers, and diagnosing portal-linking issues can be a headache for less technical or less experienced players.\nOn the other hand, 1D farms tend to be slightly more complicated and have lower rates (although this is changing with newer 1D farm designs). They make use of a few different methods of removing shulkers, such as minecarts, and trapdoors.\nShulker Teleporting Mechanics.\nWhen a shulker tries to teleport (including when it is hit by a shulker bullet) it will try up to 5 random locations in a 17x17x17 region around itself and test if they are valid spots for it to sit on. For a spot to be valid, it needs to be an air block, have a solid face for a shulker to sit on, and have a collisionless block opposite the solid face for the shulker to extend its head into.\nSince duplicating requires the shulker to successfully teleport, ensuring an abundance of valid teleport targets around the shulker (or shulkers in the case of a reactor) is usually important to ensure good rates. Though, since the shulker tries multiple times per teleport attempt, there are diminishing returns \nMost farms also require teleport-proofing parts of the farm to ensure shulkers can't end up where they shouldn't. For this there are a number of blocks with some solid surfaces, but not others, which includes slabs, stairs, trapdoors, and soul sand (which is only solid on the base due to not being a full block).\nMoving Shulkers to the Overworld.\nThe Core Mechanism is Make Shulkers teleport to End Portal.\nMaking shulkers ride Minecarts.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; is next to a shulker, then the shulker will ride the minecart.\nSo, you can move Shulkers near the end portal, but because the shulker is riding a minecart, it won't teleport to the Overworld. So, use an &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaking shulkers teleport to End Portal.\nIf you cover all the blocks a shulker can teleport to except the block you want it to teleport to with a &lt;a href=\"Button\"&gt;Button&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to make shulkers teleport to specified position."}

You can ride them underwater without them bucking you off, which allows underwater transport, however they are hard to obtain, so being able to farm them is handy, especially for SMPs and servers.\nConcept.\nThere needs to be a way of attracting lightning from thunderstorms to spawn skeleton trap horses, (lightning rods will not spawn skeleton trap horses) and the skeleton trap horses will spawn and get pushed to an area near the player, which will spawn 4 skeletons riding 4 skeleton horses. The skeletons can be killed by the player, which is in a safe location, and then the player can push a button which will open iron trapdoors underneath the horses and transport them to an area which they can be stored."}

The main goal is to be the last person or team alive to win. in the Bedrock server The Hive, the islands are destroyed one-by-one, killing any players still on them.\nOften there is a middle, larger island that has better loot, an &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20table\"&gt;enchantment table&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes several &lt;a href=\"anvils\"&gt;anvils&lt;/a&gt;. Although insane and other modes can occur and benefit the overall &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; items (including your own chests) the center island chests have the most powerful items relative to whatever mode the game occurs in.\nTactics.\nOn many multiplayer servers, there are many perks that players can purchase that can aid them in Skywars. Here is a list of some of the perks:\nPlayers can also rush into the middle island, coming first there can grant the player better items to kill other players. However, the middle islands are often contested by other players, so there is a risk of death from using this tactic. But if you enjoy fighting then going to the center island first is a smart choice. Doing so also allows you to be able to fight any players attempting to come to the center island and therefore can allow you to win, get great stuff, and get the most kills. But as the next paragraph says, you may end up having to battle a camper who could knock you into the void.\nAnother tactic is camping, where the player stays in their starting island while watching other players kill each other. Then, the final surviving player is often knocked into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; by the camper. This tactic is sometimes considered cheap and can be easily countered by &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s. Another downside is the lack of kills the camper gets after the game.\nNormal mode.\nThe chests on the spawn island give &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; that is either leather or iron, which gives the player 1 to 15 armor. The chests also contain 1 to 3 swords ranging from a stone sword, a stone Sharpness 1 sword, and an iron sword. Wooden Planks and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; are randomized in the chests and give 8 to 16 in one slot, which gives anywhere from 8 blocks to over 64.\nInsane mode.\nThe &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s on the spawn island give at least 3 pieces of armor that are either &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, which gives the player 9 to 20 &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. The chests also contain 1 to 3 &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s ranging from a &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sharpness\"&gt;Sharpness&lt;/a&gt; 1 sword, a diamond sword, and a diamond sword with Sharpness 1. Wooden Planks and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; are randomized in the chests and give 8 to 16 in one slot, which gives anywhere from 8 blocks to over 64.\nOther random items by chance are:\n]"}
{"id": "128887", "revid": "53764881", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=128887", "title": "Tutorials/Skyblock", "text": "Skyblock is one of the most popular survival gamemodes. The idea is that you can create and expand your very own world infinitely with only minimal materials. It was originally created by Noobcrew, a veteran Minecraft player.\nYou start on a small island floating in the middle of void with a few items and a single tree and you must learn to use and preserve your materials wisely as each one has a strategic use, (for example &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;s), and to know the basics of Minecraft in order to complete challenges and to expand. It is normal to make beginner mistakes, sometimes requiring many restarts.\nThere are countless Skyblock maps that can be found over various Minecraft community websites. You can also play online by choosing a Skyblock multiplayer server. Skyblock is widely known as being the most popular map and gamemode ever created on Minecraft while being highly popular for almost a decade, with gameplay and tutorials from just about every Youtuber including MrBeast, PewDiePie, CaptainSparklez and others.\nGlobal Progression.\nSince there is no normal terrain to explore, setting up farms for resources is vital to game progression.\nYour first day.\nYour first day will mainly depend on the skyblock map. If you have any grass or flowers, mine them and try to get at least one seed. Then, break the dirt on your island, leave at least a few grass blocks. Place the dirt around the tree so that it catches the dropped saplings. Chop down the tree and make a crafting table and wooden pickaxe. Catch the saplings and replant them. If you have a chest, open it and check the items. You usually start out with a few crops like sugar cane, melons, and pumpkins, some obsidian for a portal. Some maps also give you 2 turtle eggs, although turtles can spawn in a beach biome if the map has different biomes. There is also a bucket of lava and ice. To make a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Cobblestone%20farming\"&gt;cobblestone generator&lt;/a&gt;, dig a one block deep T-shaped hole. Put a block in the center, water and lava on two others slots. Break the center block, get in the last slot, and break the cobblestone that forms. Make sure that the blocks that surround the lava are not flammable, or they will burn. Mine as much cobblestone as you can and make a full set of stone tools. Make a small shelter out of wood or cobblestone to prevent phantoms and other monsters.\nCrops and Trees.\nIf you start with crops, plant them around the water at your cobblestone generator. For your second and third day, you want to gather as much wood and cobblestone as you can. If you have an oak tree, you can get apples for your food. If you started with a melon, make melon seeds and plant them. If you get a melon block, you can break it for melons, which you can also eat.\nMob Farm.\nHostile mob farms are very important because they are a source of &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potatoes\"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, among many other drops. Building a mob farm is mandatory to get the crops to start crop farming. It is also an abundant source of &lt;a href=\"rotten%20flesh\"&gt;rotten flesh&lt;/a&gt;, which you can now eat instead of apples. Multiple mob farms designs are explained in the page &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20farm\"&gt;Tutorials/Mob farm&lt;/a&gt;, however, the vast majority of efficient designs need water or redstone circuits.\nIf a spider spawns, killing it for string will allow you to craft a fishing rod, which can be used in the water from your cobblestone generator to obtain early-game fish as food.\nThis hostile mob farm design shown by ilmango uses the mob pathfinding mechanics to lure them into a drop shaft, without the need of water or redstone circuits (note that spiders can't spawn in this farm) : \nYou should also make a temporary passive mob farm to get animals: to do that, use cobblestone to bridge away from your island, and hope a passive mob spawns.\nCrop Farm.\nYou can get &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; from the seeds at the start of your island. Along with melon and potato seeds. Killing skeletons will yield &lt;a href=\"bone\"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt;s which can be converted to &lt;a href=\"bonemeal\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt;, in order to quickly grow crops in the beginning. On higher versions of Minecraft, killing zombies will also drop &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"potatoes\"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, which you can farm as well as lure and breed pigs.\nGetting Water.\nWater is extremely useful in a Skyblock world for many uses, and allows you to pillar down easily for building or to save you from death. It is also used to irrigate &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;. \nBonemeal underwater to make sea grass to turn flowing water into water sources.\nAn ice block can be broken by hand to create flowing water.\nBy using two sources of water, usually included in a chest or as ice blocks apart of the island, you can create an infinite water source. Dig a 2x2 hole 1 block deep, place two water sources in opposite corners, and the merging flows will create new water source blocks. Use a bucket on any of the now-four water blocks, and the removed water will be replaced by a new water source block when the flows merge. If the source blocks are too far apart, the merging flows will be too weak to create a source block, and so cannot become infinite.\nAnother option is placing a cauldron below open sky and waiting for rain, which will very slowly fill the cauldron with water. When the cauldron is full, you can empty it with a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;. With 2 buckets worth of water, you can make an infinite water source. If you're playing on versions above 1.13, you can also use &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;Bone Meal&lt;/a&gt; in water to spawn seagrass and more water sources, which you can then pick up with a bucket.\nGetting Villagers.\nGetting villagers is crucial for your progression, because it is the only way to get &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s, diamond tools and armor, and the only way to reliably get &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s. To get villagers, you will need to cure the rare &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, which sometimes spawn in mob farms or such.\nTo cure zombie villagers, you will need to give them the &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; status effect, and then a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; on them. There are several ways of doing this: to give a zombie villager the Weakness status effect, you can use a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; (which is more tedious) or make a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;splash potion of Weakness&lt;/a&gt; (which requires going to the Nether).\nTo make a witch give Weakness to your zombie villager, you will need to get near the witch with it and have less than health points. There will be then a 25% chance that the witch will throw a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;splash potion of Weakness&lt;/a&gt;. To make your own potion, you need to get a &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"fermented%20spider%20eye\"&gt;fermented spider eye&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"gunpowder\"&gt;gunpowder&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you will need a &lt;a href=\"brown%20mushroom\"&gt;brown mushroom&lt;/a&gt; to do that, which requires trading with a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;, which itself requires an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, this method is highly impractical for the first villager conversion.\nTo get the &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s, you will need &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s. Getting the apples is easy, but getting the gold is harder. You can either go to the Nether and kill &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, smelt &lt;a href=\"golden%20armor\"&gt;golden armor&lt;/a&gt; dropped by monsters, or kill &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, which sometimes drop gold ingots (Note how this will not work in the 1.17 update as a drowned will now drop copper ingots instead of gold ingots). \nIt is strongly advised to build a villager breeder as soon as possible, in order to avoid doing this tedious process multiple times.\nIron Farm.\nIron farms are very useful in a Skyblock world, because they allow way easier access to &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s. To make the smallest possible iron farm, you will need 3 villagers, 3 beds, and a zombie holding an item (to not de-spawn). Keep in mind that only a small percentage of zombies have this ability, so you will have to try several zombies.\nThis video by Ray features at the beginning a simple iron farm design, which uses lava in the killing zone but could use another killing system that doesn't need some. The rates are about 320 iron ingots/hour.\nWhen your needs for iron get larger, you can just make multiples copies of the farm or build a larger design.\nNether Skyblock.\nSome Skyblock maps either start the player in &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;, or give the player access to the Nether through some alternative method.\nThere are 5 biomes in the Nether, and each of them has unique properties that are interesting in a skyblock context:\nGold Farm.\nTo make a gold farm, make a platform up to 23 blocks away (ensuring the platform is within the Nether Wastes biome) and make a roof out of slabs and wait. A little while later, you should see some &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s spawning. Killing them can give the player &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s, which then gives access to &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;Bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;Bartering&lt;/a&gt; will yield many useful resources (such as &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Pearl\"&gt;Ender Pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"string\"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;).\nFortress Farm.\nIf structures are not disabled upon World Generation, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Fortress\"&gt;Nether Fortress&lt;/a&gt;es can still spawn in the void, extending up from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. This gives access to a variety of items, such as &lt;a href=\"Coal\"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bone\"&gt;Bone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20Rod\"&gt;Blaze Rod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sand\"&gt;Soul Sand&lt;/a&gt;, and (most importantly) &lt;a href=\"Wither%20skeleton%20skull\"&gt;Wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt;s. This allows the player to kill the &lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtainable Items.\nOverworld.\nThe most efficient way to get an item is written in bold.\nWays of getting items requiring &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; are written in \"italic\"."}

Slimeballs can also be crafted into &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Cream\"&gt;magma cream&lt;/a&gt;, which is needed for brewing &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;potions of fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Because slime blocks break instantly when hit (with a bare hand or any tool), they are useful for quickly displacing and clearing out volumes of water, even when under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; inflicted by an &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;. \nMethod.\nPre-build.\nBefore building a slime farm, first decide whether to build it in a slime chunk or &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; biome. Every chunk that is generated in a world has a 10% chance of being a slime chunk. Within slime chunks, slimes can spawn when Y &lt; 40. This method requires an underground room to be dug out before the farm is constructed. Slime spawning in swamps can occur between Y=51 and Y=69. This method has the advantage of not requiring a dug-out room prior to building the farm, and the size of the farm is not limited, unlike the slime-chunk method, although the spawn rates are lower in a swamp.\nAlternately, you can use the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.chunkbase.com/apps/slime-finder\"&gt;Chunkbase Slime Chunk Finder&lt;/a&gt; web app to locate chunks for your game seed.\nSpawning.\nThe first step in constructing either farm is the spawning place. In most farm designs, spawning platforms are created which spawn slimes that are then moved to a killing trap, usually a drowning trap to split larger slimes down and dispatch the smallest size. Spawning pads are usually constructed with a 2\u00bd-block gap using slabs, to allow all types of slimes to spawn. It is important to illuminate the spawn platforms a bit to allow slimes to spawn while preventing other hostile mobs from spawning. It is also recommended to illuminate horizontal surfaces in a 128-block radius around the farm, to keep the hostile &lt;a href=\"Spawn\"&gt;mob cap&lt;/a&gt; as low as possible.\nTransportation.\nThe second step in building a slime farm is transportation. In &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.8\"&gt;pre-1.8&lt;/a&gt; traps, this is usually achieved by using 'canals' of water separated by signs. As slimes can swim in snapshot &lt;a href=\"14w06a\"&gt;14w06a&lt;/a&gt; and above, specific water placement is required in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt; and above. Or using an iron golem to attract the slime to the killing spot.\nSeparation and killing trap.\nThe final step in building a slime farm is the separation and killing trap. To separate the different sizes down to the smallest, a drowning trap is usually used. The largest type of slime is split to the medium size, and medium to small. The slimes are then taken off to another trap to be killed, usually another drowning trap. Separation trap could be used as a killing trap also.\nAlternatively, a water stream carrying the slimes flowing into a cactus trap can be used. Hoppers around the base of the cacti then collect the drops. This has the advantage of killing all sizes of slimes without the need for separation. A downside of this method is that the cacti destroy around 20% of the slimeballs that are dropped.\nA quick and lossless method for killing slimes is using &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s. Slimes can either be pushed there with a water stream, drawn there by &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, or allowed to roam off the side on their own. A &lt;a href=\"Minecart%20with%20Hopper\"&gt;hopper minecart&lt;/a&gt; track underneath the magma blocks can be used to collect the drops.\nFor an interesting option, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s named \"Johnny\", or &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s attack all slimes, but the slimes never retaliate.\nItem collection (optional).\nTo automatically collect the slimeballs produced by the farm, create a hole below the end of the trap, with &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s feeding into one or more double chests.\nDesigns.\nBefore 1.19, most designs are based on slime chunks usually under the ocean, since only drowned spawn in oceans and you'd only need to only clear a few caves in the process. In 1.19 however, you can now build swamp-based slime farm."}

Accordingly, you will usually want to smelt things in multiples of 8 (when burning lumps of coal or charcoal), or occasionally 3 (2 wooden planks). For individual smelts, you can use sticks or saplings, 2 of which smelt 1 item. If your fuel source is plentiful, such as charcoal later in the game, you may not care about fuel wastage, so items can be smelted in any number.\nFuels.\nWhen smelting items, it's best to choose a fuel that is most suitable for how much you are smelting, so that you can use up as few resources as possible. In these examples, the process is making green dye, but this works for any item. For &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, wooden &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, oak is used, but it does not matter what type of tree the item came from. Also, you can replace one of the slabs with a &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt; or sapling when burning slabs. Two slabs can be replaced with one of the following items or vice versa:\nFuels not shown are not ideal.\nNote that wooden slabs smelt 0.75 items and 1.5 . \nIf you are doing 4-7 processes, start by doing them in groups of 3 until you have less than 3 processes left to do. Then you can do the rest using the appropriate fuel.\nIf you are doing 9-15 processes, the fuel depends on the exact number of processes you are doing.\nYou can do 12 processes more than one way.\nIf you are doing processes of 20 or 40 items (or another multiple of 20), you can use &lt;a href=\"dried%20kelp%20block\"&gt;dried kelp block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf you are doing 16-23 processes, the ideal fuel depends on the exact number of processes as well.\nIf you are doing 25-79 processes, do them in groups of 24 until you have less than 24 left to do. Then you can do the remainder with the appropriate fuel. Note that in extremely large projects you might be smelting more than a full stack. If this Is the case, you will need to do the following actions in the middle:\nUsing &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s, you can automate these processes.\nLarge projects.\nThese are fuels to start with if you are doing large numbers of processes. Note that for &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;lava bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, you will need to remove the bucket before putting another fuel in. Set 0-19 items aside so that the number of items you are smelting is a multiple of 20.\nTo use lava efficiently, keep the remaining load of 36 or 16 items handy, and put it in during the middle third of the burn (after it has done that many, but before it exhausts the original stack). Remember to both refill the un-smelted items, and remove the smelted product. A &lt;a href=\"Clock%20circuit\"&gt;despawn timer&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt; may help.\nNote:The numbers shown here is to indicate how many of the items to smelt,item stacks over 64 is not possible without cheats.\nFirst, figure out if you can burn blocks of coal so that you would have a multiple of 100 items left to smelt, then burn lava buckets (which do 100 processes). Note that a group of 400 items can be done in multiple ways.\nIf this is not possible, you will need to do something else."}

{"id": "28958", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28958", "title": "Tutorials/Snow farming", "text": "Snow farms allow for quickly obtaining a large amount of &lt;a href=\"snowballs\"&gt;snowballs&lt;/a&gt;, which can be further crafted into &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s. The easiest way to make a snow farm is to use &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s to produce the snow, which is what most farms use.\nUsage.\nThere are many benefits to making a snow farm. Here is a list of some of them:\nLocation.\nThe farm must be built in a &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; where a snow golem can survive and generate snow. Thus, the farm cannot be built in the Nether, deserts (all variants), badlands (all variants), or savannas (except variants listed below), and it also must be built above certain altitudes in other biomes, due to temperature decrease with altitude:\nSnow farms can be built an any altitude in cold and snowy biomes, which are stone beaches, taigas, mountains, snowy taigas, and snowy tundra biomes (as well as variants).\nSnow farms can be built at any level in river biomes (without the snow golem melting), which are reasonably easy to find, even in areas full of deserts, savannas, and badlands. If you are near an ocean, your farm will work on an island, even if it is next to a desert or other hot biome. \nOne nice thing you can take advantage of is the fact that even if you completely drain a river, it will still stay a river biome, and therefore allow snow farms. This applies to oceans as well, but it is much easier to drain a section of a river than it is to drain up a section of an ocean.\nPiston Based Automated Snowball Farm.\nOn Bedrock Edition snow layers can be broken by moving a block or piston head into the space occupied by snow layers, dropping snowballs. A simple fully-automated farm can therefore be made using a snow golem to create snow layers, breaking those layers using pistons and collecting the snowballs via hoppers. It is also possible to create a semi-automated snow block farm by pushing the snowballs into the player inventory, using a dropper, where they can be easily crafted into snow blocks as the farm runs.\nVideo tutorials.\nSee the following video tutorial for how to make an automated snowball and semi-automated snow block farm for Bedrock Edition\nManual Snowball Farm.\nMaterials.\nBefore creating a snow farm, make sure that the player has all of the materials. Here is a list of the materials they will need to build a snow farm:\nTo operate the farm, the player will need one or more shovels and inventory space sufficient to collect a lot of snowballs. Note that snowballs only stack to 16. However, 4 snowballs can be crafted into snow blocks, which stack to 64, and yield the 4 snowballs used to craft them when mined. So, if you're running out of inventory space, you can craft the snowballs into snow blocks. Later, when you are ready to use the snowballs, place the blocks on the ground and mine them.\nBuild.\nFor most snow farms, the player constructs a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in a 1\u00d71 space. The golem should be standing on a block that can support snow layers and isn't quickly destroyed by shovels, and where the player can easily target that block. Here is a step-by-step guide for how to make a snow farm using snow golems:\nHere are some suggestions of ways to enhance your snow farm: \nVideo tutorials.\nSee these videos for examples of ways to make a snow farm using golems.\nOperation.\nTo operate the snow farm, simply stand next to the golem's floor block, equip a shovel, aim at the &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt; on top of that block without hitting the golem itself, and hold the control.\nNote that the durability on the &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; will go down very quickly: a new stone shovel without the &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; enchantment will break in about 13 seconds after producing 131 snowballs (enough to make 32 snow blocks with 3 snowballs leftover), and an iron shovel will break in about 25 seconds after producing 250 snowballs (enough to make 62 snow blocks with 2 snowballs left over). Unless you have an &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Iron%20golem%20farming\"&gt;iron golem farm&lt;/a&gt; or plenty of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, it is recommended to use a stone shovel, because stone shovels dig up snow at the same speed as gold, iron, and diamond, and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; is extremely common and renewable. However, using stone shovels means that they have less durability, so make sure to bring plenty.\nAlso, remember to enable the &lt;a href=\"Gamerule\"&gt;mobGriefing gamerule&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, the golem will be unable to create snow."}

{"id": "26180", "revid": "53767318", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26180", "title": "Tutorials/Snow golems", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Snow%20golems\"&gt;Snow golems&lt;/a&gt; are one of the two utility mobs in Minecraft. They can be used for a variety of purposes to benefit the player. This tutorial teaches many ways that the player can use snow golems to their advantage.\nUses.\nA snow golem's primary purpose is to defend the player from &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;hostile mobs&lt;/a&gt;. They can keep enemies away from your house, or another area that needs protection, such as a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"zombies\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; and break up &lt;a href=\"sieges\"&gt;sieges&lt;/a&gt;. They can also lure mobs into traps, collecting their drops for the player. An &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; hit by a snow golem will teleport away and ignore the player, making them useful if you accidentally look at one.\nSnow golems also have some offensive uses as well. Because they are relatively quick and cheap to build, especially compared to &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, they can be deployed during combat. Any mob that they hit will ignore you to attack the snow golem, allowing you to kill it with a &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; while it's distracted. This provides a safer way to kill &lt;a href=\"spiders\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, which are normally dangerous to get close to. When using a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, the knockback of a snow golem will slow down mobs, giving you more time to shoot them, and also protecting you from spiders and skeletons. If attacked by an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt;, a single snowball will turn it neutral, so don't be afraid to make a golem if you are losing the fight. Also, if attacked by numerous mobs, creating a snow golem or two will both distract them and slow them, giving you plenty of time to escape. Since both &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s and snow can be found in snowy taiga, snowy tundra and mountains biomes, it may be a nice idea to build a few when first starting out if one is desperate. \nSnow golems deal no damage to most mobs, except to blazes . Given enough &lt;a href=\"splash%20potions\"&gt;splash potions&lt;/a&gt; of fire resistance, they can be used to farm &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s, as long as the player deals the final blow.\nDon't expect snow golems used in battle to last, whether offensively or defensively. Their vulnerability can be reduced, but if it has a way to shoot &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s have a way to shoot it. Make a &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; farm, so you have golems readily available.\nDue to their small health (, which is 20% of the player's), players are advised to use many at once.\nThere are two main types of snow golem turrets. Pushing snow golems use the sheer knockback from their &lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s to keep mobs away, while pulling snow golems use the fact that they attract mobs to lure them into a hazard such as &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, or a pit.\nSnow golems can also be used to farm &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;, as they immediately replace snow on the block(s) that they are standing on. This can make a fast snow farm. For more information, go to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Snow%20Farming\"&gt;Tutorials/Snow Farming&lt;/a&gt;\nPushing Turrets.\nA pushing turret's role is simple: Keep mobs away from your house. To do this effectively, they require a large number of snow golems, at least three, preferably more. It is possible to build one with a single snow golem, however, it won't be effective and will likely be killed if not in a protected turret. Four snow golems throw snowballs quickly enough to continuously push a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; back.\nThe sheer number of snowballs will push mobs away faster than they can reach the golems. This usually occurs until the mob is either killed by the player, burns in sunlight, or despawns. This makes them very effective against zombies, and fairly effective against spiders if you have enough golems. They are fairly straightforward and open-ended to build, all they require is a place for several golems to shoot from. If they are in your wall of your house, you can remove a block behind them to break the snow from under them from inside your house, thus doubling as a snow farm and saving space.\nIt is also possible to make a pushing turret that knocks the mobs into a hazard, for example, a narrow pathway with golems on one side and lava on the other. Players can walk across safely, but any mob will be pushed into the lava. Keep in mind, however, that, because once hit, mobs move toward the golem, to do this requires either the mob to be killed after the first hit, or a great number of golems to provide knockback faster than the mob can walk. To kill mobs, it is generally better to use a pulling turret.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nPulling Turrets.\nPulling turrets are like pushing turrets but with fewer golems, usually just one, and they have a hazard, usually lava, between the mobs and the golem. Instead of keeping the mobs away, their purpose is to bring them closer, where a trap awaits. It may take some time for the mob to reach the trap, as the knockback will slow them down, and this kind of turret usually only targets one mob at once, so it is advised to have several. If the trap protects the golem from all sides, such as a lava moat, they don't need as much protection, as no mobs will be able to reach them anyway. However, it is still recommended to keep them enclosed, to prevent them from moving and possibly falling into lava, and to protect them from skeleton arrows.\nPossible traps include lava, cacti, or even a pit. It can also lure monsters into a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Traps\"&gt;Mob Trap&lt;/a&gt;, where they are either killed, or weakened to be finished off by the player. This makes it a more versatile and strategic tool than a pushing turret.\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\nThe following is an example of a pulling turret.\nHow to Build a Pulling Turret.\n1. Dig a 3x3x3 hole into the ground. \n2. From the center of the hole build up 5 blocks of a non-flammable material such as &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;.\n3. Surround the top block of the tower with non-flammable material so that there is a 3x3 square with one open block between the square and the hole.\n4. Build another 3x3 square directly atop the last but without a center block.\n5. On one of the non corner blocks build up 2 blocks, place a slab on all other non-corner blocks.\n6. Build a &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt; in the middle.\n7. On the 2 block tower from the top block place 1 block in so that it is above the golem's head and the golem cannot jump.\n8. Delete the slabs and 2 block tower but leave the middle block floating, if you like you can make it a 3x3 square above the golem, however this is not necessary because after Beta 1.8 (The adventure update) Skeletons no longer fire in an arc, rather a straight line.\n9. Delete the first 3x3 square (the one 1 block above the hole) without deleting the middle (the snow golem is standing on that!)\n10. Delete the bottom 4 blocks of the tower but not the one your golem is standing on.\n11. Place 1 lava on the bottom of the block the golem is on. Since the golem deals no damage (except to &lt;a href=\"Blaze\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt;) and mobs will attack it if hit when they come up to it there is a chance they will die in the lava.\n12. If you wish to make it more deadly you can place &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; at the corners. However, this could possibly allow spiders to climb it and reach the golem. \n13. If you'd like to collect the drops, in the 3x3 hole, make the deepest layer have water on one side leading to a collection center, the middle layer signs, and the top layer lava."}

Breaking the &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; without Silk Touch drops nothing. \nNatural generation.\nBlue ice naturally generates on the bottom of &lt;a href=\"iceberg\"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;s and as large arching structures in &lt;a href=\"frozen%20ocean\"&gt;frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt also generates as &lt;a href=\"pile\"&gt;pile&lt;/a&gt;s and in some &lt;a href=\"snowy%20tundra\"&gt;snowy tundra&lt;/a&gt; village houses, and in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;. Rarely, an iceberg will generate entirely made of blue ice.\nCrafting.\nIt takes 81 regular &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; made into &lt;a href=\"Packed%20Ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; to create a single blue ice block. \nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s have chance to &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;sell&lt;/a&gt; blue ice for 6 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nBlue ice is slippery, causing most &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; to slide, including &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. It is even more slippery (0.989) than &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; (0.98). This allows for increased speed of items in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; currents by placing the blue ice under the water current. &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s do not travel faster in water currents on blue ice. \n, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s can travel even faster on blue ice than on either normal ice or packed ice, being able to reach a top speed of 72.73 m/s (as opposed to 40 m/s on ice and packed ice). Ice tracks built from blue ice, packed ice, or a combination are useful for long-range travel in all three &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimensions&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlue ice is a completely solid &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; and allows the placement of any objects on top.\nUnlike normal ice, blue ice does not melt when placed near &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; sources.\nBlue ice can be used to create &lt;a href=\"basalt\"&gt;basalt&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flows into a space which is above &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; and next to blue ice, basalt is formed. Effectively a \"basalt generator\" when repeatedly produced.\nBlue ice is not a storage block, as it cannot be crafted back into packed ice."}

Bamboo rafts look different, but function almost identically to other boats.\nObtaining.\nBoats can be crafted with any Overworld planks; crimson and warped planks cannot be used to make boats.\nBoats can be retrieved by repeatedly hitting them until they drop as an item.\n&lt;a href=\"Tool\"&gt;Tool&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s that deal more than damage will instantly destroy a boat in one hit.\nUsage.\nBoats can be used for the transportation of &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, sold for emeralds, or &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;burnt&lt;/a&gt; as fuel.\nTrading.\nMaster-level fisherman &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s always offer to buy a boat for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;. The type of boat depends on the biome outfit type of the villager; &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; villagers offer to buy oak boats, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snowy%20Tundra\"&gt;snowy&lt;/a&gt; villagers offer to buy spruce boats, &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; villagers offer to buy acacia boats, &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; villagers offer to buy jungle boats, and &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; villagers offer to buy dark oak boats.\nFuel.\nA boat used as fuel in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; lasts 60 seconds, smelting up to 6 items.\nTransportation.\nEntering.\nA player enters a boat by it, if the boat is not fully occupied (boats can hold two entities). Unlike &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied boat.\nExiting.\nA boat can be exited by or, , pressing down the right analog stick on a controller, tapping the \"Leave Boat\" button when using touch controls, or . When exiting a boat, the player is placed in the direction the player is facing, or, if facing directly up or down, the player is placed in front of the boat. The exiting player is placed on land if possible from the dismounting position.\nMotion.\nBoats do not turn with mouse-look. \nWith a keyboard or gamepad, boats are controlled using the , (turns left), (turns right), and keys. Using the key increases the field of vision, but does not increase speed as if &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith touchscreen controls, two buttons for steering appear. The right button or key steers to the left, and the left button or key steers to the right. Pressing both buttons or keys moves the boat forward.\n, boats can be ridden against a current, but cannot be ridden upstream to a higher elevation. A boat lift, usually made from tripwire, pistons, and optionally a slime block, can be used to move a boat up. Bubble columns created with soul sand can also be used to push boats upward. These mechanisms can also be used but are usually unnecessary because boats can be ridden upward in descending water, as well as &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Water-powered%20boat%20transportation\"&gt;follow upward stair-step currents&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nSpeed.\nBoats move according to the player's control or water currents, with speed affected by the surface traversed. Boats move extremely quickly on ice, allowing for the construction of fast transportation systems in any dimension.\nFloatation.\nA boat floats atop still or flowing water. , a boat sinks if it enters a waterfall. , a boat does not sink when submerged but floats up. This feature lets a player contrive stepped uphill water flows to &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Water-powered%20boat%20transportation%23Floating%20uphill\"&gt;propel a boat uphill&lt;/a&gt; using only flowing water.\nWhen a boat moves over a bubble column, it begins to shake. If the bubbles are caused by a &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;, all passengers are expelled and the boat sinks.\n, a sunken boat cannot be re-floated until a bubble column pushes it up or it is broken by the player. , a boat resumes floating when it emerges from the currents keeping it down, or when the bubble column is blocked or removed.\n&lt;a href=\"Dolphin\"&gt;Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s chase players riding a boat in motion, occasionally bumping the boat, causing it to shake briefly.\nDestruction.\nAs boats are &lt;a href=\"Entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, they have &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. Boats effectively have just over (exactly 4 damage is not quite enough to destroy a boat), and regenerate per game tick. \nBoats can be destroyed by explosions, fire and lava (but not magma blocks), cactus, and by being punched by mobs, such as &lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt;. Boats made invulnerable with commands cannot be broken by any of these, but they still cannot be used to travel on lava because they sink.\nPassengers.\nBoats can support two riders, including &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Except for &lt;a href=\"Enderman\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; , a mob cannot exit a boat and is trapped until the boat gets destroyed, or until the player uses a &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20Rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; to remove the mob. This can be used to transport mobs, although hostile mobs still attack while in boats. Mobs riding a boat don't despawn and don't count toward the mob cap.\nA player cannot both move (row) and use items at the same time. It is still possible to initialize item use (e.g. start eating) and row the boat while the item is still in the middle of the use animation. Although the rowing animation overrides the item use animation, the item can still be successfully consumed. This does not work with items that are triggered by the \"release\" of the use button (such as &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;tridents&lt;/a&gt;).\nBeing in a boat limits the player's mouse-look to the forward 210\u00b0 arc and 180\u00b0 .\nUnderwater boat cannot be ridden. When the boat is underwater, all passengers in it are expelled.\nDamage prevention.\nRiding a boat does not deplete &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, making it an efficient way to travel.\nBoats can completely nullify &lt;a href=\"fall%20damage\"&gt;fall damage&lt;/a&gt; for themselves and any players/mobs inside, making them useful for travel through mountains or through the Nether. However , due to a bug, boats can break when falling from certain heights, and the riders take fall damage.\nCollision.\nA boat has a solid collision box, which means players and other entities can't go through it even with high speed. Falling blocks are also blocked by boats.\n, a boat falling on top of an entity stops on top of the entity. , a falling boat can go through other entities.\nRiding a boat over a &lt;a href=\"Lily%20Pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt; causes the lily pad to drop, although the boat's speed stutters a bit.\nMobs.\nMost mobs can ride boats. Mobs cannot exit the boat unless the boat is destroyed, sinks, or moves over a bubble column. However, , &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; are able to teleport out of boats.\nMobs can be picked up into the boat when they collide with the side of the boat. A mob cannot control the boat. , a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob. , mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player.\nMobs wider than the width of a boat cannot be picked up by a boat. &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be picked up by a boat. , baby &lt;a href=\"sniffer\"&gt;sniffer&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be picked up either.\nLead.\nLeads can be attached to boats, though the lead can break when stretched too far due to boats moving much slower on land.\nSounds.\nBoats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nBoats have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity."}

The flowers/pink petals that appear depend on the biome, meaning that in order to obtain specific flowers, the player must travel to biomes where the flowers are found naturally. See for more information.\nUsing bone meal on a 2-block flower (rose bushes, sunflowers, lilacs or peonies) will cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original. This is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks.\nUsing bone meal on a non-transparent block that is underwater generates &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt; on that block and surrounding blocks. Sometimes, if in a &lt;a href=\"warm%20ocean\"&gt;warm ocean&lt;/a&gt; biome, &lt;a href=\"coral\"&gt;coral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coral%20fan\"&gt;coral fan&lt;/a&gt;s may have a chance to generate as well, and in Bedrock Edition, coral (not coral fan) can be generated in any biome. In order for this to work, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water.\nUsing bone meal on a &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"coral%20block\"&gt;coral block&lt;/a&gt; creates sea pickles. This generates sea pickles up to 3 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s (of coral) away, so a 7+ \u00d7 7+ block (49+ blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks).\nUsing bone meal on &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; adjacent to &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt; converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type. If both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created.\nUsing bone meal on &lt;a href=\"nylium\"&gt;nylium&lt;/a&gt; causes the corresponding &lt;a href=\"roots\"&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt; and both types of &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; to appear on the nylium block and other nylium nearby, with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common. In addition, using bone meal on the side of warped nylium creates &lt;a href=\"nether%20sprouts\"&gt;nether sprouts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"twisting%20vines\"&gt;twisting vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarmer villagers.\n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s with the farmer profession can collect bone meal from a full &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt;, with which they can make their crops grow faster."}

The chance of dropping a bow is increased by 1% per level of Looting, allowing up to an 11.5% chance of dropping. \nTrading.\nApprentice-level fletcher &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s sell bows for 2 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s as part of their &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;s.\nExpert-level fletcher villagers sell enchanted bows for 7\u201321 emeralds as part of their trades. The enchantment level is equal to enchant level 5\u201319.\nFishing.\nBows have a chance of being caught by &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. When caught, the bow may be damaged and contain random &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s equivalent to a level 30 enchantment from an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;, including treasure enchantments like &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nWeapon.\nBows can be drawn back by them. In order to use a bow, the player must have at least one &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; or be in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode. The arrow that is shown inside the bow always looks like a regular arrow, regardless of what kind of arrow is actually being shot from the bow.\nWhen drawing a bow, the display zooms in slightly. Charging the bow to its maximum causes it to visually shake as an indicator. Releasing the button shoots an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; if it is charged at least 15%. Drawing a bow can be canceled by switching to another hotbar slot while holding use.\nWhile the bow is being charged or remains fully charged, the player is forced to move at &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; speed, unless they are riding a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;, or flying with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;. It is not possible to &lt;a href=\"Sprinting\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; while charging a bow or holding a drawn bow. When the bow is released, normal motion resumes although any prior sprint is cancelled. Sneaking while drawing the bow makes the player move even slower.\nIf an arrow hits another player, the player that shoots the arrow hears a high-pitched \"ding\" sound.\nFully charged shots launch critical arrows which have a trail of &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; behind them and deal up to formula_1damage, where formula_2is the damage after any enchantments. The listed values below describe maximum damage from a bow with no &lt;a href=\"Power\"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; enchantments, assuming the target is at a distance where drag and gravity are negligible. However, the critical damage is likely to be more around 8-10; critical damage is added at a random value between formula_2and formula_1 and it is rare to have minimum or maximum values. The damage dealt can ultimately be less than the maximum damage if the arrow slows down after being shot. \nThe game stores the damage of arrows even in values with a decimal point. For example, it is possible for a critical arrow shot to cause damage values such as 6.4. In this cases of a broken value, the game can round up or down and store the amount for subsequent damage sources.\nAny projectile thrown by the player is under the influence of momentum in current versions of \"Minecraft\". Naturally, the player's movement speed can be modified under a number of circumstances, affecting the ballistic trajectory of projectiles, and as a result, the damage inflicted by arrows.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Combat%20Tests\"&gt;Java Edition Combat Tests&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid sniping, arrows shot from fully-charged bows become non-critical if held drawn back for longer than three seconds. Instantaneous effects on tipped arrows are scaled by 1/8, just like the duration of other effects. For example, Instant Damage I arrow will deal an additional magical damage.\nDamage caused by the arrow is not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; effect.\n&lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears as the enderman teleports, or it gets deflected. Even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows. However, an arrow shot from a bow enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; can ignite the enderman.\nEnchantments.\nBows can receive several different &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s and have a base enchantability of 1. Bow enchantments have no effect on &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; speed or the distance it travels. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, if a bow is enchanted with any level 1 enchantment, it always gets Power I.\nFuel.\nA bow can be used as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per bow or 1 item per bow .\nArrows.\nAs in real life, a flying &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; in \"Minecraft\" is affected by gravity. Its vertical speed is modified by one block downward every second, resulting in a flight path. An arrow slows down if shot through water, reducing its damage to near zero unless brought back into the air or otherwise given momentum.\nArrows that hit solid &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt; become stuck and can be retrieved, unless the arrow was shot by a bow &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;ed with &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, a player in Creative mode, or a mob.\nAn arrow shot through &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; ignites, giving it the effect of the &lt;a href=\"Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, igniting any entity it hits. If not extinguished, the fire inflicts up to damage. Although a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt; does not spawn naturally with bows, if it holds a bow then it also shoots flaming arrows.\nOn impact, an arrow can trigger a wooden &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"target\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; block, &lt;a href=\"wooden%20button\"&gt;wooden button&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt;. Arrows cannot trigger stone pressure plates or stone buttons.\nThe player can choose the type of arrow to shoot based on its location in the inventory. Arrows in the off-hand, or the selected hotbar slot if the bow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first. If there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot then the arrow closest to &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23Slots\"&gt;slot 0&lt;/a&gt; is selected.\nArrows shot by bows in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly higher range than arrows shot by bows in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHistorical sounds:"}

{"id": "9770", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9770", "title": "Breaking", "text": "Breaking, digging, punching, or mining is a common activity in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\", performed (by default) by holding the left mouse button or right trigger while the cursor is pointing at a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, or by long-pressing on the block on touch screens. Breaking is the primary way to remove unwanted blocks and acquiring blocks for future placement or &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasics of breaking.\nBy holding down the button while the player is within range of the target block and while selecting the block, the player's hand begins swinging, making a repetitive \"thump\" sound as the player hits the block, and cracks appear on it while being broken.\n, this range is 5 blocks in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, and 4.5 blocks otherwise. , the range is 5 blocks when using a keyboard/mouse or controller input, and when using touch input, the range is 12 blocks in Creative mode and 6 blocks otherwise.\nBlocks are marked with a wireframe cube outline (or turn a little brighter on touch screens), making the current target easily visible (this can be toggled on and off ). After the cracks completely cover the block, it breaks and depending on the type of block and the &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; used to do so, it may drop an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough many blocks can be harvested with bare hands, certain ones require the use of a &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, to obtain resources from stone or metal-type blocks, the player must use a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. For harder blocks like &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, a pickaxe made from a higher-tier material is required. \nThe player can use &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt;s to speed up the breaking of dirt, wood, and plant-type blocks, respectively. However, tools are not required to get the resource drop. A downside to this is that tools also have &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;, so they eventually wear out.\nIf the tool has the blue tag under its enchantment and name, it will never break. , one can be acquired using the command : codice_1\nThe progress for breaking a block is reset if the target block changes while breaking. Progress is also reset whenever the control is released. The player can move freely while breaking blocks. The player can even dig while jumping, swimming, or riding, although this reduces the breaking speed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, however, some blocks are unbreakable, like &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; mode all blocks are unbreakable unless the player has a item/tool with the NBT tag. In &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode a player can't break blocks in any way, and in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode all blocks are breakable unless the player is holding a sword, trident, or &lt;a href=\"debug%20stick\"&gt;debug stick&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeed.\nThe player's digging speed is controlled by three factors: the block being broken, the item the player is currently wielding, and the mining penalties affecting the player. Every block has a hardness value, which determines the base amount of breaking time if the player hits it with their bare hands.\nThe base time in seconds is the block's hardness multiplied by 1.5 if the player can harvest the block with the current tool, or 5 if the player cannot.\nAssuming that the player can harvest the block, the next check is whether the player's tool increases the breaking speed for the block. See &lt;a href=\"%23Best%20tools\"&gt;Best tools&lt;/a&gt; for a full list.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; helps, then it increases digging speed by a constant multiplier, given in the following table:\nIf a proper tool is used, the tool speed is further increased by the &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. If the level of Efficiency is not 0, then the level squared plus 1 is added to the tool speed. For example, Efficiency I adds 2 to the value, while Efficiency V adds 26. The speed is also increased by (20\u00d7level)% per level of &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; decreases it by 70% for level I, 91% for level II, 97.3% for level III, and 99.19% for all other levels.\nIf the player's head is underwater and they are not wearing a helmet with the &lt;a href=\"Aqua%20Affinity\"&gt;Aqua Affinity&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, breaking a block takes 5 times as long. If the player's feet are not touching the ground, an additional 5x penalty is added; this causes players floating in water to break blocks 25x slower than if they had been standing on land.\nThe total time to break a block is always a multiple of of a second, or 1 game tick; any remainder is rounded up to the next tick.\nInstant breaking.\nWhen breaking a block, a tool and its enchantments do its speed value as \"damage\" to a block every game tick, and when that value exceeds the block's hardness times 30, the block breaks. If the tool and enchantments immediately exceed the hardness times 30, the block breaks with no delay; otherwise a 6 tick ( second) delay occurs before the next block begins to break.\nFor example, a player with &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; II holding an &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency V&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; can break stone instantly, as the damage is (+)\u00d7=47.6, which is greater than the base hardness of stone (1.5) times 30 (which is 45). Players in creative mode always break blocks instantly regardless of tools or status effects, except for when wielding a sword, debug stick or a trident, in which case the player is unable to break anything.\nCalculation.\nCombining all of the information above yields the following pseudo-code to calculate how long in seconds a player takes to mine a certain block. All operations are floating-point, not integer.\nBest tools.\nFastest tools to mine specific blocks:\nBlocks by hardness.\nThe following table shows the time it takes to break each type of block. Values with a red background indicate that it cannot be harvested by that quality of tool. If there is no tool that helps speed up mining that block, the \"tool\" column is left empty. A few blocks are harvested faster with shears or a sword. These speeds are listed in the last two columns if different than \"nothing\".\nNote that some blocks don't drop anything even when mined with the proper tool; these are marked with a yellow background.\nAny blocks with a breaking time of 0.05 seconds or less can be broken without the second (or 6 ticks) delay that occurs between each broken block. See &lt;a href=\"%23Instant%20breaking\"&gt;instant breaking&lt;/a&gt; above.\nAny block that has a hardness of infinity \u221e actually has a hardness of -1. However, the breaking ticks start from 0, which means that effectively it can never break. \n[[ edit values]]"}

Once an animal notices a player holding its food, it follows the player until either the player is out of range, the player stops holding the item, it begins the breeding process, or it is attacked. Baby animals behave the same way. Most animals are uninterested in food &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;lying on the ground&lt;/a&gt;, and those that are do not breed from eating this food; animals breed only when fed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. One item per parent is needed to breed a single baby.\nLove mode.\nWhen an animal is fed its food, it enters \"love mode\", preparing to breed with another animal of the same species that is also in love mode.

The two animals walk into each other for about two and a half seconds, and then drop and end love mode to produce their offspring, the method of which depends on the animal. Most animals immediately spawn a &lt;a href=\"%23Baby_animals\"&gt;baby animal&lt;/a&gt; at the feet of the parents, usually of the same species as their parents, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt;s, which cannot breed with each other and must be bred via the union of a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;. Some animals lay eggs, but the method and location they perform this varies from animal to animal. &lt;a href=\"Chicken\"&gt;Chicken&lt;/a&gt;s are the only animals that can both directly produce babies and lay eggs, as well as the only animals that lay eggs without being fed. After breeding, the parents cannot be fed to breed again for five minutes, but they (and their babies) always follow players holding breeding items. An animal exits love mode if it does not breed 30 seconds after being fed, but it immediately becomes able to be fed and enter love mode again.\nThe number of animals that are produced starting from a single pair of animals, assuming the offspring is fully grown before breeding again, is represented by this sequence:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the .\nThe formula_3th term of the sequence can also be computed with this formula: formula_4 where formula_5 and formula_6 is the . The constant formula_7 is defined to be formula_8 (see &lt;a href=\"https%3A//oeis.org/A083286\"&gt;OEIS A083286&lt;/a&gt;)\nVillagers.\n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s do not breed automatically when given food. Villager breeding depends on both the number of valid &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s in the area (see the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; page for full details), as well as whether the villagers are \"willing.\" A villager may become willing if they have 3 &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, 12 &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, 12 &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, or 12 &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s in their inventory. They may also become willing as a result of &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with a player. When they breed, they produce a smaller &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike many baby animals, baby villagers do not have big heads . &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20villager\"&gt;Zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s cannot breed, and baby zombie villagers do not grow up.\nBaby mobs.\nBaby mobs are smaller variations of their adult counterparts, having small bodies, relatively big heads (with some exceptions), and faster walking speeds. Their sounds are the same as their adult variants but 50% faster and are pitched up by 6 . The only exception to this is &lt;a href=\"tadpole\"&gt;tadpole&lt;/a&gt;s, which are a wholly unique mob from from &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s. Many baby mobs have different interactions or behavior compared to their elders that depends on the mob. For example, lambs cannot be sheared for their &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;, calves, mooshroom calves and kids (baby goats) cannot be &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;ed, and baby piglins take &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ingot\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; but do not &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt;. Most baby mobs do not drop &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; when killed, with the exception of items they pick up. Baby mobs that do drop loot or experience consist of the following:\nMost baby animals choose and follow an adult within 8 blocks of the same species, regardless of whether it is their parent. Babies can choose new targets to follow whenever they do not have a valid target, such as when the previous target dies or moves further than 16 blocks away. Tamed pups and kittens follow their owner if the parent is absent or sitting. Baby animals that do not follow adults consist of:\nBaby mobs that are not animals never follow adult mobs.\nWhen a baby of a species with different fur/pattern variants is born, they usually inherit the pattern of one of their parents, chosen at random, with some exceptions: \nBaby animals can be manually spawned by &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s on a grown animal. This also works on zombies or variants. Baby animals may also be spawned using the command with a negative tag; for example, using spawns a baby sheep at the player's position, that matures in 100 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (5 seconds). For baby mobs that don't grow up like zombies and &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, the tag is used instead.\nMost baby mobs take 20 minutes to grow up. This can be accelerated by feeding them their breeding item. Green sparkles appear similar to those caused by &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, each feeding reduces the remaining time before the animal grows up by 10%. The less time remains, the less time is saved by each feeding, making it inefficient to feed an animal continuously until it becomes an adult. After the eighth feeding, the time saved by one feeding is less than a minute, as shown in the graph. \nHorses, donkeys, and llamas have different mechanics: different breeding items grow babies by different amounts, and each item ages babies by a constant time rather than a percentage of the remaining time. \nBaby &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;zombie villagers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Husk\"&gt;husks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zoglin\"&gt;zoglins&lt;/a&gt; do not grow up, and none of these mobs can breed. \n&lt;a href=\"Polar%20Bear\"&gt;Polar bears&lt;/a&gt; have a baby form that can grow up into an adult, but cannot be bred. This also applies to &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dolphin\"&gt;dolphins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;\"Bedrock Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nMonsters.\nThese are baby versions of mobs that count toward the \"Monster Hunter\" and \"Monsters Hunted\" &lt;a href=\"advancement\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;s or are otherwise &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar mechanics.\nAllay duplication.\nIf an &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt; is given an &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20shard\"&gt;amethyst shard&lt;/a&gt; while it is dancing due to a nearby &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt; playing any &lt;a href=\"Music%20Disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt;, it splits into two allays (itself and a new allay) and the amethyst shard is consumed. After duplication, both allays have a five minute cooldown before being able to duplicate again. Allays do not have a baby form.\nShulker duplication.\nThere is a chance for a new &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt; of the same color to spawn when a shulker is hit with a shulker bullet (including one of its own).\nThe following conditions must be met:\nIf the attempt succeeds a new shulker spawns where the old shulker was before it teleported. Shulkers do not have a baby form, and, other than the above criteria, have no duplication cooldown."}

It attacks at range by firing wind charges. They drop &lt;a href=\"breeze%20rod\"&gt;breeze rod&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be crafted into &lt;a href=\"wind%20charge\"&gt;wind charge&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s. \nAppearance.\nBreezes are very similar to &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s. They have a head that is bright purple on top and dark blue on the bottom with two eyes that have yellow scleras, black pupils, and large white bushy eyebrows that resemble clouds and gives the appearance of it being angry. Underneath the head are three rods that are similar to a &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;. The rods represent its &lt;a href=\"breeze%20rod\"&gt;breeze rod&lt;/a&gt;s. The rods are surrounded by a bunch of lines that resembles a wind tunnel or a tornado. The Breeze is a possible windier cousin of the blaze. A Breeze also hovers slightly above the ground, similar to a Blaze.\nSpawning.\nBreezes spawn from &lt;a href=\"trial%20spawner\"&gt;trial spawner&lt;/a&gt;s surrounded by &lt;a href=\"chiseled%20tuff\"&gt;chiseled tuff&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"trial%20chambers\"&gt;trial chambers&lt;/a&gt;. They spawn specifically from trial spawners that have a rotating, diagonally-oriented breeze inside them, and will stop spawning when the trial is complete.\nBehavior.\nBreezes are immune to damage from &lt;a href=\"projectile\"&gt;projectile&lt;/a&gt;s and able to repel them back. They are also immune to fall damage, much like cats. They leap all around to attack &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; nearby, firing wind charges that burst to switch some &lt;a href=\"redstone%20components\"&gt;redstone components&lt;/a&gt; and knock &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; into the air. The knockback and radius are larger than that of a player-crafted wind charge, allowing it to launch itself around the room it's in. \nDrops.\nBreezes drop breeze rods, which can be used to craft wind charges. Breeze rods are also able to be crafted into the Mace, with the recipe being the breeze rod under and the Heavy Core on top, meaning that you can craft it in your own inventory. They are 100% guaranteed to drop 2-4 wind charges, but it only counts if the damage is listed as a player kill. Any natural deaths, like hovering into lava that the player placed, are not counted. This makes farming wind charges difficult, since they are immune to all traditional afk farming methods, which is why people have designed farms oriented around using dogs and thorns armor to efficiently farm breezes."}

The &lt;a href=\"Fermented%20Spider%20Eye\"&gt;fermented spider eye&lt;/a&gt; is unique in that it is the only modifier that can convert a &lt;a href=\"Potion%23Base%20potions\"&gt;water bottle&lt;/a&gt; directly into an effective potion.\nEnhancement: Generally, upgrading a potion involves a trade-off between duration and potency. A potion with an enhanced effect has shorter duration, and a potion with extended duration cannot have an enhanced effect. However:\nCorrupting effect: A fermented spider eye changes a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion.\nSplash and lingering potions: Any potion can be turned into a &lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently, a lingering potion. Splash and lingering potions can be used best for affecting other entities.\nEffect ingredients.\nEffect ingredients imbue an awkward potion with a particular effect but do not alter potion duration or intensity. When added directly to a water bottle, most of these ingredients produce a mundane potion. The exceptions to this are golden carrot, pufferfish, turtle shell, and phantom membrane, which cannot be added directly to a water bottle.\nBrewing recipes.\nBase potions.\nBase potions are potions without effects, brewed by adding a single base ingredient to a water bottle. Of these, only the awkward potion can be imbued with an effect ingredient to produce a potion effect.\nEffect potions.\nEffect potions are primarily created by adding an effect ingredient to an awkward potion, which is created by adding nether wart to a water bottle. Certain effects require a potion to be corrupted by a fermented spider eye. The potion of &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; can additionally be created by simply adding a fermented spider eye to a water bottle \u2014 and it is the only potion that can be brewed without &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob%23Undead%20mobs\"&gt;Undead mobs&lt;/a&gt; react differently to effects than other mobs. They take damage from potions of &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt;, gain health from potions of &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Harming&lt;/a&gt;, and are unaffected by potions of &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;.\nCures.\nCures are brewed from awkward potions using different &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s. Drinking these removes the specified bad effect. They cannot be modified into splash, lingering, extended, or enhanced versions.\nUnbrewable potions.\nThe potion of &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; and Unbrewable Potion and the potion of &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt; cannot be brewed, and can be obtained only through commands or the &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23Creative%20inventory\"&gt;Creative inventory&lt;/a&gt;."}

Mojang hired two new programmers to work on the game, and a prototype was created by Notch.\nBefore the title had reached a significant stage of development, Mojang cancelled the collaboration to focus on developing their own titles (\"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Scrolls\"&gt;Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"0x10c\"&gt;0x10c&lt;/a&gt;\" at the time). Notch claimed at the time that the game had been a first-person shooter.\nThe game's true nature remained unknown to the public until \"Brickcraft\"'s existence was revealed in December 2020 in an episode of the \"Bits N' Bricks\" podcast, created by The Lego Group to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the first LEGO video game. Daniel Mathiasen, a Lego Group employee at the time, blamed the cancellation on a series of legal hurdles that The Lego Group had put in place to protect the product's family-friendly image, with Daniel Kaplan claiming that the staff at Mojang had felt more like consultants on the project, rather than its designers.\nDespite the cancellation, The Lego Group remained partnered with Mojang to produce &lt;a href=\"LEGO%20Minecraft\"&gt;LEGO Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; sets, and briefly considered acquiring Mojang, but according to Ronny Scherer, the senior director for the LEGO Games Asia/Pacific division, they decided against it as \"Minecraft\" \"was still emerging\" and they had \"no guarantee that it would end up becoming the cultural phenomenon that it became\"."}

It also prevents such blocks from being given through less conventional methods, such as inventory editing, &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;. Until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;1.7.2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;, there had been a wide variety of blocks that could be edited into the inventory; over time, however, the game was updated so that these blocks became entirely unavailable, even though one utilized inventory editing. From &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt; onwards, blocks and items are completely different concepts, and numerical IDs no longer exist at all.\nCurrently, the game only accepts &lt;a href=\"resource%20location\"&gt;resource location&lt;/a&gt;s (such as codice_1) in most commands, and uses these resource locations when assigning blocks to the inventory and save files. The old method of obtaining a block via numerical IDs is no longer an option because the numerical id method codice_2 is no longer used in command codice_3. In addition, the game automatically removes blocks with illegitimate resource locations from the inventory, so using inventory editors is also no longer an option . Furthermore, certain blocks with both block and &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; forms, such as codice_4, cannot be obtained in their block form in the inventory; however, since the game has a corresponding item named codice_4, the item form is given instead. The only option is modifying game's class where registered items and ItemBlocks (direct item forms of blocks) in order to register and obtain them. \nDespite never being intended to be obtainable, some of these could even be acquired in survival using unusual means.\nList.\n\"The following data is based on the last version each item existed in.\"\nRemovals.\nAll of the following block items were removed at one point, as clarified in the following paragraphs.\nIn snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w37a\"&gt;13w37a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;, the command was modified so that it would display the name of the item in chat. In fact, this change could not remove ItemBlocks, another change was necessary. Due to this, codice_6 was added which \"removes\" the item forms of blocks in the list of its list. Due to this, 26 blocks were made unavailable.\nIn snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w25a\"&gt;14w25a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;1.8&lt;/a&gt;, changes were made to the way the icons of items were rendered, and the way block data was internally represented. Similar to 13w37a, this change could not remove ItemBlocks, another change was necessary. Due to this, codice_7 method was added, which \"adds\" the item form of respective block. Due to this, 12 blocks were made unavailable. \nBedrock Edition.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, some of the items can only be obtained from inventory editing."}

Moreover, it has the capability to replace &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"granite\"&gt;granite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"andesite\"&gt;andesite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"diorite\"&gt;diorite&lt;/a&gt;, polished granite, polished andesite, polished diorite, &lt;a href=\"tuff\"&gt;tuff&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"deepslate\"&gt;deepslate&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nDirt drops as an item when broken with any tool or by hand, but a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; is the quickest way to break it.\n&lt;a href=\"Farmland\"&gt;Farmland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dirt%20Path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s, grass blocks, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; drop dirt if broken without &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. Farmland and dirt paths drop dirt even if broken with Silk Touch.\nMob loot.\nAn &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; drops a dirt block upon death, if holding one.\nPost-generation.\n&lt;a href=\"Farmland\"&gt;Farmland&lt;/a&gt; turns into dirt if either a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; jumps on it, a solid block is placed over it, or if nothing is planted on it and it is not within four blocks of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dirt%20path\"&gt;Dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s immediately turns into dirt if a solid block is placed over it.\n&lt;a href=\"Coarse%20Dirt\"&gt;Coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt; can be tilled with a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; to become dirt.\nTilling &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt; with a hoe turns it into normal dirt, and yields a &lt;a href=\"hanging%20roots\"&gt;hanging roots&lt;/a&gt; item.\nGrass blocks and &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; can die under various circumstances. When they die, they turn into dirt.\nRenewable acquisition.\nBy tilling coarse dirt, the player can convert &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; into dirt. Two blocks each of gravel and dirt become four blocks of coarse dirt, which can then be placed and tilled. Since gravel is renewable through &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, this makes a renewable source of dirt.\nAnother way to obtain renewable dirt makes use of &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Azalea\"&gt;Azalea&lt;/a&gt; converts the moss block below it into rooted dirt when grown into a &lt;a href=\"azalea%20tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;. , Large &lt;a href=\"spruce\"&gt;spruce tree&lt;/a&gt;s convert up to about 100 moss blocks into podzol when grown. Since moss can be converted from stone using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, and stone can be renewably generated with water and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, dirt can be renewably created as long as there is access to water, lava and moss blocks.\nA third way to obtain renewable dirt is by buying podzol or rooted dirt from &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s. However, only 18 blocks of podzol or 10 blocks of rooted dirt can be purchased from each trader, so this method cannot be performed on a large scale.\nUsage.\nDirt's primary use is for farming, but it can also be used as a highly available building block.\nFarming.\nDirt has the ability to grow &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sweet%20berries\"&gt;sweet berries&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, which can be planted directly in dirt under appropriate conditions.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; on dirt turns it into &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;, enabling &lt;a href=\"wheat%20seeds\"&gt;wheat seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20seeds\"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"melon%20seeds\"&gt;melon seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"beetroot%20seeds\"&gt;beetroot seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pitcher%20pod\"&gt;pitcher pods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"torchflower%20seeds\"&gt;torchflower seeds&lt;/a&gt; to be planted on it.\nDirt path.\n a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; on dirt turns it into a &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrass and mycelium spreading.\nWhen a dirt block is adjacent to a grass block and is exposed to a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of at least 4, it is eventually converted into a grass block at random intervals.\n&lt;a href=\"Mycelium\"&gt;Mycelium&lt;/a&gt; spreads in a similar fashion, but requires a light level of at least 9.\nMud.\n a &lt;a href=\"water%20bottle\"&gt;water bottle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"splash%20water%20bottle\"&gt;splash water bottle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lingering%20water%20bottle\"&gt;lingering water bottle&lt;/a&gt; will convert the dirt into &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;.\nData values.\nBlock states.\n, dirt uses the following block states:"}

A dirt path has the highest hardness value of all blocks mineable with a shovel.\n, a dirt path block can be directly obtained with a &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; tool.\n, dirt paths always drop &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; when broken. Dirt path blocks can be obtained only via the &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23Creative%20inventory\"&gt;Creative inventory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, or . They can still be created from placed dirt, however, by a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; on dirt, as described in below.\nNatural generation.\nDirt paths are naturally generated in &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s when pathways replace &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTheir purpose is aesthetics, and additionally , &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Preferred%20path\"&gt;pathfinding&lt;/a&gt; for villagers. Most dirt paths connect to village structures and houses.\nDirt paths also generate as part of some village structures.\nAlthough they can't be placed that way by the player, village generation can cause them to appear under other blocks.\nPost-generation.\nDirt paths can be created by any type of &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; on the side or top of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt; that has air above it. The shovel then loses one &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nDirt paths are primarily used for decoration, although they also prevent hostile mobs from spawning. They are a similar color to &lt;a href=\"grass%20blocks\"&gt;grass blocks&lt;/a&gt; placed in a desert or savanna biome. They are only of a block high, therefore items that require a full block like &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be placed on them. &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt; prefer to use dirt paths the most when routing compared to any other block.\nA dirt path block converts to dirt instantly if a block with a solid &lt;a href=\"material\"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt; is placed on top of it.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; on dirt path converts it to &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt;. Since dirt path can be created with any variant of dirt, it can be used as an intermediate step to convert &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, which cannot be tilled directly, into farmland."}

If mined without a pickaxe, the dispenser drops only its contents.\nNatural generation.\nTwo dispensers are naturally generated in every &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;, and many generate throughout trial chambers.\nUsage.\nA dispenser can be used as a container and as a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20component\"&gt;redstone component&lt;/a&gt; that dispenses items when activated, with results varying based on the item dispensed. For example, the trap in a &lt;a href=\"jungle%20pyramid\"&gt;jungle pyramid&lt;/a&gt; incorporates &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s inside a dispenser, which shoots the arrows when activated. \nTo place a dispenser, it while pointing at a surface adjacent to the space it should occupy. A dispenser can be placed so that its output faces in any direction, including up or down. When placed, a dispenser faces the location of the player placing it.\nA dispenser cannot be moved by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s.\nContainer.\nA dispenser has 9 slots of inventory space.\nTo open the dispenser GUI, use the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;. To move items between the dispenser inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the dispenser GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the dispenser GUI, use the control.\nBy default, the GUI of a dispenser is labeled \"Dispenser\". A dispenser's GUI label can be changed by naming the dispenser in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; before placing it, or by using the &lt;a href=\"Commands/data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; command. For example, to label a dispenser at (0,64,0) \"My Dispenser\", use codice_1.\nA dispenser can be \"locked\" by setting the dispenser's codice_2 tag. If a dispenser's codice_2 tag is not blank, the dispenser cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the codice_2 tag's text. A dispenser's codice_2 tag can be set or unset with the &lt;a href=\"Commands%23data\"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; command. For example, to lock a dispenser at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"My Key\" can access the dispenser, use codice_6.\nRedstone component.\nA dispenser can be used to dispense its contents randomly.\nA dispenser is a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Mechanism%20components\"&gt;redstone mechanism&lt;/a&gt; and can be activated by:\nSome of these methods can \"activate\" a dispenser (in the sense of triggering an action) without \"powering\" the dispenser (in the sense of whether the dispenser can power adjacent redstone dust, etc.).\nIn addition to the methods above, a dispenser can also be activated by &lt;a href=\"quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity&lt;/a&gt;. A dispenser becomes activated if one of the methods above \"would\" activate a mechanism component in the block above the dispenser, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the dispenser is &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; or a transparent block), but only when the dispenser receives a block update (including a redstone update within two blocks of the dispenser). A dispenser does not activate if it has been less than 1 &lt;a href=\"redstone%20tick\"&gt;redstone tick&lt;/a&gt; (2 game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag) since its last activation ended.\nWhen activated, a dispenser waits for 2 redstone ticks (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) and then ejects one item. The dispenser does not continue to eject items while activated; ejection occurs only on the initial activation (the &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23Pulses\"&gt;rising edge&lt;/a&gt; of an input signal). To eject multiple items, repeatedly activate the dispenser with a &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt;. If the clock runs at faster than 5\u00a0Hz (more than 5 redstone pulses a second), the dispenser fires once and then locks in the \"on\" position.\nIf multiple slots are occupied by items, a random occupied slot is chosen for ejection. The slot is chosen when an item is ejected, not when the dispenser is initially activated; thus it is possible to move items into or out of a dispenser between its activation and item dispensing.\nThe effects of being activated vary with the type of ejected item. Most items are thrown in the direction the dispenser is facing as if a player had used the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;. (Unlike a &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;, a dispenser can't feed another container.) Other items behave differently when dispensed, as described in the table below. In general, a dispenser \"cannot\" place blocks into the world; the exceptions are shulker boxes, powder snow, and certain cases where the placed block would do something unusual. There are also a couple of special cases where an empty bottle or bucket can \"collect\" liquids from the world. When dispensing an item that has &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; would cause the item to be used, such as with &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20Steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;, the item's durability decreases.\nWhen a dispenser dispenses an item, it emits a clicking sound (unless the item is a projectile or a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;) and a &lt;a href=\"Particles\"&gt;smoke particle&lt;/a&gt;. If it is empty when activated, it emits a slightly higher-pitched click. The noise of a dispenser can be heard up to 16 blocks away.\nA dispenser is a full solid opaque block, so powering it directly can cause adjacent &lt;a href=\"mechanism%20component\"&gt;mechanism component&lt;/a&gt;s (including other dispensers) to activate as well.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA dispenser has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nSee also.\nSome other blocks can also be used to move items:"}

They do not obstruct the placement of blocks, nor do they push players or other entities away from their own position. Unlike &lt;a href=\"marker\"&gt;marker&lt;/a&gt;s, display entities are sent to the client for rendering and do count towards in the value (total amount of entities) listed on the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDisplay entities have no hitbox. Using the &lt;a href=\"Debug_screen%23More_debug-keys\"&gt;debug key combination&lt;/a&gt; , which normally draws the hitboxes of all visible entities, does not show a hitbox for display entities.

{"id": "93671", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=93671", "title": "Dolphin", "text": "Dolphins are neutral &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that live in non-frozen &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, which grant a speed boost to &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s that &lt;a href=\"swim\"&gt;swim&lt;/a&gt; near them.\nSpawning.\nDolphins are found in groups (pods) of 3\u20135 in all &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; biomes, except frozen oceans and cold oceans. They spawn exclusively between levels 50 and 64.\nDolphins continuously spawn as long as their spawn requirements are met, and naturally despawn if no players are near by, similar to &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;. \n, dolphins and squids together make up the water creatures &lt;a href=\"mob%20cap\"&gt;mob cap&lt;/a&gt;.\n10% of dolphins spawn as babies.\nDrops.\nWhen killed, dolphins drop 0\u20131 ( if on fire). The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt;, for a maximum of 0\u20134 with Looting III. are dropped as well.\nBehavior.\nDolphins normally swim in pods, occasionally leaping out of the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; to get air. They are also able to jump from one body of water to another. Additionally, they chase after &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPlayers who &lt;a href=\"Swimming%23Sprint-swimming\"&gt;sprint-swim&lt;/a&gt; within a 9 block spherical radius of a dolphin receive &lt;a href=\"Dolphin%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Dolphin's Grace&lt;/a&gt; for 5 seconds. Players who already have Dolphin's Grace and continue to sprint-swim within a 15 block spherical radius of a dolphin will have it replenished. Players with &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; do not receive the effect unless they already had Dolphin's Grace before receiving Invisibility, or if they are wearing armor. The dolphin keeps following the player as long as they are sprint-swimming, allowing the player to swim under the speed boost for long distances. , the player simply gets a swimming speed boost without a status effect.\nDolphins are lured by &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;dropped item&lt;/a&gt;s that are inside nearby water blocks, knocking them around and chasing them. If the dolphin can not find a path to a dropped item, the dolphin may stay underwater to the point of &lt;a href=\"drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt;. If the dolphin is in, or on, a &lt;a href=\"waterlogged\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; bottom &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; block above, the dolphin is prevented from drowning. \nShould the player or another mob hit a dolphin (unless the dolphin is killed within one hit), the whole pod retaliates, attacking all at once similar to &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. Hostile dolphins remain hostile even if they are fed fish.\nFeeding dolphins &lt;a href=\"raw%20cod\"&gt;raw cod&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raw%20salmon\"&gt;raw salmon&lt;/a&gt; improves their \"trust\" and interactions with the player, depending on the amount of fish fed. \nWhen dolphins are fed raw cod or raw salmon, they swim to the nearest &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Because they are locating the &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; in the structures rather than the structures themselves, breaking the chests causes the dolphin to locate a new structure with intact chests. Dolphins also avoid &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWeaknesses.\nIf a dolphin leaves the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in dry weather, it starts taking suffocation damage after two minutes, and eventually dies. It takes no damage out of water during &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of weather, a dolphin on land actively seeks out a body of water, or seeks its target if in a hostile state.\nThey cannot survive without getting air every once in a while, so if they stay submerged for about 4 minutes they begin &lt;a href=\"drowning\"&gt;drowning&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; effect prevents them from drowning.\nDolphins cannot ride &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, similarly to &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; and all types of fish.\nDolphins can be towed by a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause the dolphin is an aquatic &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;, they are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. \nSounds.\nDolphins use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nDolphins have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

This causes the player to swim significantly faster and lose speed at a slower rate, but also makes changing directions slower. Dolphin's Grace on its own allows you to travel 9.8 m/s underwater without &lt;a href=\"Depth%20Strider\"&gt;Depth Strider&lt;/a&gt;, making it faster than a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;. Combining it with Depth Strider, players are able to travel at much higher speeds, adding 8.983 m/s per level. Potentially higher speeds are possible by adding &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt; underwater and using &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted boots, along with &lt;a href=\"Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; II.\nDolphin's Grace only affects horizontal movement speed. Vertical movement is not affected.\nThis status effect is exclusive to . Although players are also able to experience a significant gain in speed if the same conditions as in \"Java Edition\" are met, it is not considered a status effect as no effect icon is shown.\nDolphins do not give this effect to players with the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; effect, unless their invisibility is reduced by having at least one &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; piece or headgear equipped. So wear at least one armor piece to have Dolphin's Grace and Invisibility effect at the same time for the advancement \"How Did We Get Here?\"."}

Donkeys also spawn in &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;s. 20% of the individual donkeys spawn as foals.\nBedrock Edition.\n2-6 donkeys spawn only in plains at light level 7 or above.\nAppearance.\nAdult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Foals start at half the size of adults and , get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, the appearances of donkeys do not change once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment.\nDonkeys are smaller all around than the normal horses and sport long, erect ears. Their manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks. All donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails. Donkeys can be equipped with a simple saddle, not the full covered armor and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items.\nUnlike almost all other mobs, donkeys with equipped saddles or chests do not render these when under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nUpon death, donkeys drop:\nIf equipped with a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;, they drop those items. They also drop the contents of the chest.\nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped.\nKilling a baby donkey yields no items nor experience.\nUsage.\nTamed and &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;d donkeys are some of the fastest means of transportation or hauling in the game, although they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences, which the player can't generally.\nDonkeys cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\nDonkeys can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals. They can also be pulled along and tied up using a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nTamed donkeys can have the following &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt; available:\nEquipment can be placed on a donkey by holding left shift and then on the donkey, or by accessing its inventory. A donkey\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the donkey and using control, or by and then or pressing the \"open inventory\" button on the donkey.\nA donkey can be equipped with a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; by a chest on a donkey. The chest cannot be removed except by killing the donkey, which causes the chest and its contents to drop.\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\nRiding.\nOnce a donkey is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls, , and the mouse. The player dismounts using the control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; while on a donkey.\nA ridden saddled donkey automatically runs up any one block high slope. The donkey and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The donkey itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. They cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\nUnlike horses, all spawned donkeys have the same movement speed and jump strength, although speed potions can be used on the donkey and travel via the Nether can make the donkey easily the pack animal with the fastest practical way to travel in \"Minecraft\". Donkeys are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\nRidden saddled donkeys have the ability of \"jumping charging\". When the player rides them, the experience bar on &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled donkey can be made to and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Donkeys are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\nBehavior.\nDonkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. A donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near. Any donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; without protest. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves. Donkeys remain passive, even when hit.\nDonkeys occasionally emit an audible braying sound.\nAdult Donkeys, unlike most mobs, cannot ride in a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; and boat. Foals, however, can. Unlike other passive mobs, donkeys slowly regenerate health.\nTaming.\nAdult donkeys can be tamed. With an empty hand, mount it repeatedly; when it shows hearts and no longer bucks the player, it is tamed. It is necessary to tame a donkey in order to breed it, give it equipment, or ride it for any length of time. \nTaming depends on the donkey's \"temper\". They begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the donkey, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The donkey becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.\nWhile riding an untamed donkey, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid. This gives a general idea of the donkey's speed. It is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed.\nBreeding.\nFeeding tamed donkeys &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s activates &lt;a href=\"love%20mode\"&gt;love mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe offspring appear more spindly than their adult versions and grow progressively larger with time until they reach their full size. The offspring do not automatically belong to the player who owns their parents. Rather, it is born as an untamed donkey and must be tamed after it grows into an adult. The foal can be fed to make it mature faster.\nBreeding two donkeys creates a donkey foal. Because all donkeys have the same texture, the offspring looks exactly like its parents when it is fully grown.\nCross-breeding a donkey with a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; creates a &lt;a href=\"mule\"&gt;mule&lt;/a&gt; foal. Mules cannot breed.\nFood.\nFeeding a donkey food may alter its behavior and cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and restore its health.\nTo feed a donkey, hold a valid food item and press while looking at it. If the food is invalid, the action is treated as an attempt to mount the donkey. Donkeys can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. The table below lists the effects of the various foods donkeys can consume.\nStatistics.\nAll donkeys have three \"equine stats\" that vary between donkeys: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the donkey is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\nSpawned values.\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs \u2013 donkeys are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\nHealth.\nDonkey's health ranges from 15\u201330, but tends toward the average 22\u201323. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A donkey with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not display the last half-heart. If the donkey has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\nMovement speed.\nA spawned donkey's speed value is always 0.175, but it only moves at the slightly reduced 7.38 blocks/sec. For reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1, equivalent to 4.3 blocks/sec. and the player's sprinting speed is equivalent to 5.6 blocks/sec. The speed listed does not include any &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; that affects the speed of a horse or a player.\nA bred donkey's speed value has the same limits as other horses, between 0.1125 and 0.3375. See &lt;a href=\"Horse%23Movement%20speed\"&gt;Horse#Movement speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"Transportation%23Methods\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt;\" to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\nJump strength.\nA spawned donkey's jump strength is always 0.5, enough to clear blocks. A bred donkey's jump strength has the same limits as other horses, between 0.4 and 1.0. See &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Horses%23Speed\"&gt;Tutorials/Horses#Speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nBred values.\nWhen breeding two donkeys, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined the same way &lt;a href=\"Horse%23Statistics\"&gt;horses' stats&lt;/a&gt; are.\nSounds.\nDonkeys use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nDonkeys have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

Some have built-in openings that are useful for determining the time of day.\nBreaking.\nWooden doors can be broken with anything, but &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s are fastest. An iron door can only be broken with any &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s, otherwise it will drop nothing. Copper doors can only be broken with a stone pickaxe or higher, once again, they will drop nothing if broken with anything else. All doors drop themselves if they no longer have a block beneath them that can support them.\nA door is removed and drops itself as an item:\nNatural generation.\nDoors generate in some generated structures, forming the entrances to the majority of buildings.

Waxed copper doors do not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.\nScraping.\n an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; on a waxed copper door turns it into the respective non-waxed copper door. In addition, using an axe on an exposed, weathered, or oxidized copper door reverts it one stage to a regular, exposed, or weathered copper door respectively.\nLightning strike.\nNon-waxed copper doors are completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed copper doors nearby are deoxidized randomly.\nUsage.\nWooden doors and copper doors can be opened and closed by players, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s. Wooden doors can be broken by all variants of &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s (except &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s in Hard difficulty.\nIron doors can be opened only with redstone power.\nPlacement.\nDoors must be \"attached\" to a block beneath them. To place a door, a door item while pointing at the top of the block it should be attached to. A door can be attached to:\nMore information about placement on transparent blocks can be found at &lt;a href=\"Opacity/Placement\"&gt;Opacity/Placement&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen placed, a door occupies the side of the block facing the player, or behind a player if placed in the player's own space.\nBy default, a door's \"hinge\" appears on the side of the half of the block that the player pointed at when placing and its \"handle\" on the opposite side, but the hinge is forced to other side by:\nBehavior.\n&lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow around doors. Lava can create &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; in air blocks next to wooden doors as if the wooden doors were flammable, but the doors do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either, except throwing them into lava).\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn in a space occupied by a door.\nThe sound of opening and closing of a door can be heard up to 16 blocks away, like most mob sounds.\nWhen placed using the command, only one half of a door is placed, because doors are actually two separate blocks. The lower half still works, but with graphical bugs, and the upper half does not. Redstone cannot be used because it updates the half, breaking it. The upper half does not drop anything when broken, the lower half drops a normal door. This implies that the upper half is dependent on the lower.\nBarrier.\nA door can be used as a switchable barrier to entity movement. Although primarily used to block movement by mobs and players, a door can also be used to control the movement of boats (for example, a door placed in a two-wide water flow stops a boat when perpendicular to the flow, but allow it to move again when parallel), items and minecarts (a door can stop a falling item or minecart, then allow it to drop again when the door moves), etc.\n, doors provide a breathable space if placed underwater. , doors in water source blocks are &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; and do not displace water source blocks.\nDoors are 0.1875 () blocks thick (0.1825 ). The rest of a door's space can be moved through freely. A door occupies two block spaces and both halves normally act as a single barrier, although doors can be opened or closed with a player or mob occupying the bottom block of the door, in which case the player can jump up to land on the bottom half of the door and then again to land on top of the door.\nTo open or close a wooden door, use the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;. When a door opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it \"swings through\". Moving doors do not push entities the way that pistons do.\n&lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;Villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s can open and close wooden doors when pathfinding.\nSome &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s can break wooden doors in &lt;a href=\"Hard\"&gt;Hard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Zombies have a 5% chance to spawn with the ability to break doors. Vindicators spawned from a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Normal\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt; and Hard difficulty can also break wooden doors, but they do so only to reach targeted players, villagers, or wandering traders. Some vindicators may sometimes open a wooden door instead of breaking it. Both zombies and vindicators attempt to break wooden doors only when in their \"closed\" state, even if a door is placed so that its \"open\" state blocks access (for example, by facing sideways when placing a door so that it allows passage when closed and blocks passage when open).\nIron doors can be opened only with redstone power (a &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Any mob can activate an iron door by stepping on a pressure plate or by triggering a tripwire.\nRedstone component.\nBoth wood and iron doors can be controlled with redstone power.\nA door is a redstone &lt;a href=\"mechanism%20component\"&gt;mechanism component&lt;/a&gt; and can be activated by:\nAll methods of activating a door can be applied to either the top or bottom parts of a door.\nWhen activated, a door immediately rotates around its hinge side to its open state. When deactivated, a door immediately returns to its closed state.\nAn activated wood door can still be closed by a player or villager and does not re-open until it receives a new activation signal (if a door has been closed \"by hand\", it still needs to be deactivated and then reactivated to open by redstone).\nFuel.\nOverworld wooden doors can be used as a &lt;a href=\"Smelting%23Fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1 item per door.\nNote blocks.\nWooden doors can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sound.\nVideo.\nNote: The videos do not mention or state Crimson, Warped, Bamboo, or Cherry doors, since the videos were uploaded before 1.16.\nHistory.\n\"For a history of changes to textures and models for each block state, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\"\nHistorical sounds:"}

If all air blocks in that area are filled so there is nowhere for the egg to teleport to, or if it fails to find an air block after 1,000 attempts at teleporting, it can be mined. The dragon egg is a gravity-affected block, and drops as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; when pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; or when it falls onto a block &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;less than a full block tall&lt;/a&gt;, such as a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; or a bottom &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen destroyed by an &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;, the block \"always\" drops as an item.\nThe dragon egg is not immune to destruction by the ender dragon, despite being produced by it.\nUsage.\nThe dragon egg, if there is no block below it, falls until it lands on the next available block. When it is being affected by gravity and falling, it exhibits a smooth falling animation.\nIt does not &lt;a href=\"suffocate\"&gt;suffocate&lt;/a&gt; mobs or players when it falls and covers them, nor does it crush mobs or players like &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stalactite\"&gt;stalactite&lt;/a&gt;s do.\nThe dragon egg can be placed on a non-solid block without falling.\nLike other falling blocks, when the dragon egg is floating, it has black particles falling from it.\nLight source.\nThe dragon egg emits a &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt; of 1.\nTeleporting.\nTo cause the egg to teleport, press while in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; mode (press in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;).

However, using a different fuel source to smelt pieces of kelp that are then crafted into dried kelp blocks, the number of operations per fuel is effectively increased.

Most mobs have certain items that they may drop when killed. Some common drops, such as &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, don't always drop, but have a large chance (at least 50%, depending on the drop range) to do so. Some common drops, such as &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s, don't drop at all if the mob was not killed by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach of these items has a drop range, which is a random of numbers of items that drop. For example, a &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt; drops 0\u20132 leather items and 1\u20133 &lt;a href=\"raw%20beef\"&gt;raw beef&lt;/a&gt; items. Because the range for leather includes 0, there is a chance of no leather being dropped.\nA &lt;a href=\"baby%20animal\"&gt;baby animal&lt;/a&gt; does not drop any common drops upon death. \nLooting.\nSome common and uncommon drops are affected by the &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. At most, a number of additional items equal to enchantment level are dropped.\nMore specifically, the game generates a fractional number ranging from 0 to the Looting level, which is then rounded to the nearest integer. This causes the numbers in the middle of drop range to occur twice as often. The probabilities are as follows:\nA &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;'s tipped &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; is a special case: while Looting can attempt to increase arrow drop amount, the final number of dropped arrows is capped at 1. So, Looting effectively increases arrow dropping odds, up to with Looting III.\nRare drops.\n\"Rare drops\" normally appear if the monster is killed by a player, although some rare drops can also be obtained by other means. Rare drops are always a single item, but may appear in conjunction with other common drops. A drop is considered rare if they are accompanied by the codice_1 condition in the mob's &lt;a href=\"loot%20table\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt;.\nRare drops typically have a 2.5% chance of dropping, plus 1 percentage point per level of &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; on the weapon used (up to a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III). An exception to this is that a &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; drops a &lt;a href=\"rabbit%27s%20foot\"&gt;rabbit's foot&lt;/a&gt; with a 10% chance, plus 3 percentage points per level of Looting (to a maximum of 19% with Looting III). there are other exceptions: a &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt; drops a &lt;a href=\"Head\"&gt;wither skeleton skull&lt;/a&gt; with a 2.5% chance plus 2 percentage points per level of Looting (to a maximum of 8.5% with Looting III), and a &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; drops a &lt;a href=\"copper%20ingot\"&gt;copper ingot&lt;/a&gt; with an 11% chance plus 2 percentage points per level of looting (to a maximum of 17% with Looting III).\nNote that in case of multiple rare drops (&lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; types) the 2.5% chance is split between them, instead of being rolled for each item.\nThe &lt;a href=\"shulker%20shell\"&gt;shulker shell&lt;/a&gt; is technically also a rare drop, only ever dropping in singles from &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, although they don't require a player kill, have a 50% base chance, and increase by 6.25% per Looting level.\nEquipped items.\nWhen killed by a player or a tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, a monster can drop equipment and armor that it spawned with. Each piece of equipment the monster was spawned with is dropped with an 8.5% chance or 25% chance, except &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"jack%20o%27lantern\"&gt;jack o'lantern&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;'s iron sword, which have a 0% chance. This value is determined by the mob's &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format/Mob\"&gt;codice_2 and codice_3&lt;/a&gt; tags. The &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; enchantment increases this chance by 1% per level (up to 11.5% with Looting III, and 3% for pumpkins, jack o'lanterns, and said sword) or 5% per level in some cases. The chance is rolled for each piece of equipment, so it is possible for a monster to drop more than one piece of equipment upon death.\nThere are also some equipped items that are guaranteed to drop:\nExperience orbs.\n\"Experience orbs\" drop only if a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; dies less than three seconds after being attacked (melee, bow, snowballs, eggs, and potions causing instant damage) by a player or by a player's pet &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, though not by a player-activated &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;. Their total value is the specific amount of experience granted by killing that mob. They are also dropped from a thrown &lt;a href=\"bottle%20o%27%20enchanting\"&gt;bottle o' enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. Collected experience accumulates into levels, which can be used for &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"repairing\"&gt;repairing&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other drops, such as &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, experience orbs appear at the location of the mob's corpse at the moment it disappears in a puff of smoke. Experience orbs move toward any nearby players.\nMob drops.\nHostile mobs.\nWeapons, tools, and armor dropped by mobs have at least 25 durability remaining, which is also the most common. Less-damaged items are increasingly rare.\nExcept for gold swords and tools, items always have at least 26 points of damage taken. Gold items can be dropped un-damaged.\nBlock drops.\nMost blocks drop themselves when broken.

{"id": "95103", "revid": "49394786", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=95103", "title": "Drowned", "text": "Drowned are common underwater &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; variants that spawn in &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dripstone%20caves\"&gt;dripstone caves&lt;/a&gt;, or when zombies drown. They usually attack through melee attacks, but may also come armed with &lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;tridents&lt;/a&gt; that they throw. They are the only source of tridents, and the only &lt;a href=\"renewable\"&gt;renewable&lt;/a&gt; source of &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nNatural generation.\nDrowned spawn naturally at light level of 0 in all &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, aquifiers in the &lt;a href=\"dripstone%20caves\"&gt;dripstone caves&lt;/a&gt; biome, and &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; biomes. They spawn at higher rates in rivers and dripstone caves than in ocean biomes.\n, drowned spawn individually inside flowing water or source water that is 2 blocks or taller (this can include waterlogged blocks). In ocean biomes, drowned spawn at Y &lt; 58, or at least 6 blocks below sea level; this restriction does not apply to rivers. \n, drowned spawn in groups of 2\u20134 inside flowing water or source water of any depth, but they spawn at higher rates in water that is 2 blocks or taller. They spawn only on the surface that is on the highest spawnable block at any given X, Z coordinate. They count toward the monster population control cap and also have their own density caps of 5 in oceans and 2 in rivers. \nDrowned have a chance to spawn with either a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally with a &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;. , they also have a small chance of spawning while riding a chicken, creating a drowned &lt;a href=\"chicken%20jockey\"&gt;chicken jockey&lt;/a&gt;. They are the only zombie variant within the game that cannot spawn naturally with any armor. The only way drowned can spawn with armor is if they used to be a zombie with armor. Their eyes give off a glow effect, but not any light levels.\nOcean ruins.\nDrowned spawn during the generation of certain &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruin\"&gt;ocean ruin&lt;/a&gt; structures. These drowned do not naturally despawn unless the world is set to Peaceful difficulty.\nConversion.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;'s head (not the legs) is submerged in water continuously for 30 seconds, it begins the process of converting to a drowned. It starts shaking, similar to the effect seen while a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; is being cured. At this point, the process cannot be stopped, and 15 seconds later the zombie becomes drowned. The drowned appears with full health even if the previous zombie did not.\n only, an item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability.\nOnly normal zombies can transform, while &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s and zombified piglin can not. For &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, they first transform into a regular zombie, and subsequently convert to a drowned in the usual fashion. The zombie that converted from a husk also always has full health even if converted from a damaged husk.\nDrops.\nDrowned drop 0\u20132 after dying. The maximum drop is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-5 with Looting III.\nAdult drowned drop 5 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player or tamed wolf. Baby drowned drop 12 and an additional 1\u20133 per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can also drop:\nAny picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping, and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.\nIf a drowned is able to pick up equipment and is wielding a trident, it can trade its trident for a nautilus shell if it is not currently attacking anything.[\"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; only\"]\nNaturally-spawned equipment.\nFor naturally-spawned drowned:\nOnly 6.25% (or 1 in 16) drowned spawn with tridents. Of these, they have an 8.5% chance to drop their trident when killed by a player. The chance is increased by 1% for each level of looting up to a max of 11.5% with Looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident from any given drowned is 0.53125% (about 1 in 188) or 0.71875% with looting III.\nNautilus shells always drop.\nConverted drowned are never equipped with any items.\nFor naturally-spawned drowned:\nOnly 15% (or 3 in 20) drowned spawn with tridents. Of these, they have a 25% chance to drop their trident when killed by a player. This chance is increased by 4% for each level of looting up to a max of 37% with looting III. This means the overall chance of obtaining a trident from any given drowned is 3.75% (or 3 in 80) or 5.55% with looting III.\nFor converted drowned:\nConverted drowned are never equipped with tridents.\nOn Halloween, zombies may spawn wearing a carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern. They do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.\nFarming.\nFarms that convert &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s into drowned produce all of naturally-spawned equipment dropped by &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Ingot\"&gt;copper ingots&lt;/a&gt;, and (in Bedrock Edition) &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s. A drowned farm must be designed to harvest naturally-spawned drowned to produce &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;s in all game editions and &lt;a href=\"nautilus%20shell\"&gt;nautilus shell&lt;/a&gt;s in \"Java Edition\".\nBehavior.\nDrowned have a melee attack, and if they spawn with a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;, they use it as a ranged &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. A trident is thrown every 1.5 seconds at up to 20 blocks away. Thrown tridents cannot be picked up by the player for the same reason skeleton-shot arrows cannot be picked up by the player. , drowned with tridents use a melee attack if the target is 3 blocks away or less.\nThey are always hostile toward &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s, and like other zombie variants, they chase and attack &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20golem\"&gt;snow golem&lt;/a&gt;s, baby &lt;a href=\"turtles\"&gt;turtles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s at night or in dark areas.\nDrowned detect &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt;s within 10 blocks in Bedrock Edition and 24 blocks in \"Java Edition\". They stomp on turtle eggs until the eggs break. Drowned can even jump over a 1-block gap to reach a turtle egg successfully, even if the egg is raised 1 block higher than the gap. \nIf on land, drowned seek out nearby water. They sometimes step onto land but quickly return to the water. \nDuring the day, drowned swim only to attack players that are in any water; otherwise, they stay on the floor of the water body they are in, ignoring players on land, in a boat or that have attacked them or other drowned. Drowned equipped with tridents continue throwing them at the player even after the player leaves the water, or gets a long distance away. They also attack players if they attack them or another drowned, unless the drowned is killed in one hit. Additionally, they may not always immediately become aggressive toward a player when they first enter water. At night or during thunderstorms, drowned swim to the surface and chase players as well as baby turtles, even outside the water, like regular zombies. \nIf a drowned kills a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, either with a melee attack or with a trident, the villager has a chance of turning into a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; (with a 0% chance on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard).\nDrowned break down wooden doors in &lt;a href=\"Hard\"&gt;Hard&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nThey are immune to &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s attacks. They also have a small chance to be immune to knockback when damaged.\nSome drowned spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. That includes armor and weapons or tools just like regular zombies. Unlike zombies however, they can also pick up tridents, which they always prefer over anything else. They also can pick it up and throw it the wrong way.\nDrowned can be damaged by a fully-powered &lt;a href=\"conduit\"&gt;conduit&lt;/a&gt; within 8 blocks.\nIf one drowned gets attacked by another drowned's trident, the attacked drowned ignores it. \nSwimming.\nDrowned use a swimming animation similar to the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. They use this animation whenever they try to pathfind to a player that is either below or above them; if the player is on the same ground level, the drowned simply walk toward them. Drowned also use this animation if they are tracking a player while they are not standing on a solid block. Their hitbox does not change when using this animation. Also, if they hold a nautilus shell or anything else in their offhand, their arms are in the same posture as a player's. When attacking, they use the player's attacking animation. Still, they use the same swimming animation when tracking a player underwater.\nIn Java Edition a Trident enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; does not do extra damage to Drowned because they're classified as undead and not aquatic. This does not apply in Bedrock Edition as instead a Trident enchanted with Impaling does extra damage to any mob in water or rain.\nSounds.\nDrowned use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nDrowned have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Players can also select an item and press by default to automatically equip it. The off-hand slot then appears beside the &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; opposite from the main hand. If the player is in &lt;a href=\"first-person%20view\"&gt;first-person view&lt;/a&gt;, then the off-hand appears in the screen along with the held item. Whichever hand should be the main hand is configurable in the &lt;a href=\"Options%23Skin%20Customization\"&gt;Skin Customization&lt;/a&gt; menu.\nThe off-hand can the item it holds when there are no usable items on the main hand (e.g. &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s), or the item held on the main hand cannot be used directly (e.g. &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; while not looking at a &lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;). Otherwise, the main hand takes priority over the off-hand. Players also cannot blocks or with the off-hand, even if nothing is held in the main hand.\nCombat.\n&lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s held in the off-hand are prioritized over other arrows in the &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;hotbar&lt;/a&gt; and the inventory. Players can equip a specific arrow in their off-hand slot to fire it with a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. If the bow is on the off-hand, then the arrow selected on the hotbar (with the main hand) is prioritized. &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;s can be held in the off-hand as defense.\nA player can also equip a bow, &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; in their off-hand. So far, these are the only weapons that can be used in this slot or in conjunction with another weapon. This allows for higher damage output, as players no longer have to switch between a melee and distance weapon; however, it disables the use of a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Players can left-click to attack with the equipped melee weapon, and right click to attack with the ranged weapon. However, if a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; collides with an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; or another player while using a &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted trident, damage will be dealt with the item in the player's main hand.\nTool use.\nWhen a tool with a right-click function is held in the off-hand with another tool or weapon selected in the hotbar, right-clicking on a block that is relevant to the off-hand tool uses that off-hand tool unless the selected tool in the hotbar can also be used on the same block, in which case the hotbar tool has priority.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt; is in the off-hand slot and is being used with a crossbow, right-click and hold to charge and when ready, right click again to fire a firework. Fireworks can be fired from crossbows only when in the off-hand slot.\nBedrock Edition.\n, only a select few &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s can be placed in the off-hand slot and be dual-wielded.

It represents the number of \"useful actions\" an item can perform and depletes upon item use. The bar starts at green, but as the durability decreases, the color gradually turns to yellow, then orange, and finally red. When the durability is empty, the item is about to become destroyed. Durability may be increased by combining two damaged items in the crafting grid or a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, or repairing them with materials in an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, or through the &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\nInterface.\nThe remaining durability of any item can be seen by looking at the item's durability bar on the bottom of the item icon in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; and action bar. Unused items do not display a durability bar. As the item's durability decreases, the bar's colored area shortens right to left, changing color from green to red and leaving an empty gray part.

This enables additional information in the tooltips for items in the player's inventory.\nA weapon, tool or piece of armor picked up by a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; does not decrease in durability; it remains the same as when the item was first picked up by the mob. However, a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; worn by an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mob in sunlight loses durability due to the helmet absorbing the mob's damage from burning. , a &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; wielded by a &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt; also loses durability and eventually breaks; this is not the case .\nItems with the tag do not deplete their durability or break when used. Their durability is not shown, even with advanced tooltips enabled, though it is retained in the NBT data. Such an item can be acquired using .\nArmor durability.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; durability is based on the armor's type (head, torso, legs, feet) and material (leather, gold, chain mail, iron, diamond, and netherite). Any time the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; takes damage that can be reduced by armor, each piece of armor they are wearing loses 1 durability for every of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). \nArmor can reduce damage from the following sources:\nThe following types of damage are not reduced by ordinary &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and have no effect on the armor's durability but some enchantments protect against them:\nThe following types of damage are not reduced by ordinary &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; even with enchantments such as &lt;a href=\"protection\"&gt;protection&lt;/a&gt;:\nValues in the table below represent the number of points of durability damage this armor can take before it is destroyed.\nNote that every time the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; takes &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; is capable of reducing (see &lt;a href=\"%23Armor%20durability\"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;), it counts as one point of durability damage for \"every\" worn armor piece. \nTool durability.\nSome tools do not have durability, and can therefore be used infinitely. These include &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"clock\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spyglass\"&gt;spyglass&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"recovery%20compass\"&gt;recovery compass&lt;/a&gt;es.\nSome &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s are not block-breaking tools: This includes &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carrots%20on%20sticks\"&gt;carrots on sticks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warped%20fungi%20on%20sticks\"&gt;warped fungi on sticks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"brush\"&gt;brush&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;. Such tools are no better than bare fists at breaking blocks, but they do not take damage from doing so\u2014they take &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; by being used in their own various manners.\nFor block-breaking tools, a use is counted only if a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; completely breaks apart one block or hits a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;. If a &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; is partially broken this is not counted as a full use.\nItems with an &lt;a href=\"Unbreaking\"&gt;Unbreaking&lt;/a&gt; enchantment do not always lose durability when used; for a given enchantment level, the chance of losing durability is 1 in (1+\"level\"). Such items last an extra \"level\" times their original durability, give or take a few.\n&lt;a href=\"Axe\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Hoe\"&gt;Hoe&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Shears\"&gt;Shears&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing%20rod\"&gt;Fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;Carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;Flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Crossbow\"&gt;Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Warped%20Fungus%20on%20a%20Stick\"&gt;Warped Fungus on a Stick&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Sparkler\"&gt;Sparkler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glow%20Stick\"&gt;Glow Stick&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Brush\"&gt;Brush&lt;/a&gt;\nAll other &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s can be used indefinitely.\nUsing a tool properly maximizes its durability.

However, they have other important uses that aren't related to color, and are therefore not considered true dyes. They are mentioned in this article only in regard to their use as dyeing agents; see their individual articles for complete information about them.\nObtaining.\nDyes can be produced by crafting them from plants (mainly flowers), by crafting dyes of different colors together, by smelting plants, or by trading with a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s can sell 3 dyes for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;. , they can also sell 3 lapis lazuli, bone meal, cocoa beans, or ink sacs for one emerald.\nApprentice-level cleric &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s sell one lapis lazuli per emerald.\nOther.\nInk sacs can also be created using 1 iron, 1 sulfur, and 4 oxygen in the &lt;a href=\"compound%20creator\"&gt;compound creator&lt;/a&gt;. \nUsage.\nSimilar to their use in crafting, &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ink%20sac\"&gt;ink sac&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lapis%20lazuli\"&gt;lapis lazuli&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"cocoa%20beans\"&gt;cocoa beans&lt;/a&gt; can be substituted for the corresponding dye in any of the following usages unless otherwise specified. \nDyeing wool and mobs.\nPlayers can dye wool by placing &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; and any dye in a crafting grid.\nDyes can be on sheep to change the color of the wool. Shearing a colored sheep drops the corresponding color of the wool, and the sheep retains the color when the wool regenerates. &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;Breeding&lt;/a&gt; colored sheep produces a lamb colored as one of the parent sheep, or a color resulting from the combination of both parents' color. The color combining follows the same rules that dyes use \u2013 red and yellow sheep produce an orange lamb, but a blue and yellow sheep cannot create a green lamb. The unlimited reproduction of colored sheep makes dyeing and shearing sheep infinitely more efficient than just dyeing wool directly.\nDye can also be used on a tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; to change the color of its collar from the default red to the color of the dye.\nDyeing carpets.\nCarpets can be dyed.\nDyeing terracotta.\n&lt;a href=\"Terracotta\"&gt;Terracotta&lt;/a&gt; can be dyed by placing 8 blocks around a dye on a crafting table.\nCreating concrete powder.\nDyes can also be used to craft &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt;, which can then be set into their respective &lt;a href=\"concrete\"&gt;concrete&lt;/a&gt; blocks (they cannot be dyed directly).\nStaining glass.\n&lt;a href=\"Stained%20glass\"&gt;Stained glass&lt;/a&gt; can be stained by placing 8 blocks of glass around a dye on a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;. Just like regular glass, stained glass can be crafted into stained glass panes. The recipe for this is the same as with regular glass.\nDyeing shulker boxes.\n&lt;a href=\"Shulker%20box\"&gt;Shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es are generated in a light shade of purple (like the &lt;a href=\"purpur%20block\"&gt;purpur block&lt;/a&gt;), but can be dyed any color. They can also be re-dyed as often as desired.\nDyeing beds.\nPlayers can dye beds by placing a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; and any color dye in a crafting grid.\nDyeing candles.\nPlayers can dye &lt;a href=\"candles\"&gt;candles&lt;/a&gt; by placing an undyed candle and any color dye in a crafting grid.\nBanner patterns.\nDyes are used in most banner patterns to determine the pattern and color displayed.\nDyeing armor.\nLeather &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wolf%20armor\"&gt;wolf armor&lt;/a&gt; can be dyed by:\nThere are 5,713,438 (34.1% of sRGB) colors leather armor and wolf armor can be, as it is possible to put more than one dye on the crafting table alongside the leather armor and the wolf armor. Armor can be dyed multiple times with previous colors affecting the final outcome. Colored armor can be reverted to their original color using a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; with undyed water.\nThe game has a specific formula for calculating the color of dyed armor: each color, in the RGB color model, has a red value, green value, and blue value. For each dye in the crafting grid, and the armor itself (if it is already dyed), the red, green, and blue values are added to running totals. In addition, a running total of the highest value (be it red, green, or blue) is also kept. After this, each total is divided by the number of colors used. This effectively produces the average red, green, blue, and maximum values. The maximum value of the average RGB values is also calculated. Finally, each average RGB value is multiplied by the average maximum value and divided by the maximum of the average RGB values. The modified average RGB values are then used as the final color. This procedure can be summed up with the following equations:\n for each color (all \"total\" variables start at 0 before counting):\n totalRed = totalRed + redValue\n totalGreen = totalGreen + greenValue\n totalBlue = totalBlue + blueValue\n totalMaximum = totalMaximum + max(redValue, greenValue, blueValue)\n numberOfColors = numberOfColors + 1\n averageRed = totalRed / numberOfColors\n averageGreen = totalGreen / numberOfColors\n averageBlue = totalBlue / numberOfColors\n averageMaximum = totalMaximum / numberOfColors\n maximumOfAverage = max(averageRed, averageGreen, averageBlue)\n gainFactor = averageMaximum / maximumOfAverage\n resultRed = averageRed * gainFactor\n resultGreen = averageGreen * gainFactor\n resultBlue = averageBlue * gainFactor\nDue to the way this formula works, the resulting color can never be darker than the average of the input colors and is often lighter and more saturated. Of course, the resulting color can never be lighter or more saturated than the lightest or most saturated input color. In addition, this formula never creates an RGB value higher than 255 (which would be invalid in the 8-bit RGB color model).\nIf leather armor or wolf armor is renamed on an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, it retains its name when dyed or undyed.\nDyeing firework stars.\nA &lt;a href=\"firework%20star\"&gt;firework star&lt;/a&gt; can have a single color or a combination of up to eight colors when crafted with dyes. Adding one or more dyes to a crafted firework star adds a \"fade to color\" effect to it, overwriting any existing fade colors.\nCreating balloons.\nDye can be used to craft balloons.\nCreating glow sticks.\nDye can also be used to craft glow sticks.\nDyeing water inside cauldrons.\nWater can be dyed in a cauldron by holding any dye in the hand and pressing on a cauldron filled with water.\nSigns.\nDye can be on a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"hanging%20sign\"&gt;hanging sign&lt;/a&gt; to change the text color. , &lt;a href=\"ink%20sac\"&gt;ink sac&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be used for this purpose; black dye must be used to change the text to black.\nTrading.\nApprentice, journeyman and expert-level shepherd &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s buy any of the 12 dyes for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nColor values.\nThe \"color codes\" are used to determine the color imparted on sheep, wolf and cat collars, firework stars, &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; beams, and dyed leather armor. The hex value is shown in the extended tooltips of dyed leather armor; however, to set the color using an NBT data tag in a &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;, the decimal value must be used instead. The color values for firework stars are slightly different from the ones listed below, and use &lt;a href=\"Item%20colors%23Firework%20stars\"&gt;these values&lt;/a&gt; instead."}

When put on a &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;, it displays Mojang Studios' old logo in whatever color &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; was used. It is labeled \"Thing\" in the inventory. The Swedish word \"moj\u00e4ng\" means gadget or thing.\nWithers on blocks.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; can be spotted in two blocks. A 2\u00d72 &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; shows the soulsand T-shape and the three &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton%20skulls\"&gt;wither skeleton skulls&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"chiseled%20red%20sandstone\"&gt;chiseled red sandstone&lt;/a&gt; block depicts the wither on the edges of the block.\nTextures.\nSome textures have hidden things in space unused by the game. Some of these are accessible by unzipping &lt;a href=\"client.jar\"&gt;client.jar&lt;/a&gt; found in the versions folder.\nGuardian.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Texture%20Update\"&gt;Texture Update&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt; textures, there was an unused area saying \"jeb\".\nArmor stand.\nIn the texture for the &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;, in an unused area in the bottom right, the word \"Searge\" can be seen in a black box. This is presumably put there as a signature by &lt;a href=\"Searge\"&gt;Searge&lt;/a&gt;, the developer that implemented armor stands. In the bottom left, the word \"Jappa\" can be seen. This is likely another signature, this time from the texture artist, &lt;a href=\"Jappa\"&gt;Jappa&lt;/a&gt;, who was in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Texture%20Update\"&gt;Texture Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nZombie pigman.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Texture%20Update\"&gt;Texture Update&lt;/a&gt;, in an unused area for the &lt;a href=\"zombie%20pigman\"&gt;zombie pigman&lt;/a&gt; texture, the words \"THX XAPHOBIA\" could be seen. This was written by &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; to give credit and thanks to the original creator of the texture, XaPhobia.\nCreeper.\nThe first released texture of the creeper. The old leaf texture is overlaying a lighter version of the pig test texture with some green added. Areas for arms and long legs are seen, which were never used.\nTextures hidden in transparency.\nSome of the textures have pixels set to 0 opacity, which makes them appear transparent when viewed with most image viewers. However, the color information of these pixels is still present and can be retrieved by disabling the alpha channel. Most of these textures are probably leftovers from the creation of the texture, that the editing program didn't erase but instead simply set the opacity to 0.\nTextures listed here had their alpha channel disabled to reveal unused/hidden pixels in the texture. Most of the invisible pixels are from development of the texture or already existing texture has been used as a template during development.\n1.12.2.\nMobs.\nThere are hidden pixels in these mobs. As of 1.19.2, all except the ocelot still have them.\nAlex.\nIn version 1.8, Alex was added to the game. Invisible pixels include Alex's face with glasses, a reference to &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt;, a Mojang developer, as well as an unfinished arm texture similar to Steve's used texture.\nSilverfish.\nThe silverfish was added in Beta 1.8, but the texture already exists in Beta 1.7. Invisible pixels consist of a few different colored regions around the \"hair\" textures.\nEndermite.\nThe snapshot texture of the endermite is seen underneath the new one.\nBat.\nAn unused face texture can be seen and the spider head texture is seen under the wing. The spider texture was used as a template for the bat.\nOcelot and cat.\nThe ocelot and the cat variants were added in version 1.2.1. The ocelot's hidden pixels contain an extra head texture, and all the cat textures feature an orange texture with black lines across it. After the 1.14 update, the ocelot texture no longer contains hidden pixels. Most of the new cat textures are edited from the old ones, as indicated by the similar hidden patterns. The textures also appear to have been cropped, since a large part of the old hidden texture is missing, with the exception of the red cat texture, which appears to be unchanged.\nWolf.\nThe wolf was added in Beta 1.4. All four wolf texture files feature similar hidden textures, which suggests, that they were created by modifying the same file. The most extreme is the collar texture, which originally contains only the collar, but there is an entire wolf texture hidden in transparency.\nBlaze.\nThe blaze has a hidden body texture.\nMagma cube.\n A second pair of eyes are visible.\nWither.\nThe Wither's Armor texture was based on creeper's charged armor. In the Wither textures, there is a copy of the main head under the smaller one. The light blue color is visible without removing transparency.\nGuardians.\nIt seems that a template texture was used for designing the guardians.\nVex.\nThe vex head is bigger and there seems to be leftover wing design.\nZombies.\nThe zombie textures have a villager zombie head hidden in its texture.\nCapes.\nSome cape textures have a secret on the underside where it is not very visible.\nLanguages.\nThere are five joke &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;s available at the language menu: Pirate Speak, LOLCAT, Shakespearean English, Anglish (puristic English), and \u0265s\u1d09l\u0183u\u018e (\u026fop\u1d77u\u1d09\u029e p\u01dd\u0287\u1d09u\u2229) (upside-down English).\n\"Minecraft\" is also translated into tlhIngan Hol, the Klingon language from \"Star Trek\"; Quenya, one of the Elvish languages from \"Lord of the Rings\"; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban\"&gt;Lojban&lt;/a&gt;, a conlang made by the LLC (Logical Language Group); and , a conlang created by L.L. Zamenhof.\nIf a player types \"excitedze\" into the search bar in the &lt;a href=\"recipe%20book\"&gt;recipe book&lt;/a&gt;, their language is automatically switched to Pirate Speak. \"ExcitedZe\" is the username of &lt;a href=\"Maria%20Lem%C3%B3n\"&gt;Maria Lem\u00f3n&lt;/a&gt;, a former Mojang Studios staff member.\nNames.\nNaming mobs.\nSeveral mobs can be renamed by using a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; to create an effect.\nUpside-down mobs.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.6\"&gt;1.6&lt;/a&gt;, any mob (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;) named \"&lt;a href=\"Dinnerbone\"&gt;Dinnerbone&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Grumm\"&gt;Grumm&lt;/a&gt;\" (case sensitive) through &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;s, commands, or any other method, cause it to render upside-down. The mob's behavior does not change.\nThis also applies to players, allowing Dinnerbone and Grumm's avatars to be rendered upside-down. This can be toggled using the \"Show cape\" button from \"Skin Settings\". , if the player names themselves Dinnerbone or Grumm, they are rendered upside-down. This works only if the player did not sign into Xbox Live.\nRainbow sheep.\nNaming a sheep \"&lt;a href=\"Jens%20Bergensten\"&gt;jeb_&lt;/a&gt;\" using a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; or a renamed &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; causes it to continually cycle through all colors a sheep can be dyed. When sheared using shears, however, the sheep drop wool of the original color of the sheep rather than the color that currently appears on the sheep. , if a sheep is named jeb_, and then sheared, the leftover wool on its skin continues to cycle through all the colors.\n\"Toast the Bunny\".\nWhen Ryan Holtz was developing &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, user xyzen420 asked him to make a skin that would look like his girlfriend's lost rabbit, Toast. Now, naming a rabbit with a name tag or a rabbit spawn egg called \"Toast\" causes the rabbit's skin pattern to look like Toast as a memorial. This also works if the player attempts to name The Killer Bunny; although while the rabbit's appearance uses the Toast skin, it can still attack as it would without the given name. When the player is killed by the renamed Killer Bunny, the &lt;a href=\"death%20message\"&gt;death message&lt;/a&gt; says \"&lt;playername&gt; was slain by Toast\". \"Toast\" is re-textured to have black spots on its fur.\n\"Johnny\".\nIf a &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; is named \"Johnny\" or has its codice_1 tag set to codice_2, it attacks any nearby mobs except other &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s. This references the movie . &lt;a href=\"Zoglin\"&gt;Zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s also behave in this manner.\nPlayers.\ndeadmau5's ears.\nWith the addition of the cape, Notch also added ears for the player deadmau5. The ears are \"vanity items and are worn in addition to the player's skin\", with the texture contained within &lt;a href=\"http%3A//textures.minecraft.net/texture/48db3fbf18e5f0ef266b47f5e6b54126a55f331558ff34cb17468753d84d096\"&gt;deadmau5's skin&lt;/a&gt;.\ndeadmau5 cannot disable his ears, as a translucent part of the skin is automatically converted into a black color. His name tag is also programmed to render ten pixels higher to be above the ears.\nThe ears are set to show up based on the username, rather than the UUID of the player, meaning that if deadmau5 were to change his name, he would not keep his ears.\nNotch's death.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; died in-game, he dropped an additional &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt; along with his inventory. At a certain time in-game, these were unobtainable. However, this was removed\nSplashes.\nNever displayed splash.\nWithin the \"texts\" folder, there is a text file named codice_3. The text file contains all the splashes that appear on the title screen. One of them is \"This message will never appear on the splash screen, isn't that weird?\" As its text implies, the splash is never displayed. However in Legacy Console Edition it does display, but it has never been confirmed if it is a bug or an intentional feature.\nmissingno Splash.\nIn older versions, if one were to delete the file splashes.txt without also deleting the META-INF folder, the splash text on the title screen would appear as \"missingno\". This is a reference to the infamous glitch Pok\u00e9mon found in the first generation of \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games. This was later changed to a , which is displayed with \"Minecraft\"s Unicode font as a box with the letters \"ZWNBSP\" within it.\nThe splash was added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20v1.0.12\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha v1.0.12&lt;/a&gt; and it's the only vanilla version with this splash by default since splashes.txt was not added yet.\nNotch's Birthday.\nOn June 1, Notch's Birthday, the only splash displayed is \"Happy Birthday, Notch!\" \nThis splash was removed in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8.5\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8.5&lt;/a&gt;, since Notch no longer works for Mojang.\nHoliday splashes.\nVarious splashes appear all day on many holidays, like \"Happy New Year!\" on January 1, and \"Merry Christmas!\" on Christmas Day. They may change slightly every year.\nCoronavirus.\nSpecial splashes are displaying due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They include \"Wash your hands!\" and \"Support elderly relatives and friends!\"\nTributes to Technoblade.\nFollowing the announcement on June 30, 2022 that popular Minecraft YouTuber &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Ayoutube%3ATechnoblade\"&gt;Technoblade&lt;/a&gt; passed away from stage 4 cancer, Mojang added his skin\u2019s crown to the pig on the \"Java Edition\" art in memory of him. A splash text in his honor was also added in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.19.1\"&gt;1.19.1&lt;/a&gt;. The launcher art was later changed to reflect &lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Update\"&gt;The Wild Update&lt;/a&gt;, removing the pig and the crown from the launcher.\nRemoved Easter eggs.\nSeveral Easter eggs have been removed from \"Minecraft\".\nCommand blocks.\nCommand blocks have various Easter eggs with messages being added to the previous output.\nSearge.\nRunning \"&lt;a href=\"Searge\"&gt;Searge&lt;/a&gt;\" as the command in the command block without a preceding \"codice_4\" now sets the previous output to \"#itzlipofutzli\". This Easter egg is case insensitive.\nSearge says.\nIf the command is run via &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;, it gives various messages prefixed with \"Searge says: \" as the previous output when activated. The following messages exist:\nThis no longer works in 1.13 or above (); instead the command now runs normally, but the previous output gives only the last line (\"/xp -&gt; experience\") due to there being space for just one line.\n\"Java Edition\" launcher.\nBefore the release of the \"Java Edition\" launcher version &lt;a href=\"Launcher%202.1.497x\"&gt;2.1.497x&lt;/a&gt;, the launcher contained multiple Easter eggs. If the player hovered their cursor over the \"Play\" button for a few seconds, a random mob would appear in the bottom right corner of the launcher. In the top left corner of the launcher, the player could see a translucent creeper face. There was about a chance of the creeper face being replaced with a shrugging emoticon, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. When the player clicked on either of these, they turned solid white. Clicking them again would return them to their translucent state. In addition, if the player pressed codice_5, the &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt; pickup sound plays. These can no longer work because the launcher has since been updated.\nLegacy Console Edition tutorial world.\nTower of Pimps.\nIn the old &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; TU12-TU13 Tutorial World, on the top floor of the sandstone pyramid, there are four blocks of gold on top of a block of obsidian. This is the \"Tower of Pimps\". It was created by of in their video \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTihfx6DunZs%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dyoutu.be%26amp%3Bt%3D3m20s\"&gt;Let's Play Minecraft Part 2 - On a Rail!&lt;/a&gt;\" and has become a symbol of the group's \"Let's Play Minecraft\" series, mainly as a trophy of their competitions in their Achievement City world within \"Xbox 360 Edition\" and \"Java Edition\".\nStampylonghead reference.\nIn the Legacy Console Edition TU19/CU7/1.12 Tutorial World, there was an island in the northeast side of the world and it had a remake of Stampy's house along with his boat, the S.S. Stumpy.\nAdditionally, the boat was seen in the trailer for &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; TU19/CU7.\nReferences to other franchises.\n\"Portal\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; for crafting a &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt; is called \"The Lie\" in reference to the phrase \"The cake is a lie\" from the popular Valve game \"\".\n\"Super Mario\".\n&lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;'s behavior, Tommaso &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/_tomcc/status/651042141397979136\"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;, \"is like Mario 64\" in reference to the wing cap from \"\".\nOne of the paintings is a reference to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/Zetterstrand/status/1636470302937952266%3Fs%3D20\"&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Star Fox\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; for using a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; is called &lt;a href=\"Achievements%23Do%20a%20Barrel%20Roll.21\"&gt;\"Do a Barrel Roll!\"&lt;/a&gt; in reference to the popular phrase said by Peppy Hare in and , telling the player to execute an aerial maneuver called a barrel roll.\n\"2001: A Space Odyssey\".\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;1.13&lt;/a&gt;, using in a command block displays one of a few joke messages, one of which is \"Oh my god, it's full of stats\", a reference to a quote from the novel \"\". In the &lt;a href=\"Crash%23Witty%20comments\"&gt;witty comments&lt;/a&gt; of a crash report, there are two other quotes, \"I'm sorry, Dave.\" and \"Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.\"\n\"Age of Empires\".\nIf an &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; sees a blue sheep, it turns the sheep into a red sheep while uttering \"wololo\". This is a reference to the Priest unit from the real-time strategy game series, which would utter \"wololo\" while converting enemy units to their side, changing their color. The evoker specifically uses the sound sample from the 1999 title .\n\"Terraria\".\nThe summoning mechanism for the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; boss, according to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//minecraft.net/article/meet-wither\"&gt;Jens&lt;/a&gt;, was inspired by the summoning mechanisms for bosses in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria\"&gt;Terraria&lt;/a&gt;. The game is also directly referenced in a splash text, \"Also try Terraria!\".\n\"Counter Strike 1.6\".\nThree of the paintings in the game are of stages in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/Zetterstrand/status/1636494619545403393%3Fs%3D20\"&gt;Counter Strike 1.6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20painting%20textures\"&gt;de_aztec&lt;/a&gt; 1 &amp; 2 and &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20painting%20textures\"&gt;Target successfully bombed&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Grim Fandango\".\nThe painting '&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20painting%20textures\"&gt;Mortal Coil&lt;/a&gt;' is a reference to the character &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/Zetterstrand/status/1636072391607480323%3Fs%3D20\"&gt;Bruno Martinez&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"https%3A//twitter.com/Zetterstrand/status/1636072391607480323%3Fs%3D20\"&gt;Grim Fandango&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Project Zomboid\".\nOne of the games splash texts recommends the game &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/ryejt6/project_zomboid_is_also_a_minecraft_splash_screen/\"&gt;Project Zomboid&lt;/a&gt;. \"Also try Project Zomboid!\"\nOther.\n\"Minceraft\".\nThere is a 0.01% chance for the title screen to display \"Minceraft\" instead of \"Minecraft\". The beginning of crash logs can have the phrase \"You should try our sister game, Minceraft!\"\n\"Someone is closing me!\".\nAfter a crash, the second-to-last line of text on the game output launcher tab says \"Someone is closing me!\"\nEnchanting symbols.\nThe enchanting symbols shown on the enchantment selection contain random words using the standard galactic alphabet from Commander Keen games, but the words in enchanting tables are randomized and do not correlate with any enchantments. This language shows up in the 10th anniversary of Minecraft, as a puzzle.\nSounds.\nDisc 11.\nWhen the ogg for &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt; 11 is converted to wave and run through a spectrogram, an image is created. Several theories for this image exist, but the most popular is that the image depicts the default &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; head and &lt;a href=\"C418\"&gt;C418&lt;/a&gt;'s autograph. C is the hexadecimal of 12, so 12418 is C418.\nCave sound 14.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ambience\"&gt;ambient sound&lt;/a&gt; 14 is put into a spectrogram, it appears to be a creeper face.\nCrimson Forest ambience.\nMany of the sounds were created using balloons.\nThe killer bunny.\nThe &lt;a href=\"killer%20bunny\"&gt;killer bunny&lt;/a&gt; is a variant of the rabbit that is hostile to all players. This is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from \"\". It can be spawned only by using commands, and only .\n\"Super Secret\" settings.\nIn snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2013w36a\"&gt;13w36a&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.7.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.7.2&lt;/a&gt;, Dinnerbone added a \"Super Secret Settings\" button, which could be viewed in the options screen. Clicking it would blare a random game sound with a lower pitch and change the &lt;a href=\"shader\"&gt;shader&lt;/a&gt; of the screen. These effects would not necessarily work on computers without a graphics card that supported OpenGL 2.1. This was removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2015w31a\"&gt;15w31a&lt;/a&gt; for 1.9.\nCrash screens.\nWhen the game runs into a fatal error and crashes, the crash log includes a message such as \"Who set us up the TNT?\" or \"Hi. I'm Minecraft, and I'm a crashaholic.\"\n.minecraft.\nDebug profile results.\nDebug profile results (triggered via ) contain witty comments at the top, much like with crash reports.\nItem and block NBT tags.\nIf one were to use to give themselves an item that can mine a non-existent block ID (any block ID that is not in the game), the text simply displays \"missingno\". This is a reference to the infamous glitch Pok\u00e9mon , which can be found in the first generation of \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games.\nScottish Steve and Swedish Alex.\n, in the default &lt;a href=\"skin%20pack\"&gt;skin pack&lt;/a&gt; or the legacy skin pack, the Scottish Steve and Swedish Alex &lt;a href=\"skin\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;s are references to the locations of the companies developing the game. &lt;a href=\"4J%20Studios\"&gt;4J Studios&lt;/a&gt; is located in Scotland, and &lt;a href=\"Mojang\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt; is located in Sweden. These both can be used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as color/skin swaps for Steve.\nItem models.\nSeveral items when worn on the head (using ) have unique placements. The &lt;a href=\"end%20rod\"&gt;end rod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spyglass\"&gt;spyglass&lt;/a&gt; protrude from the head like a horn, the &lt;a href=\"lightning%20rod\"&gt;lightning rod&lt;/a&gt; sits at the side like a snorkel, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; look like an ear and mic piece, &lt;a href=\"banners\"&gt;banners&lt;/a&gt; display similar to how &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt; captains wear them, &lt;a href=\"fence%20gates\"&gt;fence gates&lt;/a&gt; are worn like glasses, &lt;a href=\"bones\"&gt;bones&lt;/a&gt; are held in the mouth like a dog, &lt;a href=\"leads\"&gt;leads&lt;/a&gt; go around the eye like a monocle, and &lt;a href=\"feathers\"&gt;feathers&lt;/a&gt; stick up at the back of the head.\nCommand blocks.\nIn the language files for the key for the command block\u2019s \u201cAlways Active\u201d feature \u201cadvMode.mode.autoexec.bat\u201d. A tribute to DOS based operating systems that made use of \u201cAUTOEXEC.BAT\u201d to run commands on startup of the system."}

An exception to this is &lt;a href=\"Zombie%23Reinforcements\"&gt;zombie reinforcements&lt;/a&gt;, which can spawn on glass blocks (but not &lt;a href=\"glass%20pane\"&gt;glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s).\nGlass blocks cannot be seen through by mobs, as they treat them as completely opaque. Mobs may look at players through glass, but this is purely visual.\n&lt;a href=\"Redstone%20dust\"&gt;Redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; and components can be placed on glass, but cannot power glass. Glass can't cut vertical redstone. Vertical redstone can be placed on glass. , it transmits redstone signals up, not down. Otherwise, glass in redstone circuits is functionally the same as an upside-down slab.\nBeacon beam color.\nThe color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt; (or stained glass panes) anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as &lt;a href=\"Dye%23Color%20values\"&gt;those for the corresponding dye&lt;/a&gt;. Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks.\nThe resulting beam color can be found as formula_1where formula_2 is the sequence of glass colors (formula_3 corresponds to the lowest block and formula_4 to the highest one).\nAs the blending algorithm is considerably simpler than that of &lt;a href=\"Dye%23Dyeing%20armor\"&gt;leather-dyeing&lt;/a&gt;, a much larger part of the sRGB space is available. A player may experiment with stacking glass, although programs that calculate combinations are also available.\nWith only 15 types of glass you can make all colors, for example; red + white stained glass above a beacon will be pink, the more white you add, the lighter the color will be."}

It can also be filled using a waterlogged block.\nAlso, a bottle may be filled by powering a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; containing a bottle and pointed at a water source block. This does not work with cauldrons.\nIf filled via a water source, the water is unaffected. If filled via a cauldron, of the water in the cauldron is removed. Therefore, using a cauldron to fill water bottles is inefficient, except in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; where it is normally the only way to fill bottles.\nPotion.\n, a bottle may be filled with potion by it on a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; containing potion.

Honey bottles can also be emptied by using them in crafting recipes (such as &lt;a href=\"sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;). However, a lingering potion use on tipped arrow recipe does not give the bottle back.\nDragon's breath.\n a glass bottle in clouds emitted when the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; breathes or shoots a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20fireball\"&gt;dragon fireball&lt;/a&gt; fills the bottle with &lt;a href=\"dragon%27s%20breath\"&gt;dragon's breath&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen put 2 or more dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, a glass bottle will drop as an &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;. However, if put only 1 dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, the glass bottle is consumed and cannot be retrieved.\nTrading.\nExpert-level cleric &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s have a 50% chance to buy 9 glass bottles for one &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; as part of their trade.\nExpert-level cleric villagers have a chance to buy 9 glass bottles for one emerald."}

Windows built using glass panes can be up to 267% (2 times) larger in area than windows built with regular glass blocks.\nPlacement.\nIf placed without anything on the sides, they appear as a thin vertical \u2022 shape, 2\u00d72 pixels in size; but when other blocks occupy adjacent spaces, it becomes flat or turns into a \u250f or \u2533 or \u254b shape depending on the items surrounding it. The collision box is identical to the shape of the pane. Therefore, two glass panes placed with one empty space in between forms a gap that is two blocks wide.\nGlass panes are never oriented horizontally. Horizontal glass surfaces must be made from glass blocks.\nGlass panes can be &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;, which means water can be in the same place as a glass pane, unlike regular glass.\nLocking maps.\nGlass panes can be used in &lt;a href=\"cartography%20table\"&gt;cartography table&lt;/a&gt;s to lock &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;s, which makes them unable to be filled again when exploring.

This yields one glow berry when the vine is bearing them and nothing when it is not. A cave vine also breaks if &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; runs over its location or if a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; extends or pushes a block into its location. \nUsage.\nPlacement.\nGlow berries can be placed on and grown from the bottom of most blocks. They have no specific lighting requirements. When placed, they can be of any length.\nGrowth.\nPlacing glow berries on the bottom of a block creates a cave vine that grows downward one block at a time as long as &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; is beneath it and its maximum height (2 to 26 blocks) has not been reached.

Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the player may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds glow berries. The resulting baby fox trusts the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; and does not flee.\nGlow berries can be on baby foxes to reduce the time until they grow by 10%."}

Glow squid have a 5% chance of spawning as babies.\nBehavior.\nGlow squid wander around aimlessly in three dimensions as long as they are in the water, opening and closing their tentacles, which gives them the appearance of pushing themselves leisurely forward.\nGlow squid suffocate when out of water, dying after . While on land, they remain stationary until they suffocate. They can take fall damage and &lt;a href=\"burn\"&gt;burn&lt;/a&gt; like any other land mob, but they cannot drown.

When attacked, they emit a cloud of turquoise ink particles and swim away. The particles and the ink remain remain visible when the glow squid has the status effect.\nIf the player is in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode or is far away from glow squid (often when they are in unloaded &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s), they remain stationary.

Redstone wire, even though it may appear to connect up the side of a glowstone block and to the wire portion on top, does not send a redstone signal down the glowstone block. This makes glowstone effective for vertical diodes, logic gate designs, and space-efficient instant vertical redstone.\nNote that upside-down &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s can be used for the same purpose, and are easier to obtain.\nPiston interactivity.\nGlowstone, like other pushable blocks, becomes a block of &lt;a href=\"moving%20piston\"&gt;moving piston&lt;/a&gt; when moved by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;; this momentarily stops it from giving off light.\nNote blocks.\nGlowstone can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce pling sounds.\nRespawn anchors.\nGlowstone is used to charge &lt;a href=\"respawn%20anchor\"&gt;respawn anchor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; containing glowstone is facing a respawn anchor, it can automatically charge the respawn anchor when powered.\nTransparent block.\nGlowstone blocks all sunlight, players and mobs suffocate inside it, mobs are able to pathfind to it, and it blocks a &lt;a href=\"beacon\"&gt;beacon&lt;/a&gt; beam, preventing the beacon's activation. However, like transparent blocks, it does not prevent the opening of chests, monsters (including &lt;a href=\"slimes\"&gt;slimes&lt;/a&gt;) cannot spawn on it, and it does not transfer a redstone signal. This behavior also occurs in &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Goats can jump especially high, and ram mobs. They are a source of &lt;a href=\"goat%20horn\"&gt;goat horn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nGroups of two to three goats spawn above stone variants of opaque &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jagged%20peaks\"&gt;jagged peaks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"frozen%20peaks\"&gt;frozen peaks&lt;/a&gt; at the surface at a light level of 7 or higher. Goats can spawn individually after the world generation, albeit less often. 5% of all goats spawn as babies.\nWhen a goat is spawned naturally or through breeding normal goats, it has a 2% chance of being a screaming/screamer goat. They look identical to all other goats, but they make screaming sounds and ram more often.\nDrops.\nAdult goats drop when killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;, while is dropped upon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;. Killing a baby goat yields no &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoat horns.\nGoats drop a &lt;a href=\"goat%20horn\"&gt;goat horn&lt;/a&gt; when they charge into a solid &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;. These include &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coal%20ore\"&gt;coal ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"copper%20ore\"&gt;copper ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald%20ore\"&gt;emerald ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt;. , these blocks are listed under the &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;, and can be modified using a &lt;a href=\"data%20pack\"&gt;data pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 4 horn variants for normal goats (\"Ponder\", \"Sing\", \"Seek\", and \"Feel\"), and 4 horn variants that only screaming goats drop (\"Admire\", \"Call\", \"Yearn\", and \"Dream\"). Goats do not regrow their horns; therefore, up to two horns can be dropped per goat.\nBehavior.\nWhen left to wander, goats tend to ascend hills and mountains rather than keep to lowlands. Their behavior is marked by jumping high and by opportunistically ramming non-moving mobs.\nGoats take less fall &lt;a href=\"Falling%20damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; and avoid walking into &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;. Goats do not get hurt by &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; if they fall on it from a minimum of six blocks, and do not die from pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of ten.\nJumping.\nA goat usually jumps when trying to cross an obstacle like a small hole in the ground or &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;. It lowers its head, then it leaps up to 10 blocks vertically and up to 5 blocks laterally. Once a goat jumps this way, it cannot do it again for 30 to 60 seconds. A goat also never voluntarily jumps more than 5 blocks down, although a goat can be pushed off a higher cliff by another mob or a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;.\nStanding on a &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt; prevents a goat from jumping.\nRamming.\nEvery 30 to 300 seconds, a goat tries to ram a single unmoving target it can see within a range of 4\u201316 blocks. They can target players, &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s, or any mob except for &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s and other goats. A charging goat locks on to its target's position, lowers its head, stomps, and speeds toward the target. If the charge connects, it deals to damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall. This attack is not affected by &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way. If a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first. If a goat rams a solid block that &lt;a href=\"Tags%23blocks%20snaps_goat_horn\"&gt;occurs naturally in its environment&lt;/a&gt;, it can drop one of its two &lt;a href=\"goat%20horn\"&gt;goat horn&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMobs do not retaliate to being rammed, except for &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;piglins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Piglin%20Brute\"&gt;piglin brutes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hoglin\"&gt;hoglins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zoglin\"&gt;zoglins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"wardens\"&gt;wardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoats do not target players in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode or any players in Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike most neutral mobs, goats do not attack the player if the player attacks it, and it does not call for backup if harmed.\nBaby goats deal a knockback of 4.5 blocks. A screaming goat's ramming cooldown is 5 to 15 seconds.\nMilking.\nAn adult goat can be milked by a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; on it, yielding a &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreeding.\nGoats follow players that are within ten blocks who are holding &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;. If adult goats are fed wheat, they enter love mode and breed, granting one to seven &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs. The growth time of a baby goat can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed wheat.\nIf a standard goat is bred with a screaming goat, there is approximately a 50% chance the resulting baby is a screaming goat. If both goats are screaming, there is a 100% chance that the baby is a screaming goat.\nBaby goats only have horns if they are summoned through one of two commands: or . \nSounds.\nGoats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nGoats use the Hostile Creatures sound category for some sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nGoats have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

The first batch generates 4 times per chunk in blobs of 0\u201413 blocks, from levels -64 to 32. It is most likely to be found around layer -16, becoming less common toward either end of the range. The second batch has a probability of 1/2 per chunks to generate in blobs of 0\u201413 blocks that generate uniformly between -64 and -48. There is also an extra batch of gold ore in badlands biome that generates 50 times per chunk in blobs of 0\u201413 blocks, from 32 to 256 uniformly.

(In item form, they still appear transparent.) This is likely meant to improve framerates by treating leaves more like full, solid cubes, and allowing their faces to be culled by each other, resulting in the game having to render less faces in forested areas; this, however, does not happen.\nLeaves do not use a separate texture file for their appearance in Fast graphics - rather, all transparent regions in the texture are set to fully opaque, and appear black.\nLeaves are the only block subject to this - other transparent cubes such as &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s are still rendered transparent, likely due to their comparative rarity.\nTranslucency.\nWhen graphics are set to \"Fast\" or \"Fancy\", the game makes compromises on the rendering of many translucent elements of the game.\nA notable example of this involves viewing the world through translucent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass\"&gt;stained glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tinted%20glass\"&gt;tinted glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;. When this is done, the game will not attempt to render &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"clouds\"&gt;clouds&lt;/a&gt; behind the block.\nThere are also many, much more subtle cases which can be seen. &lt;a href=\"Experience%20orb\"&gt;Experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s have many associated cases - for example, they can block the rendering of their own shadows, as well as of other entities, including entity-rendered blocks such as &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as non-entity-rendered translucent blocks such as stained glass, and other things like the &lt;a href=\"Hitbox\"&gt;outlines&lt;/a&gt; of targeted blocks.\nThe effects seem to be time-specific, and often differ depending on the age of the entities in question - different effects can be sighted for experience orbs which existed in the world before the entity behind them than experience orbs which came into existence afterwards.\nMore obscure cases can be sighted as well, such as with the dying animation of the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"world%20border\"&gt;world border&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt; annotations. Untested cases involve F3+G chunk borders and &lt;a href=\"shulker%20bullet\"&gt;shulker bullet&lt;/a&gt;s. Blocks such as tripwire, slime blocks and honey blocks may cause even more strange effects."}

Grass spreading without player intervention depends heavily on the &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;time of day&lt;/a&gt;. For a dirt block to accept grass from a nearby grass block, the following requirements must be met:\nWhen grass is &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;ed, it spreads by checking 4 blocks within range and converts any dirt blocks selected into grass.\nThough &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; are both &lt;a href=\"Light%23Light-filtering_blocks\"&gt;light-filtering blocks&lt;/a&gt; (meaning they decrease skylight by 1 level but do not affect block light), other light-filtering blocks such as &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s do not block grass from spreading to the dirt block. Grass blocks can grow under all other transparent blocks like &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es. Grass jumps directly from one block to a neighbor and is not affected by gaps or other blocks being \"in the way.\" Grass blocks spread at random intervals and have an equal chance of spreading to any suitable dirt blocks that are in range. Because grass can spread as much as 3 levels downward, it tends to spread down slopes much faster than it spreads up them.\nMob loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Endermen\"&gt;Endermen&lt;/a&gt; can pick up grass blocks, and drop the blocks they are holding if killed, making it the only way to obtain grass blocks without the use of &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nThe coloration of grass blocks is dependent on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; they are in. A grass block always uses the color set to its location, regardless of how it was placed or of its source. This affects the side and top of the block.\nIn , biome colors also appear on &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;s.\nColor.\nBiome colors.\nThese values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.

They also wander toward &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; eats a grass block, the block becomes &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;sheared&lt;/a&gt; sheep regrows its &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;.\nTilling a grass block with a &lt;a href=\"hoe\"&gt;hoe&lt;/a&gt; converts it to a &lt;a href=\"farmland\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt; block. \n&lt;a href=\"Dirt%20path\"&gt;Dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s can be created by any type of &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; on the side or top of a grass block with air above it.

Transparent blocks can kill grass in a similar manner if they cause the light level above the grass block to be four or below (like water does), and the surrounding area is not otherwise sufficiently illuminated.\nSpawning.\nIn \"Java Edition\", &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; occasionally &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; on grass blocks that have light level 9 or brighter in the space directly above. This is quite rare and requires that there be few other animals nearby or in the spawn chunks. Most animals are instead created along with the terrain.\nIn Bedrock Edition, most animals require surface grass blocks (grass blocks with no solid block anywhere above them at the same x, z coordinate) to spawn. Animals regularly spawn in most Overworld biomes on surface grass blocks that have light level 7 or brighter in the space directly above.\nSnowy Grass Block.\nGrass blocks turn into a snowy grass block if a &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt; is placed on top of the block. Removing the snow layer will turn the block into a normal grass block.\nComposting.\nPlacing grass blocks into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1."}

The layers are one block deep in &lt;a href=\"nether%20wastes\"&gt;nether wastes&lt;/a&gt;, and 3-5 blocks deep in &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;.\nOre features of gravel in the nether attempt to replace &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-160, from levels 5 to 41 or 36, in all Nether biomes except &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nGravel can be broken using any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, but a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; is the quickest. When broken, it has a 10% chance of dropping &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; instead of the gravel itself. The flint received can be controlled with &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; removes the chance of dropping flint; &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; increases the chance to 14% at the level I, 25% at level II, and 100% at level III.\nIf gravel falls onto a non-full block, it drops as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; and does not drop flint.\nMob loot.\nAn &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; holding gravel always drops the block upon death.\nBartering.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s may &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; 8-16 gravel when given a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nIf the supporting block below a block of gravel is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the gravel block turns into a \"&lt;a href=\"falling%20block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;, which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity are available in the main article listed above.\nWhen gravel falls on a player or mob, it can engulf the head, resulting in suffocation inside gravel until destroying the block, moving out of it, or dying. If falling gravel lands in a space occupied by a non-solid block (such as &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;) or non-full block (such as &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;), it breaks and turns into a gravel &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;. Gravel falls slowly through a &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt; until it passes completely through, or until it touches any block, at which point it drops and becomes a gravel item.\nGravel can be placed on a non-solid block without falling.\n&lt;a href=\"Bamboo\"&gt;Bamboo&lt;/a&gt; can be placed and grown on gravel.\nTrading.\nNovice-level fletcher &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s have a 50% or chance to buy 10 gravel and one &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; for 10 &lt;a href=\"flint\"&gt;flint&lt;/a&gt; as part of their trade.\nNote blocks.\nGravel can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce snare drum sounds."}

Data packs can be used to override or add new &lt;a href=\"Advancement/JSON%20format\"&gt;advancement&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Custom%20dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28Java%20Edition%29\"&gt;function&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"loot%20table\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"predicate\"&gt;predicate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Item%20modifier\"&gt;item modifiers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Structure%20block%20file%20format\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"damage%20type\"&gt;damage type&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Custom%20world%20generation\"&gt;world generation settings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"biomes\"&gt;biomes&lt;/a&gt; without any code modification.\nUsage.\nData packs can be placed in the folder of a world. Each data pack is either a sub-folder or a within the folder. After it is in the folder, a data pack is enabled for that world when the world is &lt;a href=\"Commands/reload\"&gt;reloaded&lt;/a&gt; or loaded.\nData packs load their data based on the load order. This order can be seen and altered by using the command and is stored in the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20level%20format%23level.dat_format\"&gt;file&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe player can also select data packs at the world creation screen by clicking the Data Packs button and dragging-and-dropping their data pack folders/zip-files there.

The version takes the form of an ever-increasing positive integer unlike client versions. Data versions are necessary because client versions usually cannot be directly compared since they use different &lt;a href=\"Version%20formats\"&gt;formats&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., \"1.14\" and \"19w02a\" cannot be compared).

Inverted daylight detectors cannot be collected directly; they drop a regular daylight detector. , the inverted sensor may be obtained via inventory editing or add-ons.\nUsage.\nRedstone component.\nA daylight detector can be used to produce redstone power in proportion to the &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;daylight cycle&lt;/a&gt;.\nA daylight detector is 0.375 blocks high (3/8ths of a block). Daylight detectors can be moved by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flow around daylight detectors without affecting them. \nDaylight Detector.\nThe daylight detector power level depends on the time of day, the weather, and the &lt;a href=\"Light%23Internal%20light%20level\"&gt;internal sky light level&lt;/a&gt;.\nInverted Daylight Detector.\n a daylight detector inverts it. However, the output of the inverted detector is not a simple inversion of the daylight detector's output; it uses a much simpler algorithm that depends only on the &lt;a href=\"Light%23Internal_light_level\"&gt;internal sky light level&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, it outputs a signal strength of 15 minus the current internal sky light level, where values over 15 or below 0 are taken as 15 or 0 respectively. This means that an inverted daylight detector actually outputs a strength of 11 at midnight when it's clear weather, if it has line of sight with the sky. The effects of shade are applied before inverting, so shade \"increases\" the signal strength when it isn't already full, and prevents it from reaching zero. \nFuel.\nDaylight detectors can be used as a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nNote Blocks.\nDaylight detectors can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA daylight detector has a block entity associated with it which stores only its entity ID and position (the minimum data for a block entity). Although the daylight detector's block entity stores no additional data, the block entity ensures that the daylight detector is updated every game tick."}

This can be easily calculated as the proportion = 72, since there are 1440 minutes (86400 seconds) in a real day (3600 seconds \u00d7 24 hours) and 20 minutes (1200 seconds) in a full \"Minecraft\" day, assuming the &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; speed is maintained at 20 ticks/second. A collection of time unit conversions is listed below:\nReal time to Minecraft time.\nThe approximation of real time to \"Minecraft\" time:\n24-hour \"Minecraft\" day.\nDaytime.\nDaytime is the longest section of the cycle, lasting 10 minutes.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; first &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"singleplayer\"&gt;singleplayer&lt;/a&gt;, the daylight cycle always starts at the beginning of the daytime (0:00). Most &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"server\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;s also start at the beginning of the daytime, but the daylight cycle continues regardless of any new players joining.\nDuring the daytime, the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; rises up to its peak in a light blue sky. The exact color of the sky depends on the current &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;; for example, &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; skies are a lighter shade of blue than &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; skies.\nAll blocks that are in direct vertical view of the sky receive sunlight at the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;internal sky-light&lt;/a&gt; level 15, which is the maximum. Sunlight provides ample light for the growth of &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt;. Most undead mobs (including &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s) exposed to direct sunlight (and are not in shade, in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, or wearing &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;s) are set on fire. Additionally, sunlight renders &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s neutral, unless they are currently chasing a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, and any &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; exposed to sunlight teleport randomly when near the player and randomly become neutral if having been aggressive for at least 30 seconds.\nSunset/dusk.\nSunset is the period between daytime and nighttime, and always lasts 50 seconds.\nDuring sunset, the Sun descends on the western horizon, and the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; rises on the eastern horizon. The sky near the setting Sun glows a vibrant orange-red. The &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;internal sky-light&lt;/a&gt; level decreases. Eventually, undead mobs exposed to direct sunlight are set not to burn.\nBetween dusk and dawn, players may sleep in a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. In singleplayer mode, doing so advances the daylight cycle to dawn and sets the &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; to clear. This also occurs in multiplayer as long as every player online is in a bed simultaneously. Time does not pass for other aspects of the world, however; for example, crops do not grow and &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s do not cook or smelt as they would when players are awake.\nNighttime.\nNighttime lasts 8 minutes 20 seconds.\nDuring the night, the Moon rises to its peak in a dark blue sky dotted with small white stars. The stars appear to move with the Moon and can be first seen toward the end of the sunset.\nDuring the nighttime, the world is covered in darkness; the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;internal sky-light&lt;/a&gt; level falls to a minimum of 4, which allows &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn on the surface. The exact duration for which hostile mobs are able to spawn in exposed areas is 13188 ticks. Regardless of the low light level, crops continue to grow during the night as long as one player is not sleeping.\nSunrise/dawn.\nSunrise is the period between nighttime and daytime, and always lasts 50 seconds.\nDuring sunrise, the Moon sets on the western horizon and the Sun rises on the eastern horizon. The sky near the rising Sun glows orange.\nThe &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;internal sky-light&lt;/a&gt; level increases. Eventually, the effects of sunlight return, dissipating the threat of most hostile mobs.\nClocks.\nA &lt;a href=\"clock\"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt; allows players to determine \"Minecraft\" time. A clock is useful while underground where the current day/night cycle is not visible. A clock helps the player avoid mistakenly surfacing at night and falling prey to night-spawned mobs on the surface.\nClocks spin uselessly in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, because there is no daylight cycle in those &lt;a href=\"dimensions\"&gt;dimensions&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommands.\nIf &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; are enabled, then it is possible to change the current time with the commands, as detailed below. To enable or disable the daylight cycle, use the following command: \nSet time.\nSpecific times can be set with the command.\nExamples:\nMoon phases.\nEach day that progresses adds 24000 ticks to the time counter. While each day looks the same, the &lt;a href=\"Moon\"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; appears in one of eight different phases each night. Although there is no explicit command to change the Moon's phase, using advances the Moon to its next phase. Furthermore, any of the phases can be accessed with the use of one of the following commands:"}

They can be placed on any kind of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;; they can also be placed on &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;s. They can also be planted in &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;s. Dead bushes do not spread, and cannot be grown using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most plants, dead bushes cannot be &lt;a href=\"Composter%23Composting\"&gt;composted&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmelting.\nDead bushes can be used as &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt; one &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; per dead bush."}

In this state, blocks can't be changed even in creative mode or with commands.\nDebug Mode World Preset.\nTo select the debug mode, hold the key while clicking the \"World Type\" button in the world creation menu. Debug mode is the world type directly after &lt;a href=\"Buffet\"&gt;Single Biome&lt;/a&gt;, and just before &lt;a href=\"World%20preset\"&gt;default preset&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon selecting debug mode, the \"Bonus Chest\", \"Generate Structures\", \"Allow Cheats\" and \"Data Pack\" options are removed from the menu. The game mode is set to &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; is locked on peaceful, and cheats are enabled. The game rule is forced to false, while other game rules are forced to default value.\nDebug Generator.\nThe codice_1 generator contains all &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s, in all of their existing &lt;a href=\"block%20states\"&gt;block states&lt;/a&gt;, organized in a single world. The world updates automatically to include any new registered &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20data%20values\"&gt;block IDs&lt;/a&gt; that are added. Therefore, this mode is useful not only to &lt;a href=\"Mojang\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt; developers, but also to creators of &lt;a href=\"resource%20pack\"&gt;resource pack&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mod\"&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBlock grid.\nEvery block state generates only once. They are sorted in a grid spread across an &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt; of y=70. The block grid changes its size according to the number of blocks and block states available, roughly resembling a square (as of 1.14.2, 213 in width and 211 eastward), occupying the +X,+Z (southeast) quadrant.\nA barrier floor at y=60 also spawns, extending past the grid in all directions to the &lt;a href=\"world%20boundary\"&gt;world boundary&lt;/a&gt;. Other than the barrier floor, the remainder of the map is empty. \nDebug Mode State.\nDebug mode can refer to a state of the world. If the Overworld uses the \"debug\" generator, the world goes into the debug world state.\nWorld Generation.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"End%20portal\"&gt;End portal&lt;/a&gt; is used, or teleported using , the player enter other dimensions. The sky, light level and other properties remain appropriate to the &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this state, all the dimensions are forced to use the \"debug\" generator. The chunk rendering may not update by itself in these dimensions, resulting in the need to right-click a block to render a new chunk.\nIn the vanilla &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt;s still spawn, although the dragon cannot break or interact with blocks.\nWorld behavior.\nIt is impossible to change, place or remove any block, even by the game itself.\nChunk's &lt;a href=\"tick%23Chunk%20tick\"&gt;chunk tick&lt;/a&gt; (including random ticks) does not execute.\nNo entity spawns naturally.\nAny block whose interactions do not change its &lt;a href=\"block%20state\"&gt;block state&lt;/a&gt; can still be (including &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cake\"&gt;cake&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Although a block's state cannot change, its &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; data can change, either through normal player interaction or with the use of the command.\nThese unique properties of debug mode can cause certain blocks to behave in unexpected ways, though due to the arrangement of blocks next to one another, not all may be seen in every version:"}

More detailed information about one section can be displayed by using the keys 1-9. Press 0 to go back to the previous section.\nFrame time graph.\nBar chart in the lower left of the debug screen displays real time measurement of milliseconds per frame with lines marking 16.7 and 33.3 milliseconds per frame, corresponding to 60 and 30 FPS respectively. The graph is color coded from green to yellow to red, with green being faster frame time, red being slower frame time, and yellow in between. In singleplayer and self-hosted LAN worlds (i.e. when running an integrated server), another graph, at the bottom right, shows milliseconds per tick (MSPT) with a line marking 50 MSPT, which is the maximum amount of time a game tick can take while maintaining 20 ticks per second (the intended rate). The color-coding is similar to the FPS graph.\nMore debug keys.\nText appears in chat for most debug keys listed here. Note that when using a specific key combination like , , etc., the debug screen does not open.\nWhen the codice_1 &lt;a href=\"gamerule\"&gt;gamerule&lt;/a&gt; is set to codice_2, the effects of (entity hitboxes), (chunk boundaries), (copying coordinates), and (copying block/entity data) are not shown.

Deserts are more likely to generate in areas with high &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt; values, which means that the terrain in which they generate is generally flat but with occasional hills, similar to the ones found in &lt;a href=\"Windswept%20Hills\"&gt;windswept hills&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Deserts can also generate in lower erosions but usally as a separation between a badlands biome and the oceans. Deserts are often found bordering &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20swamp\"&gt;mangrove swamp&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"stony%20shore\"&gt;stony shore&lt;/a&gt;s. Deserts can also generate at any &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; value, and at high humidities, lush caves can sometimes generate underneath deserts.\nDesert biomes are quite barren. Among the animals that can spawn in the desert, only &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in the wild, while &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;s appear in desert &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;Cactus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es generate frequently across the landscape. Sugar canes may generate along water. &lt;a href=\"Lava\"&gt;Lava&lt;/a&gt; ponds may still generate; water may still generate if the altitude dips low enough. Deserts make up for their barrenness by featuring a relatively large number of structures, such as pillager outposts, villages, &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fossil\"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"desert%20well\"&gt;desert well&lt;/a&gt;s. Villages and desert temples may offer refuge and valuable loot, desert wells may serve as a rare source of water, and fossils can provide large numbers of &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, or simply a neat paleontological find, while &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s are the only source of wood on the desert surface.\nDespite the structures, survival in deserts can still be difficult if one does not bring sufficient resources, as the desert has virtually no resources of its own. Wood &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s can be obtained only from &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"azalea%20tree\"&gt;azalea tree&lt;/a&gt;s if there's a &lt;a href=\"Lush%20Caves\"&gt;lush cave&lt;/a&gt; underground, though &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es provide a source of &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt;s. Wood can also be obtained by growing a sapling, which can be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;. The only desert water sources are &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"desert%20well\"&gt;desert well&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s and aquifers. At night, most &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn in deserts and variants are replaced by &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, variants of zombies that inflict the &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; effect and do not burn in the sun, resulting in more hostile mobs present during daytime.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Desert."}

The desert temple contains four loot &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s hidden under the floor in the center protected by a &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; trap, and a secret buried room to the side where &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; can be performed. Even though it is officially called desert pyramid, colloquially it is referred to as desert temple.\nGeneration.\nDesert pyramids generate in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; biomes. Desert pyramids have a lower generation frequency in than in .\nStructure.\nDesert pyramids are intended to represent an excavation site. The structure is constructed with normal, chiseled and cut sandstone, orange and blue &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt;, sandstone &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s and sandstone &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pattern of orange terracotta on the towers of desert pyramids is an ; the ancient Egyptian symbol for life and the key. There is one main entrance in the front, two more entrances in the back on both the left and right sides near the top of the pyramid, and a one-block wide window at the top. Even if the rest of the pyramid generates mostly buried by sand, the top of the pyramid is almost always above ground. A mostly buried pyramid can still be accessed by the window in the top if necessary, though fall &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; is likely. In the center of the pyramid's 21\u00d721 ground floor is a checkerboard pattern of terracotta and sandstone in a wind rose symbol, with a block of blue terracotta in the center.\nUnderneath this terracotta is a secret fosse containing four chests, which are rigged by a &lt;a href=\"stone%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;stone pressure plate&lt;/a&gt; directly under the blue terracotta block. The pressure plate is connected to a 3\u00d73 grid of &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;, which means that if a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; unintentionally steps on the plate, it sets off the nine TNT blocks, which destroy the chests and their loot. As there is no light in the chest room, mobs sometimes spawn inside it and trigger the TNT trap, destroying the chests and loot before any player can reach it.\nAs of update 1.20, desert pyramids also generate with a lower room situated in the back (either on the left or right), and buried in sand, some of it being suspicious. This room is 5x5 blocks in length, has another instance of the sandstone wind rose pattern on the ground, and is connected to the main floor with collapsed stairs.\nWhen a desert pyramid generates above a &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;, the foundation extends downward until it reaches the bottom.\nChest Loot.\nThe loot chances above are \"per chest\". As each chest has a 2.6% chance to contain an enchanted golden apple for example, with four chests, each pyramid has about a 10% chance overall of having at least one."}

{"id": "11579", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11579", "title": "Detector Rail", "text": "A detector rail is a type of &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; that produces a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone signal&lt;/a&gt; when a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; is on it.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nA detector rail can be broken fairly easily by hand, dropping itself as an item. It can be broken faster by using a pickaxe. \nA detector rail also drops as an item if:\nUsage.\nA detector rail can be used as a &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt; that can detect when &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s are on it or how full container minecarts on it are.\nTo place a detector rail, use the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt; on the face of a block adjacent to the destination space.\nA detector rail can be attached to:\nA detector rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the detector rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a detector rail to the side of the fence causes the detector rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Block%20update\"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; while on an opened trapdoor, a detector rail (or other rails) breaks drops as an item. Placing a minecart on a detector rail on top of a closed and unpowered trapdoor opens the trapdoor and updates it, causing the detector rail to break. If the trapdoor is powered while the minecart is placed, the trapdoor does not open and the rail does not break. The minecart on the detector rail powers the trapdoor and keeps it closed even if the external power source is removed, allowing the detector rail to stay on.\nWhen placed, a detector rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s (including &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"detector%20rail\"&gt;detector rail&lt;/a&gt;s), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the detector rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a detector rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a detector rail \"prefers\", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;Mob&lt;/a&gt;s avoid walking across a detector rail (or other rails), but can be pushed onto them.\nIt cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.\nRail.\nDetector rails (and other rails) act as \"roads\" for &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s. A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from either end of the detector rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with &lt;a href=\"powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rail&lt;/a&gt;s). A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the detector rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted detector rail.\nRedstone component.\nA detector rail activates when any minecart is on it (even if only a portion of the minecart is on it), and deactivates when no minecarts are on it. The duration of the signal is always a multiple of 10 redstone ticks (although lag or unloading/reloading a chunk might affect this). While active, a detector rail:\nIf the minecart on the detector rail is a &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20chest\"&gt;minecart with chest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20hopper\"&gt;minecart with hopper&lt;/a&gt;, an adjacent redstone comparator facing away from the detector rail outputs a power level proportional to the &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Comparator%23Measure%20block%20state\"&gt;container's fullness&lt;/a&gt;, possibly power level 0. For any other type of minecart (including a regular minecart with a mob riding it) the comparator's output is zero.\nA comparator can read the contents of a minecart with hopper or with chest on a detector rail through a solid opaque block, as it can with other container blocks."}
