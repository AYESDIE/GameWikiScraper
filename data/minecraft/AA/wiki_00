It can also be set to either stop outputting a signal when its side input receives a stronger one (front torch off), or subtract its side input's signal strength from its output (front torch on).\nObtaining.\nNatural generation.\nRedstone comparators generate in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nA redstone comparator can be broken instantly with any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, or by hand, and drops itself as an item.\nA redstone comparator is removed and dropped as an item if:\nIf &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; flows into a redstone comparator's space, the redstone comparator is destroyed without dropping as an item.\nUsage.\nA redstone comparator can be placed on the top of any &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block with a solid full-height top surface (including upside-down &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s and upside-down &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;). , a comparator can also be placed on &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;s and fences. For more information about placement on transparent blocks, see &lt;a href=\"Opacity/Placement\"&gt;Opacity/Placement&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe redstone comparator has a front and a back \u2014 the arrow on the top of the comparator points to the front. When placed, the comparator faces away from the player. The comparator has two miniature redstone torches at the back and one at the front. The back torches turn on when the comparator's output is greater than zero (the arrow on top also turns red). The front torch has two states that can be toggled by the comparator:\nThe redstone comparator can take a signal strength input from its rear as well as from both sides. Side inputs are accepted only from &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20redstone\"&gt;block of redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;s, other comparators, and &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s in specific scenarios. The redstone comparator's front is its output.\nIt takes 1 &lt;a href=\"redstone%20tick\"&gt;redstone tick&lt;/a&gt; (2 game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag) for signals to move through a redstone comparator, either from the rear or from the sides. This applies to changing signal strengths as well as simply to turning on and off. \nRedstone comparators check their power state before their scheduled ticks update. This results in redstone comparators not usually responding to 1-tick fluctuations of power or signal strength \u2014 for example, a &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;1-clock&lt;/a&gt; input is treated as always off from the side, and always on from the rear. This happens because the signal changes back to its original state before the redstone comparator checks its input states. However, certain setups such as powering any input with two separate observer pulses at the same time will cause a redstone comparator to respond to 2 gametick pulses.\nThe redstone comparator has four functions: maintain signal strength, compare signal strength, subtract signal strength, and measure certain block states (primarily the fullness of containers).\nMaintain signal strength.\nA redstone comparator with no powered sides outputs the same signal strength as its rear input.\nCompare signal strength.\nA redstone comparator in comparison mode (front torch down and unpowered) compares its rear input to its two side inputs. If either side input is greater than the rear input, the comparator output turns off. If neither side input is greater than the rear input, the comparator outputs the same signal strength as its rear input.\nThe formula for calculating the output signal strength is as follows:\ncodice_1\nSubtract signal strength.\nA redstone comparator in subtraction mode (front torch up and powered) subtracts the signal strength of the higher side input from the signal strength of the rear input.\ncodice_2\nFor example: if the signal strength is 6 at the left input, 7 at the right input and 4 at the rear, the output signal has a strength of \"max(4 \u2212 max(6, 7), 0) = max(4\u22127, 0) = max(\u22123, 0) = 0\".\nIf the signal strength is 9 at the rear, 2 at the right input and 5 at the left input, the output signal has a strength of \"max(9 \u2212 max(2, 5), 0) = max(9\u22125, 0) = 4\".\nMeasure block state.\nA redstone comparator treats certain blocks behind it as power sources and outputs a signal strength proportional to the block's state. The comparator may be separated from the measured block by an opaque block. However, , if the opaque block is powered to signal strength 15, then the comparator outputs 15 no matter the fullness of the container.\nFullness of containers.\nA redstone comparator can output a signal indicating how full a container is. (0 for empty, 15 for full, etc.) The table on the right is described more in detail, later in this section.\nContainers that can be measured by a comparator include:\nGenerally speaking, the comparator output signal strength represents the average fullness of the slots, based on how many of that item form a full stack (64, 16, or 1 for non-stackable items).\nThe \"Minimum Items for Container Signal Strength\" table (right) shows the minimum full-stack-equivalent (FSE) to produce different signal strengths from common containers. A full-stack-equivalent quantifies how many normal 64-stackable items are needed to output a corresponding signal strength. The 's' is a constant 64, with the additional amount needed following after.\nOne may also consider the terms: c\"umulative-weight or weighted-sum instead of full-stack-equivalent\".\nItems that stack to a max of 16 (&lt;a href=\"snowball\"&gt;snowball&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.), contribute +4 to the \"full-stack-equivalent\" for each unity (count of 1 item). Similarly, items that stack to 1 (&lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) contribute +64, and items that stack to 64 contribute +1.\nExample 1: 3 ender pearls will contribute a 3 x 4 = 12 \"full-stack-equivalent\".\nExample 2: 16 ender pearls and 60 redstone dust contributes a 16x4 + 60x1 = 124 \"full-stack-equivalent\".\nExample 3: 1 minecart and 60 redstone dust contributes a 1x64 + 60x1 = 124 \"full-stack-equivalent\".\nExample 4: To produce a signal strength of 10 from a hopper, one requires a \"full-stack-equivalent\" of at least 3s + 14 = 206 but strictly less than than 3s + 37 = 229. This can be done with 3 minecarts, and 14 dirt.\nWhen a comparator measures a large chest or large trapped chest, it measures the entire large chest (54 slots), not just the half directly behind the comparator. A chest or trapped chest that cannot be opened (either because it has an opaque block, &lt;a href=\"ocelot\"&gt;ocelot&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; above it) always produces an output of 0 no matter how many items are in the container \u2014 shulker boxes can always be measured, even if they cannot open.\n1 + ((300 items / 64 items per slot) / 9 slots) \u00d7 14 = 8.292, floored is 8\nmax(9, (3\u00d764/14) \u00d7 (9\u22121)) = 109.714, rounded up is 110\nMiscellaneous.\nSome non-container blocks can also be measured by a redstone comparator:\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA redstone comparator has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to repeater textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\""}

It can also be used to power redstone components.\nRedstone component.\nWhen placed in the world, redstone dust becomes a block of \"redstone wire\", which can transmit &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Power\"&gt;redstone power&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmithing ingredient.\nThe following color palette is shown on the designs on trimmed armor:\nPlacement.\nRedstone dust can be placed on &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; blocks as well as &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, upside-down &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, upside-down &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;s. It can also be placed on some transparent blocks; see &lt;a href=\"Opacity/Placement\"&gt;Opacity/Placement&lt;/a&gt; for more information. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands, which is not unintentional.\nRedstone wire configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Power%20components\"&gt;power components&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Transmission%20components\"&gt;transmission component&lt;/a&gt; connection points. Redstone wire also configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone wire one block higher or lower \u2013 unless there is a solid opaque block above the lower redstone wire.\nIf there is only one such adjacent redstone component, redstone wire configures itself into a line pointing both at the neighbor and away from it. If there are two or more such adjacent components, redstone wire connects them in the form of , , , or as needed.\nWhen there are no adjacent components, a single redstone wire configures itself into a plus sign, which can provide power in all four directions. By right-clicking it can be changed into a dot, which does not provide power to any of the four directions.\n, redstone wire automatically configures itself to point toward adjacent blocks or &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Mechanism%20components\"&gt;mechanism components&lt;/a&gt;. , it does not. If such a configuration is desired, the other neighbors of the redstone wire must be arranged to create it, i.e the redstone dust must be placed in a way that it would be pointed at the block\u2019s location even if it were not there.\nWhen redstone wire is reconfigured after placement, it does not update other redstone components around it of the change unless that reconfiguration also includes a change in power level or another component provides an update. This can create situations where a mechanism component remains activated when it shouldn't, or vice versa, until it receives an update from something else \u2013 a \"feature\" of redstone wire that can be used to make a &lt;a href=\"BUD\"&gt;block update detector&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nRedstone wire can transmit power, which can be used to operate &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Mechanism%20components\"&gt;mechanism components&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.).\nRedstone wire can be \"powered\" by a number of methods:\nThe \"power level\" of redstone dust can vary from 0 to 15. Most power components power-up adjacent redstone dust to power level 15, but a few (&lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trapped%20chest\"&gt;trapped chest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"weighted%20pressure%20plate\"&gt;weighted pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s) may create a lower power level. Redstone repeaters output power level 15 (when turned on), but &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;s may output a lower power level.\nPower level drops by 1 for every block of redstone wire it crosses. Thus, redstone wire can transmit power for no more than 15 blocks. To go further, the power level must be re-strengthened \u2013 typically with a redstone repeater.\nPowered redstone wire on top of, or pointing at, an opaque block provides \"weak\" power to the block. A weakly-powered block cannot power other adjacent redstone wire, but can still power redstone repeaters and comparators, and activate adjacent mechanism components. Transparent blocks cannot be powered.\nWhen redstone wire is unpowered, it appears dark red. When powered, it becomes bright red at power level 15, fading to darker shades with decreasing power. Powered redstone wire also produces \"dust\" &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; of the same color.\nWhile redstone wire always provides power to the directions it points into, it can still point into directions in which it cannot give power. If redstone wire comes in the form of a cross, the player can right-click to toggle it between a cross and dot. A redstone dot does not power anything adjacent to it, but powers the block under it."}

It can also be locked into a power state by its side being directly powered by a repeater or a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nA redstone repeater can be broken instantly using any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, or without a tool, and drops itself as an item. To remove a redstone repeater, it.\nA redstone repeater is removed and drops as an item if:\nNatural generation.\nA single redstone repeater is generated naturally in each &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey also generate in &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nA redstone repeater can be used in four different ways: to \"repeat\" redstone signals back to full strength, delay signals, prevent signals moving backwards, or to \"lock\" signals in one state.\nA repeater can be placed only on top of &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; blocks (dirt, stone, etc.), on top of upside-down &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, upside-down &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, furnaces, and glass. , a repeater can also be placed on fences and stone walls. They can also be placed on some transparent blocks. See &lt;a href=\"Opacity/Placement\"&gt;Opacity/Placement&lt;/a&gt; for more information. To place a repeater, use the &lt;a href=\"control\"&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;.\nA redstone repeater has a front and back \u2013 the arrow on the top points to the repeater's front. A repeater also has two small redstone torches on its top \u2013 the color of the torches indicates whether its output is on (dark red when off, bright red when on) and the distance between them indicates the delay the repeater adds to the signal transmission.\nA repeater is 0.125 () blocks high.\nSignal transmission.\nA repeater transmits signals only from its back to its front, but its behavior can be modified from the side (see &lt;a href=\"%23Signal%20locking\"&gt;signal locking&lt;/a&gt;, below).\nA redstone repeater can be powered by any of the following components at its back:\nA redstone repeater can power any of the following components at its front:\nA redstone repeater can activate any &lt;a href=\"mechanism%20component\"&gt;mechanism component&lt;/a&gt; it is facing.\nAn opaque block powered by a redstone repeater is called \"strongly-powered\" (as opposed to an opaque block \"weakly-powered\" by redstone dust). A strongly-powered opaque block can power adjacent redstone dust, as well as other redstone components.\nSignal repeating.\nA redstone repeater can \"repeat\" a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; signal, boosting it back up to power level 15.\nRedstone signals have a maximum power level of 15 and that level drops by 1 for every block of &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; the signal travels through. If a signal must travel through more than 15 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s of redstone dust, a redstone repeater can be used to boost the signal back up to full strength. An extra two blocks of distance can be achieved by placing solid opaque blocks before and after the repeater.\nWhile redstone repeaters can allow signals to travel great distances, each always adds some delay to the transmission since the minimum amount of delay is 1 redstone tick (0.1 seconds, barring lag).\nSignal delay.\nWhen initially placed, a redstone repeater has a delay of one &lt;a href=\"redstone%20tick\"&gt;redstone tick&lt;/a&gt; (equivalent to two game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag).\nA repeater's delay can be modified by using the control. Each use increases the repeater's delay by one redstone tick, to a maximum of four redstone ticks, then back to one redstone tick. Longer delays can be made with multiple repeaters \u2013 for example, a repeater set to 'four' and another to 'one' provides a half-second delay (0.4s + 0.1s = 0.5s).\nA repeater set to a delay of two to four redstone ticks increases the length of any shorter &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23Pulses\"&gt;on-pulse&lt;/a&gt; to match the length of the repeater's delay, and suppress any shorter off-pulse. For example, a repeater set to a 4-tick delay changes a 1-tick, 2-tick, or 3-tick on-pulse into a 4-tick on-pulse, and does not allow through any off-pulse shorter than 4 ticks.\nAlthough a repeater cannot be set to have a delay of zero, &lt;a href=\"Transmission%20circuit%23Instant%20repeater\"&gt;instant repeater circuits&lt;/a&gt; are possible (circuits that repeat a signal with no delay).\nIn Bedrock Edition, the first repeater have a delay of zero but the repeater is still showing 1-tick\nSignal direction.\nA redstone repeater acts as a diode \u2013 it allows redstone signals through in one direction (unlike &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; or opaque blocks that can transmit redstone signals in any direction).\nA diode can be used to protect a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt; from redstone signals feeding back into the circuit from its output, or can be used to isolate one part of a circuit from another.\nSignal locking.\nA redstone repeater can be \"locked\" by another powered redstone repeater facing its side. When locked, the repeater does not change its output (whether powered or unpowered), no matter what the input does. When the side repeater turns back off, the repeater returns to its normal behavior.\nA repeater can also be locked by a powered &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; facing its side. This offers additional possibilities for locking signals because a comparator's output can be affected from 3 sides as well as by containers.\nIf a repeater is locked again too quickly after unlocking (e.g. the lock is controlled by a fast clock circuit), or the lock and the input are changed only on the same tick (e.g. because they're fed by the same clock and both repeaters have the same delay), the repeater does not switch states.\nHistory.\n\"For a more in-depth breakdown of changes to repeater textures and models, including a set of renders for each state combination, see &lt;a href=\"/Asset%20history\"&gt;/Asset history&lt;/a&gt;\""}

Circuits can act in response to &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; activation, continuously on a loop, or in response to non-player activity (mob movement, item drops, plant growth, etc). \nA useful distinction can be made between a circuit performing operations on signals (generating, modifying, combining, etc.), and a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mechanisms\"&gt;mechanism&lt;/a&gt; manipulating the environment (moving blocks, opening doors, changing the light level, producing sound, etc.). Making this distinction lets us talk about the various circuits separately, and will let players choose whichever circuits are useful for their purposes. The machines controlled by redstone circuits can range from simple devices such as automatic doors and light switches to complex devices such as elevators, automatic farms, or even in-game computers. However, \"this\" article provides only an overview of redstone \"circuits\" as above. These can be used to control simple mechanisms, or combined as parts of a larger build. Each circuit type on this page has links to its own page, which provides greater detail about them and give schematics for multiple variations of each. \nBefore working with any but the most basic Redstone circuits, an understanding of some basic concepts is required: \"power\", \"signal strength\", \"redstone ticks\", and \"block updates\". \nOther relevant articles:\nDescribing Circuits.\nMost circuits are described using diagrams; some of these require multiple images to show one or two layers per image. See the page for details on how various blocks and components are represented.\nSize.\nThe wiki describes circuit size (the volume of the rectangular solid it occupies) with the notation of \"shorter width\" \u00d7 \"longer width\" \u00d7 \"height\", including support/floor blocks, but not including inputs/outputs.\nAnother method used for describing circuit size in the \"Minecraft\" community is to ignore non-Redstone blocks simply used for support (for example, blocks under Redstone dust or repeaters). However, this method is unable to distinguish between &lt;a href=\"%23flat\"&gt;flat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%231-high\"&gt;1-high&lt;/a&gt; circuits, as well as some other circuit differences.\nSometimes it is convenient to compare circuits simply by the area of their footprint (e.g., 3\u00d74 for a circuit three-block wide by four blocks long), or by a single dimension important in a particular context (e.g., length in a sequence of sub-circuits, height in a confined space, etc.).\nFeatures.\nSeveral features may be considered desirable design goals:\nOther design goals may include reducing the delay a sub-circuit adds to a larger circuit, reducing the use of resource-expensive components (redstone, nether quartz, etc.), and re-arranging or redesigning a circuit to make it as small as possible.\nSome components are not available before a player has access to the Nether, which limits the designs available. In particular, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"daylight%20detector\"&gt;daylight detector&lt;/a&gt;s require &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;, which is available only from the Nether. Additionally, redstone lamps require &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, which is occasionally available from &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"witches\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt;, but is much more plentiful in the Nether.\nCircuit types.\nAlthough the number of ways to construct circuits is endless, certain patterns of construction occur repeatedly. The following sections attempt to categorize the circuits that have proven useful to the \"Minecraft\" community, while the main articles describe the specific circuits that fall into those categories.\nSome of these circuits might be used by themselves for simple control of mechanisms, but frequently the player needs to combine them into more complex circuits to meet the needs of a mechanism.\nTransmission circuit.\nSome aspects of signal transmission can be helpful to understand: transmission types, vertical transmission, repeaters, and diodes.\nLogic circuit.\nIt's sometimes necessary to check signals against each other and output a signal only when the inputs meet some criteria. A circuit that performs this function is known as a logic gate (a \"gate\" that allows signals through only if the logic is satisfied). \nIn electronic or programming diagrams, logic gates are typically shown as if they were individual devices; However, when building redstone devices in \"Minecraft\", all logic gates are formed from multiple blocks and components, which interact to produce the desired results.\nPulse circuit.\nSome circuits require specific pulses; other circuits use pulse duration to convey information. Pulse circuits manage these requirements.\nA circuit that is stable in one output state and unstable in the other is known as a &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23Monostable%20circuit\"&gt;monostable circuit&lt;/a&gt;. Many pulse circuits are monostable because their OFF state is stable, but their ON state soon reverts to OFF.\nClock circuit.\nA clock circuit is a pulse generator that produces a loop of specific pulses repeatedly. Some are designed to run forever, while others can be stopped and started.\nA simple clock with only two states of equal duration is named for the duration of its ON state (e.g., for example, a clock that alternates between a 5-tick ON state and a 5-tick OFF state is called a 5-clock) while others are usually named for their period (the time it takes for the clock to return to its original state; for example, a \"1-minute clock\" might produce a 1-tick pulse every 60 seconds).\nClocks can also be built using &lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, water flow, item despawn, etc.\nMemory circuit.\nUnlike a logic circuit whose state always reflects its current inputs, a memory circuit's output depends not on the current state of its inputs, but on the \"history\" of its inputs. This allows a memory circuit to \"remember\" what state it should be in, until told to remember something else. There are five basic types of memory circuits. (A few circuits combine two different types.) \nMany other memory circuits are possible.\nPiston Circuits.\n&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Pistons&lt;/a&gt; have allowed players to design circuits that are smaller and/or faster than the standard, redstone-only counterparts. An understanding of standard &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuits\"&gt;redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt; is helpful, as this tutorial is focused on the circuit design rather than the function. The main components here are &lt;a href=\"Sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky pistons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20wire\"&gt;redstone wire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Repeater\"&gt;repeaters&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torches&lt;/a&gt;. Regular pistons can also see use, especially combined with gravity blocks.\nThere are several benefits of piston circuitry:\nMiscellaneous circuits.\nThese circuits aren't generally needed for redstone projects, but might find use in complex projects, proofs of concept, and thought experiments. Some examples:"}

{"id": "34715", "revid": "56272835", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34715", "title": "Redstone circuits/Clock", "text": "A clock circuit is a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt; that produces a clock signal: a pattern of pulses that repeats itself.\nIntroduction.\n are devices where the output is toggling between on and off constantly. The customary name \"x\"-clock is derived from half of the period length, which is also usually the pulse width. For example, a classic 5-clock produces the sequence codice_1 on the output.\nUsing only redstone torches and wire, it is possible to create clocks as short as a 3-clock. Using repeaters or pistons allows easy construction of any clock down to 1-clocks, and other devices can also be pressed into service. There are also special circuits called \"rapid pulsers\", which produce rapid pulses like a 1 tick clock, but inconsistently due to torches burning out. Indeed, torch based rapid pulses can be too fast for repeaters. Even with repeaters in use, 1-clock signals are difficult to handle in other circuits, as many components and circuits do not respond in a timely fashion.\nCreating long clocks (more than a few ticks) can be more difficult, as adding repeaters eventually gets unwieldy. However, there are a number of approaches here, which are discussed in a separate section.\nClocks without an explicit toggle can often have one retrofitted, by wiring a lever or other switch to the controlling block of an inverter, or even to a redstone loop. In general, forcing the delay loop high eventually stops the clock, but the output may not respond until the current pulse has made its way through the loop. Whether the output gets stopped high or low depends on the clock and where in the loop players force it. Another option is to use a lever-controlled piston to open or close one of those loops, using either a solid block to transmit power, or a block of redstone to supply it.\nWhile it isn't much discussed in the circuit builds below, there is one additional concept that is occasionally important: \"Phase\". The phase of a running clock is the point it has reached in its cycle. For example, at one moment a 5 clock might be 3 ticks into its ON phase, 4 ticks later, it is 2 ticks into its OFF phase. A long-period clock might be noted as 2 minutes past the start of its ON phase. The exact beginning of a cycle depends on the clock, but it is usually the start of either the OFF phase or the ON phase. For most cases, phase doesn't matter because they just need pulses every 7 ticks or so. However, in-game computing circuits are more demanding, and if they are doing a daily clock, they should care whether the on phase is day or night.\nTorch clock.\nRapid pulser.\nRedundancy can be used to maintain a 1-clock, even as the torches burn out; the result is the so-called \"Rapid Pulsar\" (designs X, Y and (vertical) Z). However, the signal may not be consistent.\nDevice R creates energy in an irregular sequence. It is a variant of the \"Rapid Pulsar\" design shown above, except that each torch pulses in an irregular pseudo-random pattern as each torch coming on turns the other three (and itself) off. Occasionally torches burn out for a few seconds (until reset by a block update), during which time other torches blink. As of version 1.5.1, this is likely to favor one pair of torches, such as the east and west torches, which blink while the others stay dark. Output can be taken anywhere on the circuit.\nAlthough \"pulser\" is the correct spelling for any general circuit that produces pulses, the traditional spelling of a clock circuit created from short-circuited redstone torches is \"rapid pulsar\".\nTorch loop.\nThe basic torch pulser is the oldest clock circuit in \"Minecraft\", simply an odd number of inverters (NOT gates) joined in a loop. The design has been mostly replaced by repeater-based clocks, but still works. Design A shows a 5-clock, which had historically been the shortest clock that can easily be made this way. Its pulse length can be extended by adding pairs of torches, while the inclusion of &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s would turn it into a &lt;a href=\"%23Torch-repeater%20clock\"&gt;torch-repeater clock&lt;/a&gt;. Designs B and C show torch 5-clocks with a smaller footprint, while design G is a vertical version of the 5-clock.\nUsing this principle, it is possible to create 1-clocks and 3-clocks, but the first one is unstable and erratic as the torch would \"burn out\" and require a &lt;a href=\"block%20update\"&gt;block update&lt;/a&gt; to reactivate it. The same used to apply to 3-clocks before an unknown \"Minecraft\" version.\nDesign D uses a different method to produce a torch-only 4-clock. Here, each torch's output is fed into two other torches, instead of only one as in a basic torch loop. It resembles a pair of interconnected &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuits/Memory%23RS-NOR%20latches\"&gt;RS-NOR latches&lt;/a&gt;.\nRepeater clock.\nA clock signal can be generated by introducing a pulse into a loop of &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTorch-repeater clock.\nSince the introduction of the repeater, the torch-loop clocks have been generally replaced with torch-repeater loops. In these clocks, most of the delay comes from repeaters, with a single torch to provide oscillation. Such clocks can't be shorter than a 3-clock (or the torch burns out), but they can be extended almost indefinitely (subject to space and material limits). However, once the loop reaches 9-16 repeaters (delays of 36-64 ticks), a &lt;a href=\"Memory%20circuit%23T%20Flip-Flop\"&gt;TFF&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"%23Clock%20multiplier\"&gt;clock multiplier&lt;/a&gt; can increase the period more cheaply (and compactly) than adding huge numbers of repeaters.) These examples are all (R+1)-clocks where R is the total repeater delay (that is, they spend R+1 ticks OFF, then the same time ON. All have at least one potential input that turns the clock OFF within half a cycle (after any current ON-phase passes the output). (Feeding an ON signal into the output also stops the clock, but of course then the output is high.) When the power turns off, the clock automatically restarts.\nDesign A shows a basic loop clock. The repeaters must have a total delay of at least 2 ticks, or the torch burns out. Powering the block turns off the clock. As many repeaters as needed can be added, and the loop can be expanded as needed with dust for cornering. The circuit as shown is flat, but large loops can be run onto multiple levels, to cut down on sprawl.\nDesign E is an extensible vertical clock. Its minimum size is 1\u00d75\u00d74, but it can be extended indefinitely, adding 2 repeaters (up to 8 ticks delay) for each block of extension. As shown, it has a minimum delay of 5 ticks. (This can be reduced to 3 or 4 by replacing repeaters with dust, or by using D instead.) A lever or redstone signal behind the torch stops the clock with output OFF (once any current ON-phase passes the output).\nDesign D is a tiny vertical clock, a compressed form of E, that can output a 3, 4, or 5-tick cycle.\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" June 30, 2011\nThe period is the repeater's delay plus 1, but the repeater must be set to at least 2 ticks or the torch burns out. This circuit is formally 1\u00d73\u00d73, but is most commonly built as a \"V\" on the ground, and can easily be buried entirely.\nComparator clock.\n&lt;a href=\"Comparator\"&gt;Comparator&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to make fast clocks and slow pulsers.\nFader pulser.\nA fader pulser is useful for making small clocks with periods less than 15 seconds (for longer periods, &lt;a href=\"%23Hopper%20clock\"&gt;hopper clocks&lt;/a&gt; can be smaller), but they are difficult to adjust to a precise period. They use a fader circuit (aka \"fader loop\" \u2013 a comparator loop where the signal strength declines with every pass through the loop because it travels through at least one length of two or more redstone dust), renewed by a redstone torch every time it fades out.\nAlternating clock.\nAlternates between two different signal strengths every other tick.\nCan be used to compact circuits that require lockstep timing.\nHopper clocks.\nA hopper clock (a.k.a. \"hopper timer\") uses the movement of items between at least two hoppers to create a clock signal.\nGeneral aspects:\nGo to &lt;a href=\"%23Hopper%20clock%20schematics\"&gt;#Hopper clock schematics&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nHopper clock schematics.\nThis sub-page contains ~24 schematics. Open it only if needed.\nOr open the same page on its own: &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Clock_circuit/Hopper_clocks\"&gt;Hopper clocks&lt;/a&gt;\nDropper-Dropper clock.\nSimple design that does not require iron, because it uses no hoppers or pistons. However, it does require nether quartz. Pulsing output can be taken from the long dust trails in the top-right and bottom-left corners, while stable output can be taken from 1-tile dusts at top-left and bottom-right. The repeaters at the top and bottom are set to 3 ticks. The clock may need resetting after reloading the world.\nDespawn clock.\nA despawn clock uses item despawn timing to create a clock signal.\nSimply approaching a despawn clock can interfere with its timing, because any player might accidentally pick up the despawning item.\nCommand block clock.\nA setblock clock works by replacing a block of redstone or a redstone torch repeatedly with a command block activated by the &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20redstone\"&gt;block of redstone&lt;/a&gt; it places. A command takes 0.5 ticks to place a block, so these clocks are capable of producing 20 0-tick pulse per second. Only &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s can activate that rapidly \u2013 other &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Mechanism%20components\"&gt;mechanism components&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s powered by a setblock clock usually pulse only 5 times per second (like a 1-clock), while comparators may activate once and then stay on or not activate at all.\nTo prevent the destroyed blocks from dropping items use . To prevent the clock from spamming the chat use . To prevent the clock from spamming the server log use .\nBoth of these clocks begin running as soon as they're built. To turn them off, activate the command block setting the block of redstone from a secondary source. To turn them back on, remove the source of secondary activation and replace the block of redstone.\nPiston clock.\n&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to create clocks with a modifiable pulse delay without the use of pulse generators. pistons can be clocked in a fashion that leaves the arm extended only for the time required to push an adjacent block. However, note that if sticky pistons are regularly used this way (that is, as a 1-clock), they can occasionally \"drop\" (fail to retract) their block, which usually stops the clock. (Specifically, if the setup allows for a pulse \"less than\" 1 tick long, that causes a sticky piston drop its block. This can be useful, notably for toggles.) Piston clocks in general can be easily turned off or on by a \"toggle\" input T.\nMinimal Piston Clock (A).\nDesign A requires only a sticky piston and redstone wire, and is controllable. It runs as long as the toggle line (its power source) is on, and turns off when the toggle line is off. Repeaters can be added to increase its delay. If the repeater is replaced with wire, it can be used as a 1-tick clock, but it \"is\" prone to \"dropping\" its block.\nMinimal Dual-Piston Clock (B).\nDesign B shows how to counter block dropping with an optional, non-sticky, piston. The non sticky piston (the bottom one) is needed for the 1 tick clock as a self repair mechanism. It prevents detaching of the moving block from the sticky piston. If using it \"only\" for a 1-tick cycle, the repeater (under the extended piston) can be replaced with redstone wire. The toggle line stops the clock on a high signal. \nDual Block Piston Clock (C).\nDesign C requires two sticky pistons, and can be easily stopped by just setting one side of the redstone high. The repeaters can be indefinitely extended to make a long delay clock.\nCompact Sticky Piston Clock (D).\nDesign D needs just one sticky piston, but at the repeater must be set to 2 or more ticks. If it is set to one tick, the torch burns out. The output signal can be taken from any part of the circuit. This design can also be controlled; a high input on the toggle line stops the clock.\nAdvanced 1-tick Piston Clock (F).\nDesign F is an unusual, stable, 1-tick piston clock. Unlike most repeater-based 1-clocks, its signal is fast enough to make a sticky piston \"reliably\" toggle its block, dropping and picking it up on alternate pulses. For the clock to work, the block the piston moves must be placed last. The piston extends and retracts quickly. The output wire appears to stay off, because it's changing state faster than the game visually updates. However, attaching a redstone lamp, dispenser, dropper, piston, etc. to the output shows that it is working. The clock can be turned off by a redstone signal (\"e.g.\" the lever shown on the block below it) to the piston.\nThis clock is 2 blocks high, 3 wide, and 5 long. There is a solid block under the piston. The redstone torch between the repeater and the output line is at ground level.\nSimple 3-gametick Piston Clock (G).\nDesign G is the simplest design and can be used to create rapid clocks. However, it is not controllable, so the only way to stop such a circuit, without adding additional parts, is to break one component (one redstone wire is recommended). Place a block of redstone on a sticky piston, then lay down redstone so that the block powers the piston. Then, once the piston is powered and moves the block, the redstone current stops, pulling the block back to the original position, which causes the block to power the wire again, and so on. This clock creates a 0-tick pulse every 3-gameticks.\nSelf-Powered Piston Clock (H).\nDesign H is the simplest and the only one used vertically.\nTo make this design, place a &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; facing up with a redstone wire next to it on one edge. Next to the redstone wire but still 1 block away from the piston, place a solid block and place redstone wire on top of it. Then, next to that block, but still 1 block away from the piston, place &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; two blocks up with a redstone wire on top of it. Above the sticky piston place a &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, on top of that, place a redstone block. The clock activates immediately. It works on the principle of &lt;a href=\"quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity&lt;/a&gt;, and the wire directly next to the piston is used to update it.\nPlayers can also add on to this design and make it toggleable. To do this simply make a sticky piston push a solid block blocking the path from the redstone block to the piston. Because solid blocks stop redstone from connecting with a block diagonally, this stops the piston from powering on again and starting the clock again. Players can connect a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; to finish this addition.\n0 Tick Piston Clocks.\n0-tick clocks make use of 0-tick pulses and 0-tick chaining to create 0-tick pulses on a regular basis.\n1-output 3-gt clock.\nEvery 3 gameticks, the redstone block is 0-ticked to left and then 0-ticked back, creating a 0-tick pulse. The clock can be toggled by cutting the redstone line on the right\n2-output 3-gt clock.\nThis redstone clock create two 0-tick pulses every 3 gameticks. The 0-tick pulses are timed with the correct block event delay to allow the pulses to reliably chain two 0-tick pulses.\nWhen the repeater is powered, the back sticky piston starts extending. This un-cuts a redstone wire below the block, causing the front sticky piston to be powered and extend, causing the back piston to 0-tick tick block. This then causes the top block to get 0-ticked back, cutting the bottom wire again, and outputing a 0-tick pulse on the left. This causes the front piston to get 0-ticked, which then gets 0-ticked back, creating the second 0-tick output on the right.\n1-gt clock.\nThis clock makes use of three modules that output a signal every 3 gameticks, offset from each other by 0 gameticks, 2 gameticks, and 4 gameticks respectively. This outputs a pulse every gameticks, or 20 times a second.\nMinecart clock.\nMinecart clocks are simple, easy to build and modify, but are somewhat unreliable. A minecart clock is made by creating a small track rails with one or more &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;powered&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Detector%20Rail\"&gt;detector&lt;/a&gt; rails, arranged so that a minecart can run forever either around the track (A), or back and forth from end to end (B, C). (These need not be sloped\u2014properly placed powered rails lets a minecart \"bounce\" off solid blocks \u2014 but the player get some extra time as the cart slows down.) The redstone torch can also be placed in the center of the rails, making it more compact. A larger vertical track (design C) is claimed to produce an exceptionally stable clock. Note that the minecart never quite hits the top of the track.\nWhen running an empty minecart on the loop or back-and-forth, the cart generates redstone signals as it passes over the detector rail(s). Minecart clocks can be extended or shortened easily by adding and removing track, to adjust the delay between signals. On the flip side, they are easily disrupted by wandering players or mobs, and a long clock can take a fair bit of space. Also, the exact period is generally not apparent from the design. The need for gold in the booster rails can also be a problem for some players.\nObserver clocks.\nTwo observers watching each other makes for a compact rapid clock. creating a 1 redstone tick clock (2gt). A single observer could also be used as output, creating a 2 redstone tick (4gt) clock. One observer with redstone to let it watch itself can also be used. Wrap the redstone from the observing point over the top and around one side of the observer to the input. Break and replace the redstone being observed. You can add repeaters for longer periods. To switch the clock on of off, a lever can force the circuit high as usual, or a piston can be used to move one of the observers.\nLong-period clocks.\nCreating long repeater loops can be expensive. However, there are several sorts of clocks that are naturally quite long, or can easily be made so, and some are described above:\nThere are also a couple of extension techniques that apply to any clock whatsoever, including irregular pseudoclocks:\nClock multiplier.\nThis nearly-flat circuit (also known as a ring counter) takes a clock input of period codice_7 and any pulse length, and outputs as a clock of period codice_8, where codice_9 is the number of latches used; the output is on for a pulse length of codice_7, and off for the remaining codice_11. codice_9 is limited to 12 or so by redstone signal attenuation; however, the design can simply be repeated to multiply the period again, e.g. a 21-multiplier can be made by chaining a 7-multiplier and a 3-multiplier. This can be continued indefinitely, and unlike factorial stacking there is no restriction on the multipliers.\nThe build is somewhat tricky: The multiplier loop is in fact a torchless repeater-loop clock. This needs to be started separately, \"before\" the latches are engaged. The easiest way to start it is probably to add a temporary \"startup circuit\" starting 4 blocks from the dust part of the loop: Place a power source, then dust and a block for it to power. Finally place a redstone torch on the block, positioned to power the redstone loop. The torch flashes on for one tick before \"realizing\" it is powered, and this starts the loop as a clock, which cycles until the latches are powered. This startup rig can then be removed.\nThe latches are driven by an edge detector, which takes a rising edge and produces an OFF pulse; the pulse length must match the delays of the latched repeaters, so that the multiplier's pulse advances one repeater per edge. The delay/pulse length must also be no longer than the input clock, so it's probably best to keep them both at 1. Note that the delays of the latched repeaters are not actually part of the output period; the latches count off input edges. The circuit's output is ON while the last repeater is lit and lighting the dust loop.\nThis circuit need not be fed with a regular clock. With any varying input, it counts N rising edges and output HIGH between the (N-1)th and Nth rising edge.\n\"Variations:\"\n\"Efficiency:\" An efficient approach to making long-period clocks is to start with a repeater loop of 9 to 16 repeaters (up to 64 ticks), then add multiplier banks with N of 7, 5, and 3 (bigger is more efficient). Doublings should be done with T flipflops, as 2 of those are cheaper and perhaps shorter than a 4-multiplier. A couple of notes:\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" October 22, 2012\nRedstone Repeaters with Feedback.\nBy using a ring of redstone repeaters tapped at specific intervals and an OR gate set in a feedback loop extremely long durations can be created. Durations of minutes, hours, even days can be created using a minimal amount of parts.\nClock cycle time = 0.4 \u00d7 ( - 1) seconds.\nHence each time the player add a single redstone repeater, they can effectively double the cycle time. The same circuit can be used to create long duration clocks and delays of any duration in 0.4s increments. \nSuper Delay on YouTube &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzHI0vJBrPDQ\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nCopy of working minecraft save game &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mediafire.com/download/utfxmzj9ztky54a/Counters2.zip\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; \nBelow is an example of a free running 10 element clock that takes 409.2 seconds (6.82 minutes) to cycle. It outputs from the XOR Gate a unique stream of 0's and 1's that repeats every 409.2 seconds. \nTo turn it into a clock all we need to do is add a 10-Input Decoder that looks for one of those unique sequences. A NAND gate goes low when all redstone repeaters are outputting high.\nBy adding a RS flip-flop, we can reset our clock.\nHere is a version where the decoder resets the clock at the 3 minute mark.\nIn electronics this device is commonly known as a \"Linear Feedback Shift Register\" (LFSR), players can make them count up, count down, create psudo-random binary sequences for testing logic circuits. In TCP/IP a 32-bit 'Linear Feedback Shift Register' is used to perform data integrity checks ie CRC-32. LFSR's also create the codes for CDMA phones and GPS (Global Positioning System). \nNote that the XOR gate takes it inputs (Taps) from redstone repeater 7 and 10. For simplicity sake, these have been listed 2 tap LFSR sequences. In Minecraft, one could make a 1-many delay line structure to create more complicated clocks. "}

{"id": "34713", "revid": "46110320", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34713", "title": "Redstone circuits/Logic", "text": "A logic gate can be thought of as a simple device that will return a number of \"outputs\", determined by the pattern of \"inputs and rules\" that the logic gate follows. For example, if both inputs in an &lt;a href=\"%23AND%20gate\"&gt;AND&lt;/a&gt; gate are in the 'true'/'on'/'powered'/'1' state, then the gate will return 'true'/'on'/'powered'/'1'.\nThere are many different kinds of logic gates, each of which can be implemented with many different designs. Each design has various advantages and disadvantages, such as size, complexity, speed, maintenance overhead, or cost. The various sections will give many different designs for each gate type.\nConcepts.\nThe output of each logic circuit reflects the state of its inputs at all times (though possibly with some delay incurred by the circuit).\nLogic gate.\nA logic gate is a basic logic circuit.\nNOT gate.\nA NOT gate (formula_1), also known as an inverter, is a gate used when an opposite output is wanted from the input given. For instance, when the switch, or input, is set to \"on\", the output will be toggled to \"off\", and when the switch is toggled to \"off\", the output will be toggled to \"on\".\nOR gate.\nAn OR gate (formula_2) is a gate which uses two or more inputs and whenever any input is \"on\", the output is also \"on\". The only time the output is \"off\" is when all inputs are \"off\". Note that since the OR operation is associative and commutative, OR gates can be combined freely: The player can compare huge numbers of inputs by using small OR gates to collect groups of inputs, then comparing their results with more OR gates. The result will not depend on the arrangement of the inputs, or on which ones were combined first.\nThe simplest version of the OR gate is design A: merely a wire connecting all inputs and outputs. However, this causes the inputs to become \"compromised\", so that they can only be used in this OR gate. The introduction's example, using a solid block instead of wire, does not suffer the same hazard. \nIf players need to use the inputs elsewhere, the inputs need to be \"isolated\", by passing them through a block as above, or a device such as a torch or repeater. Torches yield version B. Note that this is in fact a NOR gate with an inverter on the output.\nVersion C isolates the inputs with repeaters. It can be expanded horizontally up to 15 inputs. Besides the isolated inputs, it is one tick faster than B. Additional repeaters can be used to add new groups of inputs, or to strengthen the output signal. This design is more expensive, as each repeater costs 3 redstone dust to craft (along with smooth stone).\nVersion D is a 1-wide version designed for vertical use, such as in walls. The repeater serves to isolate the outputs from the inputs. This version can only take two inputs, though of course the inputs can be stacked with multiple gates.\nVersion E utilizes the properties of light-transparent blocks: &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt;, and upside-down &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s. These send signals up, but not down. It is expandable, like design C.\nNOR gate.\nA NOR gate (formula_3 or formula_4) is the opposite of the OR gate. Whenever at least one switch is toggled to \"on\", the output is toggled to \"off\". The only time the output is \"on\" is when all inputs are toggled to \"off\". This gate also uses two or more inputs.\nAll logic gates can be made from of the NOR gate.\nIn \"Minecraft\", NOR is a basic logic gate, implemented by a torch with two or more inputs. (A torch with 1 input is the NOT gate, and with no inputs is the TRUE gate, that is, a power source.)\nA torch can easily accommodate 3 mutually isolated inputs, as in design A. Design B goes to greater lengths to squeeze in a fourth input. If more inputs are necessary, it is simplest to use OR gates to combine them, then use an inverter (NOT) at the end. It is also possible to combine OR and NOR gates, by using the inversion of OR gates as inputs to NOR gates.\nFor inverted output when A is OFF, use redstone torch for B and result is: \nAND gate.\nAn AND gate (formula_5) is used with two or more switches or other inputs. The output is toggled to \"on\" only when all inputs are \"on\". Otherwise, the output will remain \"off\".\nIn reality, the usual implementation is a NOR gate with inverted inputs (formula_6). Taking the inputs formula_7 and formula_8, the first two torches (at the top and bottom of Schematic (A) below) invert them into formula_1 and formula_10. The redstone wire between these torches serves as an OR gate, and is therefore in state formula_11, which can be interpreted as formula_12 by . Finally, the third torch (the center-right one) applies a NOT to that statement; thus it becomes formula_13.\nA 3-input AND gate is shown, but, like OR gates, AND gates can be freely \"ganged\", combining groups of inputs and then combining the results.\nA typical use for an AND gate would be to build a locking mechanism for a door, requiring both the activating button and the lock (typically a lever) to be on.\nPiston AND gates act similarly to a \"tri-state buffer\", in which input B acts like a switch, connecting or disconnecting input A from the rest of the circuit. Such designs have one input feeding a circuit, which is opened or closed by a sticky piston driven by the other input. The difference from is that one cannot drive a low current in Minecraft.\nNAND gate.\nA NAND gate (formula_14 or formula_12) turns the output off only when both inputs are on, the reverse of an AND gate. All logic gates can be made from NAND gates. As with NOR, large numbers of inputs are probably best handled by stacking up AND gates, then inverting the result. By De Morgan's Law, formula_12 is identical to formula_11.\nAll logic gates can be made from of the NAND gate.\nXOR gate.\nAn XOR gate (formula_18, formula_19 or formula_20) is a gate that uses two inputs and the output is toggled to \"on\" when one switch is \"on\" and one switch is \"off\". XOR is pronounced \"zor\" or \"exor\", a shortening of \"exclusive or\", because each input is mutually exclusive with the output. It is useful for controlling a mechanism from multiple locations. Because of these properties, XOR gates are commonly found in complex redstone circuits. In some cases, it is possible to get an OR gate output and an AND gate output on different channels. Design F is composed of AND gates, OR gates and NOT gates. The whole circuit is formula_21, which can be further simplified into formula_22 (or, equivalently, formula_23).\nA useful feature is that an XOR (or XNOR) gate will always change its output when one of its inputs changes, hence it is useful for controlling a mechanism from multiple locations. When controls (such as levers) are combined in an XOR gate, toggling any control will toggle the XOR gate's output (like a light bulb controlled by \u2014 players can flip \"either\" one to turn the light on or off, or \"either\" of which can always open or close a door, or turn some other device on or off.\nLike AND and OR gates, XOR gates can freely be \"stacked\" together, with gates gathering groups of inputs and their outputs being gathered in turn. The result of XORing more than two inputs is called \"parity\" \u2014 the result is 1 if and only if an odd number of inputs are 1. \nDesign D is tiny, but only useful if players want the levers to be fixed to the circuit. The shaded block indicates the block the levers and the lit torch are attached to, along with the block that one is resting on.\nDesign F is the most widely used of the torch-only designs, but newer components can do much better. Design H uses pistons, and is both faster and more compact. \nBeyond torches and pistons, various diodes can be used to produce fairly compact and cheap XOR gates. Design I can have its input repeaters coming in from either side or underneath, changing its size accordingly to fit tight spaces. Design J uses transparent blocks for a cheaper option.\nThe introduction of the &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; allows for several variations of a new design, the \"subtraction XOR gate\", which is flat, fast and silent (also easy to remember). The cons in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode is that making comparators requires the access to &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; to obtain &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach input is the same distance to the rear and side of the comparator closest to it, so will suppress its own signal there, but travels farther to get to the side of the further comparator, so won't suppress its signal in the further comparator. Only if both inputs are on will both comparators get suppressed by a side input.\nHowever, that is only true if the inputs are the same power level (or at least not different by more than 1), otherwise one signal could overwhelm the other's attempt to suppress its signal. If this circuit is sure to receive inputs of the same power level (because the system it's part of has been designed that way), then the \"basic\" version can be used. Otherwise, some method should be used to ensure the inputs are equal \u2014 for example, with repeaters (the \"repeated\" version) or with torches (the \"inverted\" version).\nXNOR gate.\nAn XNOR gate (formula_24 or formula_25) is the opposite of an XOR gate. This is commonly referred to as \"if and only if\" (\"iff\" for short), \"bi-conditional\", or \"equivalence\". It uses two inputs. When both switches are in the same state (both switches are \"on\" or both switches are \"off\"), then the output is toggled to \"on\". Otherwise, if the switches differ, the output is toggled to \"off\". Similar to the XOR gate, when either input changes, the output changes.\nAn XNOR gate can be built by inverting either the output, or \"one\" input, of an XOR gate. \nDesign A is a pure-torch design. If external input isn't needed, the back-facing torches can be replaced with levers, yielding B. Design F is larger but highlights the logic, while I is an inverted variant of XOR gate H. Note that the output inverter can also be placed in line with the rest of the gate, or even in a pit attached to one of the output redstone's support blocks.\nIMPLY gate.\nAn IMPLY gate (A \u2192 B) turns on either if both inputs are on, or if the first input is off. Unlike the other gates here, the inputs are not interchangeable; it is not commutative. This represents or a conditional statement, \"if \"A\" then \"B\", or \"A\" implies \"B\"\". The output is off only if the antecedent \"A\" is true, but the consequent \"B\" is false. It is the logical equivalent of B \u2228 \u00acA, and the mathematical equivalent of A \u2264 B.\nDesign C has a speed of 2 ticks if output is 1, but 1 tick if the output is 0. Similarly, the other designs take 1 tick if the output is 0, but are immediate (and not isolated) if the output is 1. If the player must synchronize (or isolate) the output, consider placing a 1-tick repeater in front of the \"fast\" input (input A for C, input B for the others)."}

{"id": "34714", "revid": "55767518", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34714", "title": "Redstone circuits/Memory", "text": " are effectively 1-bit memory cells. They allow circuits to store data and deliver it at a later time, rather than acting only on the inputs at the time they are given. As a result of this, they can turn an impulse into a constant signal, \"turning a button into a lever\".\nDevices using latches can be built to give different outputs each time a circuit is activated, even if the same inputs are used, and so circuits using them are referred to as \"sequential logic\". They allow for the design of counters, long-term clocks, and complex memory systems, which cannot be created with combinatorial logic gates alone. Latches are also used when a device needs to behave differently depending on \"previous\" inputs.\nThere are several basic categories of latches, distinguished by how they are controlled. For all types, the input lines are labeled according to their purpose (Set, Reset, Toggle, Data, Clock). There are also more arbitrary labels: The output is commonly labeled formula_1 for historical reasons. Sometimes there is also an \"inverse output\" formula_2, which is always ON when formula_1 is OFF and vice versa. If both formula_1 and formula_2 are available, we say the circuit has \"dual outputs\". Most of the following types can be built as a \"latch\" that responds to the \"level\" of a signal, or as a \"flip-flop\" triggered by a \"change\" in the signal. \nRS latches.\nAn RS latch has two inputs, formula_6 and formula_7. The output is conventionally labeled formula_1, and there is often an optional \"inverse output\" formula_2. (Having both formula_1 and formula_2 is called \"dual outputs\"). When a signal comes into formula_6, formula_1 is set on and stays on until a similar signal comes into formula_7, upon which formula_1 is reset to \"off\". formula_2 indicates the opposite of formula_1 \u2014 when formula_1 is high, formula_2 is low, and vice versa. Where a formula_2 output is available, the player can often save a NOT gate by using it instead of formula_1. \nNote that the proper name for this category of latch is \"SR latch\". However, in real-world electronics as in Minecraft, the classic implementation of such latches starts by inverting the inputs; such a latch is the proper \"RS latch\", but they're so common that the term is commonly used also for what \"should\" be called SR latches.\nTypical uses include an alarm system in which a warning light stays on after a pressure plate is activated until a reset button is pushed, or a rail T-junction being set and reset by different detector rails. RS latches are common parts of other circuits, including other sorts of latches.\nSetting both inputs high simultaneously is a \"forbidden\" condition, generally something to avoid. In the truth table, S=1, R=1 breaks the inverse relationship between formula_1 and formula_1. If this happens, the player will get \"undefined behavior\" \u2014 various designs can do different things, and especially formula_1 and formula_2 can be high or low at the same time. If the forbidden state is co-opted to \"toggle\" the output, the circuit becomes a JK latch, described in its own section. If there is instead a third input which toggles the output, the circuit becomes an \"RST latch\".\nAny RS latch with dual outputs is functionally symmetrical: pulsing each input turns on \"its\" output, and turns off the other one. Thus formula_7 and formula_6 are interchangeable, if the outputs is swapped: Which input players pick as formula_6 chooses which of the outputs is formula_1, then the other input will be R and the other output will be formula_2. (If the original circuit only had a formula_1 output, then swapping the inputs will turn it into formula_2.) In several designs (A, B, C, D, E, F, I) the functional symmetry is reflected by the circuit's physical symmetry, with each input energizing the torch it leads to, while turning off the other.\nRS latches can be built in a number of ways:\nRS-NOR latches.\nDesigns A and B are the most fundamental RS-NOR latches. In both cases, their inputs and outputs are \"duplex\"\u2014the latch state can be read (formula_1) or set (formula_6) on one side of the circuit, while on the other side, the latch can be reset (formula_7), or the inverse output read (formula_2). If separate lines for input and output are needed, opposite ends of B can be used, or A can be elaborated into A' with separate locations for all four lines. \nThese can be modified to provide separate, even isolated, input and output. C and D use torches and repeaters respectively to isolate the outputs, though the inputs can still be read. E expands the circuit slightly to isolate all four I/O lines.\nDesign F provides a vertical (1-wide) option; again, the I/O is duplex, though isolated outputs can be taken at alternate locations.\nDesign G takes up more room than F, but may be preferable, as both the set and reset are on the same side. Also, be sure to compensate for the extra tick on (formula_2), caused by the last torch.\nDesign H is smaller than design F in term of height, input and output are on the same height, but it is longer and a bit slower due to the repeater.\nFurthermore, it is easily stacked vertically and horizontally (with a shift of 2 blocks on the Y axis).\nDesign I is similar to design G as it has both set and reset on the same side,but takes up less space. The I/O is duplex, though isolated outputs can be taken at alternate locations.\nDesign J is similar to design G as it has both set and reset on the same side, but has no slowness due to not having any extra repeaters or torches. This may be more preferable to G, although the outputs (formula_1/formula_2) are not level with the inputs (R/S).\nRS NAND latches.\nAn RS latch can also be designed using NAND gates. In \"Minecraft\", these are less efficient than the RS NOR latch, because a single Redstone torch acts as a NOR gate, whereas several torches are required to create a NAND gate. However, they can still be useful for specialized purposes.\nSuch an \"RS NAND latch\" is equivalent to an RS NOR, but with inverters applied to all the inputs and outputs. The RS NAND is logically equivalent to the RS NOR, as the same R and S inputs give the same formula_1 output. However, these designs take \"inverse\" R and S (R\u0305, S\u0305) as inputs. When S\u0305 and R\u0305 are both off, formula_1 and formula_2 are on. When S\u0305 is on, but R\u0305 is off, formula_2 will be on. When R\u0305 is on, but S\u0305 is off, formula_1 will be on. When S\u0305 and R\u0305 are both on, it does not change formula_1 and formula_2. They will be the same as they were before S\u0305 and R\u0305 were both turned on. \nRS-Latch summary table 1.\nThis table summarizes the resources and features of the RS latches which use only redstone dust, torches, and repeaters.\nAnalog RS latch.\nThis latch will maintain the highest signal level that arrived from input S if R is off, and fade (reduce memorized signal strength) by strength of R every two redstone ticks. For maximum strength (15) signals it behaves like any other RS latch, but it can also memorize intermediate signal levels, and since 2-tick pulses on R will subtract their strength from its memorized state, it makes a nice element of counter or countdown circuits.\nAnalog counter.\nThis variant of the analog RS latch adds an \"increment\" (I) and \"decrement\" (D) input. While input I is active, memorized signal strength is increased by 1 every two redstone ticks until reaching maximum (15) signal strength. While input D is active, signal strength is decreased by 1 every two redstone ticks until output Q is unpowered.\nOutput Q is duplex and can also be used as an input (S); the highest signal strength at this block will be memorized.\nInput stabilization with reset.\nAn \"Input-Stabilizing Circuit\" responds to an input pulse by turning its input on and leaving it on. This can be built up into an RS Latch by adding a means to turn it off. These circuits usually don't offer a \"natural\" formula_2 output. Design J adds a pair of NOT gates, with the reset going to the second torch. Design K uses its piston to block the circuit where it goes up onto the solid block. Design L shows the reverse approach, breaking the circuit by withdrawing a power-carrying block.\nPistons and other devices.\nA pair of non-sticky pistons can be used to physically push a block back and forth. This can make or break a circuit from a torch, producing an RS latch with no inverse output (M). If the block being pushed is a block of redstone, the circuit can be even smaller, with dual outputs (N). Both of these have isolated inputs and outputs. Putting \"two\" blocks between the pistons produces an SRT latch O, with an extra input to toggle the latch state. And droppers can also be pressed into service, as in design P: Small, tileable, but it does require a comparator.\nDropper SR latch.\nAllows a lot of flexibility in geometry \u2014 the droppers can be read from 3 sides each and activated from 5 sides each; can be oriented vertically too and content can be read with comparators through solid blocks. However, always power it through an adjacent block; if players power the dropper directly, they will activate the other dropper too and the order is unpredictable. Activates on rising edge, meaning they can apply S even while R is still active or vice versa.\nD latches and flip-flops.\nA D (\"data\") flip-flop or latch has two inputs: The data line D, and the \"clock\" input C. When triggered by C, the circuits set their output (formula_1) to D, then hold that output state between triggers. The latch form, a \"gated D latch\", is level triggered. It can be high- or low-triggered; either way, while the clock is in the trigger state, the output will change to match D. When the clock is in the other state, the latch will hold its current state until triggered again. A D flip-flop is edge triggered; it sets the output to D only when its clock input changes from \"off\" to \"on\" (rising edge) or \"vice versa\" (falling edge), according to the circuit. An edge trigger can turn a gated D latch into a D flip-flop. \nBuilding these devices with torches is fairly unwieldy, though some older designs are given below. &lt;a href=\"Repeater\"&gt;Repeater&lt;/a&gt;s have a special latching ability, which drastically simplifies the problem. Now a gated D latch can be made with two repeaters, and a D flip-flop with four repeaters and a torch:\nDesign G uses the repeater's latching feature, which is added to the game in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;. It holds its state while the clock is high, and is by far the most compact of the D latch designs. Design H combines two such latches, one high and one low triggered, to create a rising edge-triggered D flip-flop. The block and redstone torch can be reversed for a falling edge-triggered design. The design is based on a real life implementation of an edge-triggered D flip-flop called a \"Master-Slave\" configuration.\nDigital D latch.\nThis design is a digital version of a low-triggered D latch. It is most frequently used for storing data in digital redstone circuits. It is based on the S-R latch, but it doesn't have an \"undefined\" or \"invalid\" state problem.\nAnalog D latch.\nDesign J is an analog version of a low-triggered D latch. The signal strength of the output formula_1 is the same as input D when the latch is triggered.\nFor maximum strength (15) signals for D, this latch behaves like a normal (digital) low-triggered D latch.\nTorch-based designs.\nFor historical interest, here are several older designs, not dependent on latched repeaters, along with a table of their resource needs and other characteristics. A few of these designs also have the additional inputs and inverse output of an RS latch.\nThis basic level-triggered gated D latch (design A) sets the output to D as long as the clock is set to OFF, and ignores changes in D as long as the clock is ON. However, on a rising clock edge, if D is low, the output will pulse high for 1 tick, before latching low.\nDesign B includes a rising-edge trigger and it will set the output to D only when the clock goes from OFF to ON. The torch-based edge trigger could also be replaced with one of the designs from the &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit\"&gt;Pulse circuit&lt;/a&gt; page.\nThese are RS latch-based circuits with appropriately set front-ends. Directly trigger the RS latch using the R and S inputs to override the clock, forcing a certain output state. Sending signals into the formula_1 and formula_2 lines works similarly, because the output is not isolated. To isolate the outputs, add inverters and swap the labels.\nDesign C is a one block wide vertical version of A, except for using a non-inverted clock. It sets the output to D while the clock is ON (turning the torch off). This design can be repeated in parallel every other block, giving it a much smaller footprint, equal to the minimum spacing of parallel data lines. A clock signal can be distributed to all of them with a wire running perpendicularly under the data lines, allowing multiple flip-flops to share a single edge-trigger if desired. The output formula_2 is most easily accessed in the reverse direction, toward the source of input. As in design A, the un-isolated formula_1 and formula_2 wires can do double duty as R and S inputs. formula_1 can be inverted or repeated to isolate the latch's Set line.\nDesign E provides a more compact (but more complex) version of A, while still affording the same ceiling requirement. E' allows the latch to act on a high input. \nDesign F holds its state while the clock is high, and switches to D when the clock falls low. The repeater serves to synchronize the signals that switch out the loop and switch in D. It must be set to 1 to match the effect of the torch.\nBUD-based D flip-flop.\nDesign I represents an entirely different form of the D flip-flop, based on the principle of the block update detector. This flip-flop is small so it can be used multiple times at large integrated redstone circuits. Note that no blocks that are adjacent to the piston can be used as circuit components except flip-flop itself.\nThe lever in the screenshot shown is the D input. The redstone wire in the middle is trigger signal input. The trapdoor is part of the BUD \u2013 it can be replaced by a &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"activator%20rail\"&gt;activator rail&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nJK flip-flops and latches.\nA JK flip-flop is another memory element which, like the D flip-flop, will only change its output state when triggered by a clock signal C. They can be edge-triggered (designs A, D, E) or level-triggered (C). Either way, the two inputs are called J and K. These names are arbitrary, and somewhat interchangeable: if a formula_2 output is available, swapping J and K will also swap formula_1 and formula_2.\nWhen the flip-flop is triggered the effect on the output formula_1 will depend on the values of the two inputs:\nThe table summarizes these states \u2014 note that formula_65 is the new state after the trigger, while formula_66 represents the state before the trigger.\nThe JK flip-flop's complement function (when J and K are 1) is only meaningful with edge-triggered JK flip-flops, as it is an instantaneous trigger condition. With level-triggered flip-flops (e.g. design C), maintaining the clock signal at 1 for too long causes a race condition on the output. Although this race condition is not fast enough to cause the torches to burn out, it makes the complement function unreliable for level-triggered flip-flops.\nThe JK flip-flip is a \"universal flip-flop\", as it can be converted to any of the other types: It's already an RS latch, with the \"forbidden\" input used for toggling. To make it a T flip flop, set J = K = T, and to make it a D flip-flop, set K to the inverse of J, that is J = K\u0305 = D. In the real world, mass production makes JK latches useful and common: a single circuit to produce in bulk, that can be used as any other sort of latch. In \"Minecraft\", however, JK latches are generally larger and more complex than the other types, and using their toggle function is awkward. It's almost always easier to build the specific latch type needed. Notably, an SRT Latch has all the same abilities, but gets the toggle function from a separate input.\nDesign E is a vertical JK Flip-Flop from the basis of design A. \nAside from these redstone designs, it is also possible to make a JK flip-flop by modifying a &lt;a href=\"Memory%20circuit%23Rail%20and%20Exotic%20TFFs\"&gt;rail toggle&lt;/a&gt;, or with newer components such as hoppers and droppers.\nT flip-flop.\nT flip-flops are also known as \"toggles\". Whenever T changes from OFF to ON, the output will toggle its state. A useful way to use T flip-flops in Minecraft could, for example, be a button connected to the input. When players press the button the output toggles (a door opens or closes), and does not toggle back when the button pops out. These are also the core of all binary counters and clocks, as they function as a \"period doubler\", releasing one pulse for every two received.\nThere are many ways to build a T flip-flop, ranging from torches and dust through pistons to more exotic devices. Many designs depend on a quirk in sticky-piston behavior, namely that after pushing a block, a sticky piston will let go of it if the activating pulse was 1 tick or less. This allows short pulses to toggle the position of a block, which is very useful here.\nBest in class TFF designs.\nThese are designs which seem markedly superior in various categories.\nL3 is a latch, which responds to a high level. Like most T latches, if the toggle line is held high too long, it will \"oscillate\", toggling repeatedly. A stone button will produce a single pulse, while wooden button's pulse is long enough to cause oscillation.\nL5 is a true flip-flop with the same footprint as the L3(but higher), which triggers on a rising edge. Both are extremely compact, thanks to the use of latched repeaters. \nL6 is a compact 1-high adaptation of D flip-flop H. The video shows L6 and a similar T flip-flop.\nL4 and L7 are basically two opposite halves of the same machine \u2014 both are extremely compact and customizable tick-wise but L4 is made for off-pulses with durations ranging from 2 to 8 redstone ticks while L7 is made for on-pulses with durations that are 9+ redstone ticks long which includes the 10-tick stone button. Customizing each requires changing the repeater delay or adding repeaters to match the trigger duration.\nTo customize L4 for your use, adjust the top most repeater according to the duration of your trigger, as shown in the table below:\nPiston TFF designs.\nThis design doesn't use the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity effect&lt;/a&gt;, so it works in both . It uses a pulse generator that feeds into repeaters that power the piston through a solid block and an underground redstone dust patch. The redstone block position is the output value of the TFF. This design requires one sticky piston (for the repeater) and two non-sticky pistons, and a 6\u00d76 area, which is linear-tilable so that the output of one TFF feeds into the next TFF.\nThe following designs work in but may present difficulties in .\nDesign M is a 1-wide dual-piston design, which can be tiled adjacent to each other for compact circuitry. (If they \"don't\" have to be right next to each other, dust can be used instead of the input and output repeaters.) The hidden piston forms a simple monostable circuit that cuts off the button signal (10 ticks or so) as soon as a 1-tick signal has passed through to the second repeater. Due to the piston quirk mentioned above, this 1-tick signal lets the main piston toggle the position of its mobile block, to set or unset the latch and the output. It can be made more compact by removing the last block, the repeater and the torch and replacing the block in front of the last piston with a redstone block. \nThat linear design can also be bent into a 3\u00d73 square, as N. (The \"any\" blocks can be air, and that torch can just as well be on the ground.) Tiling design N is a little tricker, but it can be done in either horizontal direction, by mirroring adjacent copies. Note that the output can be taken from whichever side of that corner is free, but the player will need repeaters to keep adjacent outputs from cross-connecting.\nDesign O, based on the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity effect&lt;/a&gt; that works only in , uses a redstone block that swaps positions when the top dust receives a signal; it is a dual piston design that uses only two pistons, two torches, two dust, and two solid blocks and a redstone block. While one of the most compact designs; using only 10 blocks of space before inputs and outputs in addition to being 1 wide and vertical, it also requires no slime balls and uses few resources aside from the redstone block while allowing for four areas to input and 4 areas to output (if repeaters are used for the output, 2 if not), in addition it can be built in the air since it doesn't have any redstone or repeaters that require placement on the ground. The design toggles on a falling edge.\nDesign R is a variation of design O, and it adds the ability to reset the output to 0, using the input R.\nObserver TFF designs (\"Java Edition\").\nThose designs make use of observers and the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Quasi-connectivity\"&gt;quasi-connectivity effect&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesigns O1 and O2 work for a rising signal, while the O3 toggles on a falling signal.\nOther conventional TFF designs.\nDesign A demonstrates that a TFF can be made solely with redstone dust and torches, but it sprawls over 9\u00d77\u00d73 blocks.\nDesign B is slightly unreliable for very long pulses; while the input is on, the piston will toggle every time the block below the piston arm is updated. \nDesign D (another torches-and-dust design, but vertical) does not have an incorporated edge trigger and will toggle multiple times unless the input is passed through one first. Design E adds such a trigger (and a repeater).\nDesigns J and K make more use of repeaters, but not as latches, and they are still quite large.\nDesign L2, (also L3, L4, and L5 above) relies on the redstone repeater locking mechanic introduced in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.4.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;. L4 is the smallest, but requires a piston and activates on a falling edge. \nRail and exotic TFFs.\nThe rail T flip-flop is a T flip-flop which uses rails and redstone. The general design uses a length of track that is stopped by a block at both ends. When the T flip-flop is in a stable state, the minecart is at either end of the track (depending on the state). An input pulse turns on powered rails at both ends of the track, causing the minecart to move to the other end.\nAlong the track, there are two separate detector elements (e.g. detector rails). These two detectors are each connected to an input of an RS NOR latch, and hence serve to translate minecart motion into a state transition. When the minecart moves, depending on its direction of motion, one detector will turn on (and off) before the other; the second detector to be hit is what determines which input of the RS NOR latch stays on last and hence what the new state of the RS NOR latch is.\nDesign A uses detector rails, while design B uses pressure plates. (A minecart triggers a pressure plate on the inside of a turn, including diagonals.) Note that for B, the other side of the latch isn't a true formula_2, as the passage of the cart turns on formula_1 before actually switching the latch.\nThis type of T flip-flop is slower than traditional redstone-only circuits, but this may be desirable in certain situations. With T flip-flop designs that are level-triggered (as opposed to clocked or edge-triggered), a long input pulse will cause the flip-flop to continuously switch state (oscillate) while the pulse is present. In pure redstone circuits, this is only limited by the redstone circuit delays, and hence a relatively short input pulse can cause several state transitions. Pure redstone T flip-flops usually include an edge-trigger or pulse-limiting circuit to the design, since the input pulse usually can't be guaranteed to be short enough without the use of that kind of circuit.\nWith rail-based designs, the speed at which the output can flip is limited by the time needed for the cart to move from one end of its rail to the other, which allows for a much longer pulse to be applied to a level-triggered input without needing an edge-trigger or pulse limiter circuit. However, the delay between the input pulse and the output transition is also longer.\nGrizdale's T flip-flop.\nThis hopper/dropper design is not only compact, but tileable in three dimensions. The only hitch (for survival mode) is that the player needs access to &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt; for the comparator.\nThe A variant has a size of 1\u00d72\u00d73. The B variant puts the input and output inline, but changes the footprint to 2\u00d72\u00d72, or 4\u00d72\u00d72 if players want fully powered input and output. The B design can also be tiled in line, side by side, vertically (by reversing alternate rows), or all three at once.\nOnce built, place a single item inside any of the containers and it will work as a T flip-flop, with the item cycling between the two droppers. The core has a 1 tick delay between input and turning off or on, but the optional repeaters would raise this to 3.\nThis T Flip Flop can be turned into an SRT latch by only powering the bottom dropper to set, and the top to reset. However, it won't be as tileable as the original TFF.\nObsolete T flip-flops.\nDesigns Z1 and Z2 do not work as of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.5.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.5.2&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in both cases, their pulse generator does not cause the piston to toggle its block as apparently intended."}

When the input turns on, the outputs turn on in order (e.g., A then B), but when the input turns off, the outputs turn off in reverse order (e.g., B then A).\nThe timing of the output activation and deactivation can be changed by adjusting the delay on the repeaters.\nAll of these designs can be extended indefinitely.\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" 5 July 2011 (basic concept), 20 June 2012 (Floor ABBA), and 18 July 2012 (Ceiling ABBA).\nBlock update detector.\nThe block update detector switch, or simply &lt;a href=\"BUD\"&gt;BUD&lt;/a&gt;, detects any time an adjacent block receives an update. An update is anything that changes that block's state: block placed, destroyed, door opened, repeater delay changed, cake eaten, grass growing, snow falling, furnace used (or turns off), and so on (chests opened and crafting tables used do not cause updates, sleeping in a bed does). When a block is updated, all adjacent blocks are also eligible for an update, and this can be used to produce a redstone signal or for other purposes.\nBUDs have been used for all kinds of things, from traps to detecting daylight to locking mechanisms on hidden doors.\nCurrent BUD switches take advantage of a quirk where &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s can receive power, but not updates, from blocks adjacent to the space the piston head occupies when extended. That is: blocks adjacent to the extended state and not adjacent to the retracted state \"provide power\" to extend the piston, but as they are not adjacent to the retracted state do not cause the piston to update when that power state changes.\nThere are many models of auto resetting BUDs. This is done by having the firing of the BUD switch somehow cause the BUD switch to restore the pre-fired state often when fired it cuts the power to the piston, allowing it to retract. This is done either by extra circuitry or, as in the example below, by the properties of blocks themselves.\nVersion 1.11 introduced the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt; block, which sends a one-redstone-tick signal when the block it is facing is updated. However, many designs using BUDs still incorporate older piston variations.\nMultiplex circuit.\nA multiplex circuit transmits multiple signals on a single transmission line by using a \"control line\" to choose which signal should be transmitted or received. The control line may be either \"clocked\", to transmit the signals sequentially, or \"selection\", to simply choose which signal to transmit. The control line(s) can also be substituted with two \"synchronized\" pulse generating clocks. Then only one line is necessary. However, they have to stay synchronized for the transmission to be correct. This can be done using a &lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt;.\nA multiplex circuit may consist of a \"multiplexer\", a \"demultiplexer\", or both.\nMultiplexer.\nA (a.k.a. \"mux\") is a device that selects one of two or more inputs and outputs the selected input. This multiplexer can be chained together, allowing for multiple bit multiplexing.\nFor these designs, the inputs are labeled A and B. C is the \"control\" input: whether A or B passes through depends on whether C is powered or not.\nDemultiplexer.\nAKA \"demultiplexer\" or \"DEMUX\".\nThe is the reverse of the multiplexer. It allows you to have one input be sent to either of one of two or more different outputs. &lt;a href=\"https%3A//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Demultiplexer_Example01.svg/450px-Demultiplexer_Example01.svg.png\"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a schematic of a demultiplexer with 4 outputs. 'I' represents the input, 'S' represents the selectors and 'f' the outputs. The two selector wires, holding a two digit binary number (2 wires = 2 digits), are passed to a decoder. If the input wire is on, then the output wire of the demultiplexer corresponding to the output of the decoder turns on. For example, if the input is on and the binary number 10b is passed onto the select wires (S0=on,S1=off. Start counting at zero!), then the decoder turns on the third wire (10 in binary is two, but because we start count at zero it becomes the third). An AND operation is performed between the input wire of the demultiplexer and each of the outputs of the decoder. As stated earlier, because both the input wire and only the 3rd output of the decoder is on, only the third output of the whole demultiplexer is on.\nDemultiplexers are used as decoders with the option to have ALL outputs turned off (done by turning off the input wire). \nThe two schematics on this page are those of a 2 bit demultiplexer.\nA demultiplexer is not a . A relay is an old electronic component that was replaced by transistors in the 70s. Even though a 1-pole relay is the same as a 2 bit demultiplexer, a more complex demultiplexer would be made of many relays (and in the current century of transistors). The closest thing in Minecraft resembling a relay or transistor is the Redstone torch. \nRandom number generator.\nA random number generator (aka RNG, or \"randomizer\") is a circuit that can generate numbers with no recognizable pattern.\nThe RNGs below depend on the stack maximums of the items they push:\nRandom selector.\nA random selector is a circuit that selects an available output at random.\nThe random selector (right) depends on the random flight of an item from a dropper.\nThe input (button) in this random selector turns off the torch, deactivating the piston. It also powers a redstone dust directed into the block, powering the repeater and activating the dropper. The piston then reactivates to push the stuck item (if any). A hopper collects the item and puts it back into the dropper, activating a comparator.\nNOTE: The dropper must be facing up. If facing down, the item glitches out of the machine.\n\"Earliest Known Publication:\" 24 September 2014\nAn old kind of random selector is the \"chicken randomizer\", which uses a chicken walking on multiple pressure plates in a containment chamber. For this and other improved randomizers, view the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Randomizers\"&gt;randomizers&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.\nAnother way to construct a random selector is to feed the output of a digital randomizer into a demuxer. You can create a 1-bit digital randomizer from an analog 2-RNG by discarding one of the outputs, and then combine N of them for an N-bit digital randomizer.\nThyristor.\nA is a bit like a &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Memory%20circuit%23D%20latches%20and%20flip-flops\"&gt;D flip-flop&lt;/a&gt; but has a different functionality. It has two inputs: the \"gate\" line G and the \"anode\" line A, and has one output: the \"cathode\" line K. When triggered by G, the circuit sets its output K to A if A is high, then holds that output state until A goes low. Otherwise K stays low.\nDesign A is the simplest form of the circuit. The hopper is initially empty so K stays low regardless of whether A is high or low. When G goes high, the item in the dropper moves to the hopper so K goes high as well.

{"id": "14365", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14365", "title": "Redstone circuits/Piston", "text": "&lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;s have allowed players to design circuits that are smaller and/or faster than the standard, redstone-only counterparts. An understanding of standard &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuits\"&gt;redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt; is helpful, as this tutorial is focused on the circuit design rather than the function.\nThere are three benefits of piston circuitry:\nThe main components of piston circuits are &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20wire\"&gt;redstone wire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"redstone%20torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es.\nUnless otherwise stated, all pistons are sticky pistons.\nPrinciples.\nPower is transmitted in several ways that are useful to pistons. The first thing to note is that there are two types of blocks; \"&lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"solid\". Transparent blocks are things such as &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slabs\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt;, or air, while solid blocks are more common materials such as dirt, stone, or wool. \nThe key is that redstone power can be transmitted through solid blocks, but not transparent blocks. However, power can pass through only \"one\" solid block at a go, it cannot be passed from one solid block to another. A solid block can power wire leading from it only if it was \"strongly powered\" (by a redstone torch, repeater, or &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt;, but not by redstone wire). Redstone dust can be placed on some transparent blocks, but then it transmits power only upward, not downward (that is, not through the transparent block).\n&lt;a href=\"Redstone%20torch\"&gt;Redstone torch&lt;/a&gt;es are considered logic components only if they change states as the gate is used. (Otherwise they're just power supplies.) If they change state too often, they are susceptible to burning out. If a solid block is on top of a redstone torch, any wire connected to the block becomes powered. If, however, the block is transparent, the torch does not power the wires. In Creative mode, using torches as power-supplies for blocks above is mostly deprecated by the introduction of redstone blocks, which are permanently powered. They have a higher cost in Survival, though.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt; is directed at a solid block, it passes power into that block in the same way redstone torches do. A repeater can also take power from a solid block that is powered, even weakly powered (that is, it turns a weakly powered signal into a strong one). Power cannot be transmitted by transparent blocks.\nPistons extend if powered, but it's notable that they can take power from the block above them \u2013 that is, even if the block is air, if that block would have been powered, then the piston is powered. They can also be powered through their extended piston, which produces several useful quirks that are commonly used in circuits. A piston can push up to 12 blocks when it extends; however, a sticky piston can pull back only one block when it retracts. Some blocks are immune to being pushed or pulled, notably obsidian and any block with a GUI or inventory (except crafting tables). Other blocks drop as items if a piston tries to push them; this includes most \"attached\" blocks such as either sort of torch, or doors, but also a few others such as jack-o-lanterns.\nPiston gate designs.\nPistons can produce alternate designs for many of the classic &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit\"&gt;logic gates&lt;/a&gt;. Piston gates may also use redstone torches to supply a constant signal (in which case they can often be replaced by levers), or for other purposes.\nNOT gate.\nThe piston-only NOT gate, also called an inverter, is slightly larger than a standard redstone NOT gate, so it is rarely used alone. However, it demonstrates an important concept used in many piston mechanisms, namely that torches below solid blocks create a current in any surrounding wire. When an input is triggered, the piston extends, uncovering the torch hole removing the signal from the output line. The input can power the piston from almost any direction. Alternatively, a &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20redstone\"&gt;block of redstone&lt;/a&gt; can be used in to shrink the design.\nOR gate.\nThis design is slightly faster than the standard redstone OR gate, with a comparable size.\nIt uses one piston that covers a torch when extended by any of the inputs.\nAND gate.\nIncredibly fast AND gate. When unpowered, the sticky piston pulls the block over the hole, breaking the circuit. When powered, it extends and lets the current flow in and out of the hole. One input feeds the piston, the other feeds the circuit it interrupts; both must be ON to release a signal.\nIMPLIES gate.\nComparable size and speed to some of the basic redstone IMPLIES gate.\nThis gate represents material implication. Returns false only if the implication A \u2192 B is false. That is, if the conditional A is true, but the consequent B is false. It is often read \"if A then B.\" It is the logical equivalent of \"B or NOT A\". The torch under the mobile block is in a hole.\nXNOR gate.\nPronounced \"ex-nor\", this device activates when both inputs are equal. A useful attribute is that a XOR or XNOR gate always changes its output when one of its inputs changes, allowing for 2 switches to be combined to open or close a door, or activate another device. This design is significantly smaller than the redstone-only equivalent and slightly faster. Adding a NOT gate to the end or to either input produces an XOR gate, which activates when the inputs are different.\nXOR gate.\nPronounced \"ex-or\" (a shortening of \"exclusive or\"), this device activates when only one of the inputs is on. This design, like the XNOR gate, is smaller and faster than the redstone-only equivalent.\nLatches.\nLatches are &lt;a href=\"memory%20circuit\"&gt;memory circuit&lt;/a&gt;s. Naturally, pistons' ability to physically move blocks to new locations make them a natural tool for these.\nRS latches.\nThe basic piston RS Latch is small and easy to make. The pistons used here are regular pistons, not sticky pistons, and push a block over one of two holes containing a Redstone Torch. One hole can be omitted if only one output is required. Using a &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Redstone\"&gt;Block of Redstone&lt;/a&gt; lets the circuit become even smaller, and adds the inverse output.\nT flip-flops.\nThese T flip-flops use one input to switch between two states. \nSticky pistons behave strangely when they receive a 1-tick signal. If a block is directly next to the piston, the piston pushes the block but does not pull it back when the signal ends. If the piston receives another 1-tick signal, the piston extends and retract the block. This can be used to toggle the position of blocks. \nDesign A, 4\u00d72\u00d74. Uses regular pistons. Both of the pistons are regular pistons. This flip flop is quite fast and quite small. It toggles when the input changes from ON to OFF. Inverting the input increases the speed of the circuit. \nDesign B (5\u00d73\u00d72) is actually an RST latch, combining the functionality of both the Set/Reset (RS) and toggle (T) latches. Uses regular pistons. This flip flop doesn't use torches for logic so it can work with signals of any length. The dust on level 1 is there to redirect the redstone wire away from block X, which powers the piston. However, this circuit does not have an inverse output.\nDesign C is a combination pulse limiter and downward edge detector. When the signal turns off, the first sticky piston retracts the second, which receives a 1-tick signal. The 1-tick signal toggles the mobile block. It is sensitive to timing.\nThe 1-wide Sticky Piston TFF design is 5\u00d71\u00d73. It depends on the fact that a sticky piston leaves the block after extending when given a short pulse of 0.5 ticks of delay. A &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23Rising%20edge%20detector\"&gt;circuit breaker&lt;/a&gt; is used to give a 0.5 ticks pulse to the sticky piston. This makes the sticky piston leave the redstone block, which then provides power to the output. When powered again, the sticky piston pulls the redstone block switching the output off. It is possible to make this TFF tileable.\nRing memory.\nThis is a ring of blocks attached to regular pistons at the corners so it can rotate. The blocks are usually a combination of solid and non-solid blocks. The pistons are often connected to a clock so that they rotate the ring. Most (if not all) rings have a reading head consisting of a repeater pointing at the ring and a redstone torch powering the repeater. By using redstone on the other side of a ring, one can see which type of block is in front of the reading head (1 = Solid; 0 = Non-solid). This information now can be passed to a circuit. By using a comparator and reading a cauldron's fill level, 3 additional memory cell states are available. For repeater-based reading heads those act as zeroes.\nAdding multiple rings together in a row creates a band. A band stores even more information and works similar to punched tape. Examples include &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dqt1fOED0vC8\"&gt;music machines&lt;/a&gt;, combination locks, and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0t5hD-C1JBg\"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;.\nClocks.\nRapidfire piston clock.\nThis rapidfire clock is fairly simple to build. It requires 2 non-sticky pistons, 2 repeaters, and 6 redstone, and 5 solid blocks. The repeaters must be set to at least 2 ticks, and they must match. Place the mobile block last to start the clock, and take output from either end or any wire. Note that this clock is \"not\" switchable, and if it does stop for any reason, it's difficult to restart by a redstone signal. The player can restart it by breaking and replacing the mobile block, or by changing the repeater delays (both of them; the clock restarts when they match and are set to at least 2 ticks).\nAlternate rapidfire piston clock.\nThis piston clock is a simple way of repeating a circuit that goes at high speed without burning out. It does not require repeaters or redstone torches. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4QMtn6ojZrQ\"&gt;A tutorial is available here.&lt;/a&gt; It requies a single sticky piston, one lever, a small amount of redstone, and some solid blocks. From the lever, the redstone has to be placed so it goes up a block, before linking up to the piston. The piston has to be placed in a way that, when it is extended, it blocks the redstone from going up the side of the block without breaking the redstone. This breaks the circuit, removing power from the piston and thus retracting it, causing the circuit to open again. The signals are too fast to affect lighting sources such as lamps and redstone torches. Doors and dispensers both work well at this speed.\nPulser.\nA small, stable pulser in a space of 2\u00d73\u00d72. The period can be adjusted with the repeater, and the clock can be turned off or on with the lever. (Turning the lever ON stops the clock, and \"vice versa\".) The lever can be placed on any of the solid blocks.\nRapid fire trap clock.\nAnother way of doing this is placing a sticky piston with a redstone block on its face and a line of redstone dust connecting the redstone block and the sticky piston. It must be two long to prevent lockup. To make it toggleable, connect the dust with a lever. This is useful for traps.\nEdge detector.\nA rising edge detector creates a brief signal when the input turns on. Conversely, a falling edge detector creates a brief signal when the input is turned off, and a dual-edge (\"aka\" \"zero-crossing\") detector responds to both.\nDesign A can be a rising- or falling-edge detector depending on the delays of the repeaters.\nDesign B is a variant of the piston XOR gate, and a dual-edge detector. The right-hand repeater can be adjusted to output a longer or shorter pulse.\nDesigns D, E, and F are straight-line versions, 1\u00d72\u00d72. Design D is a rising edge detector; design F, a falling edge detector; both with an output pulse of 2 ticks. Design E is a zero crossing detector, activating on both rising and falling edges. However, it produces only a single-tick pulse output. This can be moderated by adding a 2-tick repeater to the output, producing a 2-tick pulse, same as the other two.\nDouble extender.\nThis design pushes and pull a block two spaces instead of one. The first and second repeaters must be set to delays of 2 and 4 respectively. The pistons are sticky and the device correctly pushes and retracts the block. The main trick is properly sequencing the retraction because the back piston does not pull back the forward piston when it is extended. Additionally, the back piston retract only the forward piston, not the block. To handle these issues the forward piston must be retracted, pulled back, then extended and retracted again. \nTriple extenders and so forth are possible, but involve more complex circuitry. As more pistons are added to the circuit, the logic becomes more complex. In an ideal circuit the extension and retraction of the pistons are governed by the number of pistons, denoted P. Then, the time to extend the pistons equals P ticks. The time to retract the pistons equals 3P\u22122 ticks. This relationship is linear, and implies that the time for the circuit to execute goes up proportionately with the number of pistons. This relationship is achieved by moving multiple pistons per tick rather than only one at time. This relationship applies to both horizontal and vertical extenders.\nDue to the pistons limit to pushing 12 blocks at a time, an 11 piston extender is the largest possible extender. Assuming the design is constructed ideally, this needs 11 ticks to extend and 31 ticks to retract. A player built design would likely use more delays for ease of construction.\nA more advanced (and much larger) circuit can double-push pistons, without extending them (and stopping the system). This circuit can also can be powered with torches from below, to hide all the wiring. Either way, input to any of the green-marked squares, so the signal reaches all the way round without needing extra repeaters. The design can be mirrored to push a pair of pistons on the same switch.\nVertical double extenders are more difficult to make than horizontal extenders; the release of observers in 1.11, however, has greatly simplified the design of vertical double extenders.\nDesign A is a 3\u00d73 tileable design that extends upward. Design B is a 4\u00d73 tileable design that extends downward. The repeater in both designs are set to 1-tick.\nLonger vertical extenders require complex circuitry, and are often used as elevators. To slightly simplify the required circuits, a gravity-affected block like gravel or sand can be used as the elevator platform. This avoids the need for the top piston to be sticky and for it to execute multiple extensions to pull down the top block at each stage of descent. If more than two pistons are used in total, multiple extensions of lower sticky pistons are still required to pull down the pistons higher in the stack, which are not gravity-affected."}

{"id": "34718", "revid": "48704058", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34718", "title": "Redstone circuits/Pulse", "text": "A pulse circuit is a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt; which generates, modifies, detects, or otherwise operates on redstone &lt;a href=\"%23Pulses\"&gt;pulses&lt;/a&gt;.\nPulses.\nA pulse is a temporary change in redstone power that eventually reverts to its original state.\nAn on-pulse is when a redstone signal turns on, then off again. On-pulses are usually just called \"pulses\" unless there is a need to differentiate them from off-pulses.\nAn off-pulse is when a redstone signal turns off, then on again.\nThe pulse length of a pulse is how long it lasts. Short pulses are described in redstone ticks (for example, a \"3-tick pulse\" for a pulse that turns off 0.3 seconds after it turns on) while longer pulses are measured in any convenient unit of time (for example, a \"3-second pulse\").\nThe rising edge of a pulse is when the power turns on \u2013 the beginning of an on-pulse or the end of an off-pulse.\nThe falling edge of a pulse is when the power turns off \u2013 the end of an on-pulse or the beginning of an off-pulse.\nPulse logic.\nPulse logic is a different approach to binary logic than standard redstone power binary (power present = 1, power absent = 0). In pulse logic, the pulse is a toggle of logic level of the contraption: (first pulse = 1, second pulse = 0). This approach allows implementing computational logic that operates not only on redstone signal, but also on block updates, and block positions; in particular implementation of mobile logical circuits in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Flying%20machines\"&gt;flying machines&lt;/a&gt;, and significant reduction of server-side lag through avoiding redstone dust, transporting signals through block updates instead - e.g. over &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases use of pulse logic also results in more compact circuitry, and allows building 1-tileable modules where classic redstone power would \"spill\" to the neighbor modules. \nConversion from classic redstone binary to pulse logic is performed through dual edge detectors, (usually just an &lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt; observing redstone dust or other power components), and conversion back is performed through &lt;a href=\"T%20flip-flop\"&gt;T flip-flop&lt;/a&gt; circuits, in particular the block-dropping behavior of sticky pistons. That behavior is also utilized as memory storage in pulse logic, position of the block encoding state of memory cell.\nPulse interactions.\nSome redstone components react differently to short pulses:\nPulse analysis.\nWhen building circuits, it can sometimes be helpful to observe the pulses being produced to confirm their duration or spacing.\nA pulse can be measured with 1-tick precision with an oscilloscope (see schematic, right).\nAn oscilloscope simply consists of a line of 1-tick repeaters (aka a \"racetrack\"). An oscilloscope should be constructed to be at least as long as the expected pulse, plus a few extra repeaters (the more repeaters, the easier it is to time capturing a pulse). For periodic pulses (as from &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt;s), an oscilloscope should be at least as long as the clock period (both the on and off parts of the pulse).\nAn oscilloscope can be frozen to aid reading by:\nAn oscilloscope is not capable of displaying fractional-tick pulses directly (0.5-tick pulses, 1.5-tick pulses, etc.), but for fractional-tick pulses greater than 1 tick, the pulse length may appear to change as it moves through the oscilloscope. For example, a 3.5-tick pulse may sometimes power 3 repeaters and sometimes 4 repeaters.\nHalf-tick pulses do not vary between powering 0 or 1 repeaters (they just look like 1-tick pulses), but half-tick and 1-tick pulses can be differentiated with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a 1-tick pulse can activate a comparator, but a half-tick pulse cannot in most cases.\nMultiple oscilloscopes can be laid in parallel to compare different pulses. For example, you can determine a circuit's delay by putting the circuit's input signal through one oscilloscope and the circuit's output through another and counting the difference between the input and output signal edges.\nOscilloscopes are useful but sometimes require you to be in an inconvenient position to observe them. If you just need to observe the simultaneity of multiple pulses it can be useful to use pistons or note blocks and observe their movement or note particles from any angle. Redstone lamps are less useful for this purpose because they take 2 ticks to turn off.\nMonostable circuit.\nA circuit is monostable if it has only one stable output state (\"mono-\" means \"one\", so \"monostable\" means \"one stable state\").\nA circuit's output can be powered or unpowered. If an output stays in the same state until the circuit is triggered again, that output state is called \"stable\". An output state that changes without the input being triggered is not stable (that doesn't necessarily mean it's random \u2013 it may be an intentional change after a designed delay).\nIf a circuit has only \"one\" stable output state then the circuit is called \"monostable\". For example, if a powered state inevitably reverts to the unpowered state, but the unpowered state doesn't change until the input is triggered.\nWhen someone says \"monostable circuit\" in \"Minecraft\", they usually mean a &lt;a href=\"%23Pulse%20generator\"&gt;pulse generator&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"%23Pulse%20limiter\"&gt;pulse limiter&lt;/a&gt;. However, any redstone circuit which produces a finite number of pulses is technically a monostable circuit (all the circuits in this article, in fact, as well as some others), so instead of saying monostable circuit, it can be helpful to be more specific:\n&lt;a href=\"Clock%20circuit\"&gt;Clock circuit&lt;/a&gt;s also produce pulses, but they aren't monostable because they have \"no\" stable output states (they are \"astable\") unless forced into one by external interference (for example, when they're turned off). &lt;a href=\"Logic%20circuit\"&gt;Logic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"memory%20circuit\"&gt;memory circuit&lt;/a&gt;s aren't monostable because \"both\" of their output states are stable (they are \"bistable\") \u2013 they don't change unless triggered by their input.\nPulse generator.\nA pulse generator creates an output pulse when triggered.\nMost pulse generators consist of an input and a &lt;a href=\"%23Pulse%20limiter\"&gt;pulse limiter&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"%23Pulse%20extender\"&gt;pulse extender&lt;/a&gt; can be added on to generate a longer pulse.\nOn-pulse Generator.\nObserver Pulse generator.\nThe observer pulse generator is one of the most common pulse generators due to its adaptability. It can be oriented in almost any direction, and the observer can be oriented in almost any direction, allowing for lots of flexibility. And depending on where the output is taken from, it can be a rising or falling edge pulse generator. The observer can also be updated by other circuitry to send more pulses from the output.\nOff-pulse Generator.\nAn off-pulse generator has an output which is usually on, but generates an off-pulse when triggered.\nPulse length limiter.\nA pulse limiter (aka \"pulse shortener\") reduces the length of a long pulse.\nAn ideal pulse limiter would allow shorter pulses through unchanged, but in practice the range of input pulse can often be determined (or guessed) and it is sufficient to use a circuit which produces a specific pulse shorter than expected input pulses.\nAny &lt;a href=\"%23Rising%20edge%20detector\"&gt;rising edge detector&lt;/a&gt; can also be used as a pulse limiter.\nOff-pulse limiter.\nAn off-pulse limiter (aka \"inverted pulse limiter\") has an output which is usually on, but which shortens the length of long off-pulses.\nAny &lt;a href=\"%23Inverted%20falling%20edge%20detector\"&gt;inverted falling edge detector&lt;/a&gt; can also be used as an off-pulse limiter.\nPulse extender.\nA pulse extender (a.k.a. \"pulse sustainer\", \"pulse lengthener\") increases the duration of a pulse.\nThe most compact options are:\nPulse multiplier.\nA pulse multiplier turns one input pulse into multiple output pulses.\nThere are three primary strategies for designing pulse multipliers:\nIn case the player requires only the pulse frequency to be doubled, usually a simple &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit%23ded\"&gt;dual edge detector&lt;/a&gt; is often sufficient:\nSplit-path pulse multiplier.\nA split-path pulse multiplier produces multiple pulses by splitting the input signal into multiple paths and having them arrive at the output at different times. This usually requires first reducing the length of the input pulse with a &lt;a href=\"%23Pulse%20limiter\"&gt;pulse limiter&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the delay required between each output pulse.\nEnabled-clock pulse multiplier.\nAn enabled-clock pulse multiplier runs a clock for as long as the input stays on, thus producing a number of pulses relative to the input pulse length.\nTriggered-clock pulse multiplier.\nA triggered-clock pulse multiplier consists of a clock circuit that is allowed to run for a specific number of cycles once triggered. Strategies for designing a triggered-clock pulse multiplier include using a latch to turn the clock on and have the clock itself reset the latch back off after one or one-half clock cycles, or using a pulse extender to run a clock.\nAs of 1.11, it the lower hopper needs a longer pulse from the clock.To compensate, we add a repeater facing down to a block next to the, now below the dropper, hopper, and set it to 3 ticks.If you want a longer clock, use the formula: codice_2 where n is the clock pulse, for the delay of the lower repeater \nPulse divider.\nA pulse divider (a.k.a. \"pulse counter\") produces an output pulse after a specific number of input pulses \u2013 in other words, it turns multiple input pulses into one output pulse.\nBecause a pulse divider must count the input pulses to know when to produce an output pulse, it has some similarity to a ring counter (an \"n\"-state memory circuit with only one state on). The difference is that a ring counter's output state changes only when its internal count is changed by an input trigger, while a pulse divider produces an output pulse and then returns to the same unpowered output it had before its count was reached (in other words, a pulse divider is monostable but a ring counter is bistable). Any ring counter can be converted into a pulse divider just by adding a pulse limiter to its output (making it monostable). \nIn addition to the circuits here, a &lt;a href=\"Clock%20circuit%23Clock%20multiplier\"&gt;clock multiplier&lt;/a&gt; can function as a pulse divider (or a ring counter, for that matter); unlike these circuits, its output remains ON until the next input pulse turns it off.\nEdge detector.\nAn edge detector outputs a pulse when it detects a specific change in its input.\nAn inverted edge detector is usually on, but outputs an off-pulse (it turns off, then back on again) when it detects a specific change in its input.\nRising edge detector.\nA rising edge detector (RED) outputs a pulse when its input turns on (the \"rising edge\" of the input).\nAny rising edge detector can also be used as a pulse generator or pulse limiter.\nThis observer pulse edge detector is one of the most common edge detectors due to its modifyablity. It can be oriented in almost any direction, and the observer can be oriented in almost any direction, allowing for lots of flexibilty. And depending on where the output is taken from, it can be a rising or falling edge pulse generator. The observer can also be updated by other circiutry to send more pulses from the output.\nFalling edge detector.\nA falling edge detector (FED) outputs a pulse when its input turns off (the \"falling edge\" of the input).\nDual edge detector.\nA dual edge detector (DED) outputs a pulse when its input changes (at either the rising edge \"or\" the falling edge of the input). The simplest way to do is using an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most trivial way to build a dual edge detector is to OR the outputs of a &lt;a href=\"%23nor-gate%20rising%20edge%20detector\"&gt;NOR-gate rising edge detector&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"%23nor-gate%20falling%20edge%20detector\"&gt;NOR-gate falling edge detector&lt;/a&gt;.\nA useful feature of this approach is that you get the rising- and falling-only pulses for free if you need them.\nIf rsource or space usage is more important than timing, parts of the components of the 2 single edge detectors can be shared (the middle row of the example in the &lt;a href=\"%23schematics-DED\"&gt;Schematic Gallery: Dual Edge Detector&lt;/a&gt;).\nAgain, the blocks above the torches limit the output pulse to 1 tick.\nInverted rising edge detector.\nAn inverted rising edge detector (IRED) is a circuit whose output is usually \"on\", but which outputs an off-pulse on the input's rising edge.\nInverted falling edge detector.\nAn inverted falling edge detector (IFED) is a circuit whose output is usually \"on\", but which outputs an off-pulse on the input's falling edge.\nInverted dual edge detector.\nAn inverted dual edge detector (IDED) is a circuit whose output is usually \"on\", but which outputs an off-pulse when its input changes.\nPulse length detector.\nSometimes it is useful to be able to detect the length of a pulse generated by another circuit, and specifically whether it is longer or shorter than a given value. This has many uses, such as special combination locks (where the player have to hold down the button), or detecting .\nTransports and Logic gates implemented in Pulse logic.\nSome basic circuits exploiting the pulse logic. See the reference link for more advanced use of pulse logic circuitry.\nTypically, in pulse logic circuitry, signal is sent over &lt;a href=\"Powered%20Rail\"&gt;Powered Rail&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Activator%20Rail\"&gt;Activator Rail&lt;/a&gt;. Since the two don't propagate the updates to each other, this allows for tight tiling of modules.\nNegation of signal depends only on initial position of blocks, or often - only on interpretation of the signals by the creator. \nThe OR gate in pulse logic differs from AND gate only by initial positions of the blocks.\nGeneric redstone OR in pulse logic acts as XOR. \nThe \"greenstone\" or \"leafstone\" transport depends on updates of leaf blocks depending on changing distance from the nearest log block. This transport is particularly helpful in transporting signal upward and downward. Updates do propagate to neighboring blocks though, and take 1 game tick to progress to next block. It makes it useful in creating 1 gametick resolution timing source though.\nThe Scaffolding propagates updates containing distance from supported scaffolding block. By moving a block under a suspended section of scaffolding, the player can send a signal an arbitrary distance upward and up to six blocks horizontally in any direction. The signal propagates at 1 block per redstone tick. \n&lt;a href=\"Wall\"&gt;Wall&lt;/a&gt; blocks (cobblestone wall etc.) instantly transmit signal arbitrary distance down by turning themselves and all wall block below from smooth wall segment to a pillar segment if certain blocks are placed on them or attached from a side. To form a smooth segment, a wall needs two other wall blocks or other blocks wall can attach to, adjacent to it from two opposite sides. If they are other wall blocks though, it doesn't matter if they are smooth or pillars - so the solution is 1-tileable, but requires uninterrupted columns of full blocks (or wall) on far ends. Probably the most practical way to toggle a wall between these states is a redstone-controlled &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;. The readout through an observer is possible only from below though, as the wall connects to an observer from a side."}

{"id": "34716", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=34716", "title": "Redstone circuits/Transmission", "text": "A transmission circuit is a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuit\"&gt;redstone circuit&lt;/a&gt; that allows redstone signals to move from one place to another.\nSignal transmission.\nRedstone signals can be transmitted from one place to another with redstone wire \u2013 a line of redstone dust. Redstone wire can transmit a signal only 15 blocks \u2013 after that it needs a &lt;a href=\"%23Repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt; to boost the signal back up to full strength.\nTransmission crossing.\nWhen crossing each other, redstone wires must be kept isolated so they don't interfere with each other.\nVertical transmission.\nWhile horizontal transmission can be relatively straightforward, vertical transmission requires trade-offs.\nObservers can also be used to create a vertical ladder. Each observer carries block updates to the next observer up or down. A more advanced observer wire can be made by alternating, in upward order, observers, solid blocks, and either hoppers (only in Java Edition) or Droppers (in any edition). Each observer powers the dropper/hopper above it through the solid block, which changes its block state, activating the observer above it. The blocks can be removed to make a wire that is slower but does not power anything next to itself. Any of these can go horizontally or downward as well. There is also a more efficient downward method that goes (in downward order) observer, solid block, redstone dust, solid block, hopper/dropper.\nStarting from Java Edition 1.16, a &lt;a href=\"Wall\"&gt;Wall&lt;/a&gt; with a tall center post (due to a protruding wall block over it) causes all walls directly below it to also have a tall center post. In Java Edition, this change can be detected by observers, allowing for instantaneous downward transmission by moving a block over or away from the topmost wall.\n&lt;a href=\"Scaffolding\"&gt;Scaffolding&lt;/a&gt; provides the upward counterpart: Each scaffolding block tracks how far it is \"overhanging\", that is the distance from a column of scaffolding which is actually resting on a block. A trapdoor counts as support only when it is closed. Place a column of scaffolding atop a trapdoor, and also next to another scaffolding block that can support it while the trapdoor is open. When the trapdoor is closed, the column isn't overhanging at all, when the trapdoor is open it is overhanging 1 more space than its support scaffold. The difference propagates up the column, and can be detected by an observer.\nWater streams can carry information up and down. For a slow downward signal, a dispenser can place and pick up a water block (or even a lava block), and an observer can detect the changes in the flow downstream. For upward signals, a column of water source blocks can have the solid block below it swapped out by pistons; switching to a magma or soul sand block instantly propagates a bubble column up the water column, while switching to a normal block removes the bubbles; an observer watching one of the water blocks detects these changes.\nDiode.\nAnother important aspect of signal transmission is making sure a signal doesn't go the wrong way. A \"diode\" is a redstone component or circuit that allows signals through in one direction but not the other.\nRepeater.\nTo \"repeat\" a signal means to boost it back up to full strength. When redstone signals are transmitted through redstone dust, their signal strength fades and must be repeated after 15 blocks. Repeater components and circuits keep signals going over long distances.\n \n \nInstant repeater.\nAn instant repeater is a circuit that repeats a redstone signal change with no delay. A sequence of instant repeaters and redstone dust lines is known as instawire (or \"&lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Instant%20wire\"&gt;instant wire&lt;/a&gt;\").\nTwo-way repeater.\nA two-way repeater (aka \"2WR\", \"bi-directional repeater\") is a circuit that can repeat a signal in either direction.\nTwo-way repeaters have two inputs that also act as outputs.\nTypically the problem to be solved in design is repeating the signal in either direction without repeating the signal back into the same input, which could create a clock, a RS latch or a permanently-powered repeater loop.\nEach circuit description below lists a transmission speed, the rate at which multiple circuits can transmit signals when placed at maximum distance from each other. Most circuits have their inputs offset from each other by one or two blocks \u2013 moving the wires in-line with each other reduces the transmission speed (because the signal has to move sideways to get to the correct input).\nCurrent designs also have a two-way reset time \u2013 when input from one side is turned on, and then input from the other side is also turned on, then the first input turned back off, there is a short time while the transmission on the first side remains off until the circuit can reset itself to allow the second input through. Thus, the reset time can be seen as a spurious off pulse in a line that should be on.\nTransmission encoding.\nFor simple redstone structures, digital (\"on/off\") transmission is sufficient.\nFor complex redstone structures, with banks of inputs or outputs, more sophisticated forms of transmission may be required, such as analog, binary, or unary transmission.\nWhen numbers are represented by different types of transmission, they are said to be encoded.\nAnalog.\nAn analog encoding in \"Minecraft\" (a.k.a. wire or simply hex wire) is a transmission that outputs the same signal strength it receives as input. Because power levels can vary from 0 to 15, an analog transmission can convey 16 states in a single wire.\nThe tap-anywhere ACW is helpful with 1-tileable devices, both all requiring the same input, or collecting output from them (e.g. readout from a memory bank), sustaining the strongest of the inputs all the way \"downstream\" from it, on all the outputs.\nVertical analog transmission.\nThe vertical options for analog transmission are similar to the horizontal options.\nThe downward variant can go two blocks down for two block sideways, and double back, for a 1x3 tower. \nVertical &lt;a href=\"%23asw\"&gt;ASW&lt;/a&gt; basically just consists of redstone staircases or ladders with occasional breaks for subtraction.\nAnalog inverter.\nAn analog inverter is a circuit that inverts the signal strength, for example a signal with the strength of 6 becomes 9, and a full strength signal becomes 0. This can be achieved by placing a redstone block at the back of a redstone comparator and the input signal at the side of the comparator, with the output signal at front of the comparator, or by making an analog repeater wire, but instead of the wire in front of the repeater, place a block with a redstone torch attached to the front. place a wire in front of every torch, and the bottom-left redstone dust is the output.\nBinary.\nA binary encoding consists of multiple &lt;a href=\"%23Digital%20line\"&gt;digital lines&lt;/a&gt; run in parallel, with each line representing a different digit in a single binary number. For example, three lines might individually represent binary 001 (decimal 1), binary 010 (decimal 2), and binary 100 (decimal 4), allowing them together to represent any value from decimal 0 to 7 (by summing the represented values of the powered lines). An individual digital line of a binary transmission is referred to by the value it can add to the total number (for example, the 1-line, the 2-line, the 4-line, the 8-line, the 16-line, etc.)\nWhen a binary encoding is intended to carry only decimal numbers (encoding only values 0 to 9), it is known as (BCD).\nOne-hot.\nA one-hot encoding consists of multiple &lt;a href=\"%23Digital%20line\"&gt;digital lines&lt;/a&gt; run in parallel, where a value is represented by which line is on (for example, the number 5 might be represented by having only the fifth line on, and all other lines off). A common alternative to one-hot encoding is one-cold encoding, where a number is represented by which line is \"off\" instead of which line is on.\nWhile a strict one-hot encoding would always have precisely one line hot, a useful alternative is to eliminate the \"0\" line and represent the number 0 with no lines hot.\nOne-hot and one-cold encoding are rarely used for transmitting values over distance, but may be used for inputs (e.g., which button is pressed) or outputs (e.g., which dispenser is activated), with conversion to or from a more efficient transmission encoding in between. They are also used as a transitional encoding \u2014 for example, it is relatively complicated to decode from analog to binary directly, but relatively simple to first decode from analog to one-cold, then encode from one-cold to binary.\nUnary.\nA unary encoding consists of multiple &lt;a href=\"%23Digital%20line\"&gt;digital lines&lt;/a&gt; run in parallel, where a value is represented by the number of lines on (for example, the number 5 might be represented by having 5 of 16 lines powered). A unary encoding might use a convention that lines must be powered starting from one side (allowing values to be determined from the transition from powered lines to unpowered lines) or that they can be powered in any combination (requiring logic circuits or calculations to determine the represented value).\nUnary encoding is rarely used for transmitting values over distance, but may be used for inputs (e.g., the number of players standing on pressure plates) or outputs (e.g., the number of doors opened along a passageway).\nWireless transmission.\n&lt;a href=\"Command%20block\"&gt;Command block&lt;/a&gt;s allow redstone signals to be transmitted to any loaded chunk, without a direct connection.\nSetblock transmission.\nSetblock transmission works by using the setblock &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; to create and remove &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Power%20components\"&gt;power components&lt;/a&gt; at a receiver.\nFor the setblock transmitters below, the two command blocks should be given commands to create and remove power components at the receiver location. For example, if X, Y, and Z are the absolute or relative locations of the setblock receiver:\nOther power components can be used to activate the receiver, but most require additional data to specify their orientation (for example, to specify the direction a lever is attached). Additionally, any non-power component can be used to deactivate the receiver (even &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;). Avoid using blocks that are transparent or produce light (like redstone torches) as that can increase lag due to block light calculations in up to hundreds of blocks around the receiver.\nWhen a setblock command is executed, the affected block does not change until a half a redstone tick later (one game tick). Thus, the minimum circuit delay for setblock transmission is 0.5 ticks.\nScoreboard transmission.\nScoreboard transmission works by setting values for &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt; objectives. Scoreboard transmission can be used to transmit simple binary values (as shown below), but scoreboard objectives can store values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 (inclusive) and multiple scoreboard objectives can be active at once (though transmitting and receiving many values requires arrays of transmitters and receivers). A single scoreboard transmitter can activate multiple receivers at once and different transmitters can set the scoreboard objective to different values, activating specific sets of receivers and simultaneously deactivating all other receivers. Scoreboard receivers can also respond to \"ranges\" of values, instead of just specific values.\nScoreboard transmission requires the creation of a dummy scoreboard objective to store the transmission's current value (\"WirelessBus01\" is an example and can be anything):\nBinary scoreboard transmitters are similar to &lt;a href=\"%23Setblock%20transmission\"&gt;setblock transmitters&lt;/a&gt;, except they require different commands (WirelessBusFakePlayer is an example and can be anything, but only one fake player is required for all wireless buses):\nUnlike setblock receivers, scoreboard receivers must be run on &lt;a href=\"clock%20circuit\"&gt;clock circuit&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSummon transmission.\nSummon transmission works by summoning an item onto a wooden pressure plate.\nUnlike setblock and scoreboard transmission, summon transmission doesn't require an \"off\" command block, depending only on the summoned item's despawn time to deactivate the receiver."}

Redstone circuits and devices have many uses including automatic farms, controlling doorways, changeable or mobile buildings, transporting players and mobs, and more. Some relevant pages include:\nRedstone Concepts.\nRedstone tick.\nA redstone tick is a unit of time, in redstone, that is equal to two &lt;a href=\"tick%23Game%20ticks\"&gt;game ticks&lt;/a&gt;, 0.1 seconds. Most redstone components take a multiple of a redstone tick to change states. Redstone torches, redstone repeaters, and other redstone components require one or more ticks to change state, so it can take several ticks for a signal to propagate through a complicated circuit.\nRedstone ticks differ from \"game ticks\" (20 per second) and \"&lt;a href=\"tick%23Block%20ticks\"&gt;block ticks&lt;/a&gt;\" (block updates that occur at each game tick). When discussing redstone circuits, the term \"tick\" should always be interpreted to mean a redstone tick, unless otherwise specified.\nRedstone components.\nA Redstone component is a block that provides some purpose to a Redstone circuit.\nPower.\nRedstone components and blocks may or may not be powered. A \"powered block\" can be thought of as a block that has electricity running through it. Some blocks will show their powered state visibly (for example, &lt;a href=\"Redstone%23Redstone%20Dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt; lights up, a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;illuminates&lt;/a&gt; its surroundings and a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20Torch\"&gt;redstone torch&lt;/a&gt; turns off), but other blocks may give no visual indication of their powered state other than their effect on other redstone components.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Opacity\"&gt;opaque block&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. stone, dirt, etc.) powered by a &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Power%20components\"&gt;power component&lt;/a&gt;, or by a repeater or comparator, is said to be strongly powered or 'hard-powered' (a different concept from &lt;a href=\"%23Power%20level\"&gt;power level&lt;/a&gt;). A strongly powered block can power adjacent redstone dust (including dust on top of the block or dust beneath it).\nAn opaque block powered only by redstone dust (and no other components) is said to be weakly powered or 'soft-powered' because a block powered only by redstone dust will not power other redstone dust (but can still power other components or devices, such as repeaters and pistons).\nNo opaque block can directly power another opaque block\u2014there must be dust or a device in between. A transparent block can't be powered by anything. \"Strong\"/\"hard\" vs. \"weak\"/\"soft\" power applies only to opaque blocks, not to dust or other redstone components.\nA powered block (strong or weak) can affect adjacent redstone components. Different redstone components react differently to powered blocks\u2014see their &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components\"&gt;individual descriptions&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nSignal strength.\nRedstone \"signal strength\" can be an integer between 0 and 15. Most power components provide an output of power level 15, but a few components provide a variable amount of power. These include daylight sensors and redstone comparators.\nRedstone dust transmits power to adjacent redstone dust and blocks, but its strength decreases by 1 for each block the redstone power travels. Redstone dust can thus transmit power up to 15 blocks before needing to be \"maintained\" with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; or \"re-strengthened\" with a &lt;a href=\"Transmission%20circuit%23Repeater\"&gt;repeater&lt;/a&gt;. Power level only fades with the dust-to-dust transmission, not between dust and a device or block.\nThe power level can also be adjusted directly with a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; in comparison or subtraction mode.\nSignals and pulses.\nCircuits with a stable output are said to produce a signal \u2014 an ON signal (also \"high\" or \"1\") if powered, or an OFF signal (\"low\", \"0\") if unpowered. When a signal changes from OFF to ON (\"rising edge\") and then back to OFF (\"falling edge\"), that is described as a pulse (or ON pulse), while the opposite is described as an OFF pulse. ON pulses are far more common, and in casual discussion, \"a signal\" often refers to an ON pulse.\nVery short pulses (1 or 2 ticks) can cause problems for some components or circuits because they have different update sequences to change states. For example, a redstone torch or a comparator will not respond to a 1-tick pulse.\nActivation.\nMechanism blocks (pistons, doors, redstone lamps, etc.) can be activated by incoming power, which causes the mechanism component to do something (push a block, open the door, turn on, etc.). \nActivation behavior.\nThere are two main variations for how things can respond to activation:\nPowered vs. activated.\nFor opaque mechanism blocks (&lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dropper\"&gt;dropper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt;s), it is important to make a distinction between a mechanism component being \"activated\" and being \"powered\" (and this is the reason why mechanism components are described as activated instead of just saying they are powered).\nAny method of powering a mechanism component (such as a redstone torch underneath it) will also activate it, but some activation methods (such as a redstone torch next to or above a mechanism component) won't actually power the component (following the usual rules for power components).\nNon-opaque mechanism components (doors, fence gates, hoppers, pistons, rails, trapdoors) can be activated (they can do things), but cannot be powered (i.e. they can not then power adjacent redstone dust, etc.).\nNormal activation rules.\nIn general mechanism components are activated by:\nSpecial activation rules.\nSome mechanism components have additional ways of being activated:\nRedstone block updates.\nBlock upates are how most redstone compenents \"tell\" each other that they need to change states.\nWhen a change occurs somewhere in a redstone circuit, it can produce other changes in surrounding blocks in what is called a block update. Each of these changes can then produce other changes in their surrounding blocks. The update will propagate following the redstone circuit rules within loaded chunks (block updates will not propagate into unloaded chunks), usually very quickly. \"Note: in Bedrock Edition, block updates and redstone are not connected.\"\nA block update simply notifies other Redstone components and blocks that a change has occurred nearby and allows them to change their own state in response, but not all updates will necessarily require changes. For example, if a redstone torch activates and updates the dust below it, the dust may already be powered from something else, in which case the dust won't change state and the update propagation will stop there.\nBlock updates can also be generated by any immediate neighbor block being placed, moved, or destroyed.\nSolid blocks don't \"know\" if they're powered or not. Block updates simply update enough blocks around a redstone component to update other redstone components around the solid block (for example, a pressure plate updates its neighbors and the neighbors of the block it's attached to, which includes the space under that block which might be redstone dust).\nIn addition to block updates, comparators can be updated by containers (including detector rails with container minecarts on them) and certain other blocks, up to two blocks away horizontally when their state changes (for example, when their inventory changes). This is known as a comparator update.\nThe following redstone components produce block updates up to two blocks away by &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;, including up and down:\nThe following redstone components produce block updates in their immediate neighbors, including above and below, \"and\" in the immediate neighbors of the block they're attached to:\nThe following redstone components update only their immediate neighbors when they change their state, including above and below:\nThe following redstone components do \"not\" produce block updates when they change their state (though any block will produce a block update in its immediate neighbors if moved or destroyed):"}

Each file stores a group of 32\u00d732 chunks called a region. The format took the place of the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20level%20format\"&gt;Alpha level format&lt;/a&gt;, which had been in use since the &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; development phase, where chunks were stored in individual files on the file system. The file does not begin with a , unlike , and begins directly with the header. The format has been superseded by the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20file%20format\"&gt;Anvil file format&lt;/a&gt;; however, the Anvil file format made changes only to the &lt;a href=\"chunk%20format\"&gt;chunk format&lt;/a&gt; and changed the region file extensions from \".mcr\" to \".mca\".\nThe system is based on McRegion, a mod by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.minecraftforum.net/members/Scaevolus\"&gt;Scaevolus&lt;/a&gt;, also known for his development of the Optimine project. The McRegion format was adopted nearly unchanged, except for the addition of a table of chunk update timestamps. &lt;a href=\"JahKob\"&gt;JahKob&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that this format is up to 7 times faster than the previous system. The difference in a world's total file size between the Region file format and the Alpha level format is negligible.\nLocation.\nRegion files are located in a subfolder of the world directory, \"region\", and have names in the form codice_1, where x and z are the region's coordinates.\nThe coordinates for the region a chunk belongs to can be found by taking the floor of dividing the chunk coordinates by 32, or by 5 bits to the right. For example, a chunk at (30, -3) would be in the region (0, -1), and one at (1500, -600) would be at (46, -19).\n// division\nint regionX = (int) floor(chunkX / 32.0f);\nint regionZ = (int) floor(chunkZ / 32.0f);\n// bit shifts\nint regionX = chunkX \u00bb 5;\nint regionZ = chunkZ \u00bb 5;\nStructure.\nHeader.\nRegion files begin with an 8KiB header, split into two 4KiB tables. The first containing the offsets of chunks in the region file itself, the second providing timestamps for the last updates of those chunks. \nThe offset of a chunk [x, z] (in chunk coordinates) in the first table can be found by using this formula: 4 * ((x mod 32) + (z mod 32) * 32). When using certain languages (such as Java/C/C++), the values of x mod 32 and z mod 32 can be negative. To prevent this, use the AND operator (&amp;) instead of modulo: 4 * ((x &amp; 31) + (z &amp; 31) * 32). Its timestamp can be found 4096 bytes later in the file. \nChunk location.\nLocation information for a chunk consists of four bytes split into two fields: the first three bytes are a (big-endian) offset in 4KiB sectors from the start of the file, and a remaining byte that gives the length of the chunk (also in 4KiB sectors, rounded up). Chunks are always less than 1MiB in size. If a chunk isn't present in the region file (e.g. because it hasn't been generated or migrated yet), both fields are zero.\nA chunk with an offset of 2 begins right after the timestamps table.\nChunk timestamps.\nThe entries in the timestamp table are individual four-byte big-endian integers, representing the last modification time of a chunk in epoch seconds.\nPayload.\nChunk data begins with a (big-endian) four-byte signed length field that indicates the exact length of the remaining chunk data in bytes. The following byte indicates the compression scheme used for chunk data, and the remaining (length-1) bytes are the compressed chunk data.\n\"Minecraft\" always pads the last chunk's data to be a multiple-of-4096B in length (so that the entire file has a size that is a multiple of 4KiB). \"Minecraft\" does not accept files in which the last chunk is not padded. Note that this padding is not included in the length field.\nThere are currently three defined compression schemes:\nThe uncompressed data is in &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT format&lt;/a&gt; and follows the information detailed on the &lt;a href=\"chunk%20format\"&gt;chunk format&lt;/a&gt; article; if compressed with compression scheme 1, the compressed data would be the same as the on-disk content of an Alpha chunk file. Note that chunks are always saved using compression scheme 2 by the official client.\nIf the value of compression scheme increases by 128, the compressed data is saved in a file called codice_2, where x and z are the chunk's coordinates, instead of the usual position.\nMigration and level.dat.\nBeta 1.3 converts any \"old\" chunks into region files before loading the world, rather than incrementally as they are loaded during play. As part of the conversion, codice_3 is updated with TAG_Int(\"version\") (note case) set to 19132. Beta 1.3 also introduces a new level name field, TAG_String(\"LevelName\"). There's also introduced new TAG_Byte(\"Sleeping\") in player TAG_Compounds - level.dat in singleplayer, [player name].dat in multiplayer that indicates whether is player in the bed. It has value 1(true) or 0(false). For the beta 1.8, TAG_Int(\"GameType\") was added. In beta 1.9, TAG_byte(\"hardcore\") was added.\nThe format of &lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt; is otherwise unchanged.\nSoftware.\nThe community has developed programs to work with region files:"}

{"id": "150859", "revid": "48384975", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=150859", "title": "Removed blocks", "text": "This page documents &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s which existed in any of the game's several editions, but are no longer present in the latest version.\nFor the sake of brevity, this page only documents blocks which were programmed into the game intentionally. There are far more \"blocks\" which exist as metadata values outside of the expected range, normally inaccessible &lt;a href=\"block%20state\"&gt;block state&lt;/a&gt; combinations, and other anomalous cases of block data such as non-standard &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; definitions. Due to their tendency to behave differently across editions due to not being intended, said cases can be found linked to by the following list pages:\nExisted in multiple editions.\nLocked chest.\nA joke block, completely unrelated to the current ability to lock chests via NBT.\nShrub.\nThe shrub was an unused plant block. While visually identical to the &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt; in most aspects, it differs largely in functionality. Its main visual difference arises from it using a random offset, identical to that of &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fern\"&gt;fern&lt;/a&gt;s, and later flowers.\nUnlike the dead bush, which was a separate block and used a separate block ID at the time, the shrub was the default data value variant of the block ID that also hosted grass and ferns, which were respectively metadata values 1 and 2 of the shrub. As such, the shrub inherits much of the functionality of grass and ferns; alongside the aforementioned offset, they also had the same chance to drop &lt;a href=\"wheat%20seeds\"&gt;wheat seeds&lt;/a&gt; upon breaking.\nHaving been given a unique name, as well as being intentionally programmed to not be tinted unlike all other metadata values of its block ID, it can be assumed that the inclusion of the shrub was intended to a certain degree, although likely only as a prototype of sorts, as the dead bush was included in the same version that added shrubs, and shrubs were unobtainable through normal means whereas the dead bush appeared everywhere. It not being removed in 1.8, as detailed below, strengthens this assertion.\nIn contrast to almost all other invalid metadata variants of blocks, the shrub was not removed in 14w26a with the switch to block states, and the shrub remained a valid block. (The \"green shrub\", which refers to blocks with the shrub/grass ID with metadata values exceeding the expected values, were in fact removed, and were not intentionally implemented in the first place, which is why they are not listed on this page.)\nThe shrub remained until 17w47a, the version in which the Flattening occurred, which merged shrubs into the more well-established dead bush, likely due to shrubs never having been used. The shrub is unique in this aspect, as all other merged block IDs were clear functional variants, and as such is the reason why the shrub is featured on this list.\nOnly existed in Java Edition.\nOld Colored Wool / Cloth.\nUpon introduction in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.20a\"&gt;0.0.20a&lt;/a&gt;, there were 16 different colors of wool, referred to as \"cloth\" at the time due to the lack of in-game names until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.0\"&gt;Beta 1.0&lt;/a&gt;. The colors of these blocks matched up with the default colors of Paint.NET, as well as generally appearing similar to tertiary RGB colors. Each of these blocks had a unique numeric ID, ranging from 21 to 36.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100624\"&gt;the June 24, 2010 build of Infdev&lt;/a&gt;, 15 of the 16 different colored cloth blocks were outright removed from the game. Specifically, this referred to IDs 21-34, as well as 36. The remaining ID, 35, belonged to light gray cloth prior to this version. ID 35 was changed to instead have the white cloth texture, ultimately rendering it the actual white cloth block, and removing light gray cloth as a result, despite white cloth technically also being removed in this version due to having ID 36.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.2\"&gt;Beta 1.2&lt;/a&gt;, colored wool was reimplemented. However, the color scheme was completely different, and coloration was handled via block metadata, rather than defining a new ID for each color. Wool would continue to use metadata (and later block states) to define its color up until &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13/Flattening\"&gt;the Flattening&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt; gave each wool color a unique (albeit non-numeric) block ID again.\nThe IDs 21-34 and 36 would start to be used with completely different blocks between Beta 1.2 and &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.7\"&gt;Beta 1.7&lt;/a&gt;, while \nNone of the removed colors have been named officially, and there seems to be no plan to return any of them to the game.\nThe following table lists each of the removed wool colors alongside their currently unofficial color names.\nGears.\nA fully animated block, it was inaccessible and had no real use other than decoration. It was later replaced with redstone.\nWater spawner.\nThese blocks persistently generated their respective liquid around them.\nLava spawner.\nThese blocks persistently generated their respective liquid around them.\nGeneric dead coral block.\nIn snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w09a\"&gt;18w09a&lt;/a&gt;, all coral blocks had the same texture, colored differently. Because of this, there was only one dead variant needed. By the time of snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w10a\"&gt;18w10a&lt;/a&gt;, each color of the coral block had its own unique texture, but would still all die into the same generic dead coral block from the previous snapshot. The generic dead coral block was removed and replaced with dead variants for each color in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2018w10b\"&gt;18w10b&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly existed in Bedrock Edition.\n&lt;samp&gt;grass_carried&lt;/samp&gt;.\nThis block, when placed, appeared identical to how &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s appear in item form, due to it having been used to store its item model due to the inability to tint items in earlier versions.\n&lt;samp&gt;leaves_carried&lt;/samp&gt;.\nThis block, when placed, appeared similar to how &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; appear (but noticably darker) in item form, due to it having been used to store its item model due to the inability to tint items in earlier versions."}

While running completely out of resources is unlikely to be a factor in normal worlds due to the massive size of a \"Minecraft\" map, only some resources can be produced over and over without having to explore more terrain. Running out of resources can be a bigger issue on &lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; worlds, where resources are less plentiful, in PvP maps, where one would like to obtain resources without having to conquer more land, or simply if the accessible portion of the map is limited.\nThe listed fully renewable craftable &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s are items that can be &lt;a href=\"Crafting\"&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;smelted&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Brewing\"&gt;brewed&lt;/a&gt; using only renewable resources. For example, &lt;a href=\"cookie\"&gt;cookie&lt;/a&gt;s are renewable as they require only &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cocoa%20beans\"&gt;cocoa beans&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can be regrown infinitely.\nMost items dropped by &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s or monsters are renewable because more &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s of the same kind can spawn and be killed again for more loot. The exceptions are drops of enemies that spawn just once with the generation of specific structures, such as &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s (three spawn with each &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;). Drops of hostile mobs, with the exception of those obtainable by other means, are \"not\" renewable on Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; because the monsters do not spawn.\nMethods for renewably obtaining.\nMany resources are renewably obtainable using certain main methods, such as &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;. Others are obtainable by unusual &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;-specific methods, which can vary from building a &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; generator to harvesting &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s to collecting &lt;a href=\"dragon%20breath\"&gt;dragon breath&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"bottle\"&gt;bottle&lt;/a&gt;. The renewable method to obtain an item is not necessarily the easiest, fastest or safest, and may in some cases be highly impractical.\nThe most common methods for renewably obtaining items, ordered roughly by increasing effort are:\nThe first three methods are often the most practical ways to obtain items that can be obtained by using them. \nMost items obtainable by fishing and trading are obtainable in some other way, which may be easier or of comparable difficulty, but may not be renewable. They are especially worth using when the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; wants to avoid the risk of &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, such as while playing in &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode. \nGrinding for rare drops is rarely practical unless there is no other option, as the player must kill many &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s to obtain the desired drops.\nRenewable.\nTradable.\nThese &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s are renewable only through &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s, and not by any other method.\nRare drops.\nThese &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s are considered &lt;a href=\"rare%20drops\"&gt;rare drops&lt;/a&gt; or are obtained by a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; dying in a unique way. For some of these items, this is the only way to obtain them; otherwise, this is the only renewable way to obtain them. Rare drops do not include any item the mob picked up after spawning. &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Mob%20Farm\"&gt;Mob farms&lt;/a&gt; are an option for obtaining rare drops more easily.\nAll &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s which can be legitimately obtained in Survival are also renewable.\nBedrock Edition.\nMost resources are as renewable in as they are in .

Besides, some customizable or hardcoded contents also use resource locations.\nRegistries and registry objects.\nEach registry and each object in registries has a resource location to represent it.\nThere's a root registry with resource location of . Other registries are registered into the root registry as its entries.\nThe following is the list of registries and their resource locations:\nPack contents.\nResource locations are also used to represent files' paths in data pack or resource pack.\nLocating contents in packs.\nGiven objects from resource packs and data packs are files, the resource locations represent corresponding paths.\nThough the locations vary by object type and the pack type the object type belongs to, there is a pattern to follow. In general, the location is in the fashion of pack_type/namespace/object_type/name.suffix, where all the / (forward slash) symbol (may be part of object_type or name) is replaced by operating system-dependent directory separator.\nGiven the type of content we want to locate, we can find out the corresponding , , and . Then, we can substitute in and find out the final file location of the content.\nExamples\nRegistered pack contents.\nA registried pack content refers to pack content that is registered into a registry when the pack is loaded. For a registried pack content, its resource location works as both main key of registry entry and path of its resource file.\nList of registered pack contents\nBedrock Edition.\nUnlike \"Java Edition\", where there is a unified standard and handling methods of resource location, namespaced identifiers are usually treated as normal strings in Bedrock Edition. Moreover, namespaced identifiers are even not required in some cases (e.g. recipe's identifier). However, for content creators, it is recommended to always use namespaced identifiers no matter whether required or not.\nThe following is a list of all places that use namespaced identifiers: \nRegistried add-on entries.\nA registried add-on entry refers to add-on content that is registered with an identifier which is declared in add-on files.\nHere is a list of registried add-on entries whose identifiers can be namespaced.\nSome custom fields in add-on files can also be namespaced, such as custom block properties and entity component groups, which aren't listed here.\nNamespaces.\nA namespace is a domain for content. It is to prevent potential content conflicts or unintentional overrides of objects of the same name.\nFor example, two data packs add two minigame mechanisms to Minecraft; both have a function named . Without namespaces, these two functions would clash and the minigames would be broken. When they have different namespaces of and , the functions would become and , which no longer conflict.\nnamespace.\nMinecraft reserves the namespace. When a namespace is not specified, a resource location falls back to . As a result, the namespace should only be used by content creators when the content needs to overwrite or modify existing Minecraft data, such as adding a function to the function tag.\nCustom namespace.\nThe namespace should be distinct for different projects or content creations (e.g. a data pack, a resource pack, a mod, backing data/resource packs for a custom map, etc.)\nTo prevent potential clashes, the namespace should be as specific as possible.\nIn either case, these poorly chosen namespaces reduce the exposure of a project and bring difficulties for debugging when there are multiple content creations applied to the game.\nOther built-in namespaces.\nThe vanilla Minecraft resource pack declares Realms-oriented language files in the namespace (located at assets/realms/lang/.json) and game-related language files in the namespace, even though translation keys are not resource locations. The realms jar itself also declares its en_us.json language file and its various textures in the namespace.\nIn the IDs of command argument types, a namespace also appears for command argument types that are native to Brigadier."}

{"id": "41733", "revid": "50327121", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=41733", "title": "Resource pack", "text": "Resource packs are packs of files that can be applied to any &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;. They provide a way for players to customize &lt;a href=\"textures\"&gt;textures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"model\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sound\"&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;s, texts such as the &lt;a href=\"end%20poem\"&gt;end poem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"splash\"&gt;splash&lt;/a&gt;es, credits, and fonts without any &lt;a href=\"Mods\"&gt;code modification&lt;/a&gt;. Resource packs are available in both &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;\"Java Edition\"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;\"Bedrock Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nJava Edition.\nBehavior.\nResource packs can be placed in the folder within the folder. Each resource pack is either a sub-folder or a within the folder. Once in the folder, a resource pack can be added from the &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt;, where resource packs can be moved between \"Available resource packs\" and \"Selected resource packs\". \"Selected resource packs\" also contain the default assets on the bottom, which cannot be removed.\nResource packs load their assets based on the order of the packs on the list. The bottom-most pack loads first, then each pack placed above it replaces assets of the same name with its assets.\nDefault resource packs.\nA resource pack can be bundled with a &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; by saving it as a file under the name and placing it directly in the world's folder. When playing the world, that resource pack appears as the default right above the default resource pack.\nA resource pack can be set on a server by adding a link to a file download after the line in the &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server.properties&lt;/a&gt; file. Users then have an option of whether to download the resource pack or not. Resource packs can also be forced on a server using in the server.properties file. Rejecting the resource pack disconnects the player from the server.\nThe old (pre-&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.14\"&gt;1.14&lt;/a&gt;) textures are available in a resource pack titled \"Programmer Art\". These textures are not updated when the game receives new textures.\nFolder structure.\nMore than one directory for different namespaces may exist under the directory.\nContents.\nA resource pack is identified by \"Minecraft\" based on the presence of the file in the root directory, which contains a file with the following information:\nThe root directory also contains an optional image called , which appears as the thumbnail for the pack on the resource pack selection menu.\nLanguage.\nResource packs can create language files of the type in the folder . Each file either replaces information from a file of the same name in the default or a lower pack, or it creates a new language as defined by .\nEach line in the file is in the standard json format of followed by a comma in case it is followed by another value in the next line. is what the game uses to look up the name for something, and as such it should not be translated or changed. is the name that is displayed. For example, stone in the default language file is , with being the identifier, and being the displayed name. Blank lines are ignored. The file needs to be valid JSON syntax, meaning it starts with a codice_1, has a comma after every key value pair except the last one, and ends with a codice_2.\nLanguage files need to add only those lines that are changed by the pack. Any names that are not in the pack are loaded from the pack below, or default if no pack changes the names.\nModels.\nModels are files in JSON format with the extension , which determine the shape and textures of blocks and items.\nBlocks use a block state file from to determine which model is loaded for each variant from the folder . Meanwhile, each item has an item model in to determine its model, which either loads from a block's model, contains data for its own custom model, or uses the default \"flat\" or \"entity\" model.\nModels and block states used in packs below the top one are still loaded unless overridden in the top pack, which may cause some textures and models used by the top pack to no longer be loaded.\nSounds.\nResource packs load additional sounds with the file type of . Each sound placed in the pack overrides the sounds from packs below, and packs also contain a file called , which is placed within . Unlike most other files in resource packs, merges sound information from packs below the top pack, rather than each file overriding the previous completely.\nTextures.\nFor block or item textures to function, they must have equal width and height (or height that is a multiple of the width if &lt;a href=\"%23Animation\"&gt;animated&lt;/a&gt;); otherwise it appears as a magenta and black checkerboard. For most other textures, the file is stretched to fit the required dimensions.\nMost solid blocks turn any transparent area fully opaque. Some other blocks, which have \"cutout\" transparency (like glass) turn all pixels that are less than 10% opaque fully transparent and all other pixels completely opaque. Every other block renders textures with semi-transparency as-is. All items and any blocks or entities that are semi-transparent by default support semi-transparency.\nIf a file does not exist in any resource pack, including the default, the &lt;a href=\"missing%20texture\"&gt;missing texture&lt;/a&gt; appears in its place. As of 1.19.1, six such cases exist in the vanilla resource pack, all particle-related.\nAtlases.\nAtlases are configuration files, located in &lt;samp&gt;atlases&lt;/samp&gt; directory, that control which images are included in the atlases. That directory contains following JSON entries for configuring atlases:\nAnimation.\nBlock, item, particle, painting, item frame, and status effect icon () textures support animation by placing each additional frame below the last. The animation is then controlled using a file in JSON format with the same name and at the end of the filename, in the same directory. For example, the file for would be .\nIf the file does not exist in the pack and the texture does, the game assumes the texture is not animated, rather than loading a file from a pack below that pack. If no file exists for a texture with unequal dimensions, the texture appears as a purple and black checkerboard.\nVillagers.\nTextures from and support a file in JSON format containing additional effects to apply to the hat layer. The file is contained in the same directory as the texture, and has the same name as the texture, except appended with . For example, the file can have a properties file called \nIf the file does not exist in the pack and the texture does, the game loads the default settings, rather than loading a file from a pack below that pack.\nColormaps.\nColormaps are 256\u00d7256 pixel images which tell the game which color to use in each biome. They are located in . The game contains two colormaps: colors plants such as &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; (except birch and spruce) and &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, and colors &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grass%20blocks\"&gt;grass blocks&lt;/a&gt;. Colormaps can be disabled on individual blocks by removing the tag from the block model.\nProperties.\nIf the file does not exist in the pack and the texture does, the game loads the default settings, rather than loading a file from a pack below that pack.\nTexts.\nTwo files in UTF-8 format and one file exist in . They are used by the game to determine the text to display.\nThe file contains the text of the end poem, using &lt;a href=\"formatting%20codes\"&gt;formatting codes&lt;/a&gt; to apply the colors to the two speakers, and with the text being replaced with the player's name. After that file is shown, the contents of are shown.\nThe file contains lines of text separated using line breaks to determine the splashes to display in-game. Any splash can be replaced with different text.\nFonts.\nA font file is a JSON file located at within a resource pack and contains a list of providers that each tie a character set to a resource location along with some extra information. The default font is defined by the font while the default font used by enchantment tables is defined by the font . \nThe resource locations given in font providers should also include the file extensions.\nFont texture sheets automatically resize based on the amount of characters in each array line, and some sheets may use a 16-character wide sheet, in order to conform with a Unicode block. This is how Vanilla formats the default font JSON.\nDefault textures.\nThe texture files of the default fonts contain a grid of white characters, which are automatically colored by \"Minecraft\" as needed in-game. The character sizes are automatically determined based on the last line of pixels containing any alpha value. Due to the way fonts are detected, filling the background of a character with a color containing a 5% alpha background causes the full width to render without generally having a visible background to the character. The default font character is 8\u00d78 pixels, while is 9\u00d712 pixels.\nThe default texture is located in . It contains these characters:\n 0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?\n @ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO\n PQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_\n `abcdefghijklmno\n pqrstuvwxyz{|}~ \n \u00a3 \u0192\n \u00aa\u00ba \u00ac \u00ab\u00bb\n \u2514\u2534\u252c\u251c\u2500\u253c\u255e\u255f\u255a\u2554\u2569\u2566\u2560\u2550\u256c\u2567\n \u2205\u2208 \n \u2261\u00b1\u2265\u2264\u2320\u2321\u00f7\u2248\u00b0\u2219 \u221a\u207f\u00b2\u25a0 \nA texture sheet in contains many accented characters and most of the symbols \"Minecraft\" supports.

text or \"alien font\") is .\nThere is another currently unused texture called , which is the rune-like font from \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Dungeons\"&gt;Minecraft Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;\". It is located at .\nLegacy Unicode.\nAs a fallback for untextured characters, \"Minecraft\" uses . Each sheet of characters is stored following the format of , where are the hexadecimal numbers 00 through FF. These pages are 16\u00d716 pixels, and appear small and rough in-game. The version of GNU Unifont used is 9.0.04, and is outdated as of 1.17.1. It provides the support for the characters as well as a fallback for every character not provided by any loaded font.\nThe Unifont entries use a for recording glyph widths. Each entry is one byte large; the higher nibble records the starting position while the lower records the ending position in the 16\u00d716 glyph grid. For example, a square character occupying the entire grid (pixel #0 through #15) would have a byte of .\nCodepoints beyond U+FFFF are not handled and are ignored.\nEmoji.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.15\"&gt;1.15&lt;/a&gt;, \"Minecraft\" can support UTF-16 sequences for emojis, or any character in the plane. \nFor the emoji to be read properly in the array of the font file, the character can either:\nThe first method is used in the Vanilla font file, but either works equally well.\nTo convert a character into a surrogate pair, one can use the following equations, where \"C\" is the codepoint in decimal: \nAs of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.17.1\"&gt;1.17.1&lt;/a&gt;, \"Minecraft\" has default support for the following emojis:\nShadows.\nIn most places text is rendered, a shadow appears beneath every character. This shadow is a copy of the character's bitmap, with the r, g and b values divided by 4, and positioned 12.5% south-east of the character, relative to its spacing. Regardless of the resolution of the character's texture, the shadow is always moved by 12.5%; whether there exists any way to change this value using resource packs is unknown. In the default font (), the shadow is equivalent to being moved 1 pixel down and to the right.\nGlowing text.\n&lt;a href=\"Glow%20Ink%20Sac\"&gt;Glow ink&lt;/a&gt; on a sign causes a character to create eight copies of itself, similar to the shadows, but in all eight directions. This results in the font appearing to have a thick outline.\nTexture sheets.\nMinecraft generally does not store multiple different textures on sheets and instead stores them on separate files. Two current exceptions are &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; icons and &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShaders.\nShaders are a way for resource packs to change how the game renders. They are written in OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL).\nRegional compliancies warnings.\nRegional compliancies warnings can be customized at .\nTemplate.\nThe folder structure of Vanilla Resource Pack:\nBedrock Edition.\nMany resource packs for \"Bedrock Edition\" can be obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, either for free or for a price of Minecoins (Tokens on PS4).\nBehavior.\nSimilarly to &lt;a href=\"skin\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;s, resource packs can be bought or made . Users can download resource packs on the system itself with the file names, if the game platform allows file importation. When these files are opened, they are automatically imported into the game without any need for file system access. Resource packs can also be put manually in the folder in the folder. Each resource pack must either be a sub-folder or a file.\nResource packs can be applied on the Global Resources option from the &lt;a href=\"settings\"&gt;settings&lt;/a&gt; menu from the main menu screen. Resource packs can be moved between \"Active\" and \"My Packs\". \"Active\" also contains the default assets at the bottom, and cannot be removed.\nResource packs load their assets based on the order of the packs on the list. The bottom-most pack loads first, then each pack placed above it replaces assets of the same name with its assets.\nDefault packs.\nOne or more resource packs can be bundled with a world in the world settings. When playing the world, that resource pack appears as the default right above the default resource pack. A resource pack can be set on a server by bundling the resource pack in the world, and then re-uploading the world folder to the server. Users then have an option whether to use the resource pack or not if the option is disabled in the &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server settings&lt;/a&gt; and if the world has the \"Require players to accept resource packs to join\" option disabled. Resource packs can also be forced on a server by using the property on the &lt;a href=\"server.properties\"&gt;server settings&lt;/a&gt;."}

The respawn anchor keeps its current level of charges with the &lt;a href=\"Pick%20Block\"&gt;Pick Block&lt;/a&gt; option in Creative mode, and it is unique in the fact that this does not work on other blocks with different states like the &lt;a href=\"redstone%20lamp\"&gt;redstone lamp&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"daylight%20sensor\"&gt;daylight sensor&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting.\nWhile the ingredients to craft a respawn anchor are all native to the Nether, they are also obtainable in the Overworld: &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;, or crafted from &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt; dropped by &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es; crying obsidian can be found in &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s and obtained with &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nRespawning.\nThe respawn anchor is used to respawn in the Nether, even if the player leaves the Nether. Once the block is charged, it can be to set the player's respawn location.\nWhen crafted, a respawn anchor has no (zero) charge and can't yet be used until charged. \"\" a &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; block (not &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt;) on it adds a charge. The anchor accepts up to 4 charges, and the charge level is indicated by a dial on the side of the block.\nThe first charge makes the respawn anchor glow with a light level of 3. Each glowstone after the first increases the light level by 4, up to a maximum of 15.\nTo set the player's spawn location to the respawn anchor they must it, just like one does with a bed. The anchor must at least have one charge, and it must be in the Nether. A confirmation appears when the player's respawn location is set. Other players can also set their spawn point to the same respawn anchor. Each respawn uses up one charge, even if used by another player.\nUsing a charged anchor overrides any other spawn location the player might have had, as with a bed. The respawn anchor does not serve as a backup spawn point to a missing or obstructed bed.\nUpon death, the player respawns next to the anchor, consuming one of its charges. If a player's respawn anchor is destroyed, has no charges left, or if the area around it is made unsuitable for respawning, a message appears saying \"You have no home bed or charged Respawn Anchor, or it was obstructed\", and the player respawns at the world spawn point. Returning through an &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; is not counted as a respawn against the charges.\nA respawn anchor can be shared among several players. When shared, remaining charges are shared as well.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, the respawn anchor does not resurrect the player, but may still teleport them and consume charges.\nExploding.\nIf the player attempts to set their spawn at a charged respawn anchor in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"custom%20dimension\"&gt;custom dimension&lt;/a&gt;s in which they are disabled, the block &lt;a href=\"explode\"&gt;explode&lt;/a&gt;s (and is destroyed) similar to when a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt; is used in the Nether or the End. The explosion has a power of 5 and sets fire to surrounding blocks.\nRedstone component.\nWhen charged, a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; gives a signal depending on the number of charges: 3 for one charge, 7 for two charges, 11 for three charges, 15 for four charges. An empty anchor gives a signal of 0.\nThe respawn anchor can also be charged with a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe respawn anchor cannot be pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;. \nMobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Hoglin\"&gt;Hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s run away from respawn anchors.\nNote blocks.\nRespawn anchors can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce the \"bass drum\" sound."}

The &lt;a href=\"Water%23Slower%20mining%20speed\"&gt;slower mining speed&lt;/a&gt; when underwater, however, still applies to players inside bubble columns. Water-breathing mobs avoid bubble columns because they suffocate if trapped in one. A bubble column is destroyed when moved by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;. Bubble columns propagate only through water source blocks, stopping at any flowing water or &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; block. The height of a bubble column is limited only by the water's surface or by any obstructing blocks underwater.\nBubble columns cannot be created in downward flowing water. This can be circumvented by placing &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; in downward-flowing water, which converts it into a source block.\nWhirlpool.\nA whirlpool, or downward bubble column, is the only type that naturally generates in the Overworld, often originating from &lt;a href=\"magma\"&gt;magma&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of underwater &lt;a href=\"canyon\"&gt;canyon&lt;/a&gt;s. A whirlpool can be identified by the presence of air bubbles wandering downward. They drag &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; downward. A &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; ridden over a whirlpool shakes and eventually sinks if kept above the whirlpool for too long.\nUpward.\nUpward bubble columns can be identified by the presence of vertically rising air bubbles. An upward bubble column accelerates entities upward; it is impossible to swim downward in one. The longer an object rises through the bubble column, the faster it travels. At high enough speeds, players and entities can be launched out of water by several blocks. Sitting on the surface above a rising bubble column causes entities to bounce upward repeatedly by about 1 block.\nTransport.\nIn , entities move at a speed of approximately 11 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 4.9 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.\nIn , entities move at a speed of approximately 8 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 6 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.\nEnder pearl stasis chamber.\nProjectiles such as &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearl&lt;/a&gt;s are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are."}

It can also speed up the growth of a baby axolotl.\nBucket of axolotl.\n, if an &lt;a href=\"axolotl\"&gt;axolotl&lt;/a&gt; is picked up with a bucket, the bucket appears in the player's inventory as \"Bucket of &lt;Baby/Adult&gt; &lt;Color&gt; Axolotl\" based on the age and color of the axolotl. These varieties are:\nWhen the player spawns in an axolotl with a bucket of axolotl from the &lt;a href=\"creative\"&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, it is always a leucistic adult. Buckets containing other variants will always spawn that variant when used in creative mode.\nThe bucket of axolotl does not change textures in the inventory to reflect the captured axolotl's color, it always appears leucistic.\nBucket of tadpole.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"tadpole\"&gt;tadpole&lt;/a&gt; is picked up with a bucket, the bucket appears in the player's inventory as \"Bucket of tadpole\". The bucket can be emptied again like any other bucket of aquatic mob, depositing the tadpole and water on the targeted location.\nThe water in the bucket of tadpole appears green, unlike the other buckets of aquatic mobs, in which water appears blue.\nData values.\nItem data.\nNormal buckets of fish use only the BucketVariantTag tag to store the variant of any tropical fish that is picked up, and the item's &lt;a href=\"Player.dat%20format%23Display%20Properties\"&gt;display name&lt;/a&gt; to store the fish's custom name."}

Items that stack to 16 occupy more space within the bundle, and items that do not stack occupy the entire bundle without allowing space for any other items.

This does not, however, increase the total capacity of the slot: each bundle has 64 \"bundle slots\" and each item placed in the bundle takes up these slots similar to how they take up space in a normal inventory slot: items that stack to 64 take up 1 bundle slot, items that stack to 16 (for example, &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;s) take up 4, and items that do not stack (such as tools/weapons/armors) take up the whole bundle, all 64 slots.\nAlthough bundles themselves cannot be stacked, a bundle can be placed inside another (nested): the inner bundle itself uses 4 slots plus the number of slots already occupied by the items in that bundle. \nTo place items inside a bundle, either (1) pick up the bundle in the inventory and right-click on the item(s) to be placed inside or (2) pick up the item(s) and right-click on the bundle. When placing bundles inside another bundle, the interface uses the first method: picking up Bundle A and right clicking on Bundle B attempts to store Bundle B inside A. \nBundles can be inside the inventory to take out the last item put in. In this way, items are accessible LIFO (last in, first out). When outside the inventory, it dumps all the items out into the world.\nHovering over the bundle shows its contained items in its inventory slots. The number of bundle slots used is displayed as \"&lt;fullness&gt;\"/64 in the tooltip. If the bundle is full, then the empty slots are greyed out with an .\n&lt;a href=\"Shulker%20box\"&gt;Shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es cannot be placed inside of bundles."}

Trying to pull it with a sticky piston does nothing. \nUsing a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; on the side of a cactus causes both the sign and the cactus to drop as items.\nNatural generation.\nCacti naturally occur in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s (twice more common in desert than in badlands).

The item created in this case will sometimes (though not always) be destroyed by the cactus. The conversion to an item applies even when the falling block is a cactus (which is possible with ).\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; hits a cactus block, the minecart drops as an item and is often destroyed, although a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt; can pick it up faster.\nA cactus can also be placed in a &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;, where it is rendered harmless.\nA cactus (excluding its spikes) is of a block in width (the same as &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s) and a full block in height, however the &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block\"&gt;collision box&lt;/a&gt; is of a block high.\nFarming.\nCacti naturally grow to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top cactus block has received 16 random &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (i.e. on average every 18 minutes, but the actual rate can vary widely). &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; does not work on cacti to speed their growth. A cactus does not need &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; to grow and is non-flammable. If a cactus has space directly above it, it grows even if the newly-grown block would immediately break due to adjacent blocks.\nBreeding.\nCacti can be used to breed &lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;s and reduce the remaining growth duration of baby camels by 10%. Camels also follow a player holding a cactus.\nComposting.\nPlacing a cactus into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1."}

A camel is tall enough that its riders cannot be reached from the ground by a few melee-attacking harmful mobs, who do not attack the camel.\nSpawning.\nA camel spawns in the center of each &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; village during &lt;a href=\"Seed%23Level%20generation\"&gt;world generation&lt;/a&gt;. They do not respawn if they are killed.\nDrops.\n &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs drop when camels are killed by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;. A saddle is dropped if the camel was already equipped with one. Upon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped. Killing a baby camel yields neither items nor experience.\nBehavior.\nA camel wanders aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles or it sits for two to seven seconds, before eventually getting up. Camels immediately get up and flee after being harmed. A seated camel cannot be pushed by players or mobs. Sitting camels do not stand up if there are solid blocks above them, as doing so would cause them to take &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocation&lt;/a&gt; damage immediately after.\nCamels are healed by health points each time they are fed a cactus. Camels also heal on their own over time slowly.\nDespite the fact they are bred with cacti, touching a cactus block still harms camels like any other mob.\nCamels have the unique ability to step up 1.5 block-high walls, unlike other mounts such as &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, which can automatically step up one block without jumping. This allows camels to step onto fences and walls, among other things.\nRiding.\nCamels can be ridden by players. Up to two players can ride one camel. While riding, the player in the back seat cannot hurt the player driving or the camel itself.\nCamels have one slot in their inventory, to put a &lt;a href=\"Saddle\"&gt;Saddle&lt;/a&gt; on it. A saddle can be placed on a camel by holding it and then it on the camel, or by accessing its inventory. A camel's inventory can be accessed by mounting the camel and using control, or by and then or pressing the \"open inventory\" button on the camel.\nOnce a camel is saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, , and the mouse. The player dismounts using the control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; while on a camel.\nCamels cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 3 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\nCamels walk slowly and can &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;. Saddled camels also have the ability of \"dashing charging\". When the player rides them, the experience bar on &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; is replaced by a dash charging bar. Dashing is done using the jump control, and holding the control charges for a longer dashing. Camels can dash every 2.75 seconds. When dashing, the camel launches up to 12 blocks forward and one block upward. For a short time after dashing, the camel cannot sprint. \nCamels are tall enough that most melee hostile mobs such as &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sword\"&gt;golden sword&lt;/a&gt;-wielding &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s cannot reach players to attack them. &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s can attack because they jump or climb while attacking. Most mobs never deliberately attack camels under any circumstance, even to reach players riding one; the only exceptions are mobs that attack all other mobs, these being &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s and vindicators named \"Johnny\".\nBreeding.\nA camel follows the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; who holds a &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; but stops following the player if it is separated from the player by at least 10 blocks / 16 blocks. Sitting camels do not follow the player. Adult camels enter love mode and &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; to create baby camels after they are each given a cactus. The parents have a cooldown of five minutes before they can breed again. The growth time that baby camels take to be an adult camel can be reduced by giving the baby camel cactus.\nSounds.\nCamels use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nCamels have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

{"id": "101317", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=101317", "title": "Campfire", "text": "A campfire is a block that can be used to cook &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, pacify &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s, act as a spread-proof &lt;a href=\"light%20source\"&gt;light source&lt;/a&gt;, smoke signal or damaging trap block.\nA soul campfire is a dimmer variant of the campfire with turquoise flames. Soul campfires deal more damage than normal campfires.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nCampfires can be mined with any tool, or without a tool, but &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s are the fastest. A regular campfire drops 2 or 4 &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;, a soul campfire drops &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;, and either one also drops any items placed on it. If mined with a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the campfire instead drops itself as an item.\n, either kind of campfire can also be broken by pushing it with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;. Pistons cannot move or break campfires .\nNatural generation.\nCampfires can generate in and &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCampfires also generate in camps inside &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;, beneath a pile of blue, light blue and cyan &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nTrading.\n, apprentice-level fisherman &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s have a 50% chance of selling a campfire for 5 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\n, apprentice-level fisherman villagers have a chance of selling a campfire for 2 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nLit campfires emit a light level of 15 and lit soul campfires emit a light level of 10. Unlike &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, campfires do not spread under any circumstances.\nCampfires are lit by default when placed. Campfires can be manually lit by or &lt;a href=\"Dispenser\"&gt;dispensing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; on them, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when is true. , campfires can also be lit by an item enchanted with &lt;a href=\"fire%20aspect\"&gt;fire aspect&lt;/a&gt;, or stepping on it while burning. \nCampfires can be extinguished by &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogging&lt;/a&gt; it (placing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in the same block space), throwing a &lt;a href=\"splash%20water%20bottle\"&gt;splash water bottle&lt;/a&gt; on it, or a &lt;a href=\"shovel\"&gt;shovel&lt;/a&gt; on it. , campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire. As with &lt;a href=\"torches\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, rain does not extinguish campfires.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; on the side of a waterlogged or lit campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead.\nAny items cooking on a campfire always drop when the campfire block is broken.\nParticles and smoke signals.\nCampfires produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing. If a &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt; is placed below, the campfire becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead.\nCampfire smoke particles can partially pass through a block directly above it, but do not pass through blocks more than one block directly above it.\nAlthough a trap door is thinner than a slab, a trap door can block the smoke completely, preventing the smoke from floating up.\nCampfires emit extra smoke particles during rain, similar to &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;.\nCampfires also emit occasional ember particles, similar to lava. Soul campfires, however, do not emit embers.\nDamage.\nCampfires damage &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s standing on top of them even if underwater (with exceptions such as &lt;a href=\"shulker\"&gt;shulker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s), but only if lit. Campfires deal and soul campfires deal of damage every tick (although &lt;a href=\"damage%20immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt; reduces this to once every half-second) Campfires do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Damage taken is considered &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Fire\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt; and is reduced by &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; (which loses &lt;a href=\"Item%20durability%23Armor%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; potion effects, and the &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantments. The player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a &lt;a href=\"potion%20of%20fire%20resistance\"&gt;potion of fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; or wearing &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt; boots.\nRegardless of &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;height&lt;/a&gt;, all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above campfires. The campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.\nCooking.\nThe player can place on a lit campfire by the food item on it. Up to four food items can be placed on a single campfire, which cooks the items simultaneously. Unlike other blocks that can cook food, campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook. On a campfire, foods produce small smoke particles, indicating they are being cooked. Food items take 30 seconds (600 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s) to cook, compared to 10 seconds for &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s or 5 seconds for &lt;a href=\"smoker\"&gt;smoker&lt;/a&gt;s. Assuming that one uses all four slots to cook at once, the Campfire is, therefore, more efficient than furnaces (taking 10 seconds less per four items and no fuel) for cooking, but must be watched so as to pick up the food and refill it once it is done. It is slower than a smoker by about ten seconds, but its lack of fuel consumption could be seen as a worthwhile trade-off. Once finished cooking, items pop off the campfire. If the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, it resets as if it had not been cooked at all. Food items can be placed on an unlit campfire. \nOther items can be placed on campfires using external editors, mods or add-ons.\nHoppers.\nCampfires do not have an &lt;a href=\"Inventory%23External%20inventories\"&gt;external inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Raw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a &lt;a href=\"hopper\"&gt;hopper&lt;/a&gt;.\nA hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls through any items dropped into the campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the campfire get pulled into the hopper.\nBees.\nPlacing a campfire under a &lt;a href=\"beehive\"&gt;beehive&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; allows players to harvest &lt;a href=\"honey%20bottle\"&gt;honey bottle&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"honeycomb\"&gt;honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; without provoking the &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere must be unobstructed air between the campfire and the beehive or bee nest. &lt;a href=\"Carpet\"&gt;Carpet&lt;/a&gt;s are an exception.\nPiglins.\nLit soul campfires repel &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s that are not currently attacking. This occurs when the &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt; is within an 8 block radius of the soul campfire.\nLight source.\nStandard lit campfires emit a light level of 15, while soul campfires emit a light level of 10. Like most other sources of light, campfires melt nearby &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their lower light level, soul campfires do not melt snow or ice.\nNote blocks.\nCampfires can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sounds.\nConverting soul sand to soul soil.\nSoul campfires can be used to convert &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;. If a soul campfire is crafted using soul sand, placed, and then broken without &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;, that soul campfire drops soul soil.\nPiston interactivity.\n, pushing a campfire or soul campfire with a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt; breaks it. Unlike other methods, breaking with a piston drops only one &lt;a href=\"charcoal\"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt; instead of two. Campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.\n, pistons do not interact with campfires. Campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA campfire has a &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; associated with it that holds additional data about the &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;."}

Ravines often appear deep underground but can breach the surface.\nStructure.\nCanyons are usually between 85 to 127 blocks in length, and typically less than 15 blocks wide. canyons are usually 27 to 62 blocks in depth. Canyons can sometimes go all the way down to &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, causing canyons spawning in mountainous biomes to appear deeper.\nA canyon extending down to bedrock causes &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; to generate at the bottom. &lt;a href=\"Obsidian\"&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; often forms at the bottom as &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; sources flow down into the lava.\nCanyons can have small ledges along the top.

However, unlike skins, players cannot create custom capes or transfer any owned capes to a different account. When equipped, they also change the appearance of worn &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;. Capes are purely decorational, and do not alter the wearers' capabilities in any way.\nThere are various &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Mods/OptiFine\"&gt;Optifine&lt;/a&gt;, that allow players to obtain capes, some even allowing for any custom design to be used. These capes are however \"not\" official and only visible to the player using the mod (or, in some cases, other users of that mod). Only official capes, that can be seen by everyone, are listed in this article.\nObtaining.\n\"Java Edition\".\nThe only capes that can be obtained on one's own, so far, in are the migrator cape, which comes from migrating a \"Mojang\" account to a \"Microsoft\" account, and the vanilla cape, which comes from owning both and in the same \"Microsoft\" account prior to June 6, 2022. The rest cannot be obtained by players through any in-game means and are therefore considerably rarer.\n&lt;a href=\"MINECON\"&gt;MINECON&lt;/a&gt; capes before &lt;a href=\"Minecon%20Earth%202017\"&gt;Minecon Earth 2017&lt;/a&gt; were obtained by attending or buying a ticket to the year's MINECON. Minecraft events from 2017 and onward are done via a livestream available to everyone and no capes are given out anymore. On May 12, 2020, Mojang disabled all unused &lt;a href=\"MINECON\"&gt;MINECON&lt;/a&gt; cape links used to obtain the capes of years 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. Only a few thousand players around the world have a MINECON cape.\nOther less common types of capes have manually been given out by Mojang to select few members of the community throughout the years. Some of the people who have those capes include Mojang staff themselves, volunteers in various programs as well as individuals whose impact was recognized by Mojang. Only a few hundred players around the world have such a cape, with some capes being owned by a single individual only.\nPlayers of can equip or unequip certain capes for their skin via the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;\"Minecraft Launcher\"&lt;/a&gt; or their &lt;a href=\"http%3A//minecraft.net/profile\"&gt;Minecraft profile&lt;/a&gt;.\nBedrock Edition.\nUnlike , in , capes are much more common items with skins from various &lt;a href=\"skin%20pack\"&gt;skin pack&lt;/a&gt;s having capes integrated to them. One skin pack made available to every player is the &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202016\"&gt;MINECON 2016&lt;/a&gt; skin pack that contains all five &lt;a href=\"MINECON\"&gt;MINECON&lt;/a&gt; cape designs from up to 2016. A cape celebrating &lt;a href=\"Minecon%20Live%202019\"&gt;Minecon Live 2019&lt;/a&gt; was available in to promote the &lt;a href=\"character%20creator\"&gt;character creator&lt;/a&gt;, though it was obtainable by everyone regardless of whether they watched the event or not. Another cape made available to every player is the pan cape. Players who owned both and on the same Microsoft account prior to June 6, 2022, were also given the vanilla cape.

Jungle trees range from short bushes to tall trees that reach up to 31 blocks in height. Their wood is of a pale brownish color.\nVariants.\nRegular jungle trees lack branches, and the trunk covers a 1\u00d71 space on the ground. The &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; of these 1\u00d71 trees are arranged the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Birch%23Leaf%20arrangement\"&gt;birch tree leaf arrangement&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiant jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally to the trunk or other branches). Most of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and six &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;s. The trunk typically covers a 2\u00d72 space on the ground.\nThere are also much smaller, bush-type variants, which have only 1\u20132 logs and a few leaves. They are typically 1\u20133 layers tall and cover the floor of jungle biomes. , they consist of oak leaves and a jungle log, while , they consist of jungle leaves and a jungle log.\nGeneration.\nThe jungle tree variants generate naturally in the indicated biomes:\nA large jungle tree always generates with &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nBlocks and items.\nThese items can be obtained from all variants of jungle tree, except that saplings cannot be obtained from a bush:\nWhen jungle tree leaves decay or are destroyed, a jungle sapling drops 2.5% () of the time \u2013 half the chance of other tree leaves.\nPlanting.\nJungle tree &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s can be planted on:\nWhen planted in grass or dirt, a jungle sapling grows into a jungle tree with a 1\u00d71 trunk, but the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can place saplings in a 2\u00d72 formation and they grow into a jungle tree with the 2\u00d72 trunk found naturally in the jungle biome.\n1\u00d71 jungle trees require a 3\u00d73 column of unobstructed space at least 5 blocks above the sapling to grow (6 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, 1\u00d71 jungle trees require 5\u00d75 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep still grows).\nIn order to grow a 2\u00d72 jungle tree, four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used on any of the saplings to accelerate growth.\n2\u00d72 jungle trees require a 5\u00d75 column of unobstructed space at least 11 blocks above the saplings to grow (12 blocks including the saplings themselves). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. A 3\u00d73 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings). They can grow up to 32 blocks high.\nIf planted by the player, 1\u00d71 jungle trees do not generate with vines, while 2\u00d72 jungle trees do. 2x2 jungle trees cannot grow side by side because the vines break the space clearance requirement.\nOther variant jungle trees.\n, trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.\nDying trees.\nA dying jungle tree has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, although all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;.\nFallen jungle trees.\nA fallen jungle tree may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1\u20132 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.\nA fallen jungle tree has a log length of 4\u201311 blocks. Vines cover 75% of the stump.\nFoliage colors.\nDepending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, a jungle tree's leaves are normally bright deep green in the jungle, but they have a beige tint in badlands biomes.\nLeaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side."}

Each chunk has chance to generate a &lt;a href=\"vegetation\"&gt;vegetation&lt;/a&gt; of kelp.\nBreaking.\nKelp can be mined instantly with any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; or with the player's fist. Removing water from the kelp block destroys the kelp. Breaking one part of a kelp stalk destroys all kelp &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s above it. Each block drops a kelp &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrading.\nKelp can be bought from &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s for 3 emeralds.\nUsage.\nKelp can be placed underwater by hand, or anywhere by the use of &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; such as . Placing it by hand gives it a random value between 0 and 24. Kelp can be placed only in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; source blocks or downward-flowing water, not horizontally flowing water.\nWhen placed in downward-flowing water, the flowing water transforms into a water source block, which is useful for faster &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt; elevator creation.\nAny building block can be placed on top of a kelp plant, which is useful for building structures over a deep ocean without needing to build from the ocean floor (see also &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;).\nComposting.\nPlacing kelp into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nGrowth mechanics.\nKelp can be planted on a broad variety of blocks. It grows underwater if it has either a source block of water or, , flowing water above it. Neither &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s nor &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s can remove the water source block that kelp grows in without breaking the kelp first.\nKelp does not require any &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level to grow. Kelp also grows without having &lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt; access. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used to grow kelp by 1 block on each use.\nKelp, when planted, is generated with a randomly chosen age value, which can be checked when pressing &lt;a href=\"Debug%20screen\"&gt;F3&lt;/a&gt;. The age value of a newly planted kelp plant varies randomly from 0 to 24. Each time the kelp grows in height by one block, the newly generated top of the kelp plant increases its age by 1. When the top block of the kelp plant reaches an age of 25, it stops growing. This means that kelp can naturally grow to a height between 2 (if the first kelp plant had an age of 24) and 26 blocks (if the first kelp plant had an age of 0). \nWhen a kelp plant block is broken, the age of the kelp plant block underneath is randomized to a value from 0 to 24 and the kelp continues growing until it reaches age 25. It is possible to use this mechanic to cultivate a kelp plant to increase its growth height beyond its natural maximum height of 26 blocks. This can be done by breaking the top-most block of the kelp plant each time it reaches age 25. A kelp plant cultivated by a player in this way repeatedly grows until it reaches the water surface.\nEach time it receives a &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;, kelp has a 14% chance of growing.\nIf &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt; are used on the topmost block of kelp, that block automatically sets its value to and stop growing.\nFarming.\nKelp farming is similar to farming &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;, although kelp must be placed underwater. Automation of harvest is easier because items float up in water."}

Damaged players start receiving less knockback while they are in the air. \nOn a combat situation where two players are moving, the horizontal knockback received is multiplied by 0.6 (reduced by 40%) if the attacker send an attack packet and is moving forward.

Currently, 92 sets have been released.\nThere have been four main types of sets - the \"Micro World\" sets, each made up of four modules which are each 6\u00d76 studs in size, the normal LEGO minifigure scale sets, the \"Big Fig\" sets, each consisting of two brick-built mobs at a scale of approximately two pixels per stud, and the \"Brickheadz\" sets, smaller, more stylized and less poseable brick-built figures. Currently only the minifigure-scale sets are in production.\nOne \"Minecraft\" block is represented as a 2\u00d72 brick with a tile on top. LEGO states that this is not a perfect cube, but it is \"the best approximation at the chosen scale.\"\nSet information.\nThe original \"Micro World\" set centers around the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; (Steve) and one of the game's antagonists, a &lt;a href=\"creeper\"&gt;creeper&lt;/a&gt;. The scene is depicted in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and depicts a few biomes, including a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Village\" features structures in the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;. It includes blocks for constructing houses, along with the Pig, Villager, and Zombie figures. \"The Nether\" is a stylized depiction of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and contains a lava sea, a lava stream flowing down a hill, a &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Portal\"&gt;Nether Portal&lt;/a&gt; to connect to the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes two Ghasts and a Zombie Pigman. \"The End\" is a stylised depiction of &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, and contains the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, six &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20pillars\"&gt;obsidian pillars&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"ender%20crystal\"&gt;ender crystal&lt;/a&gt;s on top of them, an &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%23Exit%20portal\"&gt;exit end portal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe normal LEGO \"Minecraft\" sets each feature different parts of \"Minecraft\". All the sets include Steve, Alex, or another player skin, and at least one mob. For example, \"The Cave\" features a cave in \"Minecraft\" with different ores and mobs, \"The Farm\" features a normal crop farm with one cow and one sheep and a skeleton, and \"The First Night\" features a basic house in \"Minecraft\" and a farm with a &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Creeper\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt;. All sets follow this theme of representing a specific natural or player-made location meant to approximate something a player might build or encounter, featuring decor and mobs appropriate for that environment.\nCurrent LEGO \"Minecraft\" sets can be purchased through the websites Jinx and Lego.com.\nVideos.\nOriginal URL:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgNJ6tPi1tk\nHistory.\nWhen asked about LEGO \"Minecraft\"'s beginnings, Mojang chief executive officer &lt;a href=\"Carl%20Manneh\"&gt;Carl Manneh&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"it was one of the first things we talked about when we started Mojang.\"\nIn December 2011, &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; started a project on the LEGO Ideas program (then known as \"LEGO Cuusoo\"), which requires 10,000 signatures for a project to be approved. With the strong support of the \"Minecraft\" community, the 10,000 signature objective was achieved in under three days, and the development of the LEGO \"Minecraft\" set commenced after LEGO reviewed the project. &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; promised to donate 1% of the proceeds to charity. The first set was subsequently released on June 1, 2012.\nThe second and third sets, \"The Village\" and \"The Nether\", were announced at Comic-Con 2013. The fourth set, \"The End\", was announced through a teaser on March 8, followed by a reveal on March 14 on the LEGO \"Minecraft\" Facebook page.\nOn 2 November 2013, during &lt;a href=\"MINECON\"&gt;MINECON&lt;/a&gt;, it was announced that The LEGO Group would be creating a fully fledged minifigure-scale theme, and that they would be seeking feedback from \"Minecraft\" players on designing these sets. This was the first time that LEGO would work together with fans to create a new series of sets. This initiative was referred to as the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUCmJemgGGwI\"&gt;co-build project&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first six of these minifigure-scale sets were released on 1 November 2014. These were the first sets that did not follow the \"Micro World\" design of the previous sets. Another four sets were unveiled at the 2015 London Toy Fair. These sets were released on 1 August 2015. Subsequent sets have continued to be released up until the present.\nMagazine.\nAn official LEGO \"Minecraft\" magazine is available in several European countries, each issue of which contains a small promotional polybag set."}

The type of the block (solid, opaque, transparent, etc... given the block has top/bottom solid surface) does not affect the ability to hang of a lantern, similar to torches.

If the latter is used and both the support/ceiling block is presented:\nThis is only true if the eye level of the player is perpendicular to the targeted air block onto an adjacent block's surface. A solid block that is adjacent to the targeted air block generates two values, or \"areas\" on the solid block itself atop of each other that decide which placement position is used for the lantern based on which area the crosshair is aimed at, changing dynamically when the angle created by the block surface and the player's LoS line is deviated. This means that if the player is looking up at a block, hanging is prioritized; and looking down causes placing to be prioritized.\nWhen the adjacent ceiling/surface of the targeted air block is blocked from view, the game will prioritize the placement position on the other visible surface/ceiling completely (e.g. the lantern is placed on the ceiling if the surface is not visible due to the player standing lower than the block). This is true only if the solid block whose ceiling/surface was mentioned is blocking the surfaces itself and does not taking into account other objects that might obstruct the placement of the lantern.\nIf the object the lantern is placed on receive a block update that does not support the placement of the lantern, it is removed and drop as an item (e.g. lantern on a trapdoor and the trapdoor is flipped)."}

Lava does not replace air blocks inside &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monster%20room\"&gt;monster room&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20geode\"&gt;amethyst geode&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLava can also occur as lava flows from a single &lt;a href=\"spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; block, pouring down walls into pools. The spring block can be on the side of a cave, ravine, mineshaft, or stone cliff above ground.\nLava also generates as small &lt;a href=\"lava%20lake\"&gt;lava lake&lt;/a&gt;s, which can be found above Y=0 within any &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo blocks of lava can also be found in plains, snowy plains, and desert &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; weaponsmith buildings, or one source in savanna village weaponsmith buildings.\nFifteen blocks of lava can be found in the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt; room of a &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;: 3 along each side wall, and 9 below the portal frame.\nLava also generates in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s: two blocks of lava generate in the \"blacksmith room\", and 25 blocks of lava generate in a secret \"lava room\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, lava is more common than &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Terrain%20features%23Lava%20sea\"&gt;Seas of lava&lt;/a&gt; occur, with sea level at y-level 32, about a quarter of the total height of the Nether (as the usable space in the Nether is 128 blocks tall). They can extend down to about y-level 19-22. Lava also randomly appears &lt;a href=\"Spring%23Hidden%20lava\"&gt;in single blocks&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; formations. Lava is also generated as a single source in well rooms in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es. There are also large pockets of lava generated under y-19 and can reach all the way down to bedrock level. These pockets are generally over 12 blocks in height and often connect to a large lava lake on y-32; the size of these pockets in 1.18 can range from the size of a singular pre-1.18 ravine to multiple ravines combined.\nLava generates as &lt;a href=\"delta\"&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt; shapes, which can be found commonly in the &lt;a href=\"basalt%20deltas\"&gt;basalt deltas&lt;/a&gt; biome. Lava also generates in &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPost-generation.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Water%23Source%20blocks\"&gt;water source blocks&lt;/a&gt;, new lava source blocks cannot be created in a space by two or more adjacent source blocks. However , if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to , new lava source blocks can form in a similar way to water source blocks.\nIf there is a lava source above the &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; stalactite, there is a 15\u2044256 (~5.9%) chance for it to completely fill an empty cauldron within 10 blocks under the tip with lava after a &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;. This lava can then be scooped with a bucket, making it a renewable resource.\nUsage.\nFuel.\nWhen used in a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;, a bucket of lava lasts 1000 seconds (100 items). Note that when used as fuel, a bucket of lava turns into a normal bucket.\nBurning.\nMost &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; take damage every half-second while in contact with lava, and are set on &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. An entity/player in lava will also have its set to 300, setting it on fire for 15 seconds. This timer is reset to 300 every tick that the victim spends in lava, so it will only start counting down once the victim leaves the lava. Once the victim does exit the lava source, it will burn for just under 15 seconds, taking fire damage 14 times. This is due to the fact that for the first tick outside of lava, its decrease to 299, and entities take fire damage when is a multiple of 20 and greater than 0. If the victim touches water or &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; falls on it, the fire is extinguished, but the lava continues to damage them directly.\nIn addition, a dense &lt;a href=\"fog\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt; effect will be applied for players under lava to obscure vision. This can be slightly mitigated via the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nAn entity/player moving in lava has their horizontal movement speed reduced by 50% and their vertical movement speed reduced by 20%.\n, a player with the Fire Resistance effect or a total &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt; of 7 or higher does not catch fire. \n&lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, Nether &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (excluding &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s), &lt;a href=\"Wither\"&gt;withers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;wardens&lt;/a&gt;, and players or mobs affected by the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect are not damaged when touching lava. \nThe embers or fireballs that fly out of lava are purely decorative and do not cause fires or damage to entities. When rain falls on lava, the black ember particles appear more frequently.\nA player in lava lasts a few seconds before dying:\nBedrock Edition.\nIf the player is wearing armor enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection&lt;/a&gt;, they can last even longer. With the maximum bonus, the damage is small enough that the natural healing from a full hunger bar can outpace it , so a player could survive indefinitely as long as they have food and their armor holds up (non-netherite armor is damaged by lava). This maximum bonus can be obtained by wearing 2 pieces of armor with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection IV&lt;/a&gt; and 1 with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection IV&lt;/a&gt;, or 1 piece of armor with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection\"&gt;Fire Protection IV&lt;/a&gt; and 3 with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection IV&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire spread.\nLava can cause fires by turning air blocks to fire blocks.\nIn order for air above lava to turn to fire, a block adjacent to the air has to be &lt;a href=\"Fire%23Burning%20blocks\"&gt;flammable&lt;/a&gt;, or one of the wood-constructed &lt;a href=\"Fire%23Non-flammable%20blocks\"&gt;non-flammable&lt;/a&gt; blocks. Since catching fire depends on air blocks, even torches or lava itself can prevent a flammable block from catching fire. Additionally, not all flammable or wood-constructed blocks can be ignited by lava.\nThe lava of any depth can start fires this way, whether or not it appears to have a current.\nAdditional conditions must be met, depending on the edition of Minecraft.\nJava Edition.\nAir block must be in a 3\u00d71\u00d73 area right above the lava or in a 5\u00d71\u00d75 2 blocks above the lava.\nNote that an air block in the 5x1x5 area will not catch on fire if the 3x1x3 area is completely filled, even if the latter is filled with flammable blocks.\nBedrock Edition.\nThe block to be set on fire must be in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube centered on a lava block, above which there must be either air or an ignitable block.\nFlow.\nLava flows from \"source blocks\". Most streams or \"lava-falls\" come from a single source block, but lava lakes (including the \"flood lava\" in the bottom 10 layers) are composed entirely of source blocks. A source block can be captured only with a &lt;a href=\"lava%20bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, lava travels 3 blocks in any horizontal direction from a source block. Lava flows far more slowly than water (1 block every 30 game ticks, or 1.5 seconds), and sourceless lava flows linger for a short time more. In &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, lava travels 7 blocks horizontally and spreads 1 block every 10 game ticks, or 2 blocks per second, which is half the speed as water in the Overworld. In all dimensions, lava spreading uses the same mechanic as water: for every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. (This can result in lava flows turning toward dropoffs that they cannot reach in the Overworld and the End.)\nFlowing lava destroys the following in its path: &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; on ground (but snow blocks are immune), &lt;a href=\"lily%20pad\"&gt;lily pad&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vines\"&gt;vines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;s, all three types of &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;repeaters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"end%20rod\"&gt;end rod&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20cane\"&gt;Sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s hold back lava, but disappear if the sugar cane's water source is destroyed by the lava. Lava also slows down entities, including those that are normally immune to lava damage.\nUsing redstone wire, a one-block lava flow can be redirected by supplying power to the source block, which causes it to reset the flow toward the now-nearest terrain depression. It cannot, however, be reversed. This re-calculation is made because of the redstone wire when toggled changes the block from redstone (on) to redstone (off). Whenever a block updates on any side of the lava, the lava re-calculates where to flow, but does not cut off its current direction of flow. In Bedrock Edition using the /setblock command can be used to create stationary lava without the use of barriers. \nFlowing lava can push entities.\nLava and water.\nWater and lava can produce &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; based on how they interact. Lava can also generate basalt when above soul soil and touching blue ice.\nLight source.\nLava blocks emit a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of 15.\nOther.\nLava above a non-transparent block (does \"not\" include stairs, fences, and slabs) produces dripping particles on the underside of that block. These droplets do not do anything other than warn the player that a deluge of lava lies above that block. The particles function identically to their water counterparts, except that they drip slower.\nFlowing lava can set off tripwires because it breaks placed string. Lava triggers a tripwire only once.\nAny &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; dropped into lava is immediately destroyed, except for &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt;-related items. &lt;a href=\"Lodestone\"&gt;Lodestones&lt;/a&gt;, however, can be destroyed by lava despite containing netherite.\nLava can be placed in an empty &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf lava is above a non-transparent block supporting &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt;, dripping particles are created on the end. These can fill cauldrons with lava.\nFarming.\nLava farms can be created by placing a lava source block on top of a solid block and a &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; underneath.\nData values.\nID.\nLava spends most of its time as stationary, rather than 'flowing' \u2013 regardless of its level, or whether it contains a current downward or to the side. When specifically triggered by a block update, lava changes to 'flowing', update its level, then change back to stationary. Lava springs are generated as flowing, and lava lakes are generated as stationary."}

When a trader llama is detached, either by killing it or the wandering trader, dragging them far apart, or putting the llama in a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;, the lead drops at the llama's position.\nUsage.\nLeashing mobs.\n a lead on a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; ties the lead to the mob, allowing it to be moved by the player. Multiple mobs can be held by leads at once, but each mob held requires its own lead.\nIt is possible to leash the following mobs and other entities:\nAdditionally, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"monster\"&gt;monster&lt;/a&gt;s other than the ones listed above, can be leashed using a map editor or &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; editor. \nWith a mob on a lead held by the player, the lead on any type of &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt;) attaches the lead to it with a visible knot, tying the mob to it. To attach it to a wall on Bedrock Edition, the player must hold a lead in the main hand. Multiple leads may be attached to one fence post. A mob tied to a fence tends to stay within 5 blocks of the fence post.\nA lead is broken by pressing the control on the mob again, hitting the knot, or removing the attached fence post. Leads also break when hit by projectiles. Whenever a lead is removed or broken, it drops as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; at the location of the mob. However, it does not drop when unleashed in Creative mode. A lead does not break if the attached animal dies.\nA lead can stretch a maximum of 10 blocks. If the mob is able to move towards the player or fence post, it does so. If not, or if the mob is moving very quickly away from the player, the lead breaks.\nWhen the player or the knot is more than 7 blocks above the ground, the mob being leashed becomes suspended.\nMost mobs that can be leashed can still be leashed even if attacking the player leashing them, and any attached leads do not break.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; cannot be leashed after becoming angry. Despite this, if they become angry while already leashed, the lead does not break, but it cannot be reattached when broken through other methods while the wolf is still angry.\nA lead attached to a hoglin breaks if it becomes a &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;.\nA lead does not prevent mobs from despawning if they normally would despawn.\nWhen moving downwards and accelerating towards the ground, leashed mobs accumulate fall damage and take it if they hit the ground while still accelerating. When moving up or decelerating (such as when the lead is stretched to its limit), the fall distance is set to one block and the mob therefore does not take any fall damage if it touches the ground.\nIf the player walks into and back out of a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; while holding a lead connected to a mob, the lead remains attached to the mob. However, if a mob attached to a lead walks into a nether portal, the lead breaks and drops as an item in the other dimension.\nA lead can be used to remove a mob from a boat without needing to break the boat, if the mob can normally be leashed.\nIf a chunk unloads while containing a leashed mob (either by the player walking too far away, or traveling to another dimension via a portal), the lead breaks and drops as an item, leaving the mob free to wander around.\nLeash Knot.\nLeash knot is an entity created when the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; right-clicks the fence while having a mob leashed.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nLeash knots have entity data that define various properties of the entity."}

Specially, oak leaves are generate in &lt;a href=\"jungle%20bush\"&gt;jungle bush&lt;/a&gt;es. Oak leaves also generate in the tree at meeting point in plains &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;. Dark oak leaves also generate in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPost-generation.\nLeaves generate as part of trees grown from &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"azalea\"&gt;azalea&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nLeaves from trees spontaneously decay (disappear) when they receive a &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Random%20tick\"&gt;block tick&lt;/a&gt; if they are not connected to a block with the codice_1 tag (&lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt; block), either directly or via other leaf blocks, with a maximum distance of 6 blocks or 4 blocks. Leaves placed by players never decay.\nLeaves that decay, or are destroyed without using &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shears\"&gt;shears&lt;/a&gt;, yield &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s 5% () of the time, sticks 2% of the time, and otherwise drop nothing. Jungle leaves drop saplings 2.5% () of the time. Oak and dark oak leaves also have a separate but additional 0.5% () chance of dropping an &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;, making it extremely rare but possible for a single leaf to drop a sapling, a stick and an apple at the same time. Rates are increased by the &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Leaves that are burned do not yield saplings or apples.\nLeaves take on a different shade of green depending on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; in which they are placed.\nLeaves are always &lt;a href=\"transparent\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, but cannot be seen through when the &lt;a href=\"Options%23Video%20Settings\"&gt;graphics mode&lt;/a&gt; is set to \"Fast\"; the transparent regions are instead black/dark green. They diffuse sky light, causing the shadows they cast under trees.\nLeaves can be &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;, despite being a full block. Water does not spread out and waterlogged leaves follow the same rules as any other &lt;a href=\"Waterlogging%23Mechanism\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt; block.

They only stare at the lectern from less than a block away as \"working\".\nHolding books.\nLecterns can also hold a single &lt;a href=\"book%20and%20quill\"&gt;book and quill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Written%20Book\"&gt;written book&lt;/a&gt; that other players can read at the same time. Right-clicking an empty one with a book and quill or written book places it. Right-clicking a lectern with a book already occupied opens an interface to read the book. Books occupying a lectern can be retrieved through the interface, punching the lectern or by destroying the lectern, even when codice_1 is false.\nLecterns cannot hold &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Book\"&gt;enchanted books&lt;/a&gt; or normal &lt;a href=\"Book\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, right clicking the lectern with an enchanted book or a normal book does nothing and the book won't be placed.\nChanging profession.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; has a lectern that has not been claimed by a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, any villager has a chance to change their profession into &lt;a href=\"librarian\"&gt;librarian&lt;/a&gt; if that villager has not already chosen a &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block.\nRedstone signal.\nLecterns holding a book emit a full-strength redstone pulse that is one game &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; long (0.5 redstone ticks) when a page is turned. A &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; also records book reading and sends a signal, depending on what page the player is currently on. Because displays two pages of the book at once, the same signal strength increments require double the number of pages.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;\"Java Edition\"&lt;/a&gt; a book with only 1 page gives maximum signal strength, however page 1 always gives 1 signal strength if the book contains at least 2 pages.\nDue to this, to calculate the signal strength formula_1 of books with more than 1 page, use the following formula: \nformula_2\nWhere formula_3 is the \"floor\" operation (round down), formula_4 is the maximum number of pages the book on the lectern has, and formula_5 is the current page number the lectern is turned to.\nThis is most noticeable when a book has 2 pages where the signal strength is either 1 on page 1 or 15 on page 2.\nA book that would step up or down in increments of 1 per page would be 15 pages long.\nFor the formula is slightly different. Due to Bedrock Edition showing 2 pages at once and counting a change to the book's output only if the highest even numbered page contains information, a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; treats books with 3 pages the same as those with 1 or 2 pages of information, the same as how \"Java Edition\" would treat a book with just 1 page.\nFor 4 or more pages of information use the following formula to calculate signal strength.\nformula_6\nIn this case formula_7 is half of the maximum page number rounded down, and formula_8 is half of the current highest page number containing data displayed on the book interface, rounded down.\nRounding down is required to eliminate the discrepancy caused by books containing an odd number of pages. For example, a book with 8 pages gives a signal strength of 15 when looking at pages 7-8. A book with 9 pages has a signal strength of 15 when looking at either pages 7-8 and 9-10.\nIn , a book that steps up or down in increments of 1 per page turned must be exactly 30 pages long, with information left on page 30.\nFuel.\nLecterns can be used as fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnaces\"&gt;furnaces&lt;/a&gt; to smelt 1.5 items.\nNote Blocks.\nLecterns can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass\" sound.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA lectern has a &lt;a href=\"block%20entity\"&gt;block entity&lt;/a&gt; associated with it that holds additional data about the &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;."}

It comprises of:\nLegacy Console Edition introduced new features such as a simplified &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; system, in-game &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20tutorial\"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, leaderboards, built-in &lt;a href=\"mini%20games\"&gt;mini games&lt;/a&gt; and split-screen &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;,[\"except \"] as well as online multiplayer for up to 4/8[\"&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203%20Edition\"&gt;PS3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt; only\"]/16 players, which required the console's paid online multiplayer subscription service.[\"except \"] As with all editions, updates were free of charge.\nPreviously, the simpler term \"Console Edition\" was used to refer to these editions on this wiki, but with the release of the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;, three of the platforms received an implementation of Bedrock Edition as well. Since it no longer comprised all implementations for all consoles, the term was amended.\nOn September 20, 2017, the \"Xbox One Edition\" was withdrawn from the Microsoft Store, in conjunction with 's &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;. People who owned it were entitled to download the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; of \"Minecraft\" for free. Worlds and DLC were intended to be transferable to &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, however some DLC does not carry over. Users can also continue to play on the \"&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox One Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" instead. This also happened with the \"&lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" on June 21, 2018, and \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" on December 10, 2019. Again, some DLC does not transfer on these platforms. \nInitially, \"Xbox One Edition\" was planned to no longer receive updates, starting with the lack of an equivalent update to &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20version%20history%23xbox-TU58\"&gt;TU58&lt;/a&gt;, but the edition later received &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20version%20history%23xbone-CU50\"&gt;CU50&lt;/a&gt;, an update adding the MINECON Earth Skin Pack, and later updates resumed entirely with &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20version%20history%23xbone-CU51\"&gt;CU51&lt;/a&gt;, an update equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20version%20history%23xbox-TU60\"&gt;TU60&lt;/a&gt;, which also added all the features from TU58.\nOn May 3, 2018, Mojang officially announced that the \"&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 3 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Vita%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation Vita Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" would receive the &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt;, but would receive no further feature updates after its release. The \"&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox One Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" were excluded from \"&lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt;\". The \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" would still receive feature updates until December 10, 2019 (including &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt;), when it was replaced with Bedrock Edition on the platform, at which point the Legacy Console Edition codebase was discontinued entirely. Despite being discontinued, \"Xbox One Edition\" and \"PlayStation 4 Edition\" are playable on the and respectively via backward compatibility.\nAlthough worlds can still be transferred from \"&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt; \"and \"&lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" to \"&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20One%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox One Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Nintendo%20Switch%20Edition\"&gt;Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" respectively, the worlds currently cannot be loaded on the latter consoles due to the \"&lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wii%20U%20Edition\"&gt;Wii U Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" using a newer version of the game. As of April 15, 2020, the ability to transfer worlds from \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 3 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%20Vita%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation Vita Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" to \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" has been terminated.\nBy the end of 2020, all Legacy Console Edition games had ceased receiving new updates.\nGameplay.\nThe objective of the game remains the same as its counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. There is no preset goal; the player may choose to set their own goals.\nFor the most part, Legacy Console Edition is almost identical to \"Java Edition\" with few apparent differences, but was released with the \"Xbox 360 Edition\" in an earlier version equivalent to \"Java Edition\" &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20version%20history%23TU1\"&gt;Beta 1.6.6&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the current \"Java Edition\" version at the time of release, &lt;a href=\"1.2.5\"&gt;1.2.5&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Wii U Edition\" was released with an earlier version equivalent to \"Java Edition\" &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20version%20history%23TU19\"&gt;1.6.4&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the current \"Java Edition\" version at the time of release, &lt;a href=\"1.8.9\"&gt;1.8.9&lt;/a&gt;. Legacy Console also slowly became more like Bedrock (like movable tile entities being implemented) to prepare for Legacy Console being taken off the market.\nDifferences from \"Java\" and Bedrock Edition.\nDifferences from include:\nDifferent modes.\nThe different gameplay modes and settings may vary from the other platform versions, such as &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, as it is currently one of many &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20exclusive%20features\"&gt;Java Edition exclusive features&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreative.\nUsing Creative mode permanently disables achievements/trophies and leaderboard updates during normal gameplay on that world, however the core mechanics of flight and infinite resources remain the same.\nAdventure.\nBlocks can be destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Breaking%23Best%20tools\"&gt;proper tools and depending on the block, the quality of the tool&lt;/a&gt;. Example: blocks can be destroyed by using . While only and higher can break and gather blocks.\nSurvival.\nIn Survival mode:\nX/Z distance effects.\nAt the edges of the world, which varies depending on the console and &lt;a href=\"world%20size\"&gt;world size&lt;/a&gt;, there exists an invisible barrier that cannot be bypassed (not even in Creative Mode). Below sea level, the barrier is comprised of gravel. During TU 46, it was possible using a glitch involving the new &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;Boats&lt;/a&gt; to bypass this barrier. Past this barrier, an ocean with a flat stone sea floor generates up until X/Z 2800 in which blocks stop rendering although the physics still exist."}

The tutorial world contains twelve hidden &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href=\"music%20disc\"&gt;music disc&lt;/a&gt; that the player can search for.\nConcepts covered.\nThe tutorial walks the player through:\n\"Other tutorials for features such as &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Nether%20portal\"&gt;Nether portal&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s are scattered throughout the world, but are not part of the main tutorial.\""}

These features may be debugging material, leftovers or scrapped concepts and ideas.\nMechanics.\nUnbreakable tools.\nAll &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;s can be made unbreakable via editing the item's NBT data.\nCan break or place.\nUsing NBT editors, &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s can be configured to be only placed on a specific block or only to destroy a specific block, however while the text for this mechanic works, the mechanic itself does not.\nBlocks and items.\nCommand blocks.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", the command block cannot be obtained without using &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;. In Legacy Console Edition however, they are completely unobtainable without inventory editing with an external editor. All three variants can be modded into the game, but none of them have any functionality. Oddly it has unused NBT data relating to executing &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; and a tooltip stating \"Used to execute commands.\" Also in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"terrain.png\"&gt;terrain.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; there are unused conditional mode textures for each variant of the command block.\nBarrier.\nThe barrier can also only be obtained via external inventory editing. It's an invisible block used to make solid boundaries, however they are not fully functional as they cast shadows like other normal &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s, making them somewhat visible. It has a tooltip simply stating \"An invisible but solid block.\" Interestingly barriers were used in the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20tutorial\"&gt;Aquatic Update tutorial mode&lt;/a&gt; once and is also used in various &lt;a href=\"Mini%20games%23Battle\"&gt;Battlemode&lt;/a&gt; DLC maps.\ndebug_fourj_item.\nThis mysterious item has the texture of a &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt;, no display name and no tooltip hint. It can't be placed and has no actual use for anything. Although its ID suggests that it was used for debugging and testing purposes.\nMinecart with command block.\nA &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; which also lacks any functionality. This only exists as an item, as placing it will result in a normal minecart being placed. The command block in the minecart cannot be modified via NBT editing and it has an unused tooltip stating \"Used to execute commands on the move!\".\nSpectral arrow.\nSpectral arrows can be shot using a &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, however lack any functionality when hitting a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't give the player the &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;Glowing&lt;/a&gt; status effect which is also an unused feature of the Legacy Console Edition. The tooltip reads \"Gives the victim a glowing outline that can be seen through blocks.\".\nBark wood.\nWood is a block which has the &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;'s side bark texture on all six sides and it can be chopped using an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;. It can be used as fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s but is not flammable, as it is completely immune to &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. It cannot be used to craft &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; though the tooltip states \"Chopped using an axe, and can be crafted into planks or used as a fuel.\" \nOn \"&lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 4 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", all variants of wood were later added into the game, as obtainable blocks in both &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, as the only version of Legacy Console to receive the &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%204%20Edition%201.90\"&gt;1.90&lt;/a&gt; update.\nPetrified oak slab.\nBefore normal wooden slabs were added, there were other wooden slabs with stone properties, which means that they couldn't burn and needed to be broken with a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. These were however not removed.\nEntities.\nKiller Bunny.\nThe Killer Bunny is a white &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt; with horizontal red eyes, which is hostile towards &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s. It can only be summoned by changing a rabbit's RabbitType tag to 99 and upon being modded into the game, it will be given the name \"entity.KillerBunny.name\". Its attack strength changes depending on the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;: it will deal points on easy, points on normal and points on hard mode. Although not a neutral entity, it will not despawn when switching to Peaceful mode.\nAreas.\nCavern testing area.\nIn the Battlemode map Large Cavern there is an out-of-bounds area that can't be accessed without hacking. It seems to be a testing area used to test various aspects of the game in Battlemode. It consists of a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"minecart%20with%20chest\"&gt;minecart with chest&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt; with text that reads \"11111\". The chest is empty, however the furnace has a stack of &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s inside.\nCavern unseen structures.\nAlso in the Large Cavern Battlemode map, there is an unseen &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; right beside the big opening of the cave and a obscure mossy &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Bricks\"&gt;stone brick&lt;/a&gt; structure which was likely going to be a part of the main battle arena.\nCove unseen caves.\nIn the Large Cove map there is a lot of scenery that goes unused and unseen, the majority being caves. However, some can be seen without using mods, for example &lt;a href=\"swimming\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; out of the main arena through an one block gap at a waterfall.\nSounds.\nCorrupted cave sounds.\nThere are two unused corrupted &lt;a href=\"Ambience%23Cave%20ambience\"&gt;cave sounds&lt;/a&gt;, these being cave1.binka and cave8.binka and were removed in a later update. Oddly, the non-corrupted versions that are used are stored in folders called \"_fixed\".\nWarning: Loud!\nSound loops.\nFour audio loops existed in the game files once, but these were also removed in a later update. \nOld explosion.\nThe old &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; sound file still exists in the game files.\nDuplicate crafting sound.\nA duplicate of the crafting failed sound.\nResources.\nBlocks and items.\nStructure block textures.\nIn &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"terrain.png\"&gt;terrain.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; there are unused textures which were going to be used for the &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt;.\nStructure void texture.\nLike the structure block textures, there is also an unused texture for the &lt;a href=\"structure%20void\"&gt;structure void&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"items.png\"&gt;items.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;. \nFire texture placeholder.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; placeholder texture from as early as the beginning of the Legacy Console Edition still exists in the texture files today. It reads \"FIRE TEX! HNST\", which is short for \"Fire texture! Honest!\".\nParticles.\nVillager particles.\nIn &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"particles.png\"&gt;particles.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; there an unused particle of a villager's face.\nOther.\nOld tutorial screenshot.\nIn the Chinese Mythology &lt;a href=\"Mash-up%20pack\"&gt;Mash-Up pack&lt;/a&gt; there is a low-quality screenshot from an old Tutorial world. This image is normally seen when completing the first part of the tutorial, however this image is from &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU19\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition TU19&lt;/a&gt;.\nAquatic Update graphic.\nThere exists an unused graphic featuring the artwork for the &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Aquatic Update&lt;/a&gt;. It's located in MCBREUpSell720.fui.\nTeam alliance icon.\nThere was once a feature planned to allow alliances and teams in mini games, however this idea was scrapped. Leftover is this graphic along with some unused text regarding teams. \nMinecraft icons.\nInside almost every .fui file from the Legacy Console Edition there is a 64\u00d764 Minecraft icon whose purpose is unknown. Such an icon is only sometimes seen as world icons. These icons are identical to the MinecraftIcon.png file and are also present in Mash-Up packs.\nPS3 layout table.\nFound on the &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203%20Edition\"&gt;PlayStation 3 Edition&lt;/a&gt; is this graphic located in DebugUIMarketingGuide720.fui, and which seems to be some sort of layout table.\nStatus effects.\nGlowing.\nTo obtain the Glowing effect, the player's NBT data has to be edited using an editor. In other editions of the game this effect is obtained when hit by a spectral arrow, however that is not the case here as &lt;a href=\"spectral%20arrow\"&gt;spectral arrow&lt;/a&gt;s are non-functional in this edition, and so is the status &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nSaturation.\nSaturation is non-functional in this edition and will not regenerate a player's &lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;hunger points&lt;/a&gt;. It can not last longer than a few ticks, even when the duration of the effect was made longer using a NBT editor.\nBlindness.\nThis unused effect impairs the players vision by surrounding them with a thick black fog, with only a few blocks being visible. It also prevents the player from &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; and doing critical hits to &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s or players.\nHealth Boost.\nHealth boost is a status effect that increases a player's maximum &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the &lt;a href=\"absorption\"&gt;absorption&lt;/a&gt; effect icon texture instead of its own. The number of hearts will not change visually but &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; will still increase.\nBad Luck.\nThe direct opposite to the &lt;a href=\"Luck\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; status effect. It subtracts the effect level from the &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; codice_1.\nOther.\nDebug menu.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; there is a debug menu that was probably used by the developers during development. It can currently only be accessed in &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360%20Edition%20TU1\"&gt;Xbox 360 Edition TU1&lt;/a&gt; and below.\nOld tutorial world.\nIn the game files there is a leftover world file of the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition%20tutorial%23History\"&gt;TU46 tutorial world&lt;/a&gt;. It's located in \\Tutorial\\Tutorial.mcs.\nDLC.\nThere is some DLC which used to be purchasable but now can't be obtained without modding anymore, most of which are located in \\CU\\DLC\\."}

{"id": "72761", "revid": "4784321", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=72761", "title": "Legend of the Chambered", "text": "Legend of the Chambered (\"LoC\"), or simply Chambered, is a series of raycaster-styled games created by &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Persson\"&gt;Markus \"Notch\" Persson&lt;/a&gt; where the player must explore winding stone chambers, fight &lt;a href=\"Legend%20of%20the%20Chambered%23Enemies\"&gt;monsters&lt;/a&gt;, and reach the end of the dungeon. There are at least six different versions of \"LoC\". According to Notch's now-deleted project page, he later lost interest in this project and gave up on it, though he would go on to make several similar games later.\nAlong with other similarly titled \"Chambered\" games, \"Legend of the Chambered\" was based on games like \"Dungeon Master\", \"Eye of the Beholder\" and \"Ultima Underworld\". The first \"Legend of the Chambered\" game was made in 2001, and the more well known version was released on May 24, 2008, with a sequel being released on or before May 3, 2009. Notch also created flash and android versions of \"Legend of the Chambered\", as well as several other similar 3D dungeon crawlers, some of which bore variations of the \"Legend of the Chambered\" or \"LoC\" title, such as Prelude of the Chambered (\"PoC\"), created for the Ludum Dare 21 game jam in August 2011.\nNotch reused many item textures from the 2008 versions of \"Legend of the Chambered\" as textures for items in \"Minecraft\", those being the textures for &lt;a href=\"leather%20armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"studded%20armor\"&gt;studded armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chainmail%20armor\"&gt;chainmail armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20armor\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"iron%20sword\"&gt;iron sword&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"apple\"&gt;apple&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"quiver\"&gt;quiver&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the armor slot sprites. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Language%23Font\"&gt;the text font&lt;/a&gt; used in \"Minecraft\" was also first used in these games, and \"Minecraft\"'s &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; menu was based on a modified version of the \"LoC\" inventory. The four monster types present in the 2008 versions also bear resemblance to the first four monsters added to \"Minecraft\".\nControls.\n\"Legend of the Chambered\" 2001.\nBoth \"LoC\" 2001 and \"LoC\" 2008 have the same base controls.\n\"Legend of the Chambered\" (Flash/Android).\nBoth the Ludum Dare \"LoC\" and the flash \"LoC\" with characters from \"\" have the same controls.\nStory.\n\"Legend of the Chambered\" 2008-1.\n\"Legend of the Chambered 1\" begins in a stone chamber with the word \"Welcome\" written on one wall. There are more winding stone chambers that need to be explored. The player soon finds a small side-room in the hall with a pile of &lt;a href=\"Legend%20of%20the%20Chambered%23Items%2520and%2520inventory\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; on the floor, enough for the entire team, with some text above it saying \"Loot\".\nA little further on, there are two slots in the wall with some text in the middle of them saying \"Niches\". There are other niches scattered throughout the dungeon, but none of them have anything in them, nor can anything be placed in them.\nThe player finds an intersection; going left, the player finds another, and going left again there is a square loop in which there is a niche in one of the walls. Going the other way there is a roofless room with an automatic wood door to it which continuously opens and closes, and some text on the wall next to it saying \"(dancing)\". Inside are two apple trees and two monsters. Going right from the first intersection is a room with a pentagonal stone pressure plate in the middle, and two stair wells behind it, one going up and one going down, with some text on a wall between them saying \"Stairs\". The player can't go up or down these stairs because of an invisible barrier.\nThere is also another automatic door inside this room which leads to the woods (another roofless room with a maze of trees) as is suggested by some text saying \"woods\" on a wall somewhere inside it. Another wall on the opposite side has the words \"Monsters\" and \"(dancing)\" written on it. There are five monsters roaming around in these woods. Some of the trees have apples growing on them that can be picked by clicking on them, and many of the trees have apples piled underneath.\nThe player can find their way into another tree-filled room that contains two words, \"Win\" and \"Yay\", on opposite walls, and a dynamic texture which shows the time set on one's computer on the middle wall.\n\"Legend of the Chambered\" 2008-2.\n\"Legend of the Chambered 2\" begins in a crevasse of stone walls open to the night sky. Equipment is scattered about on the ground, which the player can pick up and use. An opening to the left has studded boots and a leather shirt on the ground. Trees block the way past the opening. The player can either choose to descend the stairway leading down into the dungeon, or to follow a dirt path.\nThe dirt path further up is lined with trees, and a skeleton wanders its entrance. A holy rune and a copper key can be found here. Further down the path, another skeleton wanders behind a stone block wall. The path then leads to the front of the graveyard, which has three ghosts wandering around in it, and the brick house. A chain helmet can be found here.\nPressing the gray button on the front of the brick house opens up its front wooden door. Inside, behind three more wooden doors, can be found an iron key, a gold key, a copper key, and a jade key. There are also windows on all four sides of the house, that the player and monsters can attack through, but which items cannot be thrown through.\nBehind the brick house extends the rest of the graveyard, in which the player can find an earth rune, a water rune, and two coins. A wooden door in the stone wall that surrounds the map opens up to a stone room containing a spider. Inside to the right is another wooden door with windows in the walls on each side. This door opens up to a room with two spiders, a pit, three pressure plates, and a staircase leading to the dungeon.\nIn the dungeon, two halls lead to the left and right with the staircase at the player's back. The halls meet up again with two wooden doors. Behind each door is a spider and rooms of marble. Each room conjoins into another marble room held up by marble pillars. At the end of the room, there are gravestones. Leaving the dungeon always brings the player back to the starting path no matter which entrance was taken.\n\"Prelude of the Chambered\".\n\"Prelude of the Chambered\" starts in the Prison, and the player must smash through cracked walls to find a ladder. Going down the ladder leads to the Dungeon, and after exploring a little, the player finds a power glove which lets the player push boulders and fight monsters. After fighting some bats and solving a boulder and pressure plate puzzle, doors open into a room filled with bats and the Golden Bat &lt;a href=\"Legend%20of%20the%20Chambered%23Bosses\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;, which, like the other bosses, drops a key.\nAfter that, the player must go back up to the Prison to cut some bars, fight more bats and push two boulders into some holes. This lets them cross to another ladder which leads up to the Island, where there are more bats, along with eyes, and yet another ladder that takes the player down to the Frost Cave. Here they must fight more eyes, and find the skates. The player can also find a green healing potion here too. The skates allow them to move on the ice without sliding, allowing them to get to the Golden Eye boss.\nThe player can then go back to the Island to cross some ice to obtain Cutters. Going back to the Frost Cave, the player can use the cutters on some bars to obtain a pistol. Going back to the Prison, they can cut more bars and find another pistol and potion in the cells. On the Island, there is a fence of bars with ogres that spit acid behind it, that the player must cut in order to get to the Crypt. In the Crypt, they must fight more ogres, and find the flippers. There is also another potion and pistol behind some cracked walls. The flippers allow them to swim in the water, allowing them to get to the Golden Ogre boss.\nGoing back to the Island, the player must swim across some water and trap a ghost in a white box to enter the Temple. Here the player must lead ghosts and trap them in some more white boxes in order to cut bars and push buttons to open a door. Pushing a boulder through a hallway and into a hole lets the player pass into a room with another white box in it. Going into the door behind the white box is a room with a maze made out of ghosts.\nAfter finding the Golden Ghost boss, the player must lead it back through the maze to the white box at the beginning in order to get the last key. With all 4 keys collected, the player can go back up to the Island and open up the last door and walk out into a field. The text \"YOU WIN\", the number of trinkets found (trophies), and the time show up on screen.\nItems and inventory.\n\"Legend of the Chambered\" 2008.\nItems are objects that can be picked up, set down, thrown, placed into a character's inventory, and used, though they are unstackable. Each character's inventory consists of 18 item slots and 12 equipment slots (4 slots for armor, 2 for weapons, 2 for rings, an amulet slot, a quiver slot, and 2 power up slots that any item can be placed in), totaling up to 30 inventory slots per character, and 120 slots for the whole party.\nThe original textures for leather armor, iron swords, apples and quivers can be found in the \"items.png\" file in the first 2008 version. The original textures for other armors such as studded, chainmail and iron armor can be found in the \"armor.png\" file in the second 2008 version.\nThe locks were on the same file as the buttons used to open doors (), suggesting they may also have been intended for opening doors.\n\"Legend of the Chambered\" 2001.\nThis version of \"LoC\" is lost and may have had more items than listed.\n\"Prelude of the Chambered\".\nThe inventory consists of a hotbar with 8 slots, in which collected items are shown. Unlike in the main game, certain items \"are\" stackable, such as Health Potions and Pistol Bullets.\nCharacters.\nThe game code in \"LoC\" refers to a character individually as Hero, and collectively as Party. Both \"PoC\" and the android version of \"LoC\" refer to the player character simply as the Player, which has no sprite or given name. The \"LoC\" game from 2001 contained character portraits from \"\" by as a placeholder, but it is unknown which ones were used.\nWhich heroes take damage from an attack is determined by the direction the attack comes from. The middle heroes take damage from attacks from the front, the outer heroes take damage from attacks from behind, the left heroes take damage from attacks from the left, and the right heroes take damage from attacks from the right. Heroes are able to take damage from other directions if a hero that would normally receive an attack from that direction is dead.\nEach hero's HP and power regenerates over time, with power regenerating faster than HP, and more quickly while standing still. A hero's power is reduced by attacking and sprinting, and the party is unable to sprint if any living hero runs out of power. Each hero also has hunger and thirst meters that slowly decrease over time and can be replenished using apples, with indicators appearing on a character's portrait if either is low (which flash in \"LoC2\"), though nothing happens when they reach zero.\nWhen a hero dies, items can still be taken in and out of their inventory, but they are unable to perform any actions. When the entire party dies, the camera drops to the ground and the player is unable to move, though they can still turn the camera around.\nIn \"LoC2\", each hero starts at level 1, but each time the party kills an enemy, each hero earns a random amount of experience points. Each hero needs 200 points to reach level 2, and the number of points needed to reach the next level increases by 200 each time. Upon leveling up, each hero's HP, power, and attack increases by a random amount (except for Diana and Teron, whose attack does not seem to increase).\nCharacters taken from \"\".\nThese characters are from the flash variant of \"LoC\". The names and sprites are taken from the game \".\nThe characters taken from \" in the Adobe Flash \"LoC\" had dialog or an onomatopoeia whenever the player attempted to move into a wall, these being: *thud*, *bonk*, \"Oof! That hurts!\", and \"Ouch! These walls are quite hard.\"\nPrelude of the Chambered.\nThe unseen player character in \"Prelude of the Chambered\" has 20 HP, takes 1 damage from all attacks and deals 1 damage with each attack.\nEnemies.\nThe \"LoC\" from 2001 has mummies, the first version of \"LoC\" from 2008 only has monsters in it, while the second version has skeletons, ghosts and spiders. The android version only has slimes. \"PoC\" has bats, eyes, ogres and ghosts, along with boss variants of each.\nPrelude of the Chambered.\nBosses.\nThere is a stronger, golden variant of every creature in \"PoC\", each of which drops a blue key. The golden bat has 5 HP, The golden eye has 10 HP, the golden ogre also has 10 HP and spits four perpendicular streams of golden acid, and the golden ghost spits a stream of golden acid at the player and also has a speed boost, and must be lured through a maze of ghosts in order for it to be trapped.\nList of \"Legend of the Chambered\" games.\n&lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; made many games with the same name or with similar names. All of them seem to take place at night."}

{"id": "858", "revid": "45088647", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=858", "title": "Light", "text": "Light (or lighting) in \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" affects visibility, &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; spawning, and &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; growth. There are three aspects of \"Minecraft\"'s lighting system: light level, internal light level, and rendered brightness.\nLight level.\nLight levels can be found on the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; . Light may come from two sources: the sky and certain blocks. There are 16 light levels, specified by an integer from 0 (the minimum) through 15 (the maximum).\nBlock light.\nBlock light comes from light-emitting blocks, and spreads using a algorithm.\nThe block light level decreases by one for each meter (block) of &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt; from the light source. This applies to each of the 3 coordinate axes. In other words, the light level decreases diagonally by the sum of the distances along each axis. For example:\n, &lt;a href=\"%23Light-filtering%20blocks\"&gt;light-filtering blocks&lt;/a&gt; can reduce more than 1 level of block light.\nOn a surface, this effect produces a diamond-shaped pattern of illumination around the light source.\n, when calculating lighting, the shapes of some blocks are detected: pistons, daylight detectors, enchanting tables, farmland, lecterns, stonecutters, dirt paths, snow, end portal frames, slabs and stairs, so that the light passing through them can spread only in specific directions. For example, dirt paths prevents the light from propagating downward, but the light can propagate in other directions.\nSky light.\nThe sky light level for blocks exposed to broad daylight is 15. Sky light cast onto blocks can spread to darker areas using a flood fill algorithm. Sky light is not reduced at night; rather, the spawning of mobs is determined by &lt;a href=\"%23Internal%20light%20level\"&gt;internal light values&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Opaque\"&gt;Opaque&lt;/a&gt; blocks can prevent the spread of sky light. By contrast, transparent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt; have no effect on the sky light level. All light-filtering blocks, however, reduce the spread of sky light.\nWhen sky light of a level of 15 spreads down through a transparent block, the level remains unchanged. When it spreads horizontally or upward, it reduces 1 light level. However, when it spreads through a &lt;a href=\"%23Light-filtering%20blocks\"&gt;light-filtering block&lt;/a&gt;, it does not follow the above two rules and attenuates specific light levels. \nSky light with a level less than 15 spreads as block light - when it propagates to adjacent (including top and bottom, six blocks in total) blocks, it is attenuated until it is 0.\n, when calculating lighting, the shapes of some blocks are detected: piston, daylight detectors, enchanting table, farmland, lectern, stonecutter, grass path, snow, end portal frame, slabs, and stairs. They have directional opacity, so that the light passing through them can spread only in specific directions. For example, the grass path prevents the light from propagating downward, but the light can propagate in other directions.\nLight-filtering blocks.\n, all of the following light-filtering blocks decrease sky light by 1 level (but do not affect block light).\n, light-filtering blocks can reduce more levels of block or sky light. The following values are the amounts by which each block decreases the light level.\nInternal light level.\nThe internal light level is used for calculations within the game. The game uses the internal light level of one block to compute aspects of the game, which include mob &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;ing, plant growth, and &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20Detector\"&gt;daylight detector&lt;/a&gt; outputs.\nThe game uses sky light, time, and weather to calculate an internal sky light value (also known as darkening sky light), then uses the maximum level of the block light and the internal sky light to calculate the internal light (formula: codice_1). This value is an integer with a maximum level of 15; it can also be negative.\nHere are the levels of internal sky light at a sky light of level 15:\nTo obtain an internal sky light for a sky light level \"s\" less than 15, take the internal level \"L\" at 15 and subtract from it the difference between 15 and \"s\": \"L\"\u2212(15\u2212\"s\").\nEffects of internal light.\n\"Keep in mind that the internal light level is only one of the considerations that apply to mob &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;ing and plant growth.\"\nMobs.\nMobs may ignore the light level they are supposed to spawn in after using .\nRendered brightness.\nThe game uses the light level (instead of internal light level), time, and weather to compute the rendered brightness of a given block or an entity. Light is completely monochromatic and cannot be truly colored.\nAs mentioned above, sky light is not reduced at night, instead, the brightness curve itself changes based on the time. Entities cast circular or tridecagonal shadows; however, these are unrelated to the rendering of blocks.\nIn general, lighting due to blocks results in a higher brightness, which is balanced by the fact that light due to blocks effectively starts at 14 (solid light source blocks emit a level of 15, but that applies to the light source block itself) while sky light brightness is 15 outdoors. Light due to blocks also tends toward orange in the middle ranges, while sky light in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; daytime is white.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; with the \"Moody\" brightness setting, full daylight reaches 98% brightness, while at night brightness is reduced to about 17% and is shaded blue. Full darkness is about 5% brightness.\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, sky lighting doesn't play a role since there is no source of sky light (although if there were, it would reach about 99% brightness.) Full darkness with the \"Moody\" brightness setting is at about 25% brightness, slightly darker than a block light level of 7 and no sky light in the Overworld, and is shaded orange like block light.\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, sky lighting wouldn't play a role even if there were a source of sky light; this can also be seen if &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; is summoned in the End (there is no flash of brightness like there is in other dimensions). Full darkness in the End with the \"Moody\" brightness setting is about 28% brightness, and is shaded toward a bluish-green rather than the orange of the Nether and of block lighting.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2020w14%E2%88%9E\"&gt;Java Edition 20w14\u221e&lt;/a&gt;, most unique dimensions have unique lighting system. However, most of the Easter egg dimensions do not have darkness at all. Instead, they are fully bright, but in an Easter egg dimension called codice_2 has the blue lighting nearly identical to the Overworld at night (only significantly brighter). Easter egg dimensions that resembles the Overworld with just world generation modifications (namely codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, and codice_10) have the same lighting as in the Overworld. codice_11 has the inverted lighting system derived from the Overworld. codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, and codice_15 dimensions resembles the Overworld with lighting mixed with dimensional &lt;a href=\"tint\"&gt;tint&lt;/a&gt;ing, and codice_16 is blended with darkness at higher distances far away from the origin. Its darkness cannot be fixed with &lt;a href=\"Night%20Vision\"&gt;Night Vision&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nSmooth lighting.\nSmooth lighting is a lighting engine that blends light levels across block faces and darkens corners using to add semi-realistic shadows and glowing from light sources. It affects only rendered brightness, not the light level, so it has no effect on mob spawning or crop growth. It is set on by default. &lt;a href=\"Painting\"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; surfaces are unaffected.\nSmooth lighting can be turned on or off in the video settings.\nAmbient occlusion in Minecraft.\nIn many newer games, ambient occlusion is mainly generated dynamically by the GPU.\nBut \"Minecraft\" calculates ambient occlusion in the code based on voxel placement and brightness levels. \nAmbient occlusion is responsible for adding shading to an ordinary texture. It is a layer of translucent textures, on top of the normal textures.\nOverlaying these AO textures onto a texture is called AO mapping.\nThere are about five AO texture patterns used in \"Minecraft\"'s smooth lighting, excluding flips and rotations, and only three patterns algorithmically. Strictly speaking, it's probably more than that. That's when the intensity changes with the brightness level. But they are solved by &lt;a href=\"tint\"&gt;tint&lt;/a&gt;.\nAO texture pattern.\nIf AO mapping is selected only to the northwest of the voxel, the following pattern is possible.\nThese classifications allow one the ability to deduce a pattern from the placement of each voxel.\nThe following function can then be used to compute the opacity of the voxels' vertices, depending on the presence of the side and corner voxels.\n function vertexAO(side1, side2, corner) {\n return 3 - (side1 + side2 + corner)\nThis generates a 2x2 pixel image using the values of each vertex. The pixels are small, but when zoomed in using anti-aliasing, it gradates."}

Put simply, they are an item when in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;, and a block when placed. For example, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s turn into an entity when placed, and &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s turn into a group of blocks when placed.

Both types slowly rotate and bob up and down; this is merely a visual effect, the item itself does not actually rotate or bob up and down.\nItem entities that represent a stack of more than one item appear as several items stuck together. Stacks of 1 appear as one item, 2-16 as two items, 17\u201332 as three, 33-48 as four, and 49+ as five.\nThe rotation rate of the item is approximately 2.87675 degrees per tick, or 57.595 degrees per second.\nBehavior.\nItem entities come from many sources. Some common ones are:\nThe player may be thought of as having an \"item pickup\" box that surrounds their hitbox. This pickup box extends 1 additional block to the horizontal sides, and 0.5 additional blocks up and down. Any item whose hitbox intersects with the pickup box can be picked up. The pickup box is inclusive on the horizontal sides (distance less than or equal to 1 will count), and exclusive on the vertical sides (distance less than 0.5 will count, but not equal). When the player's hitbox size changes, such as when crouching or sleeping, the pickup box size changes with it.\nOnce an item entity's hitbox overlaps with the player's pickup box, it can transfer its items. As many items as can fit in the player inventory, excluding the armor slots and the &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;off-hand slot&lt;/a&gt;, are transferred. If any item is transferred, &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29%23Sounds\"&gt;a \"plopping\" sound&lt;/a&gt; is played. If all items are transferred, the items appear to move into the center of the player. The item entity never physically moves, however, which means it can appear to go through lava and blocks in its path. This can happen through blocks that are thinner than a full block, but also through the shared edge of two full blocks. Unlike &lt;a href=\"experience%20orb\"&gt;experience orb&lt;/a&gt;s, multiple item entities can be picked up simultaneously. Dropped items have a delay of 10 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (half a second) between appearing and being able to be picked up, or 40 ticks (2 seconds) if thrown by a player, &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen two stackable items of the same type come within 3/4 of a block of each other, they merge into a single stack if the resulting stack size does not exceed that item's maximum stack size.\nItems do not collide with other entities(except boats) and are only moved or stopped by blocks.\nLike other entities, items can be pushed by flowing water and &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s, pushed by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, launched by a moving &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;, stuck to a &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;, or caught in a &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;. Items move at faster speeds if &lt;a href=\"ice\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt; is placed under the flowing water. When in still water, items float slowly up to the surface.\nItems can be reared by &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s, costing 3 &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf an item is within a &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;, then it flies out one of the unobstructed sides, or out of the top of the block if surrounded by solid blocks on all sides. It does this even if the space below is unoccupied; therefore, it is possible to recover an item dropped by breaking a hole in a floor by quickly placing another block there.\nItems visually disappear when the player is about 16 blocks away from them, and reappear when they get closer. This distance can be adjusted by the \"Entity Distance\" slider in &lt;a href=\"Options%23Video%20Settings\"&gt;video settings&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most entities, items cannot be spectated in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode without use of the command.\nDamage.\nItems cannot be attacked by players or mobs; attempting to do so simply hits through them. However, they take damage and disappear from environmental or block-based damage such as &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, and contact with &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;. Items have essentially no health, so they are destroyed by the slightest damage, though if set on fire they may remain for a few seconds before disappearing. &lt;a href=\"Nether%20star\"&gt;Nether star&lt;/a&gt;s are immune to explosions, and &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt;-based items and tools are immune to fire and float on top of lava. Also, some blocks that normally damage mobs, such as &lt;a href=\"magma%20block\"&gt;magma block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Berries\"&gt;sweet berry bushes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;, do not damage items.\nDespawning.\nItems despawn after 6000 game &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;s (5 minutes) of being in a loaded, entity-ticking &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;; this is affected by the player's &lt;a href=\"simulation%20distance\"&gt;simulation distance&lt;/a&gt;. If two item stacks merge, the timer is set to the item that has more time remaining. The 5-minute timer is paused when the chunk is unloaded or no longer processing entities. Nether stars do not despawn.\nItems that fall into the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; immediately despawn when they fall below Y=-128 in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, or Y=-64 in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nItem Entities use the Ambient/Environment sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nDropped items have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity."}

If the item frame contains an item, punching it drops the item, leaving the frame on the wall.\nBecause item frames are &lt;a href=\"entities\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; , they can be broken in &lt;a href=\"Adventure\"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; mode. They will also be targeted by commands using the @e selector.\nNatural generation.\nAn item frame containing a pair of &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; generates in each &lt;a href=\"end%20ship\"&gt;end ship&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrading.\nExpert-level &lt;a href=\"Trading%23Cartographer\"&gt;cartographer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s have a chance to sell an item frame for 7 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nItem display.\nItem frames can be placed on the sides of &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt; blocks, &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cobblestone%20wall\"&gt;cobblestone wall&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, and all &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;s. They can also be placed on the top and bottom of these blocks. To place on chests and doors, the player needs to be &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;. As item frames are an entity, multiple item frames can occupy the same block, although on different faces. It also allows non-solid blocks to occupy the same space.\nPlayers can place items in the frame by the item. If a &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; is placed in an item frame, it enlarges to show the map in the size of a full block, with the item frame's location displayed as a green pointer on the map, pointing in the direction the item frame is facing. If this is done in the Nether, the green cursor spins around similar to the white cursor (players). If an item in an item frame has been renamed using an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, it displays its custom name when the cursor is over the item frame. If the player places a block inside the frame, it is displayed in miniature half in, half out of the block. This can be most notably seen on stairs or slabs.\n may be used on item frames by players in creative mode only, the control has no effect for players in Survival or Adventure mode. When the item frame is displaying an item, picks the displayed item instead of the item frame.\nItem frames can be placed on the lid of a &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt; that is positioned horizontally, but pop off when the lid is opened.\nRotation.\nThe displayed item can then be rotated by right-clicking the frame. Items displayed in the item frame can turn 45\u00b0 diagonally, with a total of 8 possibilities (90\u00b0 and 4 possibilities if it is a map), and the frame outputs a &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Circuit%23Power%20level\"&gt;redstone signal&lt;/a&gt; depending on the rotation phase that can be interpreted by a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt; (note that this rotation value is separate from the clock or compass rotation). As long as the frame remains placed, it remembers the orientation of the last item it held, and uses it for the next item it holds.\nGlow item frames.\nWhen an item is placed inside a glow item frame, it appears to glow, even though it does not emit any &lt;a href=\"light%20level\"&gt;light level&lt;/a&gt;.\nSounds.\nItem frames and glow item frames share the same sounds.\nData values.\nItem data.\nUnlike spawn eggs, cannot change the type of entity created using the codice_1 tag.

The durability of the repaired item equals the sum of the old items' durability plus a 'repair bonus' of 5% of the item's maximum uses, up to a limit of the maximum durability for that item. Repairing gives a slight benefit in conserving inventory space, as it combines two non-stackable objects into one.\nThe repaired object is never enchanted even if both items were to have the exact same enchantments, with the exception of curse enchantments, which are transferred to the repaired item. Therefore, using a \"junk\" item in a repair may sometimes be useful for removing an unwanted enchantment from an item prior to enchanting it again. Tools made of different materials (for example, a wood and a stone pickaxe) cannot be combined.\nFormula for uses restored.\nThe formula for determining how many uses a repaired item can have restored to it in the crafting box, is as follows:\n \"min\"(Item A uses + Item B uses + \"floor\"(Max uses / 20), Max uses)\nwhere \"floor\" means round \"down\" to the smaller integer, and \"min(x,y)\" means the smallest of x or y.\nExample: Two stone axes have 10 and 45 uses. A newly crafted stone axe would have 61 uses.\nOr, in terms of percentage (approximated):\nThe greatest benefit is gained when the two items have a combined durability of at most approximately 95%, in any combination, such as 47.5% + 47.5%, 94% + 1%, 85% + 10% or any other values that total 95% or less. The order in which items are combined does not matter; one sequence of repairs gives exactly the same durability as any other.\nIn the example, repairing a stone tool restores a bonus of 6 durability, which is actually only 6/132 = 4.5%. The precise combined durability for efficient repairs is shown in the following table.\nA perfect repair is theoretically possible, but unlikely in practice. Combining items whose combined durability is more than 100% actually wastes more resources than simply using tools until they break.\nThe precise combined durability for efficient repairs for all types of armor is shown in the following table.\nAnvil Repair.\nAn &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; can also repair items in two different ways. This costs experience levels, but unlike the grindstone, the anvil preserves or can even enhance the target's enchantments. The anvil can combine the enchantments on two similar items, or rename any item (not just the ones it can repair). The costs are complex, so a summary is given here.\nThe repair cost is stored in a value.\nCombination.\nTwo items of the same type are put into the input slots; the first one is the item to be repaired and the second one is to be merged into the first. The second item's durability is added to the first, and if applicable, some or all enchantments from the second item are added.\nUnit repair.\nSome items can be repaired by \"covering\" the damage with a specific material. The item to be repaired is put into the first input slot, and the corresponding material is put into the second slot. Each material item (unit) heals the item's durability by 25% its maximum durability, rounded down."}

When placed, jack o'lanterns automatically face the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. Jack o'lanterns can be placed on a transparent block.\nJack o'lanterns are transparent in their rendering only; otherwise, they share the attributes of all opaque solid blocks. For example, mobs can spawn on them, they can suffocate mobs, and blocks attached to another block (such as torches and rails) can be placed on top of them or on their sides.\nThey can also be worn by the player, occupying the helmet slot."}

The &lt;a href=\"%23Full%20release\"&gt;full release&lt;/a&gt; of the game (version &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;) was on November 18, 2011, at &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202011\"&gt;MINECON 2011&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnique features.\nUpdates are managed directly by the \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt;\", so it does not have to go through platform holders' certification. \nLogging in with a Microsoft account is required to play the game. In addition to the latest version and latest snapshot, most past versions of \"Java Edition\" are also available through the launcher. The launcher allows for separate profiles that are useful for &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"development%20versions\"&gt;development versions&lt;/a&gt;, and old versions.\n\"Java Edition\"'s code is more easily modified than the other editions, and so it has by far the most robust scenes for &lt;a href=\"mods\"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt; and . One example of this is the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Obfuscation_map\"&gt;obfuscation map&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to make modding easier. &lt;a href=\"Realms\"&gt;Realms&lt;/a&gt; for \"Java Edition\" is a separate service from &lt;a href=\"Realms%20Plus\"&gt;Realms Plus&lt;/a&gt; for Bedrock Edition.\nOwners of \"Java Edition\" who bought the game before June 7, 2022, received a free copy of for Windows. \"Java Edition\" on PC and \"Bedrock Edition\" on Windows are now sold together as Minecraft: Java &amp; Bedrock Edition for PC.\nDevelopment.\nCreation/Pre-classic.\n&lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; got the idea for \"Minecraft\" after playing \"&lt;a href=\"Infiniminer\"&gt;Infiniminer&lt;/a&gt;\" with other members of the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//tigsource.com\"&gt;TIGSource&lt;/a&gt; forums in 2009. Other influences include ', ', and Notch's own previous project, \"&lt;a href=\"RubyDung\"&gt;RubyDung&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWhen he first started working on \"Minecraft\", Notch had planned for it to just be a small project. For instance, when Notch uploaded the first YouTube video of \"Minecraft\" on May 13, 2009, he had not yet decided on a name, and simply referred to it as a \"cave game\". The name Minecraft: Order of the Stone was announced the next day (from a suggestion a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//tigsource.com\"&gt;TIGSource&lt;/a&gt; forums user gave in an IRC chat), a reference to ', a webcomic and \"one of the best things on the internet\", and then shortly after, it was shortened to Minecraft as it was much simpler and to prevent people from confusing it with \"The Order of the Stick\". The name was for '. The game was finally released for an \"early private single-player alpha\" on May 16, 2009. Today, the majority of all pre-classic versions are lost.\nClassic.\n\"Minecraft\" 0.0.11a was publicly released the day after the private release on May 17, 2009, and the game received mention on IndieGames.com the day after that. This phase was later named &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;\"Minecraft\" Classic&lt;/a&gt;. In July, \"Minecraft\" was rewritten to use the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//lwjgl.org\"&gt;Lightweight Java Gaming Library (LWJGL)&lt;/a&gt;. Until \"Minecraft\" &lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; reintroduced it, Classic (and the first two versions of Indev) were the only versions of \"Minecraft\" with the &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; game mode, which gives players an infinite amount of each block to build with without having to gather them as in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode. A multiplayer test also occurred shortly before the Survival test.\nSurvival Test.\nSurvival Test was released as a version of Classic on September 1, 2009. It was the introduction of Survival Mode. In it, the player now had to mine blocks, face &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, and had a health bar. If the player were to die, the map was lost; unless backed up, the user would have to start over with a new map, similar to &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nIndev.\nIndev (short for in development) was released on December 23, 2009, after &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; received requests to let the community try out new features he was implementing in Survival Test. Indev version 0.31 was released to the public on minecraft.net/indev and available only to people who had purchased the game. From early Indev versions, when a new game was started, the player would spawn in a prefabricated house (originally made of mossy cobblestone, later wooden planks and stone) which would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Starting%20house\"&gt;Indev house&lt;/a&gt;. \nUpdates introduced a more complex and realistic &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;ing schemne than &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"daylight%20cycle\"&gt;day-night cycle&lt;/a&gt;. Indev received more updates after this, adding a few fundamental features to \"Minecraft\" as it went. During its lifespan, some updates were devoted mostly to testing new things, like food, &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es, or fire. The &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; settings: Peaceful, Easy, Normal and Hard, were added to the game. Unique to Indev were level types, similar to &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s - for example, Floating Islands and the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Dimension\"&gt;Sky Dimension&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Hell\" (not &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;). Like Survival Test, if the player were to die, all progress was lost.\nInfdev.\nInfdev (short for infinite development) was released on February 27, 2010, and became the third phase of \"Minecraft\"s development. It featured the important addition of maps that can generate infinitely, which extended the gameplay possibilities even further as well as other upgrades including new &lt;a href=\"Crafting\"&gt;crafting recipes&lt;/a&gt;, 3D &lt;a href=\"clouds\"&gt;clouds&lt;/a&gt;, a new terrain generator, a more realistic &lt;a href=\"fluid\"&gt;fluid&lt;/a&gt; system, and more complex caves. However, Infdev scrapped other features of Indev such as &lt;a href=\"Theme\"&gt;world themes&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, spelled the demise of features such as 'floating islands' and 'permaday'. These removals are understandable, as Infdev's main purpose was to develop infinite maps. However, some extra gameplay features and items were added, such as &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"mob%20spawner\"&gt;mob spawner&lt;/a&gt;s, and the ability to &lt;a href=\"respawn\"&gt;respawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being replaced by Alpha on June 30, 2010, Infdev remained available on the official \"Minecraft\" website until September 2010, when it was removed. Only one version, &lt;a href=\"Infdev%2020100618\"&gt;Infdev 20100618&lt;/a&gt;, is playable through the launcher, by enabling the \"Historical versions\" button in the Launcher options.\nAlpha.\nAlpha was released on June 30, 2010, however, only technically, as the first version labeled as Alpha was &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.0.1\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.1&lt;/a&gt;. When this update was released, Notch decided to rename &lt;a href=\"Infdev%20%28June%2030%2C%202010%29\"&gt;Infdev (June 30, 2010)&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.0.0\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;. This phase of the game saw many major features added to \"Minecraft\". Multiplayer for Survival was created, and features such as &lt;a href=\"redstone%20circuits\"&gt;redstone circuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, new &lt;a href=\"music\"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; and new mobs, often without announcement in \"&lt;a href=\"Seecret%20Updates\"&gt;Seecret Friday Updates&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halloween%20Update\"&gt;Halloween Update&lt;/a&gt; on October 30, 2010, was a major update adding &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;The Nether&lt;/a&gt;, new mobs, blocks and items, and other changes.\nOne could see Alpha's introduction of &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s as being the return, at least in part, of Indev's &lt;a href=\"Theme\"&gt;world themes&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed the Nether is not unlike the 'Hell' world theme. \nAnother reintroduction in Alpha was the return of &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Classic's Creative multiplayer, Alpha's multiplayer was available only in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; form that is logically called \"Survival Multiplayer\".\nIt is still playable on the launcher by enabling the \"Historical versions\" button in the Launch options. Today, 23% of all Alpha versions are lost.\nBeta.\nBeta was the sixth and last phase of \"Minecraft\"s development before its official release. Beta was released on December 20, 2010. Features that were added include a new logo and launcher, customizable world name and &lt;a href=\"world%20seed\"&gt;world seed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"achievements\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"statistics\"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"weather\"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Light%23Smooth%20lighting\"&gt;Smooth Lighting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dyes\"&gt;dyes&lt;/a&gt;, more plant types (two new types of &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s and tall &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, and other blocks and items.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Update\"&gt;Adventure Update&lt;/a&gt; was a major set of updates, focusing on exploring and combat and adding an ending to the game. Features added include a new terrain generator, new mobs, blocks, biomes, and items. Three generated structures were added: &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s. Changes to general &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; include an improved &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; system including &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;, a reintroduced &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hardcore\"&gt;Hardcore&lt;/a&gt;, and a way to finish the game by traveling to &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt; and defeating the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally planned to be started in Beta 1.7, the first part of the Adventure Update was released as Beta 1.8 on September 14, 2011. Starting on September 9, 2011, &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20version%20history/Development%20versions\"&gt;developmental versions&lt;/a&gt; were \"leaked\" by Mojang Studios. Beta 1.9 was never released, but 6 pre-releases using the 1.9 version number were made available for users to test and report bugs back to Mojang Studios. On October 18, a feature freeze went into effect and Mojang Studios shifted all \"Minecraft\" development focus to fixing bugs and preparing the game for release. On November 13, a release candidate of 1.0 was released, along with an official update to 1.8.1 that added sounds from the developmental version.\nIt is still playable on the launcher by enabling the \"Historical versions\" button in the Launch options.\nFull release.\nThe full release of \"Minecraft\", &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, was released during &lt;a href=\"MINECON%202011\"&gt;MINECON 2011&lt;/a&gt; on November 18, 2011, by &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; at the keynote address ceremony at 9:54 pm . &lt;a href=\"Jeb\"&gt;Jeb&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the version number in a tweet while also stating that the game would be officially out of Beta. The release includes many features from the &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Update\"&gt;Adventure Update&lt;/a&gt; that were not included in &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;. The most prominent feature is an ending to the game, which can be achieved by defeating the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;Ender Dragon&lt;/a&gt; boss in &lt;a href=\"The%20End\"&gt;The End&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe full release of \"Minecraft\" is charged at full price (29.99, 39.99, 29.99, 24.99, 39.95, 49.95, or 39.90) to new players, but Alpha and Beta players receive this copy through regular updating. After the release, Notch said in an interview that he was nervous about releasing a full game that would be rated and reviewed. Upon release, the game was well received and was given high ratings by many gaming websites and fan reviews.\nSubsequent updates have since been released, with additions such as new gameplay mechanics, new mobs, and biomes. For the full list of additions since 1.0.0, see &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20version%20history\"&gt;Java Edition version history&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe game received the \"Java Edition\" subtitle in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.12.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.12.2&lt;/a&gt;, to separate it from , which was renamed to just \"Minecraft\" by the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 6, 2018, Mojang Studios open-sourced parts of the code for \"Java Edition\", mainly the &lt;a href=\"Brigadier\"&gt;Brigadier&lt;/a&gt; command engine and the Data Fixer Upper. A complete rewrite of the game's rendering engine called Blaze3D is being considered for open-sourcing.\nDemo version.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demo%20version\"&gt;demo version&lt;/a&gt; of \"Java Edition\" is for players who haven't bought Minecraft yet and has some restrictions:\nControls.\nControls for the \"Java Edition\" are designed for use with a keyboard and mouse, Touchscreen or touchpad.\nSystem requirements.\nHardware.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409225939853\"&gt;\"Minecraft: Java Edition\" Installation Issues FAQ \u2013 Home&lt;/a&gt;:\nAny computer can actually run \"Minecraft\" - even with a low processor and graphics card - but high RAM is required. However, for an enjoyable experience, it is encouraged to consult the recommended requirements. Older operating systems can run \"Minecraft\", using software, but consequently a negative performance impact is expected.\nSoftware.\nA stable Internet connection is required for \"Java Edition\" to download game files, authenticate usernames, and connect to multiplayer servers.

However, there are some exceptions:\n, for most of rideable mobs, when its mob passenger tries to chase and attack player or mobs, the passenger takes control, otherwise the mount controls movement. The following mobs are exceptions:\n, some AI goals are disabled if the entities is ridden by or riding an entity. For example , when a zombie rides a pig, the pig controls the movement when they are idle; but the pig cannot follow players holding a carrot even when the zombie is idle; the pig controls the movement when it is breeding and the zombie is idle; the zombie controls the movement when it targets a player even when the pig is breeding. \nWhen being controlled by its passenger, the mount uses its own walk speed. However, , speed modifier of its passenger's AI is applied. For example, spiders ridden by a chicken, a sheep, or a llama have different speed when they follows a player holding seeds, wheat, or hay block, respectively. Because the AIs of chicken, sheep, and llama have different speed modifiers. While , the speed modifier (speed multiplier) for being controlled is defined for each entity type (by codice_1 component).\nBehavior.\nFor an entity that is riding by multiple passengers, only the front passenger has control over the mount. If a player and other entities ride it at a time, the player becomes the front passenger.\n, the passenger controlling its mount can be targeted with .\n, mobs cannot float on water when they are controlled. They are submerged in the water instead. , they can float on water when being controlled, however, because they float up and down more fiercely than in , their heads are often submerged so that the passenger is evicted\uff0c while tall mobs can float on water without their heads being submerged an the passenger is not evicted.\nDismounting.\nMobs usually cannot leave their mounts on their own AI (there're some exceptions, e.g. , baby piglins stop riding baby hoglins when being hurt), but there are many ways to make passengers leave their mounts:\nRiding in vanilla game.\nRiding by player.\nPlayers can ride the following entities by pressing on the entity:\nMinecart.\nA mob can ride a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; when pushing by a moving minecart on rails or when colliding with a minecart . , armor stand can also be picked up.\n&lt;a href=\"Ender%20dragon\"&gt;Ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be picked up by a minecart. , &lt;a href=\"sniffer\"&gt;sniffer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be picked up either.\n, unlike &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, ender dragons can ride a minecart via command; withers cannot ride a minecart via though a success message is returned.\nBoat.\nMobs can be picked up into a &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"boat%20with%20chest\"&gt;boat with chest&lt;/a&gt; when they collide with the side of the boat or boat with chest. , a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob. , mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player.\nMobs wider than the width of a boat cannot be picked up. &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be picked up. , baby &lt;a href=\"sniffer\"&gt;sniffer&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be picked up either.\n, mobs wider than the width of a boat can ride a boat via command. Unlike wardens, ender dragons can ride a boat via command; withers cannot ride a boat via though a success message is returned.\nJockey.\nSpider Jockey.\nSpider jockeys are the rare appearance of a spider or cave spider\u200c being ridden by a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\nChicken Jockey.\nChicken jockeys are the rare appearance of a baby &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;, baby &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;, baby &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;, baby &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;, or baby &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; riding a &lt;a href=\"chicken\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;.\nJockey of baby zombie.\n, 10% naturally spawned baby zombies, baby husks, and baby zombie villagers try to find a mount when it tries attacking a &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;, which can ride:\nSkeleton Horseman.\nSkeleton horseman is a jockey consisting of a &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; (or and ) riding a &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20horse\"&gt;skeleton horse&lt;/a&gt;. Skeleton horsemen spawn only from a \"skeleton trap horse\".\nBaby piglin riding baby hoglin.\nBaby piglins play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin. , a baby &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt; can support 3 baby piglins, which looks like they are stacked one by one. However, , baby piglins ride each other and are indeed stacked one by one, instead of all riding on the hoglin.\nStrider or zombified piglin riding strider.\nFor every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional baby strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. Zombified piglins have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider.\nIllager riding ravager.\nA &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt; generated in &lt;a href=\"raids\"&gt;raids&lt;/a&gt; may generate with a &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; riding on it.\nParrot riding player.\nA tamed parrot on the ground can be made to perch on its player's shoulder by moving through the parrot. , technically the parrot is riding the player. , technically the parrot on the shoulder is not an entity.\nValid riding combinations in vanilla.\n, whether an entity is rideable is mainly defined with minecraft:rideable component and entity &lt;a href=\"family\"&gt;familliers&lt;/a&gt; in vanilla behavior packs. Besides, some entities have hardcoded riding behaviors, for, example, wardens being not able to riding a boat, boat doing not pick up adult horses although they can ride boats via command.\nIn the following table, codice_2 means that the entity is rideable by these families no matter what component groups it has. Multiple components separated by | symbols means that the entity must have at least one of them to be rideable by these families.\nPosture.\nThe following passengers have riding posture when riding:\n&lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s do not have a riding posture although similar mobs do."}

In those situations, a thrown trident launches the player with it. Players can reach greater heights by throwing a Riptide trident straight upward, and travel further distances by throwing it from a higher altitude, or by &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sprint-swimming\"&gt;sprint-swimming&lt;/a&gt; while in motion. If a Riptide-enchanted trident is held in both the main hand and the off-hand, the player's velocity will not be doubled and the trident in the main hand will only be used (see &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;), although the animation for both tridents will be displayed on the &lt;a href=\"Heads-up%20display\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe formula for the number of blocks the trident throws the user is (6 \u00d7 level) + 3 when in rain or standing in water, and (4 \u00d7 level) + 3 while underwater.\nRiptide cannot be used in biomes (or altitudes) where it cannot rain, even if the current weather in these locations is snow or overcast.\nIf the player collides with a mob or another player, the trident deals throwing damage, including critical damage if the player is falling, and the player's movement is abruptly stopped. Throwing a Riptide trident consumes 1 durability. In this situation, a Riptide trident can bypass the defense of a shield. Colliding with a mob to deal damage consumes 1 durability regardless of version, which means a collision damages the trident twice. If the Riptide trident is in the off-hand, damage is dealt with the item in the main hand, if any.\nIf an item is being held in the off-hand during movement, on the HUD, the held item will appear at the top-left, with the top of the item texture facing the direction the player is (unless that item is another &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;, in which case the same animation as the Riptide trident is played, regardless of if the trident in the off-hand is enchanted with Riptide or not). The same is true if the trident is in the off-hand and the held item in the main hand, if any. The trident, the item in the main/off-hand (if any), and other items can be swapped, rearranged, or thrown out to create different animation combinations.\nA thrown Riptide-enchanted trident can hit multiple targets.\nElytra.\nA Riptide trident can be used to propel a player with a pair of &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, in rainy weather or in a body of water. This allows the player to reach speeds as high as 125 blocks per second, much faster than the 33.5 blocks-per-second speed achieved using &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIncompatibilities.\nSince a Riptide trident never leaves the player's hand when used, &lt;a href=\"Loyalty\"&gt;Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used, and because of that, the two enchantments can't be combined. &lt;a href=\"Channeling\"&gt;Channeling&lt;/a&gt; is also mutually exclusive with Riptide, both because the trident never really lands anywhere, and because it would strike lightning at the player's own position.\nIf combined using commands, Riptide takes priority over Loyalty and Channeling."}

Rivers can serve as borders between various other biomes, and usually lead to &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, although they can also form loops.\nDescription.\nRivers are thin, lengthy biomes that frequently generate across the world. They typically serve as a division between two different biomes, but can also split a single biome in two. They are filled with &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; up to sea level, though rivers may run dry in certain areas due to higher than usual elevation. Saddle valleys in &lt;a href=\"mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; can generate rivers, but often too high so that there's not any water. Rivers can vary a lot in width and depth, in generally flat areas rivers are usually around 10 blocks deep but in mountainous regions rivers can reach over 30 blocks in depth which is comparable to deep oceans. Sometimes rivers can also generate as lakes with small islands.\nExposed grass in rivers takes on a bluish-green hue and oak trees can rarely generate along with spare grass. Riverbeds consist of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, and are one of the few places where clay generates, alongside lakes, &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt; marshes, ocean hilltops, and &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20cane\"&gt;Sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; occasionally generates on the riverbank. &lt;a href=\"Salmon\"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; may spawn here.\nVariants.\nThere are two different river biomes.\nRiver.\nThe standard river variant. This is a very common biome in the game. The grass color is turquoise green, similar to the meadow and birch forest biomes. Vegetation is sparse, with occasional &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; trees. &lt;a href=\"Seagrass\"&gt;Seagrass&lt;/a&gt; generates atop the riverbed.\nNeither passive nor hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (except &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;) spawn within river biomes themselves, but frequently wander into them from the surrounding biomes if they can spawn there. Drowned can spawn underwater, as can &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nFrozen River.\nFrozen Rivers replace regular rivers in regions with snowy biomes. As the name implies, the top layer of water is entirely frozen. Seagrass does not generate on the riverbed. While sugar cane can generate alongside a frozen riverbank, it often quickly uproots itself after generation due to the water being frozen. Oak trees and grass can still generate here if this biome generates on land.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a"}

{"id": "3578", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3578", "title": "RubyDung", "text": "RubyDung was an unreleased strategy sandbox game created by &lt;a href=\"Markus%20Persson\"&gt;Markus \"Notch\" Persson&lt;/a&gt; before \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\", which was in development from February 2009 or earlier until May 2009 at the latest. Not much else is known about the game other than that it was influenced by \"\", and that it was canceled early in development, before being released. Notch's next game would be &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;\"Minecraft\"&lt;/a&gt; (later known as &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;\"Minecraft: Java Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;), which is based on \"RubyDung's\" codebase.\nThe name \"RubyDung\" was a placeholder name for a \"dungeon game in the rubylands\", the \"rubylands\" being a rough idea for a game world that Notch had. Rubylands is also the name of a project Notch was developing in early 2008.\nAbout.\nWhile most of the gameplay features and mechanics are unknown, as the game was canceled at a very early state, the game was meant to be a clone of \"Dwarf Fortress\" had it been finished. It would have been easier to play with a heavy focus on accessibility, unlike the former game which has been remarked for being quite complicated and unfriendly to beginners. Since the game was in an early development stage, no GUI, text, or any other such features appear in any of the existing screenshots of the game.\nThe game featured a 3D isometric perspective, as opposed to \"Dwarf Fortress\"s 2D ASCII tile-based graphics. It also included a 3D texture mapper, and grass and cobblestone textures which were randomly colored on the fly. The terrain generation was quite varied, containing many bumps, hills, and monoliths. Unlike in the blocky \"Minecraft\", many surfaces were sloped. Trees using billboarded sprites were present in the game as well, which are numerous in the screenshots where they are present. In a screenshot of an earlier version of the game, there was also a dirt material which formed maze-like dirt paths, and an alternate, earlier grass texture less resembling the one seen in \"Minecraft\". Minions existed which the player could follow around in a first-person view.\nAfter the game was canceled early in development, the codebase would later be reused for \"Minecraft\". Most notably, the same &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; block textures that appear in the screenshots of the later versions of \"RubyDung\" would also appear in the earliest builds of \"Minecraft\".\n\"Rubylands\".\nRubyDung would likely have reused some gameplay elements from a related unreleased project by Notch, Rubylands. This was going to be a group manager where players would assemble, equip, level up, and pay heroes. A local town would provide quests for the heroes, which the player could send them on. When they returned, a replay animation of the quest would show, and the player would get to distribute/sell/equip any loot gathered. The player would gain experience points to level up, and the player's level determined the size and the number of the groups one could have. The player could also construct better headquarters. There was code implemented for the player to fight enemies, fire heroes, and hire new ones, shown with text on the screen. The only known creatures implemented were the bunny and the hero. It is unknown if they had any sprites.\nItems would have existed in three forms:\nEarlier, Notch had also worked on several other unreleased projects with similar names. These included:\nCreation of \"Minecraft\".\n\"RubyDung\" is part of what inspired &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; to make \"Minecraft\". He had wanted \"RubyDung\" to have both isometric and first-person viewing modes, but when he tried implementing this, he thought that the textures were too blurry and distorted when viewed up close. Shortly after working on \"RubyDung\", Notch came across the game \"&lt;a href=\"Infiniminer\"&gt;Infiniminer&lt;/a&gt;\". He decided that this game\u2019s first-person block-based system would be a better choice for the kind of gameplay he had in mind for \"RubyDung\", which was then repurposed into the &lt;a href=\"cave%20game%20tech%20test\"&gt;cave game tech test&lt;/a&gt;, which later became \"Minecraft\".\nOn October 30, 2009, Notch talked about \"RubyDung\" on his blog, &lt;a href=\"The%20Word%20of%20Notch\"&gt;The Word of Notch&lt;/a&gt;, in an entry titled \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20091102174928/http%3A//notch.tumblr.com/post/227922045/the-origins-of-minecraft\"&gt;The Origins of \"Minecraft\"&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Minecraft\"s source code came from \"RubyDung\", and as such, the earliest versions of \"Minecraft\" still internally refer to themselves as \"RubyDung\", and still contain the &lt;a href=\"terrain.png\"&gt;terrain.png&lt;/a&gt; file from \"RubyDung\", which dates to February 2009."}

It contains some decoration and a loot chest around it.\nGeneration.\nRuined portals are the only generated structures that generate in more than one dimension; they generate in all &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in both the Nether and the Overworld. They can spawn underground, underwater, or exposed to the air. If they generate underground, they have air pockets around them. Natural terrain around ruined portals generates as &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. They also generate a mass of netherrack underneath them (including \"stalactite\"-like shapes, and this may contain &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt; deposits in the Nether). Giant ruined portals have 3 distinct designs, and normal ruined portals have 10 designs. When a ruined portal generates, it has a 5% chance to be a giant ruined portal, for about a 1.67% chance per giant portal design. This gives normal ruined portals a 95% chance, for a 9.5% chance per normal ruined portal design.\nRuined portals that generate underground do so at Y-level from 15 to , where is the highest block at the point of generation and is the height of the ruined portal structure. This means the terrain is always higher than or level with the top of the structure. Some ruined portal variants are short enough to generate completely on the surface.\nRuined portals that generate in windswept hills generate at y-level from 70 to .\nRuined portals that generate partially buried do so at y-level , plus a random integer from 2 to 8. This means that the structure has 2 to 8 layers raised above the surface.\nIn the Nether, ruined portals with air pockets generate from Y-level 32 to 100. Ruined portals without air pockets have a 50% chance to spawn from Y-level 27\u00a0to\u00a029, and a 50% chance to spawn from Y-level 29\u00a0to\u00a0100.\nMany blocks in ruined portals are replaced upon generation. A ruined portal is in a snowy biome if the &lt;a href=\"temperature\"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt; is less than 0.15.\nStructure.\nRuined portals generate incomplete portal frames composed of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and, sometimes along with &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, although nether portals cannot be activated with crying obsidian in the frame. Some frames generate flat on the ground, as if they toppled over. Others are free-standing separately, as if still being assembled/attached.\nAll ruined portals generate with a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; on Bedrock Edition, but on Java Edition the chest may be replaced if terrain overrides it. Each chest contains various golden items and items used to build portals such as &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny ruined portal generated in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; is surrounded with structures made of &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stone%20bricks\"&gt;stone bricks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"iron%20bars\"&gt;iron bars&lt;/a&gt;; in the Nether it is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"blackstone\"&gt;blackstone&lt;/a&gt; variants and &lt;a href=\"chain\"&gt;chain&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCurrently there are 13 variants: 10 normal size portals and 3 giant portals in varying states of decay.\n, ruined portals can be generated by the player by loading or with a &lt;a href=\"structure%20block\"&gt;structure block&lt;/a&gt;. These ruined portals generate as they are stored, meaning they are not modified as detailed in the Generation section above. All portals generated this way create air pockets if generated in other blocks.\nOverworld.\nNote that some blocks can be replaced with others (such as &lt;a href=\"Crying%20Obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt;) upon generation. A full list can be seen below.\nLoot.\nMost ruined portal structures contain enough obsidian to make a complete portal, although in the smaller portals, there may not enough because each obsidian has a 15% or 20% chance to be replaced by &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt;."}

Like their real-world counterparts, they also spawn in rivers and frozen rivers.\nBedrock Edition.\nSalmon spawn underwater at 12\u201332 blocks away from the player. Salmon spawn in groups of 3\u20135 in lukewarm, cold, normal, frozen oceans, their deep variants and rivers (including frozen rivers). In addition, salmon spawn on the surface (i.e., there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top).\nSalmon spawn in small, normal, and large sizes. 31.5% spawn as small, 52.6% spawn as normal, and 15.7% spawn as large.\nDrops.\nWhen killed, salmon drop:\nBehavior.\nSalmon tend to swim in schools (a maximum of seven salmon per school). Salmon can swim up approximately 4\u20135 blocks in waterfalls, emulating the behavior of real-world salmon that leap into and over small waterfalls to reach their spawning ground.\nThe player may collect salmon by a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; on it, which gives the player a &lt;a href=\"bucket%20of%20aquatic%20mob\"&gt;bucket of salmon&lt;/a&gt;. Salmon placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it. , an empty bucket may be used as well.\nWeaknesses.\nSalmon are unable to survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until eventually they start to suffocate and die. Salmon flip around on their sides. , they rotate when flipping. Salmon also cannot swim or breathe in &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; water.\n, salmon have a weakness to weapons that have the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, which also affects other fish and water/ocean mobs except &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Axolotl\"&gt;Axolotl&lt;/a&gt;s always attack salmon on sight.\nSounds.\nSalmon use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nSalmon have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

It generates in abundance in &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"beach\"&gt;beach&lt;/a&gt;es, generally in four-block-deep layers, supported by &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; below. Sand also generates as the &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; floor of lukewarm oceans, deep lukewarm oceans and warm oceans, in a single layer not supported by sandstone. It usually generates in quantities of 545 blocks per chunk on average in non-desert biomes.\nSand is also used to cover up &lt;a href=\"buried%20treasure\"&gt;buried treasure&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s depending on where the chest generates in. (In this case, sand is used to cover up buried treasure chests that generate in beaches and ocean floors that are composed of sand, but in some cases stone or sandstone might be used instead).\nSand also generates as part of warm &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;, some desert &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; houses, &lt;a href=\"desert%20well\"&gt;desert well&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"desert%20pyramid\"&gt;desert pyramid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRed sand generates naturally in &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; biomes and variants, always in a single layer. Unlike sand, there is no &lt;a href=\"red%20sandstone\"&gt;red sandstone&lt;/a&gt; that supports it below.\nBoth types of sand can spawn floating in the &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;. The floating cluster of sand falls when one of the sand blocks receives an update (e.g. when a block is placed near it or when a block near it is broken).\nPost-generation.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"brush\"&gt;brush&lt;/a&gt;ing &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20sand\"&gt;suspicious sand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20sand\"&gt;suspicious sand&lt;/a&gt; turns into regular &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrading.\n&lt;a href=\"Wandering%20trader\"&gt;Wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s sell 8 sand or 4 red sand for one &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\u200c\nRenewability.\nThe only renewable method of obtaining either type of sand is through the wandering trader. Due to its low spawning rate and limited number of trades per spawn, it is more practical to obtain it through other means.\nHowever, there is a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Block_and_item_duplication%23Gravity_Block_Duplication\"&gt;glitch that can be exploited to duplicate&lt;/a&gt; sand (as well as other gravity-affected blocks like concrete powder and gravel) that uses &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;sticky pistons&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"End%20portal\"&gt;End Portal&lt;/a&gt;. This is the majority of players' preferred means of obtaining renewable sand.\nUsage.\nIf the supporting block below a block of sand is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the sand block turns into a \"&lt;a href=\"falling%20block\"&gt;falling block&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;, which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity is available in the main article listed above.\nIf falling sand lands and covers the head of a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, the mob or player buried in it continuously receives &lt;a href=\"suffocation\"&gt;suffocation&lt;/a&gt; damage. If falling sand lands in the space occupied by a non-solid block (such as &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;) or a block &lt;a href=\"Solid%20block%23Height\"&gt;less than a full block tall&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;), the sand drops and turns into an &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;. If it falls onto a &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;, it falls slowly until it has gone through completely; if it touches the ground while still inside the cobweb, the sand becomes an item. Sand that falls onto a &lt;a href=\"Bubble%20Column%23Upward\"&gt;lifting bubble column&lt;/a&gt; floats on top of the water until the bubble column is blocked or removed.\nThough &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; does not break any blocks if it explodes underwater, if sand, &lt;a href=\"concrete%20powder\"&gt;concrete powder&lt;/a&gt; (in one-block-deep water only), or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; falls and covers the TNT before it explodes, blocks are broken as normal. This trick can be used to collect blocks underwater, or break into underwater structures such as the &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt; without mining.\nConstruction.\nSand can be used in the construction of &lt;a href=\"airlocks\"&gt;airlocks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; suffocation traps. Because sand falls, it can also be used for construction underwater while the player remains above the surface of the water.\nFarms.\nSand or red sand is required for farming &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;, and can also be used for farming &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;.\nHatching.\nA &lt;a href=\"turtle%20egg\"&gt;turtle egg&lt;/a&gt; can hatch only if it's on sand or red sand.\nNote Blocks.\nSand and red sand can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"snare drum\" sound.\nData values.\nBlock states.\n, sand uses the following block states:"}

In addition, &lt;a href=\"azalea\"&gt;azalea&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mangrove%20propagule\"&gt;mangrove propagule&lt;/a&gt;s can also grow trees.\nSaplings have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees. When a tree is to be grown, a height is chosen and then the ground and space above are checked; if the ground is bad or there is not space for the chosen height, the tree does not grow. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; can be used to speed up the growth of the sapling, even to grow the tree without sufficient light.\nSaplings can grow into trees when placed on all variants of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; (except &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s) or &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;s. The sapling requires a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of at least 9, and require a certain volume of space above the sapling, based on its type:\nIn addition:\nDirt blocks in the space above the sapling are an exception. Dirt blocks do not stop the sapling from growing. For most tree types, including giant versions, the dirt remains in place and the rest of the tree generates normally around it (it is possible to grow a tree that contains only one &lt;a href=\"log\"&gt;log&lt;/a&gt; block at the original sapling location, with a column of dirt above where the rest of the trunk should be and leaves spreading out from it). For the large variant of oak trees, the dirt blocks are replaced with log blocks wherever they would normally occur. , all types of log block and wood block and their stripped versions are also treated like dirt blocks (they don't stop growth). , log and wood blocks are treated like other block types and stop the sapling from growing if they are above it.\nWhen a sapling on a &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; grows into a tree, the grass block becomes a dirt block.\nBee nests.\nOak and birch &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any &lt;a href=\"flower\"&gt;flower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"flowering%20azalea\"&gt;flowering azalea&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"flowering%20azalea%20leaves\"&gt;flowering azalea leaves&lt;/a&gt; have a 5% chance to grow with a &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; and 1-3 bees in it.\nDecoration.\nAny kind of sapling can be placed in a &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;.\nFuel.\nSaplings can be used as a fuel in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 0.5 items per sapling.\nComposting.\nPlacing a sapling into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of saplings yields an average of 2.74 &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;."}

There are three different variants of the savanna biome.\nDescription.\nSavannas are usually bordered by &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"plain\"&gt;plain&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Acacia%20tree\"&gt;Acacia&lt;/a&gt; and small &lt;a href=\"oak%20tree\"&gt;oak tree&lt;/a&gt;s are the two types of trees that grow here; this is the only place where acacia trees naturally generate. As the savannas have arid climates, it never &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;s here and thus &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; can never naturally strike; however, overcast skies (and daytime hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s spawning in the case of &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;s) still apply. &lt;a href=\"Grass\"&gt;Grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; in the savanna take on an olive-green color, giving an illusion of dryness.\nSurvival in the normal savanna, along with its plateau variant, is generally easy. The acacia and oak trees provide a decent source of wood, tamed horses can allow for fast travel and outrunning hostile mobs, tamed llamas can serve as useful pack animals and villages can serve as a refuge and a way to trade items. However, the vast amounts of tall grass can prove to be a nuisance when building a shelter; additionally, it may serve as an obstacle when fighting hostile mobs, as the player might end up hitting the grass rather than the mob. Survival in the windswept savanna variant, however, is dangerous due to the extremes of the generated mountains.\nVariants.\nThere are three savanna biome variants (savanna, savanna plateau, and windswept savanna).\nSavanna.\nThe savanna is mostly flat biomes, with vast amounts of &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt; all over the terrain. Savanna typically generates bordering a &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; biome. \n&lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;s generates in savannas, which made mainly of terracotta, acacia &lt;a href=\"logs\"&gt;logs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt;; the bright-orange acacia planks make savanna villages easy to spot from a distance. &lt;a href=\"Pillager%20Outpost\"&gt;Pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s may generate as well.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nSavanna Plateau.\nThe savanna plateau is identical to the regular savanna, though &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt; do not generate here. This biome is found when a savanna generates on top of a plateau or beneath a stony mountain. &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt;s still spawn on the plateaus and this is the only savanna sub-biome where &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s spawn. Deep Dark biomes can also be generated under plateaus. Normal savanna won't generate deep dark on its own, but if there is plateau near as a starting point for the Deep Dark biome, it can be spread underneath a normal savannas too.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\n, savanna plateaus use the same mob spawning chances as regular savannas.\nWindswept Savanna.\nThe rare windswept savanna (formerly shattered savanna) variant generates in areas with high &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Weirdness\"&gt;weirdness&lt;/a&gt;, which means that the terrain is arguably the most chaotic in the game, a contrast from the otherwise flat savanna. It is full of extremely steep mountains, enormous overhangs, floating islands and huge &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;falls and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;falls, with higher and rougher terrain than the &lt;a href=\"windswept%20hill\"&gt;windswept hill&lt;/a&gt;s biome, and can often go past the layer 200. Large and deep lakes often form on the bases of the mountains.\nWindswept savanna biomes can often generate standalone bordering other biomes that aren't just the default savanna, with these biomes usually being temperate or warm. Windswept savannas can't generate in regions with cold or snowy biomes which means that these biomes can be found in extreme terrain.\nThe terrain is covered with a mixture of grass block patches and &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt; patches, with a large amount of exposed stones. &lt;a href=\"Tall%20grass\"&gt;Tall grass&lt;/a&gt; doesn't generate here . &lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;Village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s cannot generate in this biome.\nThe steep generated mountains make this variant almost unsuitable for shelter and even just exploring quite hazardous, due to the sharp cliffs often risking fatal fall damage if not above &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the giant overhangs often reduce skylight on the terrain below them, not only enough to spawn hostile mobs in daylight, but to produce complete darkness similar to &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, further adding to the difficulty of this biome.\nWindswept savannas uses the same mob spawning chances as regular savannas.&lt;br clear=all&gt;"}

Objectives track a number of points for entities, and are stored and displayed as integers with a full score range of \"-2,147,483,648\" to \"2,147,483,647\".\nAn objective's name is used internally for referencing in commands, target arguments, and the file format. , the allowed character set for it includes all lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, underscore, period, minus and plus. , it can contain any character.\nAn objective's display name is a &lt;a href=\"raw%20JSON%20text\"&gt;raw JSON text&lt;/a&gt; and is displayed publicly in various situations. It does not have to be unique.\nAn objective's criterion determines its behavior\u2014primarily what to track. Lists of valid criteria are provided below.\nAn entity's score in any objective can be changed via &lt;a href=\"%23Command%20reference\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; unless it's read-only (see &lt;a href=\"%23Criteria\"&gt;#Criteria&lt;/a&gt;). It can be increased by, decreased by, or set to a given amount with commands.\nA score holder is a player's name or an entity's UUID that has scores in an objective. The player name doesn\u2019t need to belong to an actual &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. Scores of non-player entities can be changed only by commands, and not by game system. Unlike players, when a non-player entity dies, its scores are deleted.\nCommands can check entity scores by using &lt;a href=\"target%20selector\"&gt;target selector&lt;/a&gt; with the codice_1 argument (syntaxed codice_2. This argument uses &lt;name&gt; to specify the internal name of the tested-for objective.\nCriteria.\nBedrock Edition.\nCurrently, codice_4 is the only criterion supported. As such, score can only be changed by commands.\nDisplay slots.\nVia the command (&lt;a href=\"%23Command%20reference\"&gt;see command reference&lt;/a&gt;), players' scores in specific objectives can be displayed in certain 'slots' in-game. Each 'display slot' can show one objective at a time, and multiple 'display slots' may be used for the same or different objectives.\nTags.\nTags are a simple list of single-word strings stored directly in the &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Entity%20format\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Data%20tags\"&gt;data tag&lt;/a&gt; of an entity. As with objectives, tags are case-sensitive.\nTarget selectors can be used to check whether an entity has a tag with the &lt;a href=\"Target%20selectors%23Selecting%20targets%20by%20tag\"&gt;\"tag\" argument&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeams.\nA team's all variables are: a name, a display name, a member name prefix, a member name suffix, a boolean allow friendly fire option, and a list of players who are on the team.\nA team's Name is used internally for reference in commands, target arguments, and the file format. It is a single, case-sensitive word.\nA team's DisplayName is a JSON text component of one or more case-sensitive word, and is displayed publicly in various situations.\nA team's Member Name Prefix &amp; Member Name Suffix are inserted before and after the names of players on the team, respectively. Prefixes and suffixes are used in the chat, the active players list, the sidebar, and above team members' heads. These can be edited with respective commands.\nThe AllowFriendlyFire option controls whether or not members of a team are able to damage each other. This defaults to \"true\", leaving &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; mechanics unchanged\u2014ergo, players can harm their teammates. When set to \"false\", however, players on the same team are prevented from directly damaging each other with melee attacks, bows, and Splash Potions of Harming. Note that players on the same team may still inflict negative status effects on each other with potions, even if &lt;AllowFriendlyFire&gt; is false. Some non-player entities in a team are also affected by this.\nIt is important to note that each individual team member can only be on one team; teams cannot share entities.\nCommands can be used to check whether team members exist by using target selection with the \"team\" argument. (The '!' character may be placed before a name to check for entities \"not\" on a team.) For example, inputting into a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; provides &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt; output if any player exists on the red team. Conversely, provides output when there are \"no\" players on the red team. allows output when \"any\" player is on at least one team, and allows output when \"no\" players are on any teams.\nCommand reference.\nFor more details, see &lt;a href=\"Commands/scoreboard\"&gt;Commands/scoreboard&lt;/a&gt;.\nNBT format.\nThe file scoreboard.dat in the 'data' folder of a Minecraft world stores the scoreboard data for that world as a GZip'd &lt;a href=\"NBT\"&gt;NBT&lt;/a&gt; file:"}

The sculk blooms consumes the mob.\nDuring a sculk bloom, the catalyst gives off soul &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt;, and creates a patch of &lt;a href=\"sculk\"&gt;sculk&lt;/a&gt; blocks with &lt;a href=\"sculk%20vein\"&gt;sculk vein&lt;/a&gt;s around them. Blooming sculk can replace blocks in the &lt;a href=\"Tag%23blocks%20sculk%20replaceable\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the surface materials of most of the biomes in all three dimensions. Sculk blooms may occasionally result in the growth of a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;. If a mob dies near multiple sculk catalysts, this does not increase the number of sculk-related blocks generated. Only the sculk catalyst that is closest to the mob will bloom.\nSculk blooms only occur in response to mob deaths and player deaths. All other experience sources are ignored.\nBlooming Range.\nSculk blooms occur for any mob death:\nSculk blooms might be able to trigger on other &lt;a href=\"sculk%20family\"&gt;sculk family&lt;/a&gt; blocks that are part of the network too. \nSculk Charging.\nWhen the mob is consumed by a sculk bloom, it won't drop any expierence. The sculk bloom event converts the mob's experience into sculk charges. 1 sculk charge is generated per experience point the mob would have dropped if it was killed by a player or a tamed wolf. The sculk charges are given to the block beneath the mob. Up to 1000 charges can be present in one block, but this is unlikely under normal circumstances.\nSculk Growth.\nSculk growth is an event where a sculk bloom starts on a non-sculk block. A sculk bloom always either starts on a sculk block, or starts with a sculk growth on a valid block. The following blocks can be transformed by sculk growth:, these blocks are marked under the &lt;a href=\"tag\"&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt;.\nSculk growth can't happen on a block that is completely covered in non-air, non-&lt;a href=\"Sculk%20family\"&gt;sculk-family&lt;/a&gt; blocks.\nSculk Patches.\nSculk growth will cause a patch of blocks to be converted into sculk. This patch is composed of a sculk block in the center, and up to 4 sculk veins on the sides. Sculk veins will not be placed on top of sculk blocks, and if sculk growth happens to a block that is covered with sculk veins already, the sculk veins will be removed.\nDischarging.\nIf the sculk bloom produced an excessively large amount of sculk charges, the sculk growth can discharge the sculk charges. This discharge can cause the sculk charge to spread across the network, and grow the network larger. This is also referred to as sculk spreading.\nTo be exact, the sculk charge is discharged to adjacent sculk blocks.\nSculk Construction.\nIf a sculk block has sculk charge, and it is more than 4 blocks from a catalyst, it might try to do sculk construction. There is a 10% chance for the sculk block to attempt construction, and construction will only be attempted if there is air above the sculk block. If construction does trigger, the sculk block uses 10 charges to grow either a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;. Construction has a 90% chance to spawn a sculk sensor, and a has a 10% chance to spawn a sculk shrieker. These probabilities are mutually exclusive, so construction always spawns one of the other. However, construction cannot happen if there are 2 or more sensors within a 9\u00d73\u00d79 box with the bottom center of the box centered on the sculk bloom's origin (or within and in relative coordinates). A sculk shrieker generated by sculk construction will have the tag set to .\nBlooming without Spreading.\nSculk growth and discharge require \"the potential for\" experience in order to grow sculk. By \"potential\", I mean the mob has to be able to give experience when killed by a player (this is called a \"player kill\"). Furthermore, it always blooms for a mob death, regardless of whether the mob had experience to offer. This seems to be the intended behavior.\nA &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; dying in range of the sculk network can also trigger a sculk bloom. The sculk bloom will consume all of the experience the player would have dropped, much like if the player was a mob. No sculk charges will be generated if the player dies with zero experience, but the nearest sculk catalyst will still bloom. If keep inventory is on, the sculk bloom behaves the same way it would if the player had zero experience, since keep inventory makes the experience inaccessible.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s death can trigger a sculk bloom, but it does not produce any sculk charges, The ender dragon will still drop experience just like it normally would. However, new behavior for \"ender dragon blooms\" might be implemented in the future.\nSculk Networks.\nSculk blocks will connect to eachother forming a network, if a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt;s is adjacent to one of the sculk blocks. This network might includes other &lt;a href=\"sculk%20family\"&gt;sculk family&lt;/a&gt; blocks . Sculk blocks can only connect via orthogonal adjacency, not the diagonals.\nWhile discharging, a sculk charge spreads like electricity in a daisy chain, moving from one sculk block to an adjacent sculk block, one block at a time. If a sculk charge tries to discharge into a non-sculk block, it will try to cause a sculk growth event on that block. Each time a sculk block discharges, it also makes sure that all the non-sculk blocks adjacent to it are covered in sculk veins.\nThe sculk charge in a sculk block will be destroyed / lost if the sculk block is destroyed / broken."}

When active, it changes to a lighter block state without a change to the light level.\nVibration detection.\nSculk sensors detect vibrations in an 8 block spherical radius around it. Vibrations are caused by various events, such as a player and mobs walking, placing or breaking blocks, gliding with &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, items falling on the ground, a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; extending or a wet &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; shaking itself off. While &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;, a player is not detected. Walking, falling, dropping items, or shooting a projectile all trigger the sensor.\nWhen a vibration is made within the range of a sculk sensor, a signal travels from the vibration source to the sensor at a speed of one block per &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt; (20 blocks per second). When the signal arrives, the sensor is activated for . The sensor cannot detect any other vibrations while activated or while a signal is traveling to it.\nSculk sensors have a cooldown period of after being placed or after deactivating. During this short cooldown period, they cannot detect vibrations. This prevents them from activating when a contraption it is powering is being unpowered.\nSculk sensors don't detect vibrations from other sculk sources or the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wool\"&gt;Wool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt;s have a special interaction with sculk sensors. If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect the placed wool nor vibrations behind it. Specifically, if the ray joining the cube centers of the sensor block and the vibration source passes through any wool blocks, the noise is muffled. If the ray passes diagonally through the edge between two blocks, either one or the other block may muffle it but not both. Sculk sensors are not able to detect footsteps or dropped items on wool blocks or carpet, and they are also unable to detect &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;dropped items&lt;/a&gt; of wool and carpets.\nSculk sensors pass on the vibrations made by players to &lt;a href=\"sculk%20shrieker\"&gt;sculk shrieker&lt;/a&gt;s within 8 blocks of the sensor. For example, an item dropped by a player triggers the shrieker, but an item dropped by a dispenser or from a broken block does not; a player flying around with elytra triggers the shrieker, but a &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; flying around does not. Alarms can be blocked by wool placed in between the sensor and shrieker, similar to how wool can block vibrations from reaching the sensor itself.\nRedstone emission.\nSculk sensors emit a &lt;a href=\"redstone\"&gt;redstone&lt;/a&gt; signal when they are activated. The strength of the redstone signal is to the distance the vibration signal traveled \u2013 the closer the vibration is to the sculk sensor, the stronger the redstone signal is, so it reaches the maximum redstone signal strength when the vibration is directly on top of the sensor.\nVibration amplitudes.\nEach vibration in the game falls under a certain amplitude value. This value can be measured with a &lt;a href=\"comparator\"&gt;comparator&lt;/a&gt;. With the right contraption, the player could detect if a certain action has occurred or is occurring nearby.\nVibration resonance.\nWhen a sculk sensor detects a vibration, any adjacent &lt;a href=\"block%20of%20amethyst\"&gt;block of amethyst&lt;/a&gt; will reemit a vibration on the same frequency that the sculk sensor detected.\nThings which are not detected.\nThe following occurrences, despite presumably causing physical motion, do not produce vibrations and therefore cannot be detected: \nThe following cases have been confirmed to be intentional: \nPiston interactivity.\nSculk sensors are immovable. &lt;a href=\"Piston\"&gt;Piston&lt;/a&gt;s cannot push them, and sticky pistons cannot push or pull them. &lt;a href=\"Slime%20block\"&gt;Slime block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s do not stick to sculk sensors and have no effect whether the slime block or honey block is being pushed or pulled.\nSounds.\nA sculk sensor is silent if &lt;a href=\"waterlogging\"&gt;waterlogged&lt;/a&gt;. It can still detect vibration, but does not produce sounds itself.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA sculk sensor has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block."}

Shriekers that generate naturally in the deep dark will inflict &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; and may summon a &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; when triggered, but those that are placed by a player or &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt; will never summon wardens or inflict Darkness under any circumstance.\nObtaining.\nNatural generation.\nSculk shriekers can be found infrequently within the &lt;a href=\"deep%20dark\"&gt;deep dark&lt;/a&gt; biome, and they are much more common within &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nSculk shriekers can be mined with any tool, but hoes are the quickest. It drops 5 experience when mined without &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. When a sculk shrieker is broken it loses the ability to summon the warden, even if mined with Silk Touch.\nPost-generation.\nA &lt;a href=\"sculk%20catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt; has a 1% chance of generating a sculk shrieker on top of a &lt;a href=\"sculk\"&gt;sculk&lt;/a&gt; block. These shriekers do not summon the warden.\nUsage.\nSculk shriekers \"shriek\" after being activated. A sculk shrieker activates when any player stands on the black part in the center of the block, even when . Sculk shriekers are also activated by any &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt; triggered within an 8-block spherical radius of itself, but only if the vibration was caused by a player. However, a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20sensor\"&gt;sculk sensor&lt;/a&gt; cannot activate the sculk shrieker if the line between the two contains a wool block. The shrieker shrieks for exactly 90 game ticks (4.5 seconds). \nSpawning wardens.\nSculk shriekers that naturally generate in the deep dark biome are capable of inflicting the &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; effect upon players and summoning wardens. If a sculk shrieker is placed by a player or generated via a &lt;a href=\"sculk%20catalyst\"&gt;sculk catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, the tag is set to , and therefore a warden cannot be summoned and Darkness cannot be inflicted by that sculk shrieker. Each time a naturally generated sculk shrieker is activated, it adds 1 to a \"warning\" level to alert the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;. The warning level is specific to each \"player\", not each sculk shrieker, meaning that the same player can activate a different sculk shrieker for each of the four times, and a warden still spawns on the fourth activation, even though any particular shrieker had been activated once. If a player does not activate any sculk shrieker, the warning level decreases by 1 every 10 minutes (12000 ticks). After the shrieking ends, all players in Survival or Adventure mode within 40 blocks are given the &lt;a href=\"Darkness\"&gt;Darkness&lt;/a&gt; effect for 12 seconds. After a warden is summoned, a player's warning level does not reset back to 0, meaning multiple wardens can be summoned.\nNaturally generated sculk shriekers have a 10-second cooldown per \"player\". This means that if a player triggers one shrieker, they are completely unable to trigger any other shrieker within 10 seconds. The cooldown period includes the 4.5-second shrieking, which means 5.5 seconds after the previous shrieking ends, the player can activate sculk shriekers again.\nWhen a player's warning level reaches level 4, the sculk shrieker attempts to spawn a warden after its shrieking ends. Up to 20 attempts are made to spawn a warden within an 11\u00d713\u00d711 box centered on the shrieker. If there isn't another warden within 24 blocks, a warden emerges from the ground. The warden always spawns at the highest available block. If the shrieker is broken before it ends shrieking, the warden spawns immediately as a result. If all 20 spawning attempts fail, a loud roaring sound is played.\n, if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to , naturally generated sculk shriekers behave as if they are placed by a player: they do shriek, but there is no shrieking cooldown, the player's warning level does not increase, no Darkness effect is inflicted, and no warden spawns.\nIf the player that triggered the sculk shrieker is outside the shrieker's range when the shrieking ends, the sculk shrieker does not apply the Darkness effect to any player. The player's warning level still increases by 1.\nIt is possible to make a warden spawn from a distance, by shooting a &lt;a href=\"projectile\"&gt;projectile&lt;/a&gt; into the direction of known sensors that are near shriekers.\nThe warnings have unique subtitles at different levels of warning: 1) \"Warden approaches.\" 2) \"Warden advances.\" 3) \"Warden draws close.\"\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA sculk shrieker has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nHistory.\n \n "}

They can be considered a precursor to &lt;a href=\"smooth%20stone\"&gt;smooth stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nSeamless slabs were never intended to be obtainable by any means, and as such inventory editors are generally the most reliable method of obtaining them.\nThere exist methods of block transmutation that may be used to obtain seamless stone slabs, allowing them to exist in block form, and then be broken to collect them in item form.\nDue to their nature of being extreme data values, and the fact that all of these data values eventually became used in-game, worlds containing the slabs that eventually used said values can be downgraded to obtain seamless slabs in an earlier version. This is, however, risky, and can cause crashes and world corruption.\nBreaking.\nSeamless stone slabs require a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; to mine, dropping themselves when broken.\nUsage.\nSeamless stone slabs can be used for any of the things other stone-type slabs can be used for, aside from being a crafting ingredient. They can be placed in the exact same way other slabs can.\nModel.\nThe seamless stone slab can be visually distinguished from normal smooth stone slabs via the texture they use: while smooth stone slabs have a dedicated side texture as to make single slabs appear polished, and double slabs appear to be composed of two single slabs, the seamless stone slab's side texture appears cut off in single form, and in double form identical to smooth stone. Indeed, the seamless stone double slab was itself a precursor to smooth stone, which would end up being implemented intentionally.\nThe use of a single texture on all sides is a trend that can be seen in many other extreme metadata variants: &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, which also eventually became obtainable intentionally, &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hay%20bale\"&gt;hay bale&lt;/a&gt;s, and Bedrock Edition-exclusive cases of &lt;a href=\"chiseled%20quartz%20block\"&gt;chiseled quartz block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"quartz%20pillar\"&gt;quartz pillar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"purpur%20pillar\"&gt;purpur pillar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bone%20block\"&gt;bone block&lt;/a&gt;s.

However, structure locations still remain different between \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld generation.\nWhenever the game has to generate a new world, it calls upon an algorithm known as \"Perlin noise\". This algorithm outputs a pseudo-random value that is then used to determine the characteristics and features of the world. However, the algorithm always outputs the same value each time for a constant starting point (seed). Thus, the same seed generates the same terrain every time.\nA world's seed is set when that world is created. By default, it is decided automatically, but it can also be set manually. Setting and reusing a seed from one world generates the same world. Either a number or a word/phrase can be used, including negatives. If a word/phrase is used, it is converted into a 32-bit integer.\nWhenever the world generation algorithm is updated (usually by adding new biomes to the game), the same seed no longer generates the same terrain. If the seed or generator changes in a saved world, new &lt;a href=\"chunks\"&gt;chunks&lt;/a&gt; are based on the new seed and no longer match those from the old seed. Deleted chunks can regenerate if the seed and generator remain the same, but changes if either the seed or generator changes. In fact, deleting chunks is sometimes done to let newly-introduced features appear in an old world; see &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Updating%20old%20oceans%20in%201.13%20using%20MCEdit\"&gt;Tutorials/Updating old oceans in 1.13 using MCEdit&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause seeds are simply random values read into an algorithm and not actually names of different worlds, using a certain seed does not result in a world with any relevance to the value of that seed. For instance, using a &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; name as the seed does not necessarily result in the creation of a world with primarily that biome, nor does it spawn the player within the said biome.\nDetermining the seed.\n, the player can enter the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; to view the world's seed. This command is available in singleplayer worlds even if cheats are off. The player can also select 'Re-create' in the Worlds menu to see the seed.\n, the seed can be found on the world options screen. There are also &lt;a href=\"seed%20templates\"&gt;seed templates&lt;/a&gt; that offers the player several pre-set seeds to generate worlds with specific features near the spawn point. Additionally, the beta version has a visible seed on the top of the screen.\nTechnical.\nRealms.\n, a player can type in the chat. , the seed is not visible when playing on Realms.\nGeneral.\nIf the seed contains characters other than numbers or is greater than or equal to 20 characters in length, the Java codice_1 function is used to generate a number seed. This restricts \"Minecraft\" to a subset of the possible worlds to 232 (or 4,294,967,296), due to the datatype used. Number seeds or a default world seed must be used to access the full set of possible worlds (264, or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616).\nOverlap between editions.\nAll \"Java\" and Bedrock Edition seeds in the range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, generate the same terrain and &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in both \"Java\" and Bedrock editions, although with differing structures, decorator placements, carver caves, and mob spawns.\nGeneration quirks.\nThrough certain seeds, it is possible to observe interesting effects.\nChanging terrain without changing some structures.\nOnly certain sections of the seed are used to generate specific features within the world. It is possible to generate multiple worlds with identical cave systems, Nether biomes and other arrangements of generated structures simply by converting the seed into binary and tweaking the desired bits. An example is the seed generator using only the first 48 bits to generate cave systems and badlands clay banding layers.\nRepetition.\nCertain seeds return 0 in the internal code, causing infinite arrays of &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s and other structures to generate. , the seed returns 0 on the first call and returns 0 on the second call, causing mineshafts, caves and underwater ravines to loop on the X and Z axes respectively.\nFeatures in seeds can repeat, such as decorations. These generate diagonally.\n, diagonal cave, ravine, dungeon, and decoration repetition occur with the seeds and . Mineshaft generation repeats vertically in the seeds and .\nAny seed calculated as also generate maps with repeating features.\nTrivia.\nNotable \"Java Edition\" seeds.\nThe following map seeds have, at one point or another, been used for generating official \"Minecraft\" maps and resources or otherwise significant community material."}

{"id": "12803", "revid": "54114542", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12803", "title": "Pocket Edition", "text": "Minecraft: Pocket Edition (informally known as MCPE or PE) was the former title of the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" developed by &lt;a href=\"Mojang%20Studios\"&gt;Mojang Studios&lt;/a&gt; for mobile devices before &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.0\"&gt;1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, although subsequent builds are still commonly (if erroneously) referred to as \"Pocket Edition\". \"Pocket Edition\" introduced the Bedrock Engine, which was later ported to non-mobile platforms as four other editions of \"Minecraft\": \"&lt;a href=\"Windows%2010%20Edition\"&gt;Windows 10 Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gear%20VR%20Edition\"&gt;Gear VR Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Apple%20TV%20Edition\"&gt;Apple TV Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20TV%20Edition\"&gt;Fire TV Edition&lt;/a&gt;\". When these editions received the &lt;a href=\"Better%20Together%20Update\"&gt;Better Together Update&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Edition\" subtitle was removed, and the official name for all of these editions became \"Minecraft\". To assist with clarification, the \"Minecraft\" community referred to these versions collectively as due to Bedrock being the name of the codebase from which they all derive.\n\"Pocket Edition\" was initially launched exclusively for the on Google Play for US$6.99 on August 16, 2011. It was later released for other devices on October 7, 2011, and on November 17, 2011. On September 13, 2012, the \"Pocket Edition\" was made available for purchase on the Amazon Appstore. \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_PE_Lite\"&gt;Minecraft Pocket Edition Lite&lt;/a&gt;\", which was essentially version 0.2.1 without world save functionality and had limited inventory items, was available until October 21, 2013. The version was released on the Microsoft Store on December 10, 2014. The Windows Phone 8.1 version (which also ran on ) was discontinued after the release of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.16.2%20alpha\"&gt;v0.16.2&lt;/a&gt; on November 18, 2016, and was later replaced by a release for Windows 10 Mobile only (which was free to owners of the previous Windows Phone 8.1 version) on February 22, 2017 starting with &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.3\"&gt;1.0.3&lt;/a&gt;. After the release of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, \"Pocket Edition\" for Fire OS was no longer available for Fire TV, but the new, more expensive \"&lt;a href=\"Fire%20TV%20Edition\"&gt;Fire TV Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" was free to its previous owners.\nGameplay.\nThe objective of the game remains the same as its counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. Like its counterparts, \"Pocket Edition\" also has &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; elements present in other versions of the game such as &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt;, and dimensions like the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"multiplayer\"&gt;multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode is cross-platform compatible between all touch-screen devices capable of running Pocket Edition.\nThe &lt;a href=\"HUD\"&gt;HUD&lt;/a&gt; and other elements are adapted to mobile standards of gameplay. Interactions are made via touchscreen (both the iOS and Android versions of \"Pocket Edition\" have the same gameplay). To comply with the disadvantages of touchscreen gameplay, several features were revised. For instance, the &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; system uses the &lt;a href=\"MATTIS\"&gt;MATTIS&lt;/a&gt; system and items are disposed of by long-tapping their icon on the toolbar. For better visibility on mobile screens, blocks being aimed at are highlighted rather than outlined. Unlike mobile's crafting menu, Windows 10 edition's crafting menu is similar to Java and Console crafting menu. The game was released with graphics akin to that of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha&lt;/a&gt; (bright green grass blocks, old cobblestone texture, etc.), but as of &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.8.0%20alpha\"&gt;v0.8.0&lt;/a&gt;, graphics have become equivalent to the \"Java Edition\" but also including light tinting and shading affected by the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;'s position. Differences from the \"Java Edition\" include:\nDevelopment.\nRelease.\nOn May 22, 2009, early in \"Minecraft's\" development, &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; indicated he had \"vague plans about porting minecraft for Android in the future.\"\nA video of an early prototype was released on Twitter, showing the game on the Xperia Play. The alpha version was later released and became no longer exclusive to the Xperia Play on October 7, 2011. The non-exclusive version was going to be released on September 29 for Android but there were several severe bugs that needed to be fixed; the release was delayed until October 7.\nAlpha.\nAfter the initial releases for iOS and Android, updates were released in parallel, with the same features being added for both platforms. During the Alpha stage, various aspects of gameplay were introduced into Pocket Edition including: &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, more &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; and more game modes to bring it closer to the Java Edition. As the Minecraft Pocket Edition development team works closely, often blocks released on the Java Edition are released around the same time for the Pocket Edition. Certain features were also tested on Pocket Edition before their Java Edition releases, such as &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s and their related items, and also &lt;a href=\"block%20model\"&gt;block model&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFull Release.\nOn November 11, 2016, the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.0.0\"&gt;1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Ender%20Update\"&gt;Ender Update&lt;/a&gt;) was announced. It was released on December 19, 2016.\nBuilds.\nStarting on November 22, 2013, &lt;a href=\"Mojang\"&gt;Mojang&lt;/a&gt; began to publicly release testing versions of full updates to Android users who opt into the beta program, in order to get major feedback, especially for bug reporting. This enabled the official updates to be considerably more stable.\nVersions from 0.8.0 to 0.12.1 required opting into a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//play.google.com/apps/testing/com.mojang.minecraftpe\"&gt;Google+ group&lt;/a&gt; to receive development builds. Players would then see development updates appear as normal updates in the Play Store. On July 17, 2015, the Google+ group was removed due to the amount of spam and advertisements that the group attracted. On November 3, 2015, the PE Beta team published a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//pocketbeta.minecraft.net\"&gt;dedicated blog&lt;/a&gt; that was subsequently used for users to opt into the 0.13.0 beta program and to display changelogs for these development builds.\nSuccess.\nAs of December 2013, Pocket Edition had sold 16.5 million copies, while in the same time, Java Edition had sold 13 million. These calculations came out after the 0.8.0 update.\nOn December 2, 2016, &lt;a href=\"Marsh%20Davies\"&gt;Marsh Davies&lt;/a&gt; announced that Pocket Edition had sold over 40 million copies (at the time, Java Edition had sold over 24 million).\nIt is also usually in the top 10 and regularly #1 in the Apple App Store's and Google Play's \"Paid Apps\" Section in the \"Top Charts\".\nControls.\nMobile devices (iOS, Android &amp; Others).\nThe iOS, Android and other versions feature a D-pad at the bottom-left corner of the screen, which controls movement. When moving forward, two strafing buttons appear. The jump button is located on the bottom-right corner, and the sneak is in the center of the D-pad. Sneaking can be achieved by double tapping this button. The location of the jump button and the sneak button can be swapped, in the controls section of the options menu. Note that when moving toward an adjacent block that is one level higher than the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, the player automatically jumps up the block. This can also be disabled in the controls section of the options menu. One can place blocks by tapping the screen in a desired location. Destroying blocks is similar to the Java Edition's way, but rather than clicking the mouse, the player taps and holds. Split controls can also be used, which allows the player to place and break blocks similarly to Java Edition, where a crosshair appears and allows the player to place blocks using that. To change to the camera view, the player can go to Settings &gt; Video. There should be a dropdown button displaying the player's current view, and tapping on it opens a dropdown menu allowing the player to choose different camera views. To open the inventory screen, tap the triple dotted button on the right of the hot bar. The player can touch and hold an item in the &lt;a href=\"hot%20bar\"&gt;hot bar&lt;/a&gt; to throw it, and if the hot bar contains a stack of items, it throws the entire stack. The player cannot divide it unless interfacing with a container (chest, furnace). The player can however switch to the Java Edition menu system via settings.\nXperia Play.\nControlled with slide out PlayStation keyboard.\nTablet features.\nAll devices have an option to enable Split Touch Controls, which may be more suitable for bigger screens. There is a crosshair and dragging a finger across the screen lets the player rotate the camera. \nOther than the screen size difference allowing any number of slots in the hotbar, the tablet version of the game is the same as other versions, hence the ability to play multiplayer cross-platform with other devices.\n\"Windows 10 Edition\".\n\"Windows 10 Edition\" has 3 control options:\nSystem requirements.\nSome devices below these specifications have been known to work fine either with or without custom ROM images, kernels, and of the CPU. However, the CPU is not supported due to its lack of the floating-point unit. The processor Tegra 2 is also not supported because the processor has no support for Neon.\n\"China Edition\".\nShortly before the release of 1.2, the game company licensed \"Minecraft\" in mainland China. The original version is no longer available in the Chinese app store. A separate edition based on \"Pocket Edition\" is instead available for free, with a marketplace where players can buy maps, skins, mods and resource packs with Emeralds (an in game currency that can be bought with real money or by logging in every day).\nShortly after the release of \"Minecraft: China Edition\", an update was released on iOS devices for the original version titled &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%201.1.7\"&gt;1.1.7&lt;/a&gt;. This update disables the &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt;."}

They generate individually after the generation of the world.\nRabbits of the following colors spawn in the following biomes:\nCreamy rabbits are the most common rabbit color and are found only in deserts and its variants. White and black and white rabbits are also quite common and spawn in snowy biomes such as &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grove\"&gt;grove&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20slopes\"&gt;snowy slopes&lt;/a&gt;. Default rabbit colors such as brown, black and salt and pepper spawn naturally in &lt;a href=\"flower%20forest\"&gt;flower forest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;s, but can also spawn in any other non-snowy biome via spawn eggs, commands, spawners or breeding. In all these places, groups of an adult and one to two babies spawn.\n, up to three kits spawn in flower forests and rabbits can also spawn in frozen aquatic biomes: &lt;a href=\"snowy%20beach\"&gt;snowy beach&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"frozen%20ocean\"&gt;frozen ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"frozen%20river\"&gt;frozen river&lt;/a&gt;s.\n, rabbits can also be found in &lt;a href=\"giant%20tree%20taiga\"&gt;giant tree taiga&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn taigas, &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"foxes\"&gt;foxes&lt;/a&gt; are also found. If left alone, these may quickly kill rabbits, so rabbits are generally more plentiful in the desert, flowery or icy biomes.\n&lt;a href=\"%23The%20Killer%20Bunny\"&gt;The Killer Bunny&lt;/a&gt; does not spawn naturally and must instead be spawned using the command, although it is exclusive to .\nDrops.\nWhen killed, an adult rabbit drops:\nBehavior.\nRabbits hop around aimlessly instead of walking. They can jump up almost 2 blocks in height. They slowly approach &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s holding &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s within 8 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s. They don't follow the players that hold &lt;a href=\"carrot%20on%20a%20stick\"&gt;carrot on a stick&lt;/a&gt; although &lt;a href=\"pig\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;s do. Rabbits also jump off of cliffs to reach carrots but do not go into &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; for them. They randomly flee around if attacked. All non-hostile rabbits avoid players within 8 blocks and avoid most hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s within 4 blocks (except &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s). They also avoid &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; within 10 blocks.\nIf is codice_1, rabbits find and eat mature carrot &lt;a href=\"crop\"&gt;crop&lt;/a&gt;s / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1. This reduces the growth stage by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.\nWild &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es, and stray &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s track down and kill any rabbits.\nBreeding.\nRabbits can be &lt;a href=\"Breeding\"&gt;bred&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"golden%20carrot\"&gt;golden carrot&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"dandelion\"&gt;dandelion&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBaby rabbits usually inherit the same type of fur as one of the parents (47.5% chance of each), but there is a 5% chance for the baby to have the fur type matching the current &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;. Baby rabbits grow to adulthood after 20 minutes, although their growth can be slowly accelerated using carrots, golden carrots or dandelions; each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.\nDespite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.\nA rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.\n and , baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent .\nVariations.\nRabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins. Skins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold (cream) fur, and salt and pepper fur. The &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; determines the skin used:\nThere are two special variants of rabbits:\nThe Killer Bunny.\nThe killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to that is hostile toward &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s, foxes, and wolves. Its fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes. It can be spawned only by using the command. It appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\".\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit. It moves in a style similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;. Once it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; on Normal difficulty. If the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player. Killer bunnies are immune to the &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any &lt;a href=\"foxes\"&gt;foxes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, including tamed wolves. These mobs, in return, attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature. It still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.\nThe killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, despite its hostile nature.\nToast.\nNaming a rabbit Toast (using either a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; or a renamed &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black Dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit. Other than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed. When Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming. If the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves. Like the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.\nThis rabbit is the skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/27hjog/to_themogminer_my_bunny_is_missing_please_help_me/\"&gt;missing rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Holtz\"&gt;Ryan Holtz&lt;/a&gt; implemented as a memorial.\nSounds.\nRegular rabbits use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events. Killer bunnies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nRabbits have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\nVideo.\nNote: this video is outdated as rabbits can no longer be tamed, rabbits are smaller now, and the killer rabbit is now called the killer bunny."}

They can sometimes break a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20door\"&gt;wooden door&lt;/a&gt; in Normal or Hard &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; if they cannot open the door normally. &lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"illusioner\"&gt;illusioner&lt;/a&gt;s gain extra movement speed without any &lt;a href=\"effects\"&gt;effects&lt;/a&gt;. This causes evokers to sprint much faster than the player. Evokers exhibit normal attack behavior, but if they do not have a target, they sprint back and forth.\n, a vindicator spawned in a raid gains the ability to break doors in Normal difficulty, but does not actively seek doors. They try to break the door only when passing by.\nCaptains.\n, when a wave captain is killed, other illagers in the raid try to pick up the banner dropped by the previous leader; the illager that retrieves the banner becomes the new wave captain. \nA player does not receive the Bad Omen effect when killing the &lt;a href=\"patrol%20captain\"&gt;patrol captain&lt;/a&gt; within a village. The captain is always a vindicator upon spawning, if possible.\nRaid wave spawning.\nThe raid spawns several waves of raider mobs. If a raid wave begins while an illager is somehow already present inside the village, the wave does not spawn at all and entirely fills up with however many existing illagers there are; When these illagers are defeated, the raid resumes as normal. , to find a valid spawn target location at the beginning of each raid wave, there are 3 spawn attempt phases with 20 attempts per phase. For each attempt, a random location is chosen a certain radius away from the raid center (64 blocks in the first phase, 32 in the second, and 0 in the third) at a random horizontal angle, with fractional results rounded down. Additionally, a random 0\u20134 is added to X and Z coordinates. , the exact spawning mechanics are unknown, but the raid can spawn in the 128x32x128 region around the village center. In effect, the three spawn attempt areas are two rings and a 5\u00d75 square. The target height is always on top of the topmost non-air block. For spawn location to be valid, the block underneath must have a solid opaque top face or be snow. \n&lt;a href=\"Spawn%23Spawn%20conditions\"&gt;Valid spawn&lt;/a&gt; blocks include full blocks, upside-down slabs/stairs, soul sand, and packed/blue ice, but not glass, leaves, some light-emitting blocks (they do spawn on crying obsidian and jack-o-lantern), trapdoors, regular ice, bottom slabs, or carpet. the raid can spawn on any block except leaves and scaffolding. Any light level is fine and player proximity does not matter. Waves tend to spawn near or at the last location they spawned at. The location must be in an entity-ticking chunk. If the game is unable to find a spawn location, the raid ends. Once a valid location is found, the horn sounds and all raider mobs for that wave spawn there at once. They then spread out and move toward the village. Once all raiders are killed, there is a 15-second cooldown before the next wave. However, if the last raider happens to move outside a spherical radius of 112 blocks from raid center, or the entire wave spawns outside that radius (which can happen with large differences in Y-level), then the next wave spawns immediately. Raiders that are part of a raid do not despawn naturally and do not contribute to the mob cap, but resume despawning once the raid is over or they leave it.\nRaid wave composition.\n\"Java Edition\".\nThe number of waves depends on difficulty. There are 3 waves in Easy difficulty, 5 in Normal, and 7 in Hard. In Hard, there is a chance of 1 additional pillager and/or vindicator spawning for each wave. If the player's Bad Omen level is II or higher, one additional wave spawns (e.g. 4 in Easy, 6 in Normal, and 8 in Hard) with the same strength as the final wave. Raiders have an increased chance of spawning with &lt;a href=\"enchanted\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; items with higher Bad Omen levels, a 10% chance starting at Bad Omen II and up to a 75% chance at Bad Omen V.\nWhen triggered with Bad Omen I, illager weapons are unenchanted. Bad Omen levels II through V each increases the possibility of low-level enchantments. There is a 25% chance of spawning an additional pillager from 3 pillagers each wave, totaling 4 pillagers on waves 2, 3, and the extra wave. There is a 25% chance of spawning a vindicator each wave, starting wave 3.\nThere's a 50% chance of spawning either a additional pillager from 3 pillagers per wave, and/or a vindicator on each wave. Witches can also spawn with a 50% chance on waves 3 and 5, and 3 witches on wave 4. A ravager also spawns at wave 3, but if there is an extra wave, there's a chance of 2 ravagers in the extra wave. Only wave 5 spawns a pillager-ravager jockey.\nThere are at least 3 pillagers each wave except wave 7. However, waves, 1, 4, 5, and 6 spawn at least 4 pillagers, but each wave has a 50% chance to spawn additional pillagers. Vindicators spawn at a completely random number, but at least 1 vindicator spawns starting at wave 4. A different minimum number of pillagers spawn from wave 5 onward, and they have a 50% chance to spawn extras on each wave also. Waves 3, 5, and 6 have a 50% chance to spawn witches. Excluding wave 4, which spawns 3 witches, and from wave 7 on, at least one witch spawns. There is a 50% chance of spawning a ravager-vindicator jockey during wave 7 only.\nBedrock Edition.\n, the number of waves depends on difficulty, regardless of Bad Omen level without any additional waves. There are three waves in Easy difficulty, five in Normal, and seven in Hard. They spawn with enchanted weapons at level 5 on Easy and at levels 5-19 in other difficulties. There are no attempts to spawn additional mobs in any difficulty.\nLoot.\nAll mobs in a raid drop their own regular loot.\nThe raid captain drops\nIn \"Java Edition\".\n&lt;a href=\"Pillager\"&gt;Pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s drop their regular loot.\nIn Bedrock Edition.\nIn addition to regular loot, pillagers and vindicators can drop:\nAdditionally, depending on difficulty, they have a 65% chance of dropping on easy and normal, while 80% chance of dropping on hard:\nNote:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;\"Java Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;, \"villagers\" give the player extra loot (gifts) after the raid, while in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the \"illagers\" drop extra loot when killed.\nBad Omen.\n, besides triggering a raid, the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; status effect's level of the triggering player also affects the raid mechanism. When the Bad Omen level is higher than one, an additional wave spawns with the same strength as the final wave. With a higher level of Bad Omen to a raid, the illagers in the raid have a higher chance of being equipped with enchanted weapons. Players can also drink &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; to remove any level of the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect. In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, Bad Omen does not affect the enchanted weapons.\nEnding.\nIf the attacked village no longer registers as a village (i.e. all &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s were killed or all claimed beds were destroyed), the raid ends, the Raid bar displays \"Raid - Defeat\", and all of the illagers celebrate: the evokers, pillagers and vindicators raise their hands, the pillagers jump up and down or raise their hands, and all of them emit \"celebration sounds\".\nIf all illagers are killed in the final wave, any player who has killed an illager in the raid receives the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; effect at the same level as the Bad Omen level of the raid. The villagers shoot off fireworks, and the Raid bar displays \"Raid - Victory\". The Hero of the Village effect activates only when the player is in the village where the raid was defeated, and the effect wears off if the player leaves the village.\nRaids cannot end naturally if at least one baby villager remains, because illagers are passive to baby villagers, except for the \u201cJohnny\u201d vindicator.\nIn some cases a raid ends after a set amount of time, if all left over raiders cannot move.\nVillagers.\n during a raid, &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s emit \"sweat particles\". At least one villager rushes to the village meeting point and rings the &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; to alert other villagers to get inside their houses during the warmup of an upcoming raid wave. \nAfter successfully defending a village from a raid, the villagers emerge from their houses and celebrate, by setting off &lt;a href=\"firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s and cheering, although villagers do not have a celebrate sound unlike the illagers.\nGifts.\nVillagers give players after the raid in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;\"Java Edition\"&lt;/a&gt;. Villagers throw items at the player that are related to their profession. After throwing a gift a villager has a cooldown between 30 seconds and 5 minutes \nbefore they can throw another gift at the player. That means the more villagers the player has, the more gifts they receive.\nWitches.\n, &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es participating in a raid often help other &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s by splashing a &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;Healing&lt;/a&gt;. Witches do not attack villagers and do not throw harmful potions at them.\n, witches participating in a raid do heal other illagers, and still attack the player and &lt;a href=\"iron%20golems\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt;. Witches are passive toward villagers, but their harmful splash potions might hit a villager by accident.\nMobs not counted.\n&lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt;es summoned by &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s do not count as part of the raid. Killing them has no effect on the raiding bar, and the raid can end in victory even if there are vexes remaining.\nExpiring.\nIf a raid goes on for 48,000 &lt;a href=\"ticks\"&gt;ticks&lt;/a&gt; (40 minutes in real time) the raid bossbar disappears, and a message appears saying \"raid expired\". Although, any living illagers stay until they are killed."}

Once a raid captain is killed by a player, the player is inflicted with 1 level of the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect, which can cause a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; to occur if they enter a &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; (unless the raid captain is currently part of a raid, in which case it does not give Bad Omen). The captain drops its &lt;a href=\"ominous%20banner\"&gt;ominous banner&lt;/a&gt; as well; another illager nearby can pick it up to become the next captain. \nBoth patrol and outpost captains grant one level of Bad Omen when killed, but captains found in raids themselves never give Bad Omen.\nBedrock Edition.\nRaid captains have the same behavior in \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" as they do in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\", but the maximum level of Bad Omen raid captains can give is one level, as Bad Omen I is the only level available.
