When an advancement does not have a display data and none of its children has a display data, the parent of the advancement only affects usage.\nAdvancement tabs.\nCreating a root advancement (no ) with valid data automatically creates a tab in the &lt;a href=\"Advancements%23Interface\"&gt;advancement menu&lt;/a&gt;. When loaded, the root advancement shows as a tab in the menu when any advancement in its advancement tree is granted to the player viewing the menu.\nThe &lt;a href=\"missing%20texture\"&gt;missing texture&lt;/a&gt; displays on the tab's background if the root advancement does not have a background.\nIf a root advancement successfully creates a tab, child advancements of the root will show inside of that tab, provided they also have valid data.\nPositioning.\nThe game automatically arranges advancements, positions them when it loads advancements from data packs, and sends the arrangement to the client. Each advancement has an arrow from its closest visible ancestor (i.e. if its parent does not have a display, it has a link from its grandparent, and so on). The root advancement appears on the leftmost column while each arrow points to an advancement in the next column. The arrangement of advancements within a column is based on file name.\nLack of display.\nSome advancements, such as the vanilla recipe unlocking advancements, may lack a display so that they can utilize &lt;a href=\"%23List%20of%20triggers\"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt; and rewards instead of excessive &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Function%20%28Java%20Edition%29\"&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt; for more functionalities and a more flexible control.

However, it is different in many ways as well. , blocks can be destroyed only with an item/tool that has the NBT tag, and cannot be destroyed by the player's fist. Likewise, blocks require the NBT tag to be placed. , similarly, and NBT tags are required to destroy and place blocks. \nHowever, players are able to make use of the environment in other ways - including interacting with mobs and other entities (for example, killing them), turning a redstone mechanism (such as a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt;) on or off, and &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; with villagers. Additionally, players are able to craft items as they normally would in any other game mode. Another feature is that players always spawn exactly on the world spawn point, no matter where it is - unlike Survival mode, where players can spawn anywhere within a certain grid.\nCustom \"Minecraft\" maps make good use of Adventure mode, and many custom maps are set to this game mode; players cannot break blocks or place them, therefore disallowing them to destroy the map, or add anything to it that would ruin the map. Also, it is often used to protect various multiplayer servers from &lt;a href=\"griefer\"&gt;griefer&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Command%20block\"&gt;Command block&lt;/a&gt;s are usually used in conjunction with Adventure mode, in servers and custom maps.\nPlayers with the ability worldbuilder set to true can break and place blocks freely on Adventure mode.\nA player can switch to Adventure mode from any other game mode by using the commands when cheats are enabled."}

Before joining Mojang Studios, Larsson was employed by two companies: Configura, in , Sweden, for six months (from January to June 2013); and Scania Group, in , Sweden, for two months (from June to July 2012).\nAs an employee who was introduced as a gameplay developer for \"Minecraft: &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" in August 3, 2016, Larsson led designs of new additions to \"Minecraft\", such as &lt;a href=\"iceberg\"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s. As her programming experience progressed, Larsson was made development manager and senior gameplay developer in April, 2019, then lead gameplay developer for \"Minecraft\" in April 2020 and, on March 3, 2021, she was promoted to \"Minecraft\" Vanilla Game Director.\nLarsson serves as a spokesperson for Mojang Studios as she holds \"Minecraft\" workshops for children, for example. Her goal as a development manager is to create as much player happiness as possible using \"Minecraft\" Java and Bedrock &lt;a href=\"Version%20history\"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing various gameplay styles, whereas keeping the principles of the game's inclusivity and simplicity, which include the dynamic of one block at a time.

One to three allays can &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt; in each cage. They have a 50% chance of spawning here. \nAllays can also spawn inside jail cells within &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s. One to three allays can spawn in each cell. They have a 50% chance of spawning here.\nDuplication/Breeding.\nAllay can be duplicated/bred by playing a &lt;a href=\"Music%20Disc\"&gt;Music Disk&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Jukebox\"&gt;Jukebox&lt;/a&gt; with Allay nearby and then clicking the Allay with a &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Shard\"&gt;Amethyst Shard&lt;/a&gt; while they are dancing. Unlike other mobs only 1 allay is needed for breeding/duplication and they have no baby variant.\nBehavior.\nThe allay's luminous texture allows it to be seen clearly in the dark, although it doesn't illuminate its surroundings.\nThe allay is small, peaceful and flies aimlessly until a player gives it an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; with their key. The allay starts following the player and seeks out dropped versions of the same item to deliver them to its player. The allay returns to wandering around if any player takes its item back by an empty hand on it.\nThe allay locks onto the player that last gave it an item. This allay follows the player from up to a 64-block cubic area away and seeks items up to a 32-block cubic area away from the player. After delivering items, the allay has a delay of three seconds until it can seek items again. An allay has a single inventory slot to hold a stack of items (usually 64 items) in addition to the item it got from the player. While the allay does not discern &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics%23Renaming\"&gt;special item names&lt;/a&gt; or items in &lt;a href=\"shulker%20box\"&gt;shulker box&lt;/a&gt;es when it seeks, it still carries such items in separate trips.\nAllays don't pick up any items if the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt; is set to , but the player can still give the allay items with the key. \nIf the allay hears a &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt; play within 16 blocks of its location while delivering items, it will instead deliver its items to the note block and then spend 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player. The allay returns to targeting its player after 30 seconds. A &lt;a href=\"Particles%23vibration\"&gt;vibration particle&lt;/a&gt; emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; between the note block and the allay can prevent this sound &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor%23Vibration%20detection\"&gt;interaction&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe allay can pick up items within a radius of about 1.3 blocks from itself and drop items up to 3 blocks away from its player or note block.\nAn allay performs a dance animation when there is a nearby &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt; playing. If the jukebox stops playing or if the allay gets too far away from the jukebox, it stops dancing. If the allay is given an &lt;a href=\"amethyst%20shard\"&gt;amethyst shard&lt;/a&gt; while dancing, it plays a small amethyst sound, makes a heart animation and duplicates into another allay. After that duplication, both allays have a five minute cooldown before being able to duplicate again.\nThe allay cannot enter water, although it attempts to gather items that are under water. \nAllays cannot be harmed by their interacted owners.

While in the nether portal block, the player can neither open their &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; nor interact with blocks with GUI. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. However, in Creative mode there is no wait time\u2014the player immediately transfers between dimensions. If there is already an \"active\" portal within range (125 blocks) in the other world, the player appears in that portal. Otherwise, a portal is created at or near the corresponding coordinates.

If the structure was incorrect, attempting to activate the reactor resulted in the client message \"Not the correct pattern!\". The messages were also sent to players on &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode.\nBehavior.\nTo activate a nether reactor, the following conditions needed to be met:\nIf those conditions were met, tapping the core would activate the reactor, sending the client message \"Active!\". Immediately after activation, a massive structure of &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; with multiple rooms, the nether spire, was generated around the reactor. The bottom room, which contains the reactor, replaced all blocks other than those of the reactor with air, while blocks in the upper levels remained intact. The spire was composed of over 25 stacks worth of netherrack. \nItems would begin to spawn within the reactor room, including &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nether%20quartz\"&gt;nether quartz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cacti\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20canes\"&gt;sugar canes&lt;/a&gt;, both types of &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s, oak wooden &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pumpkin%20seeds\"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"melon%20seeds\"&gt;melon seeds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zombified%20piglin\"&gt;Zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s were also able to spawn. During this stage, the blocks that made up the reactor were converted into &lt;a href=\"glowing%20obsidian\"&gt;glowing obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and the core adopted a red texture to symbolize the activation. Excluding the core, any part of the reactor could be mined after activation and it would still function. This way, the player could recycle the expensive gold blocks. It was possible to recover all 4 blocks provided the player worked quickly. All aspects of the reaction froze when the player mined the active core: if the &lt;a href=\"nether%20reactor%20core\"&gt;nether reactor core&lt;/a&gt; was mined out while the nether reactor is active, the glowing obsidian would not turn into obsidian after the reactor deactivates. This also caused the reactor to stop spawning items and zombified piglins, and make the day/night cycle freeze at nighttime for several in-game days.\nThe reactor cycle would end after 45 seconds, damaging the reactor's structure and changing the world to night. Because the spire could not replace blocks past the world border, when the reactor was activated near the edge of &lt;a href=\"old\"&gt;old worlds&lt;/a&gt; the player would be able to see the time set to night. The reactor was replaced with a 3\u00d73\u00d73 box of obsidian containing the core, which adopted a dark blue texture to indicate that the reaction has ended. If the player built a new reactor around the burnt-out core, the netherrack spire would generate, although the rest of the reaction would not take place."}

A fully mature nether wart crop yields 2\u20134 nether wart. This is increased by one for each level of &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, this allows for a maximum of 7 nether warts dropping from one crop. Less mature stages drop one nether wart, even with the Fortune enchantment.\nNatural generation.\nNether wart can generate in &lt;a href=\"nether%20fortress\"&gt;nether fortress&lt;/a&gt;es in &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt; gardens around stairwells. Nether wart can also generate in the courtyards of housing unit &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to only spawning in these specific structures, it's entirely possible for a nether fortress or bastion remnant to generate without nether wart (though they may still appear in the chests that generate in the fortress). \n&lt;br&gt;\nUsage.\nBrewing ingredient.\nNether wart's primary purpose is to &lt;a href=\"brew\"&gt;brew&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;awkward potion&lt;/a&gt;, the base for all potions, but optional for Weakness.\nTrading.\nMaster-level cleric &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s buy 22 nether warts for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; as part of their trades.\nFarming.\nWhen planted on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;, nether wart grows through four stages, though the middle two stages use the same texture (the hitbox of stage 3 is three pixels taller). , the exact age can be seen using the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt;, and the ages range from 0 to 3. Each random tick, nether wart has a 10% chance of growing one stage. At default random tick speed, each nether wart grows one age step approximately every on average, and fully grows from planting to harvest every on average. The growth rate is not affected by light or any other environmental factors. &lt;a href=\"Bone%20meal\"&gt;Bone meal&lt;/a&gt; cannot be used on the nether wart.\nNether wart can only be planted on &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand\"&gt;soul sand&lt;/a&gt;. It cannot be planted on &lt;a href=\"soul%20soil\"&gt;soul soil&lt;/a&gt;. It can grow in any &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;.\nNether wart is ready to harvest when it reaches its fourth stage (age:3). Breaking a fully grown nether wart drops 2 to 4 nether wart, while an immature one drops a single nether wart. Using a tool enchanted with fortune increases the maximum number of nether wart dropped by 1 per level, for a maximum of 7 for a tool enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune III&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposting.\nPlacing a nether wart into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1."}

{"id": "3460", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3460", "title": "Nether portal", "text": "A nether portal is a manufactured structure that acts as a gateway between the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCreation.\nA nether portal is built as a vertical, rectangular frame of &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; (4\u00d75 minimum, 23\u00d723 maximum). The four corners of the frame are not required, but portals created by the game always include them, resulting in 4 free/extra obsidian. The obsidian can be placed in any manner, e.g. by placing mined obsidian, by completing a &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt;, or by casting it in place using lava and water. Adjacent portals can share obsidian blocks. A nether portal cannot be built horizontally like an &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a frame is constructed, it is activated by &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; placed inside the frame. This creates portal blocks inside the frame, resembling a vortex. The fire can be placed in any manner, including use of &lt;a href=\"flint%20and%20steel\"&gt;flint and steel&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"fire%20charge\"&gt;fire charge&lt;/a&gt;, the impact of a &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"small%20fireball\"&gt;small fireball&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strike, or natural spread of fire to flammable material adjacent to the portal. Nether portals can be activated only in the Overworld or the Nether; they cannot be activated in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"customized\"&gt;customized&lt;/a&gt; dimensions.\nThe fire must be the last placed block in the structure\u2014a fire on an incomplete frame does not result in the portal activating upon the placement of the last obsidian block.\nWhen a portal is used by a player, if no corresponding portal within range exists in the other dimension, one is created there; see and . There is an infinitesimal chance of failure for the corresponding portal to generate in the Nether, leaving the player trapped until death or until another portal can be constructed, either in the Nether or by another player in the Overworld.\nBehavior.\nWhen a player in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; stands in a nether portal block for 4 seconds, the player is taken to the other dimension. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. However, in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt;, the wait time is one game tick ( second) for the player to transfer between dimensions. If there is already an \"active\" portal within range (about 128 blocks) in the other dimension, the player appears in that portal. Otherwise, a portal is created at or near the corresponding coordinates. If a portal is deactivated, and the matching portal in the other dimension is used before it is re-activated, a new portal may be created (unless there is another active portal within range). The usual cause for this is when the player's Nether-side portal is deactivated by a ghast, and then the player dies in the Nether, spawns, and then re-enters the Nether through the Overworld-side portal. However, multiple portals can be exploited to farm obsidian.\nMost entities can travel through portals, including mobs (except the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;thrown items&lt;/a&gt;, and transportation \"with passengers\" including &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s. Unlike players, other entities travel through portals instantly, and once they reach the other side, there is a cool-down time for 300 game ticks (15 seconds), in which they cannot go through any nether portals. Therefore, an entity can only travel though nether portals again, once it is not touching any nether portal for 15 seconds. In Bedrock Edition, a parrot on the player's shoulder prevents the player from going through the portal.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombified%20piglin\"&gt;Zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s have a chance to spawn on the bottom frame of the portal in the Overworld if any nether portal block above receives a &lt;a href=\"block%20tick\"&gt;block tick&lt;/a&gt;. they spawn in certain squares adjacent to the portals in the Overworld, not inside them. Zombified piglins spawned in this way have a full 15-second portal cooldown, meaning they can't go through the portal they are spawned in unless they leave the portal for a while. They spawn twice as often on Normal difficulty as on Easy, and three times as often on Hard difficulty as on Easy. No other mobs can be spawned by nether portals in this way, in any dimension.\nActive portals also repel hoglins.\nChunk loading.\nWhenever an entity is teleported through a nether portal, the chunk at the linked portal gets load ticket with load level of 30, meaning that it is fully loaded and can process entities. This load level also spreads to adjacent chunks but they get lower for each chunk. This results in 8 more fully loaded \"&lt;a href=\"Chunk%23Level_and_load_type\"&gt;entity ticking&lt;/a&gt;\" chunks with gradually fewer loaded chunks further out.\nThese chunks remain loaded for 15 seconds but this timer gets refreshed each time the entity passes through the portal (including mobs wandering through it from either direction). This can be used to permanently load chunks, creating a \"chunk loader\". Permanently-loaded chunks created using chunk loaders create a considerable amount of lag.\nPortal linkage between Overworld and Nether.\nCoordinate conversion.\nHorizontal coordinates and distances in the Nether are proportional to the Overworld in a 1:8 ratio. That is, by moving 1 block horizontally in the Nether, players have moved the equivalent of 8 blocks on the Overworld. This does not apply to the Y-axis. Thus, for a given location (X, Y, Z) in the Overworld, the corresponding coordinates in the Nether are (floor(X \u00f7 8), Y, floor(Z \u00f7 8)), and conversely, for a location (X, Y, Z) in the Nether, the matching Overworld coordinates are (X \u00d7 8, Y, Z \u00d7 8).\nThe &lt;a href=\"http%3A//download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html%23floor%2528double%2529\"&gt;Java floor() method&lt;/a&gt; used in these conversions rounds down to the largest integer less than or equal to the argument (toward smaller positive values and toward larger negative values), so a coordinate of 29.9 rounds to 29, and one of \u221229.9 to \u221230.\nBoth the X and Z coordinates in this conversion are constrained to be between \u221229,999,872 and 29,999,872 (inclusive); this affects travel to the Overworld from the Nether at X or Z beyond \u00b13,749,984.\nPortal search.\nWhen an entity starts colliding with a &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;nether portal block&lt;/a&gt;, the game records the coordinates of the entity.\nThe game then converts those coordinates into destination coordinates as above: The entry X- and Z-coordinates are multiplied by 8 if the entity is in the Nether or divided by 8 if the entity is in the overworld, while the Y-coordinate is not changed.\nStarting at these destination coordinates, the game looks for all nearby portal points of interest (POI). The point of interest can be within 257\u00d7257 blocks in the Overworld and 33\u00d733 blocks in the Nether centered on the converted coordinate and the full map height.\nIf any candidate portal POI is found, then the game selects the closest one as determined by its &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Units%20of%20measure\"&gt;distance&lt;/a&gt; in the new coordinate system (including the Y coordinate, which can cause seemingly more distant portals to be selected), and teleports the entity to the location in the new portal calculated by a special algorithm. Note that the calculated distance is , not &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;. The distance computation between portals in the range is a straight-line distance calculation, and the shortest path is chosen, counting the Y difference.\nThe algorithm used for determining the position of the entity inside the destination portal to teleport to is as follows: \nThis way, if source and destination portals are of the same shape, have the same orientation, and no other portals are interfering with the linking, one can safely assume that entities will travel through them as if the portal frames were physically placed behind each other.\nPortal creation.\nFor players, if no portals exist in the search region, the game creates one, by looking for the closest suitable location to place a portal, within 16 blocks horizontally (but any distance vertically) of the player's destination coordinates. A valid location is 3\u00d74 buildable blocks with air 4 high above all 12 blocks, with the long axis matching the long axis of the source portal. The closest valid position in the 3D distance is always picked.\nIf the first check for valid locations fails entirely, the check is redone looking for a 1\u00d74 expanse of buildable blocks with air 4 high above each. \nIf that fails, too, a portal is forced at the target coordinates, but with Y constrained to be between 70 and 10 less than the world height (i.e. 118 for the Nether or 246 for the Overworld). When a portal is forced in this way, a 2\u00d73 platform of obsidian with air 3 high above is created at the target location, overwriting whatever might be there. This provides air space underground or a small platform if high in the air. , these obsidian blocks are flanked by 4 more blocks of netherrack on each side, resulting in 12 blocks of platform.\nOnce coordinates are chosen, a portal (always 4\u00d75 and including the corners) including portal blocks is constructed at the target coordinates, replacing anything in the way.\nIf a portal is forced into water or lava, the liquid immediately flows into the generated air blocks, leaving the player with no airspace. However, a glitch can prevent this water from flowing into the portal: if the liquid would flow both vertically and horizontally into the air pocket, it instead flows only vertically, so the blocks on the platform's outer corners never become water source blocks.\nVideo.\nNote: These videos do not mention that nether portals on the Nether ceiling now link up with Overworld portals."}

{"id": "154175", "revid": "55016540", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=154175", "title": "Noise generator", "text": "\"Minecraft\" uses several different types of noise generators, specifically those making use of , for the generation of &lt;a href=\"terrain\"&gt;terrain&lt;/a&gt; alongside other features.\nSpecifications.\nNoise generators can be defined by the following parameters:\nThese values are displayed and calculated differently in the code. Vanilla simply applies a \"scale\" value (frequency*(2^octaves)), defined as how much the noise generator increments per sampling (every four blocks).\nCustomization.\nOld Customized worlds (1.8-1.12).\nCustom worlds were added in version 1.8, it was located in the list of world types at the very end.\nIn this type, it was possible to configure the biome, sea level height, stretching and other parameters allowing you to create any worlds not intended by the developers.\nTypes of noise generators.\nStratum colors are determined using only the first 48 bits of the 64-bit &lt;a href=\"world%20seed\"&gt;world seed&lt;/a&gt; . The strata repeat every 64 blocks on the Y-axis, and the elevation of a particular stratum can vary through a biome by as much as 4 blocks. Stratum elevations vary with respect to the X-axis only, neglecting the Z-axis.\nTerrain noise generators.\nThese are used for defining the shape of generated terrain itself.\nA table of default/hardcoded settings, as well as values resulting from these, is as follows. Note that not all of these are used in vanilla, but are instead used by mods such as CubicWorldGen.\nLow noise.\nLow noise is one of the two main noise generators used for defining terrain shape. This noise generator, which uses Perlin noise, is used as a heightmap, which means it\u2019s responsible for the basic shape of the terrain. It\u2019s called \u201clow\u201d noise because it changes slowly and smoothly over distance, creating large portions of plain terrain, hills, or valleys.\nHigh noise.\nThis is effectively identical to low noise, but is only used when selector noise is above a given threshold value. It adds detail to the terrain changing rapidly over distance, creating rough, jagged surfaces.\nSelector noise.\nSelector noise is a third important noise generator used for terrain generation. Selector noise, using Perlin noise, dictates which of either low noise or high noise is used for generating terrain at a given position - above 1 high noise is used, below 0 low noise is used, and values between 0-1 are linearly interpolated between the low and high noise values. Note that when Selector noise overflows, the terrain is divided within paterns, each alternating Low and High noise. That continues beyond the overflow for areas where the same noise is selected. This proves how the aformentioned two are used for.\nDepth noise.\nA rather insignificant noise generator, this uses Perlin noise to make terrain slightly more nuanced in general. The possible values it can have are tightly clamped to a thin set of values. It is also only defined for the X and Z axes.\nOther noise generators.\nThese noise generators are oriented to the generation of other world features, such as decoration.\nBiome fill noise.\nUpon generation, a top layer block (e.g. dirt, sand) will be placed to a certain thickness to replace the bare stone heightmap. The thickness of this dirt relies on a noise generator in vanilla.\nBiome distribution.\nOcean biome variants are distributed using a Perlin noise function.\nThe Multi Noise Biome Source (used for the nether) also uses perlin noise.\nSwamp noise.\nSwamps use a noise generator for two purposes: for the generation of marshy areas composing a mixture of water and grass blocks, and for the variation of the two different grass colors used.\nFlower noise.\nThe placement of flowers, most prominently in &lt;a href=\"flower%20forest\"&gt;flower forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt; biomes but possibly also elsewhere, is controlled via a noise function. Flowers generated naturally will be in different positions from those grown via bone meal, and those grown via bone meal is \"not\" dependent on &lt;a href=\"Seed%20%28level%20generation%29\"&gt;world seed&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemoved noise generators.\nThese are no longer used in the current version of the game.\nFloating island carver noise.\nDuring Indev, floating islands were produced by using an extra noise generator to carve out air into existing terrain.\nScale noise.\nA noise generator that appears to only have effects in hilly areas, with little to no impact on flat low-lying regions. Its effects are now handled by biomes rather than noise generation.\nTree density noise.\nA noise generator existed in Infdev which dictated the density of trees in the world. This was likely removed in Alpha v1.2.0 with the introduction of biomes although is yet to be confirmed, as a similar noise generator also seems to exist in 1.12.2.\nSand noise.\nA noise generator was used for generating the surface block used for low-altitude areas commonly characteristic of beaches. This noise generator would determine if a given area would use sand as the surface block or not. This was probably removed in Beta 1.8.\nGravel noise.\nEffectively identical to sand noise and used in very similar cases, this determined where gravel would generate in beach-like areas.\nOverflowing.\nNoise generators are capable of overflowing once hitting the integer limit for their given data type, producing spectacular results. The most notable of these are the Far Lands, resulting in noise generator overflows being referred to as types of Far Lands as a result.\nIn current versions of \"Java Edition\", overflowing is not usually visible without either direct modification to terrain generation code or possibly via &lt;a href=\"custom%20world%20generation\"&gt;custom world generation&lt;/a&gt;."}

While running out of resources other than the unique &lt;a href=\"dragon%20egg\"&gt;dragon egg&lt;/a&gt; is not likely to be a factor in normal gameplay due to massive size of a \"Minecraft\" map, in principle there is a finite quantity of these resources available in each \"Minecraft\" world.\nObtaining.\nNon-renewable resources can be obtained through crafting recipes that consume other non-renewable items, found as naturally generated blocks, obtained from structure loot chests or as &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s from certain enemies that do not respawn (&lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s).\nSome resources are non-renewable or even unobtainable if playing on Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, as monsters do not spawn.\nThe degree of impact the non-renewability of a resource has on normal gameplay generally depends on how limited the resource is, but on custom maps these relationships may be changed; for example, on many Skyblock-style maps, any &lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;s provided are extremely valuable, as no more can be obtained.\nAll &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;-item combinations that cannot be obtained in Survival are non-renewable.\nGenerated structures.\nThese non-renewable resources are found only as loot from &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;, the blocks the structures are composed of, or as non-renewable drops from mobs which generate with the structures, and cannot be obtained in other ways unless using certain glitches, &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode. This renders most of them unavailable in worlds with the \"Generate Structures\" option disabled, with the exception of the items which can be found in &lt;a href=\"dungeons\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Well\"&gt;desert wells&lt;/a&gt;, which aren't affected by the option . These resources are generally the most finite resources in the game.\nEnchantments on items without prior-work anvil penalty.\nWhile all enchantments obtainable in Survival other than Swift Sneak are renewable, for &lt;a href=\"treasure%20enchantment\"&gt;treasure enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s the only renewable way to get them on most items is by using an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; to combine the item with a renewable &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;. Using an anvil in this way causes the item to gain &lt;a href=\"prior%20work%20penalty\"&gt;prior work penalty&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the cost of future anvil use. Similar limitations apply to some high level enchantments, which cannot be renewably obtained on items with insufficient &lt;a href=\"enchantability\"&gt;enchantability&lt;/a&gt; without using an anvil.\nThis renders most types of items that have at least one of these enchantments without having any prior-work penalty non-renewable. Many of these item variants are unobtainable in Survival, but some of them can be found in the loot chests of various generated structures.\nItems in &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ruined%20portal\"&gt;ruined portal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shipwreck\"&gt;shipwreck&lt;/a&gt; loot chests are limited to one enchantment, while items from &lt;a href=\"end%20city\"&gt;end city&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient city&lt;/a&gt; chests often have multiple.\nOther.\nThese non-renewable resources can be obtained from the world outside &lt;a href=\"generated%20structures\"&gt;generated structures&lt;/a&gt;, they are generally more abundant, but some may be hidden under other blocks, making them harder to find. Since they generate outside structures, they can be found even in worlds with the generate structures option disabled.\nNot obtainable in Survival.\nThese resources are not obtainable as items in Survival. However, they can be encountered as blocks and some even created or manipulated in Survival. \nNot encountered in Survival.\nThese resources cannot be accessed, even as blocks, without using &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode or &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBedrock Edition.\nThese items are non renewable in , and are not items at all in .\nJava Edition.\nThese resources are not renewable in , even though they are in the . \nThese items are non renewable in , and are not items at all in .\nPeaceful difficulty.\nThese resources are not renewable while playing in Peaceful difficulty as their renewable methods of obtaining require the spawning of &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s. (Previously mentioned non-renewable resources are removed from the products list).\n, &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s still spawn in Peaceful difficulty. By killing piglins, the player can sometimes obtain golden &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, then &lt;a href=\"smelt\"&gt;smelt&lt;/a&gt; them into &lt;a href=\"gold%20nugget\"&gt;gold nugget&lt;/a&gt;s. This makes gold renewable, along with all items obtainable via &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoing to &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; almost always requires the use of &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt;, which are unobtainable in Peaceful difficulty, to activate the &lt;a href=\"end%20portal\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;, with the chances of requiring none being only 1 in a trillion for each end portal. Therefore, resources exclusive to the End can also be considered unobtainable and therefore non-renewable in Peaceful difficulty."}

The sound produced can be altered in various ways by using it or putting certain blocks directly above or below it. A note block's sound played repeatedly can be used to direct &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt;s to stay nearby and drop collected items near it.\nObtaining.\nNatural generation.\nNote blocks generate in &lt;a href=\"ancient%20city\"&gt;ancient cities&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking.\nNote blocks are most quickly broken with an &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nPlaying music.\nNotes.\nNote blocks play a musical note when hit (pressing the button) or powered by redstone. A note block must have &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; in the space directly above it to play a sound. Notes can be heard up to 48 blocks away. The volume of a note block decreases as the player gets further away from it. The volume of note blocks (as well as &lt;a href=\"jukebox\"&gt;jukebox&lt;/a&gt;es) can be independently controlled by the Jukebox/Note Blocks slider in the audio &lt;a href=\"options\"&gt;settings&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote blocks play when on or next to a powered block. Each time a note block plays a note, a note &lt;a href=\"particle\"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; may fly out of the top (if pressed too fast, notes may not appear), with the color depending on the pitch (but not the instrument).\nThere are 16 different instruments and 25 different pitches per instrument. Pressing the on the block increases the note pitch up a , with a total of two full and a semitone (25 semitones in total) being available for each instrument. The standard range (for harp and pling instruments) of notes span from F\u266f3 to F\u266f5. After reaching the highest note, pressing use again resets the pitch back to F\u266f3, as does breaking the block and picking it back up.\nThe string bass and didgeridoo are two octaves (24 semitones) lower than the standard range, the guitar is one octave (12 semitones) lower than the standard range, the flute is one octave above the standard range, and the bells, chimes, and xylophone are 2 octaves above the standard range. This gives the player six octaves (72 semitones) of effective range to combine instruments for greater pitch coverage.\nThe exact pitch can be found from its -count by using the following formula: codice_1.\nThe exact pitch to -count assignment is shown below, along with the note's color, which is rendered with shading using the particle's texture.\nAlternatively, there is a graphical version available:\nPlayers can roughly check the tuning of a block by looking at the note icon.\n, the tuning can also be checked by looking at the right side of the &lt;a href=\"debug%20screen\"&gt;debug screen&lt;/a&gt; (accessed by pressing ). It is denoted as \"note:\" followed by a number from 0 to 24.\nInstruments.\nThe instrument played depends on the &lt;a href=\"material\"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt; of the block underneath the note block. Note that these are groups of blocks defined by the code, not just the individual block.\nMob heads.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt; is placed on top of a note block, the sound made by the note block will instead be that of the corresponding mob's sound, with the exception of the creeper head, which instead causes the note block to play the sound.\nPowering note blocks.\nNote blocks can be powered in a variety of different ways following normal redstone principles; however, some ways of powering note blocks are more convenient than others or produce unexpected results. \nInteraction with allays.\nIf an &lt;a href=\"allay\"&gt;allay&lt;/a&gt; hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location, it tries to path find to the note block and then spends 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player. After 30 seconds, the allay returns to targeting its player. A &lt;a href=\"Particles%23vibration\"&gt;vibration particle&lt;/a&gt; emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing &lt;a href=\"wool\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt; between the note block and the allay can prevent this &lt;a href=\"Sculk%20Sensor%23Vibration%20detection\"&gt;interaction&lt;/a&gt;. \nFuel.\nNote blocks can be used as a &lt;a href=\"fuel\"&gt;fuel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"furnace\"&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;s, smelting 1.5 items per block.\nData values.\nBlock data.\n, a note block has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20level%20format/Block%20entity%20format\"&gt;Bedrock Edition level format/Block entity format&lt;/a&gt;."}

It has two variants: warped nylium and crimson nylium which both spawn in different &lt;a href=\"biomes\"&gt;biomes&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nNylium only drops itself when mined using a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;; if mined using a normal pickaxe, it drops &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.\nNatural generation.\nWarped nylium generates in the &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; biome, and crimson nylium generates in the &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nMob loot.\nNylium is dropped when an &lt;a href=\"enderman\"&gt;enderman&lt;/a&gt; dies while holding it.\nPost-generation.\n &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt; that is placed next to or adjacent to warped or crimson nylium transforms the netherrack into nylium of that type. &lt;a href=\"Air\"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; must be above the netherrack during this process. This transformation can also be done by activating a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt; with bone meal directly into that netherrack block. If both types of nylium are present, there is an equal chance of either being spread.\nUsage.\nSimilarly to &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, nylium decays (based on &lt;a href=\"random%20tick\"&gt;random tick&lt;/a&gt;s) into netherrack when an &lt;a href=\"opaque\"&gt;opaque&lt;/a&gt; block is placed above it. However, unlike grass blocks and mycelium, it does not decay underneath &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. It decays when covered with &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike mycelium and &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s can remain on nylium blocks in any &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level. &lt;a href=\"Huge%20mushroom\"&gt;Huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s can be grown by using bone meal on mushrooms planted on nylium.\n&lt;a href=\"Fungi\"&gt;Fungi&lt;/a&gt; can likewise be grown into &lt;a href=\"huge%20fungi\"&gt;huge fungi&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, though the fungus must be placed on the same type of nylium, or the bone meal will not even be consumed.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, the player can apply &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; to nylium. This nylium, along with nearby nylium, generate vegetation that occurs in their native biome (crimson nylium generates mostly &lt;a href=\"crimson%20forest\"&gt;crimson forest&lt;/a&gt; vegetation and warped nylium generates mostly &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; vegetation), and just like in the native biomes, the opposite type of fungi occassionally generates. The vegetation is generated in a 5x5 area, centered on the nylium block on which bone meal is used. \nNote Blocks.\nNylium can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds."}

When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.\nUsage.\nAn observer is placed similarly to a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;. It observes the block that it is placed against. The texture of the detecting side is that of an observing face. As observers can detect the state of other observers, placing two adjacent observers, each watching the other, can make a fast and compact redstone clock. They send out a &lt;a href=\"Mechanics/Redstone/Pulse%20circuit\"&gt;pulse&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\n, an observer detects changes in its target's block states, or the breaking or placing of a block (i.e. changes in its block state, but \"not\" its block entity data). This means that changes like the age of crops can be detected because they are part of the block states.\n, an observer acts as a block update detector and detects anything that causes a block update.\nThe causes and propagation of block updates are different between \"Java Edition\" and Bedrock Edition. As a result, each can detect some kinds of changes that the other cannot. See the table below for a comparison.\nWhen it detects something, the observer emits a &lt;a href=\"Pulse%20circuit\"&gt;redstone pulse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20circuit%23Power\"&gt;strong power&lt;/a&gt; at level 15 for 2 &lt;a href=\"game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt;s (1 &lt;a href=\"redstone%20tick\"&gt;redstone tick&lt;/a&gt;). The pulse can power &lt;a href=\"redstone%20dust\"&gt;redstone dust&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20comparator\"&gt;redstone comparator&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"redstone%20repeater\"&gt;redstone repeater&lt;/a&gt;, or any &lt;a href=\"Redstone%20components%23Mechanism%20components\"&gt;mechanism component&lt;/a&gt; located at its opposite end.\n, the pulse is emitted with a delay of 1 redstone tick. In Bedrock Edition, it is supposed to be delayed by 1 tick as well but is actually delayed 2 redstone ticks due to , a bug causing redstone delays to be incorrect when components are activated by world changes (which, in the case of the observer in Bedrock Edition, is the only way it can be activated), as opposed to pure redstone components ticking. Its timing can also be incorrect due to .\nIt also counts as a block update when the observer itself is moved by a piston. When this happens, an observer emits a pulse after being pushed or pulled, but not beforehand. This enables them to be used in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Flying%20machines\"&gt;flying machines&lt;/a&gt;.\nObservers behave as both opaque and transparent blocks: they block light and allow mob spawning on top, but do not block opening chests below, do not cut off redstone wire, and cannot conduct redstone power.\nBecause observers in \"Java Edition\" detect changes in the block state, and \"not\" block updates, they can detect a wider range of phenomena than a &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Block%20update%20detector\"&gt;block update detector&lt;/a&gt; (BUD) circuit in Bedrock \"Edition\" can detect (as some block state changes don't cause block updates). Observers in Bedrock Edition \"do\" detect block updates but not block state changes, and so they detect the exact same things that any other BUD would detect in that edition.\nLimitations.\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Change in block state\n! colspan=\"2\" | Detected in\n!

See the &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Obsidian%20farming%23Mining%20times\"&gt;obsidian farming tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\n8 obsidian are dropped by an &lt;a href=\"ender%20chest\"&gt;ender chest&lt;/a&gt; when broken with a pickaxe not enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;.\nNatural generation.\nObsidian generates naturally in all &lt;a href=\"dimension\"&gt;dimension&lt;/a&gt;s:\nPost-generation.\nObsidian is formed when flowing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; touches a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; source block, and it can be found naturally where water from a &lt;a href=\"spring\"&gt;spring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"aquifer\"&gt;aquifer&lt;/a&gt; has flowed over a nearby &lt;a href=\"lava%20pool\"&gt;lava pool&lt;/a&gt;. This provides a renewable way of obtaining obsidian, as lava can be farmed via &lt;a href=\"cauldrons\"&gt;cauldrons&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"pointed%20dripstone\"&gt;pointed dripstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nObsidian is created when a nether portal is generated in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;. This portal can then be mined, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. \n, if the nether portal generated floating in the air, then 4 extra obsidian are created at the bottom of the portal. \nWhen an &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt; enters the End via an &lt;a href=\"End%20Portal%20%28block%29\"&gt;end portal&lt;/a&gt;, it always spawns on a &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20platform\"&gt;platform&lt;/a&gt; of 25 obsidian blocks. This platform can then be mined, and regenerates whenever an entity enters the End, which provides another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. Obsidian pillars also regenerate when the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; respawns. \nBartering.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s may &lt;a href=\"barter\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; a block of obsidian when given a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt; with a chance of 8.71%.\nUsage.\nObsidian is useful for building &lt;a href=\"explosion\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt;-resistant structures as it has, along with &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Block%20of%20Netherite\"&gt;netherite blocks&lt;/a&gt;, a blast resistance of 1,200; the highest of all blocks obtainable in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode (together with &lt;a href=\"crying%20obsidian\"&gt;crying obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and block of netherite). Obsidian also cannot be destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;. However, ender dragons can traverse obsidian blocks without destroying them.\nThese qualities make obsidian an extremely effective defensive &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, and it is commonly used in many bases in multiplayer servers as protection from griefers.\nObsidian is, however, not immune to the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=\"Wither%23Wither%20Skull\"&gt;black wither skulls&lt;/a&gt; has merely the explosive power of a &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt; fireball, blue wither skulls ignore blast resistance, which means they can destroy obsidian. The wither's body can also destroy obsidian, either through block-breaking behavior upon taking damage, or its dash attack. The wither is the only mob in the game that can break obsidian. \nObsidian is one of the two blocks an &lt;a href=\"end%20crystal\"&gt;end crystal&lt;/a&gt; can be placed on; the other is &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;.\nNether portals.\nObsidian is used to create a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; frame, which is then ignited using &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. The frame must be a vertical rectangle any size from 4\u00d75 to 23\u00d723. The corners of the frame are not required for an operational portal.\nNote Blocks.\nObsidian can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nPiston interactivity.\nObsidian cannot be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. It also cannot be pushed nor pulled by &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Oceans are the largest biome by area, covering anywhere around 25-33% of the surface area of the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; when factoring in all of its varieties and consist of a deep water source with the surface at an altitude of y=62 by default, which is counted as the \"sea level\" layer of the world.\nDescription.\nOceans are vast expanses of &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, going from sea level all the way down to the ocean floor, which is at a depth of roughly Y=45 for normal oceans, or Y=30 for deep variants. The seafloor is fairly hilly, featuring multiple peaks and valleys, and is mostly covered by a one-block layer of &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, though some &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; patches may generate near the peaks. &lt;a href=\"Ravine\"&gt;Ravine&lt;/a&gt;s can occasionally generate on the ocean floor, forming underwater trenches. Some seafloor peaks may reach high enough to form islands on the surface of the ocean; these islands are typically small and may have very sparse vegetation with very little grass and oak trees. The seafloor is often covered with &lt;a href=\"seagrass\"&gt;seagrass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;, with \"forests\" of kelp frequently reaching close to or even touching the water's surface. &lt;a href=\"Fish\"&gt;Fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s frequently spawn within oceans. &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck\"&gt;Shipwreck&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt; generate within all oceans, while deep ocean variants can occasionally generate &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. The regular ocean variant mainly generates when bordering on land, while deep variants generates when away from land.\nSurvival in ocean biomes themselves is impractical due to all the &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. A player who camps on an island in the ocean faces a rather difficult situation. This means that whatever resources found on an island might be all the player has if the player is unwilling or unable to venture out. See the &lt;a href=\"tutorials/Island%20survival\"&gt;island survival&lt;/a&gt; article for more information.\nVariants.\nOceans come in nine different varieties in-game, including the base ocean and eight different variants. \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" has two unused biomes, \"deep warm ocean\" and \"legacy frozen ocean\".\nOcean.\nThis is the standard ocean variant. The ground is mainly covered with &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nDeep Ocean.\nThe deep ocean variant generates at deeper waters, with the depth usually being around 30 blocks which is twice as deep as shallower oceans. The ground is mainly covered with &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20monument\"&gt;Ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s generate in deep oceans, meaning &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn there. &lt;a href=\"Dolphin\"&gt;Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cod\"&gt;cod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"salmon\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt; spawn in these oceans as well. Underwater &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ravine\"&gt;ravine&lt;/a&gt;s often generate here, forming underwater trenches. Tall seagrass also generates more frequently in deep oceans compared to shallower oceans.\nDeep oceans use the same mob spawning chances as oceans.\nFrozen Ocean.\nThe frozen ocean has low temperature and often borders &lt;a href=\"snowy%20beach\"&gt;snowy beach&lt;/a&gt;es. Like the standard and cold oceans, it has a gravel seabed, though the water's surface is mostly/completely frozen. Neither seagrass nor kelp generates on the seafloor, leaving it entirely barren and reminiscent of pre-&lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt; oceans. Large &lt;a href=\"iceberg\"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;s made of &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; and a bit of &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; frequently generate on the surface.\n, frozen oceans have varying temperatures across their landscapes, and have a more noticeable effect in that colder patches have snowfall and ice sheets, while warmer patches have rainfall (up to a certain height) and unfrozen water. See also &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Temperature\"&gt;Biome#Temperature&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nDeep Frozen Ocean.\nThe deep frozen ocean generate at deeper waters and also contain &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Iceberg\"&gt;Iceberg&lt;/a&gt;s may still generate, but unlike normal frozen ocean, the water's surface is not frozen . , the water's surface is entirely frozen.\nDeep frozen oceans use the same mob spawning chances as frozen oceans.&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nCold Ocean.\nThe cold ocean uses a dark indigo water color at the surface and often generates next to cold biomes like &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"old%20growth%20taiga\"&gt;old growth taiga&lt;/a&gt;s. Like regular oceans and frozen oceans, its floor is made up mainly of &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;. The vegetation in cold oceans also has less seagrass compared to other ocean variants.\n, cold oceans use the same mob spawning chances as oceans.&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nDeep Cold Ocean.\nThe deep cold ocean generates at deeper waters being twice as deep, can generate &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s and has higher amounts of tall seagrass.\nDeep cold oceans use the same mob spawning chances as cold oceans.&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nLukewarm Ocean.\nThe lukewarm ocean has light blue water at the surface and generates in regions with slightly warm biomes like &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;s. Its floor is made of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, with occasional patches of &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"clay\"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; in shallower areas. &lt;a href=\"Ocean%20ruins\"&gt;Ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt; that generate in lukewarm and warm oceans are made of &lt;a href=\"Sandstone\"&gt;sandy&lt;/a&gt; materials, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stony&lt;/a&gt; materials that make up ruins in colder oceans. This biome also has more seagrass and less kelp compared to colder ocean variants.\nDeep Lukewarm Ocean.\nThe deep lukewarm ocean generates in deep waters. Since they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate &lt;a href=\"ocean%20monument\"&gt;ocean monument&lt;/a&gt;s and have more tall seagrass.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\n, deep lukewarm oceans use the same mob spawning chances as lukewarm oceans&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nWarm Ocean.\nThe warm ocean has an aquamarine water tone at the surface and often generates next to &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt;. Like the lukewarm ocean, it has a floor mainly made of &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, however no dirt, clay or gravel generate at shallower areas and if this biome generates above sea level, the surface is made of sand instead of grass blocks. Warm oceans feature &lt;a href=\"coral%20reef\"&gt;coral reef&lt;/a&gt;s and numerous &lt;a href=\"sea%20pickle\"&gt;sea pickle&lt;/a&gt;s, though &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt; does not naturally generate here. Because of the height of the coral reef, warm oceans can appear more shallow than other oceans, though the actual ocean floor is no deeper. This is also the only ocean temperature variant that can generate at deeper waters without needing a deep variant, and because of that monuments can't be found in this biome.\nUnused variant.\nLegacy Frozen Ocean.\nThe legacy frozen ocean variant is similar to frozen ocean biomes, but without &lt;a href=\"iceberg\"&gt;iceberg&lt;/a&gt;s, making it look like flatlands of ice. &lt;a href=\"Rabbit\"&gt;Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stray\"&gt;stray&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in here. &lt;a href=\"Rabbit\"&gt;Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s have their snowy texture. No monsters other than &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, strays and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn here. This biome also generates &lt;a href=\"kelp\"&gt;kelp&lt;/a&gt;. Those &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s were much smaller and existed prior in &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Edition%20v0.9.0%20alpha\"&gt;Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha&lt;/a&gt;. This biome does not naturally generate, though it can be generated using a biome editor or add-ons. \nLegacy frozen oceans use the same mob spawning chances as frozen oceans for water and passive categories. As for the others:\n&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nSounds.\nWhen in any ocean biome, unique ocean &lt;a href=\"ambience\"&gt;ambience&lt;/a&gt; play randomly. Normal overworld tracks also play, alongside \"Axolotl\", \"Dragon Fish\" and \"Shuniji\", as the requirements for those are merely to be underwater rather than biome-determined."}

They are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. They are the only place where &lt;a href=\"sponge\"&gt;sponge&lt;/a&gt;s can be found and one of the two places where &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt; can be found; the other being &lt;a href=\"ocean%20ruins\"&gt;ocean ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneration.\nOcean monuments generate in areas with deep ocean biome variants everywhere within a 16 block square radius around the center point, and an aquatic biome (regular/deep/frozen ocean, regular/frozen river) everywhere within a 29 block square radius around the center point. In order to prevent air pockets, water generates around the monument as a part of the structure. It is the largest structure that does not contain a loot &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and the largest water structure. An ocean monument can also overwrite other structures like &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;s during generation.\nThey can be located with ocean &lt;a href=\"explorer%20map\"&gt;explorer map&lt;/a&gt;s, which are bought from cartographer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOcean monuments may also generate in existing &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;s with an (i.e. the amount of time players have been in the chunk) of less than 3 minutes. They generate in locations that they would have generated in the current version of \"Minecraft\", regardless of what terrain was originally there, meaning they may generate inside large square pools of water surrounded by land, causing the terrain to be harshly cut off.\nMobs.\nThe area of the ocean monument spawns only guardians after generating, also being the only location they spawn. Ocean monuments always contain three elder guardians \u2013 one at the top and one in each wing.\nIn Bedrock Edition, ocean monuments always generate at the same Y level, with the top of the roof always being at Y=56. The seafloor surrounding the monument will be cut off should it be higher than the monument's base.\nStructure.\nThe monument is constructed entirely from variants of &lt;a href=\"prismarine\"&gt;prismarine&lt;/a&gt; and lit by &lt;a href=\"sea%20lantern\"&gt;sea lantern&lt;/a&gt;s. It includes a large central section flanked by two wings. Under the monument are 23 giant pillars that stretch to the ocean floor. The main entrance is located at the front of the central section. The base size of the structure is 58\u00d758 blocks. Thus, the ocean monument (the location where &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s spawn) area is 3,364 square blocks.\nThe central section consists of various types of chambers. The chambers are randomly generated; each monument has a different number of rooms (at least six) arranged in a unique manner. The chambers connect vertically and horizontally to the different parts of the monument, including the left and right wings. At the topmost room resides an elder guardian. Around the center of the central section lies the treasure chamber, a tall room with eight &lt;a href=\"gold%20block\"&gt;gold block&lt;/a&gt;s encased in &lt;a href=\"dark%20prismarine\"&gt;dark prismarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nOccasionally, monuments contain one or more rooms with approximately 30 &lt;a href=\"wet%20sponge\"&gt;wet sponge&lt;/a&gt;s on the ceiling. Sponge rooms have an opening only in the floor. Not all monuments generate sponge rooms.\nOne of the wings contains a large room with a small pillar at the center. The room contains a second elder guardian. The other wing consists of a large open space with a large, square-shaped platform, containing another elder guardian. A long hallway that arcs around the wings and the back portion of the monument connects the two wings together."}

It wields an iron &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, can phase through walls, and is only summoned as one of the &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;'s attacks. They attack by lunging at their targets with their sword.\nSpawning.\nVexes spawn as part of an &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;'s summoning attack: The evoker is surrounded by white &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; and makes a magical, horn-like sound. Then, a group of three vexes appears near the evoker. The evoker can summon additional vexes even if some still remain alive from the last summoning.\nThe vex never spawns naturally, although it can be spawned using &lt;a href=\"spawn%20eggs\"&gt;spawn eggs&lt;/a&gt; or via &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\n, the vex's &lt;a href=\"iron%20sword\"&gt;iron sword&lt;/a&gt; does not drop, because its main hand's is . \n, the vex can drop its iron sword with random durability. This is not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; enchantment.\n is dropped when a vex is killed by a player or tamed &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nVexes attack players, adult &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s if an &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt; summoned them, and any other target as commanded by their summoning evoker (any mob that attacks the evoker accidentally or purposefully, or any mob that illagers naturally attack on sight). They still attack these mobs even when they do not have a weapon. Despite this, they deal the same amount of damage. \nVexes are capable of flying through the air, and can freely pass through any solid block, including &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, without taking damage. This means they can also pass through &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it is possible for them to die in &lt;a href=\"the%20Void\"&gt;the Void&lt;/a&gt;. While vexes can pass through blocks easily, honey blocks slow them down like other entities. Vexes also can be bounced back when pushed by a slime block.\nWhile attacking, vexes glow red and lunge at their target. They often fly towards the back of their targets and attack them from behind, making it difficult to block their attacks with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nVexes do not count towards the &lt;a href=\"bossbar\"&gt;bossbar&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any mob attacks a vex, any vexes in the area become hostile toward it. This includes &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s named \"Johnny\" that attack them, despite both being allied with the illagers.\nVexes summoned by an evoker start taking damage after 30 to 119 seconds and eventually die. Vexes summoned by a &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; or by the command don't take damage this way.\nA vex does not despawn if it has a custom name or if it is in a block, minecart, or boat.\nWhen idle, vexes wander within a 15\u00d711\u00d715 cuboid range centered on their evoker's position, unless summoned by a spawn egg or by the command. This happens when the vexes killed the mob that their evoker commanded them to.\nSounds.\nVexes use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nVexes have entity data associated with them that contains various properties."}

A village is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s, as people, &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, as pets, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, for defense, passive livestock mobs, for farms, occasional &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s with their &lt;a href=\"trader%20llama\"&gt;trader llama&lt;/a&gt;s. A village is a source of resources to the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, obtained from &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, loot &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, and other materials found in the village. Villages are also a target of &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; attacks by &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s when a player walks into a village with the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect.\nGeneration.\nVillages generate naturally in &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"meadow\"&gt;meadow&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. , they also generate in &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sunflower%20plains\"&gt;sunflower plains&lt;/a&gt; biomes. The type of the village, and therefore the style of all structures within it, is determined by the biome at the village center or meeting point. The buildings and wood depend on the biome the village is in. If the meeting point does not generate in one of the above biomes, the village defaults to plains style.\nThe following table shows the village styles corresponding to different biomes.\nThe number of villagers spawned depends on the number of beds in the village. Villagers spawn only in houses that have beds, while job site buildings (with no beds) always generate without villagers.\nIf a building or pathway generates over open-air, circular or square platforms of grass or sand (depending on the terrain) generates below the structure, which can cause surface oddities. These platforms do not generate beside cliffs or over the void; rather, they generate on the lowest blocks. Platforms can be clearly seen when a village building generates over an ocean. Farms generate a few blocks of open space above them if they happen to generate inside a hill. Village buildings can also generate suddenly on the top of a windswept hills while the other buildings are at the bottom of the windswept hills. This happens often in savanna villages.\nSome villages generate as abandoned; see below.\nVillages are slightly more common in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; than in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\". There is a roughly chance that at least one village is present within 500 blocks of the world spawn point in \"Java Edition\", while this chance is about in Bedrock Edition. This is due to the fact that villages can generate in more &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s in Bedrock Edition, as well as being closer to each other within an eligible biome.\nDespite the existence of jungle and swamp villagers, there are no swamp or jungle villages in the game.\nEvents.\nRaids.\nA player who kills an &lt;a href=\"illager%20captain\"&gt;illager captain&lt;/a&gt; (found in an outpost or a patrol) receives the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt; effect for 100 minutes. Like other status effects, Bad Omen can also be cleared by dying or drinking milk. Entering a village boundary while the effect is active triggers a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, in which groups of &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s spawn and attack the village. Killing multiple captains in \"Java Edition\" gives the player a higher level of Bad Omen, and the higher the level, the higher the chance for the raiding mobs to wield enchanted weapons.\nZombie sieges.\nZombie sieges are in-game events where many zombies spawn in a village, regardless of how well lit or walled off a village is. They have a 10% chance of occurring at midnight every night or during thunderstorms when a village has at least 20 valid beds. There is no indication of a zombie siege happening except for an unusually high number of zombies.\nStructure.\nBuildings.\nThe number of buildings making up a village can vary, and not every village consists of all building types at once. Apart from the meeting point, which is unique and systematic, the number of buildings of each type is randomly generated and increased in &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; worlds. More than one meeting point can generate in superflat worlds. The number of lamp posts and decorative structures (hay bales, melon patch, pumpkin &lt;a href=\"pile\"&gt;pile&lt;/a&gt;s, farms, snow and ice patches) has no restriction, as they are generated where no other buildings can be placed. These structures could have functions, and could be of great use to the player. Paths are found between the buildings of the village and often extend beyond them.\nStructures are chosen randomly from a pool of possible buildings. No one building has a greater chance to appear than another.\nThe full list of the village house blueprints can be accessed by going &lt;a href=\"Village/Structure/Blueprints\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchitecture style, and blocks making up the village structures, vary according to village type. Not every building can generate in a single village, although some blocks can be found in any village, such as job site blocks and food items. Buildings have different probabilities of generating, depending on village type; for example, a weaponsmith shop is more likely to appear in a taiga village than other villages.\n, villages don't generate with expected structures; for example, a fletcher house doesn't appear in a plains village and a stone mason house doesn't appear in a savanna village.\nPaths.\nVillages generate paths between the buildings and extending outside of the village. Village paths generate at the level of existing terrain, potentially going up steep hills or down ravines without regard for whether an entity could actually traverse the path. Paths do not go below sea level and replace only &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s (with air above), &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"red%20sandstone\"&gt;red sandstone&lt;/a&gt;; all other blocks are ignored and the blocks underneath are considered for replacement instead. Villagers use these paths to travel across the village.\nIn plains, savanna, taiga, and snowy villages, paths are comprised of &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt;s and grass. Savanna villages also generate farmland and crops in some paths. Dirt paths that generate over water are replaced by the village style's planks type. Desert villages generate with &lt;a href=\"smooth%20sandstone\"&gt;smooth sandstone&lt;/a&gt; paths. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Buffet\"&gt;Buffet&lt;/a&gt; worlds with cave generation, paths may generate on a separate layer from the rest of the buildings. In floating island generation, paths may not generate at all.\nTrees, lamp posts, and other decorative structures can generate in the middle of paths as obstructions.\nAbandoned villages.\nA village has a 2% chance of generating as an abandoned village (also known as zombie village).\nIn an abandoned village, all generated villagers are instead &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, and all &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es are missing. The zombie villagers do not despawn, but have no resistance to sunlight. The zombie villagers spawned inside these villages behave similar to &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt; as they stay in the shade even when a player or villager are nearby, only coming out when the sun has set. In abandoned villages, most &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; blocks are replaced by &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt;, random &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s (particularly wood) are replaced by &lt;a href=\"cobweb\"&gt;cobweb&lt;/a&gt;s, and all glass panes (besides those of the church) are replaced by brown &lt;a href=\"stained%20glass%20pane\"&gt;stained glass pane&lt;/a&gt;s to represent dirty glass. The job blocks, crops, and interiors are mostly left intact. Abandoned villages also spawn stray &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the usual village livestock, but they do \"not\" spawn &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s. The amount of buildings in an abandoned village can be slightly more than a normal village.\nMechanics.\nJava Edition.\nA subchunk is a \"village center\" if it contains at least one claimed &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block. The 26 subchunks in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube around such a subchunk are also considered part of a village.\nVillages as a whole have no defined \"center\", \"size\", or \"radius\", it's all based on proximity to any \"village center\" subchunk.\nBedrock Edition.\nA village always consists of at least one acceptable bed and one villager. Rarely, a village structure can generate without beds, thus not qualifying as a village. Upon creation, a village center is defined as a bed claimed by the first villager (a village leader), or the gathering site block (a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;), and the village's size is the greater of 32 blocks or the distance to the furthest bed from the center. Any villager, village golem, siege-spawned zombie, or raid-spawned illagers can pathfind back into the village if they find themselves farther than that many blocks from the center.\nVillages are established by the number of valid &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s in the village. \nThe maximum population of a village is the number of valid beds. If the population drops below that point (due to death or removal), but there are at least two villagers left who can reach each other, the villagers mate and &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; until the population is at the maximum.\n, a village is created when at least one villager links to one bed. The village continues to exist as long as one of its villagers remains linked to one of its beds. If all beds are unlinked (by being destroyed, by players sleeping in them, or by villagers failing to pathfind to them), then the village ceases to exist. When this happens the villagers lose all links to job site blocks and bells, and cannot use them.\nWhen the first villager links to a bed a village of size 65\u00d725\u00d765 blocks is created, centered on the pillow of that bed. The boundaries, and consequently the center (which is important because it defines where cats and iron golems can spawn), may change as other villagers link or unlink from point of interest (POI) blocks. When the boundaries change the center usually shifts to the location of POI block near the midpoint between the farthest out POI in each direction. In naturally generated villages there is usually a bell near the village center, but aside from that bells have no special role distinct from other POI in how the game defines and manages the village center and boundaries.\nGathering site.\nVillages have gathering sites where villagers may mingle. A gathering site is defined as a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt; located within the village boundary. A &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt; may spawn at a gathering site, accompanied by trader &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;llama&lt;/a&gt;s. A villager will also ring the bell when a raid starts. \nJob site blocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Job%20site\"&gt;Job site&lt;/a&gt; blocks are blocks such as &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"smithing%20table\"&gt;smithing table&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"lectern\"&gt;lectern&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used by villagers. Villagers with the corresponding professions spend their time in front of their job site block, except for nitwits, baby villagers and unemployed villagers (villagers without profession overlays). Upon claiming a job site block, green particles appear above both the villager and the job site block, and the villager takes up the profession of the job site block if unemployed. Villagers that have already been traded with can claim only job site blocks related to their profession. Employed villagers that are not linked to a job site block are unable to restock their trades. Villagers cannot link to a job site block that has already been claimed by another villager. There are thirteen job site blocks in the game, each linking to their respective villager profession."}

Apart from the well, which is unique and systematic, the number of buildings of each type is randomly generated, and increased in &lt;a href=\"superflat\"&gt;superflat&lt;/a&gt; worlds as there isn't too many obstacles in the way. Structures are picked from a weighted probability list (libraries are more common than butcher shops). There may be fewer buildings of a given type than the maximum allowed. The number of lamp posts has no restriction, as they are generated where no other buildings can be placed, such as smaller spaces. Roads are found between the buildings of the village and often extend beyond them for around 10 blocks without any buildings connected to them.\nVillage structures.\nThe descriptions below apply to plains villages. In other village types, some of the blocks are &lt;a href=\"Village%23Block%20substitution\"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt;, for example desert villages use sandstone in place of wood and cobblestone in most structures.\n\"Tables\" are made of brown carpets instead of wooden pressure plates.\nVillage buildings and farms never generate \"floating\", instead filling in a foundation down to ground level when necessary.

Villages usually spawn with multiple farms and houses. The rarest buildings are blacksmiths, butchers, churches, and libraries. Small villages may not even have one of each, but large villages can spawn with multiples of each.\nStreets are made with &lt;a href=\"grass%20path\"&gt;grass path&lt;/a&gt; if replacing &lt;a href=\"grass%20blocks\"&gt;grass blocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; or (in desert villages) &lt;a href=\"sandstone\"&gt;sandstone&lt;/a&gt; if replacing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; under. Streets are 3 blocks wide and lead away from the well in any of the 4 cardinal directions. All streets are straight with intersections at right angles. Streets don\u2019t need to be flat across.\nEntry stairs are optional for all buildings, and do not spawn if the door/entrance is at street level. A building is spawned above street level has stairs leading straight out from its entrance down to the street level, with cobblestone blocks as a foundation extending below the first floor if the building did not spawn on a flat spot. Also, all asymmetrical buildings can spawn as shown below or as a horizontal mirror image.\nA fraction of buildings in a new village generate without doors. Some buildings never spawn with doors; for example, blacksmith and small house V1.\nBuilding roofs and interior benches have not yet made use of corner stairs. Instead they still use Wooden Planks.\nBiome Variants.\nVillages have 4 types: \nTaiga villages use spruce &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, Savanna villages use acacia &lt;a href=\"wood\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;. There are acacia logs instead of cobblestone in savanna villages except the blacksmith, church, and around the well. Desert villages have sandstone based variants of all the buildings substituting regular sandstone for cobblestone or wooden logs, and smooth sandstone for wooden planks. Wooden doors and fence posts are still used despite the lack of wood sources. Desert blacksmiths still use stone slabs on the roof. Also cobblestone in the church, the blacksmith and around the well is not replaced with sandstone.\nZombie Villages.\nThere are also &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; villages, but is almost identical to the normal village; with the exception that no doors or torches are generated, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s would be generated in the village instead of &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s.

{"id": "29394", "revid": "45088647", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=29394", "title": "Village mechanics", "text": "This page describes mechanics relating to &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVillage definition.\nAs used in this article, the term \"village\" means a \"logical village\", which is an area of a world where village mechanics governs villager behavior. This is in contrast to a \"physical village\", which is a set of buildings, crop fields, etc. created as part of world generation. Although the two kinds of villages most often coincide, this is not obligatory:\nThis article describes the behavior of villagers in a logical village, whether or not they are in a physical village. Some of the behaviors are performed individually, while a couple (namely, spawning of iron golems and cats) are collective; in effect they are behaviors of the village as a whole.\nJava villages.\nVillages do not have a defined center or radius. Rather, a village is defined by proximity to a village subchunk.\nAny subchunk (a 16-block-high section of a &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;) containing a claimed &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block is considered to be a village center, and all 26 subchunks in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube around it are also considered part of the village, as used in &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;raids&lt;/a&gt; and some pathfinding. &lt;a href=\"Cat\"&gt;Cats&lt;/a&gt; will spawn within the 5x5x5 cube around a village center, and &lt;a href=\"Patrol\"&gt;patrols&lt;/a&gt; will not spawn when the player is in the same range.\nSubchunks in a 17\u00d717\u00d717 cube from village subchunks define degrees of proximity to a village.\nMob AI uses these definitions in various cases. For example, when a villager is not in a village and needs to return to one, it sets out in the direction of increasing proximity. When an iron golem patrols the village, it frequently looks for a village subchunk within a 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube of itself to walk to.\nPopulation of a village is never measured. Villager breeding succeeds if the birthing parent can path to an unclaimed bed with at least two empty blocks over its head. &lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt; spawning happens if enough villagers haven't seen a golem recently, when gathered near a bell or panicked by zombies. Cats spawn around players in or near villages if enough beds (and few enough cats) are nearby.\nGathering site.\nA gathering site is where villagers spend their mingling time during the day and can be anywhere in a village, even if it is not located in the center. It is defined by claimed &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s. When a bell is claimed, green particles appear above the bell and the bell is registered as a gathering site. \nDuring a raid, a villager goes to gathering sites and rings the bell to warn other villagers.\nAdding a bell establishes a new potential gathering site, even if the village already has one. Villagers remember their specific gathering site and go to it during mingling time, even if another gathering site is closer. However, new or unregistered villagers may choose this new site.\nIf the player is within 48 blocks of a bell (claimed or not) when a wandering trader is being spawned, the trader spawns within 48 blocks of the bell rather than the player.\nBedrock village.\nA village is defined through several mechanics: the village gathering sites, village radius, number of job sites, number of houses, villager population, population cap (maximum number of villagers that can live in the village based on available housing), &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; population, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; population. Players can use these mechanics to build artificial villages.\nHouse.\nA village needs at least one house and one villager to be considered a village. A house is defined as a &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. The game utilizes villager breeding to try to maintain a 100% population level, so long as there are at least two villagers occupying it.\nGathering site.\nA gathering site is where villagers spend their mingling time during the day and can be anywhere in a village, even if it is not located in the center. It is defined as a claimed &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;. When a bell is claimed, green particles appear above the bell and the bell is registered as a gathering site. If a player is in the village, a &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt; can spawn from a claimed bell.\nThe bell must be within the village boundary to be considered a centerpoint of the village, therefore it needs to be located near at least one villager and one bed. If villagers and a bell are present but without housing, the villagers search for unclaimed beds rather than mingle.\nDuring a raid, the bell rings automatically.\nAdding a bell at a location near claimed beds establishes a new gathering site, even if the village already has one. Each villager remembers their specific gathering site and goes there during mingling time, even if another gathering site is closer. However, new or unregistered villagers may choose this new location if it is closer.\nInitial Size of Villages.\nA village forms when a villager claims the first bed, indicated by green particles emitting from the bed and villager. Initially, the village spans a rectangular space with the bed's pillow at its center, extending outward 32 blocks in all horizontal directions and 12 blocks vertically from that point, resulting in a total volume of 65 blocks wide, 65 blocks deep, and 25 blocks high. New Points of Interest (POIs) like beds, &lt;a href=\"Bell\"&gt;bells&lt;/a&gt;, or job sites added within this area don't affect the village's size.\nExpansion of Villages.\nHowever, villages can expand further. Beyond the initial borders, within an additional range of 32 blocks horizontally and 52 blocks vertically, lies the potential for expansion. If new POIs are added within this extended area, the village will expand accordingly, growing the minimum amount needed to include the new POI. This expansion occurs when a villager claims the new POI, again indicated by green particles.\nVillage Origin Point.\nWhen the village remains within the initial bounding box, the designated POI origin point becomes its center. Initially, the village center aligns with the northwest bottom corner of the first bed's pillow. However, as villagers claim or un-claim POIs, the origin point may shift to another POI. This shift follows a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dgo4ySjnZKU8\"&gt;hierarchy based on the order in which villagers were introduced to the village&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, the first villager's bed is most likely to become the new origin point, followed by his claimed bell, and finally his job site. If the first villager unlinks from all his POIs or perishes, the second villager in the hierarchy will define the origin, prioritizing his bed, followed by his claimed bell, and then his job site. However, as of April 10, 2024, that can sometimes alter the hierarchy of villagers.\nVillage Center.\nIf the village borders expand, the center shifts to the geometric center to accommodate this growth, affecting where iron golems and cats spawn. While the origin point may still influence the bounding box to some extent, it will no longer necessarily correlate with the village center.\nDistinct Villages.\nTo create two separate villages, the new village must exist beyond the expansion range of the original one. The border of the second village must be at least 33 blocks away horizontally or 53 blocks vertically from the first border. This means that two basic villages each made up of a single claimed bed must be at least 97 blocks apart horizontally to be considered separate. This calculation considers the initial border of 32 blocks from the first bed's pillow, an additional 33 blocks for shared expansion area, and finally, the village border for the second bed's pillow.\nOverlap Potential.\nVillage expansion ranges can overlap. When two villages share the same expansion space, any claimed POIs within this area belong to the village whose border is closest to the POI. This means that both villages may expand into the shared space until their borders touch.\nHousing.\nA \"house\" is defined as a claimed bed. If the bed is obstructed by a solid block, villagers cannot pathfind to it and therefore cannot claim the bed. This causes anger particles to emit from the villager's head and from on top of the bed. If a villager succeeds in sleeping in an obstructed bed, the villager suffocates and dies, leaving the bed unclaimed.\nOnce a villager has claimed a bed, that bed is registered as a house in the village. The villager remembers their bed location, even when underground. In the evening, villagers return to their beds. However, if a villager cannot reach their bed and then loses ownership of it, other villagers can claim it. In this case the previous bed owner forgets the bed location and searches for another unclaimed bed.\nJob site.\nNaturally spawned villagers spawn either as unemployed or () as a nitwit. The unemployed can then change their profession by seeking and claiming an unclaimed &lt;a href=\"job%20site\"&gt;job site&lt;/a&gt; block. \nNaturally generated villages consist of two main types of buildings: houses (any building with beds) and job sites (a building with job site blocks). No villagers spawn in job site buildings. Therefore if a naturally generated village consists of only job site buildings, no villagers can spawn and () the structures are never registered as a village.\nEmployed villagers spend their time working at their job site block, starting in the morning. Unemployed villagers, nitwits, and baby villagers have no job site and do not work. Once a villager chooses a job site block, the villager remembers its location. They go to work in the morning, mingle at their gathering point, and return to work in the afternoon.\nBreeding and population cap.\nVillagers can breed without player intervention, but there must be at least two adult villagers who can reach one another.\nVillagers go into love mode (indicated by red heart particles above both their heads) if they have enough food to make themselves and their partner willing. They enter love mode based on their amount of food and not the population cap, but can produce a baby only if they have their own beds plus an available bed for the baby, and the beds have two empty blocks above them (there needs to be room for the baby to jump on the bed). If the population cap is met, or the beds are obstructed, this prevents them from mating, and angry particles appear above their heads (along with the heart particles, note that when this happen, they still use up their food points). Much like with farm animals, when two villagers are in love mode and can see each other, they go to each other and stare for a few seconds, after which a baby villager spawns next to them. Breeding villagers does not drop &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. The baby villager spawns wearing clothing dependent on the &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt; the village is in (with a small chance to inherit one of its parents' outfits, if different). It acquires a job after it has grown up and if there is a valid, unclaimed job site.\nWillingness.\nVillagers must be willing in order to breed. \nVillagers can become willing by having 12 food points, which are gained by consuming food in the villager's inventory. &lt;a href=\"Bread\"&gt;Bread&lt;/a&gt; provides 4 points, while &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s each provide only 1. Farmer villagers occasionally throw harvested crops at villagers, allowing them to pick them up to obtain enough food to become willing.\nBreeding consumes 12 food points.\nVillagers do not accept food or farm food themselves if gamerule 'mobgriefing' is set to false. This makes villager breeding possible only with 'mobgriefing' set to true, because villagers cannot become fully willing without food.\n, villagers can become willing if the player trades with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. This does not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.\nCuring zombie villagers.\n5% of zombies are zombie villagers. Additionally, when a villager is attacked by any &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; they have a chance (50% on normal &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;, and 100% on hard) of turning into a zombie villager instead of just being killed.\nPlayers can cure &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;Zombie Villager&lt;/a&gt;s by a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; on them while they are affected by &lt;a href=\"weakness\"&gt;weakness&lt;/a&gt;. Players can usually apply weakness by brewing &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s. In &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;-disabled servers, a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; and a zombie villager, or weakness &lt;a href=\"Arrow%23Tipped_arrows\"&gt;tipped arrows&lt;/a&gt; from a master fletcher are needed. Witches sometimes throw a splash potion of weakness if a player is within 3 meters, which players can use to their advantage.\nAfter the player uses the splash potion of weakness and a golden apple, the zombie makes a loud sizzling sound, emits orange swirly particles, and shakes. During the conversion time (up to 5 minutes), they still behave as zombies, so they should be protected from sunlight and kept away from nearby villagers. After a few minutes, they turn into regular villagers.\nA zombie villager who has been cured gives a permanent discount on trades to the curing player.\nPopularity.\nA player's popularity starts at zero and ranges between \u221230 and 30. The following can alter a player's popularity:\nA player's popularity does not reset on death, and players cannot alter other players' popularity. Popularity is stored per village; a player's popularity may be high in one village and low in another. When a player acts directly on a villager, particles around that villager indicate the change in popularity. Conversely, because popularity is stored per village, if the entire village is destroyed, any accumulated popularity, positive or negative, is also eliminated.\nIf a player has -15 popularity or less, the village's naturally-spawned &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s act hostile to that player until the player's popularity is increased by trading. Golems constructed by the player, however, are always passive toward the player.\nSummoning golems, trading, and healing increase popularity.\nCats.\n, &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s are spawned around players in or near villages. A random position is chosen near the player, and a cat is spawned if that position is within a 5\u00d75\u00d75 subchunk cube around a village center subchunk, and the position is within 48 blocks of at least 4 claimed beds and fewer than 5 cats are within a 97\u00d717\u00d797 box centered around the spawn position.\nCats spawned in this way may despawn if not tamed.\n, the number of &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;s spawned in a village is based on the number of beds in that village. Cats require only one villager, and one cat can spawn for every four beds, claimed or not. Up to 40 beds can be present for a maximum of 10 cats, and cats respawn based on the number of beds.\nIf there are two villages, each already with 10 cats, merging the villages into a single village does not cause any cats to despawn. However, the number of cats is still capped at 10, so no new cats spawn until the number of cats is below 10.\nThe player can run cats out of the village, thus allowing for more cats to spawn.\nIron golems.\n, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s are spawned when villagers are talking. Their spawning requirements are:\nRandom location choosing is attempted 10 times within 16 blocks of the villager, and is attempted once from 6 blocks above the chosen x and z, to 6 blocks below it.\n, &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s are spawned in villages meeting these requirements:\nTo clarify, iron golems can spawn as long as the player is within simulation range of the village's boundaries; being near the village center is not necessary. Simulation distance remains consistent both horizontally and vertically. The formula for calculating simulation range is as follows:\nformula_1\nA spawn is attempted on average once every 35 seconds and an iron golem can spawn when the 2\u00d74\u00d72 volume above the spawn point contains only non-solid blocks and the spawn block is solid.\nZombie sieges.\nAt midnight, there is a 10% chance that a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; siege might occur. This is when a large number of zombies spawn in or near a village, attacking what villagers they can reach, crowding around and pounding on the doors of those they can't. On &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hardcore\"&gt;hardcore&lt;/a&gt; mode, they can actually break down the wooden doors (this is true of all zombies, not just during sieges). They'll attempt to beat them down on other difficulties, but not succeed.\nZombies in sieges ignore the 24-block minimum distance from the player, but other than that, behave absolutely normally (i.e., they do not spawn on &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; or any other &lt;a href=\"opacity\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; or half block, need a 2\u00d71\u00d71 minimum space, etc.). Houses can be zombie-proofed by taking out one ground block from directly in front of the door, and if necessary, rehanging the door such that the outside is flush with the outside wall. This is because zombies can break only the top half of a door, and if they have to jump, they cannot get through. In addition, players can fill the hole with two layers of carpet to achieve the same effect as zombies cannot pathfind into the door.\nRaids.\nWhen a player with the '&lt;a href=\"Bad%20Omen\"&gt;Bad Omen&lt;/a&gt;' debuff enters a village, the Bad Omen effect disappears and a raid occurs. Raids are groups of &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es) attacking the village with the intent of killing villagers. They can remove the 'Bad Omen' debuff by drinking &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; before entering a village to prevent raids; however, the player can also defend a village from a raid, at which point the player gains the '&lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt;' buff. This causes villagers to give the player steep discounts during trading, as well as bestow various gifts upon the player."}
{"id": "133998", "revid": "44196195", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=133998", "title": "Village mechanics/Before Village &amp; Pillage", "text": "This page describes mechanics relating to &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13.2\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13.2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.7.1\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.7.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerminology.\nA village is defined by several factors: the village center, radius, number of houses, population (number of villagers), population cap (max. number of villagers, based on housing), number of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt;, and golem cap (based on population).\nA village needs at least one house and at least one villager in order to be a \"village\". A \"house\" is defined simply as a &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Door\"&gt;wooden door&lt;/a&gt; with an \"inside\" and an \"outside\" (see the next section for details). A village tries to maintain its population above 35% of the number of houses if there are at least two villagers.\nThe village center is the geometric center point, or \"average coordinates\" of all the doors. The village radius is the distance from this center point to the furthest door, or 32 blocks, whichever is greater. This means that the radius is always at least 32, no matter what, but it can be bigger if there are any houses further than 32 blocks from the center. The center point coordinates are truncated, resulting in a tendency towards .\nThe center of a village can be calculated by taking the average of all coordinates of the doors in the village: \n(x.coordinate_door1 + x.coordinate_door2 + x.coordinate_door3 + ...)/ number-of-doors = x.coordinate_village-center\n(y.coordinate_door1 + y.coordinate_door2 + y.coordinate_door3 + ...)/ number-of-doors = y.coordinate_village-center\nHousing.\nA \"house\" is defined as a wooden door with an \"inside\" and an \"outside.\" The \"inside\" is the side which has more spaces covered by \"roof\" blocks than the other, within five spaces horizontally of the door in the two directions it faces. A \"roof\" block is an opaque block at any height that blocks direct sunlight from reaching the spaces below it.\nAnother way to put it would be to say that an \"outside\" space has a direct view of the &lt;a href=\"sky\"&gt;sky&lt;/a&gt;, and so has a \"SL\" (&lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;sky light&lt;/a&gt;) value of 15. An \"inside\" space does not have a direct view of the sky (looking straight up) and a \"SL\" value of less than 15. The \"inside\" is the side which has more \"inside spaces\" than the \"outside\" (which, in turn, has more \"outside spaces\" than the \"inside.\") Technically, a sky light as low as 11 (but not lower) is allowed.\nA door is not counted as a house without a \"roof,\" or with the same number of covered spaces on either side.\nExample - The door is placed on the wooden planks. The game checks the spaces represented by the light blue wool, to see if they are covered by a \"roof\" block or not:\nThe simplest house looks something like this. Just a wooden door, with a &lt;a href=\"Dirt\"&gt;dirt block&lt;/a&gt; on the ground next to it:\nThe dirt blocks the light from reaching the space below it, and so counts as a roof block. There is one \"inside\" space, covered by a roof block, on the right side of the image (represented by the &lt;a href=\"Wool\"&gt;red wool&lt;/a&gt; below) and zero on the left. Since one is more than zero, there are more covered spaces on one side of the door than there are on the other, and so the game counts this as a house:\nThe following are also examples of houses:\nThe only blocks that matter are those directly above the colored wool. The blocks on either side of this area, if any, are not necessary.\nA door is two blocks tall, and this check is performed twice per door, if necessary. If the initial \"roof check\" (see Fig. 1) fails, then the bottom-most layer is ignored and the check is performed a second time, starting one layer higher. This time, only the spaces above the lime-green wool are checked for roof blocks:\nExample - For the door pictured below, the initial roof check finds there are two spaces covered by roof blocks on the left side, and two covered spaces on the right also. With the same number of covered spaces on each side, neither one can be designated the \"inside\" or the \"outside,\" and so the door is not counted as a house... yet, but we're not through yet, either:\nThen since the initial check failed, the bottom layer is ignored, and we perform the test again, this time checking for roof blocks only above (not level with) the green wool. This time, only the two spaces on the left-hand side of the image are covered. Since the \"roof check\" passed on this second try, the door counts as a house, and its \"inside\" is on the left where the more covered spaces are:\nIn the next example, the door passes the test on the initial first check. It has one covered space on the left side and two on the right. This makes it a house with the \"inside\" to the right. The second check would pass as well (with the \"inside\" on the left this time), but since the first one already passed, we don't even bother testing again. This door counts as a house, with the \"inside\" on the right:\nThe covered spaces don't have to be contiguous. The door below is a house, with the \"inside\" on the right, which has three covered spaces within the 5-space limit, while the left side has only two:\nThis next door has three covered spaces on each side, and is not a house:\nA house is initiated by a nearby villager. Without a villager nearby, it is not considered a \"house,\" just some blocks and a door:\nBut as soon as that villager shows up, it becomes a house (and a village):\nVillagers will recognize a house within sixteen blocks along both horizontal axes, and up to three blocks above or five blocks below the level of the ground the villager is standing on:\nOverlapping boundaries.\n\"Main article: &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Village_chaining\"&gt;Tutorials/Village_chaining&lt;/a&gt;\"\nTransparent blocks.\nIt seems there are three kinds of &lt;a href=\"transparent\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; blocks. First, there are fully transparent blocks such as &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Torch\"&gt;torches&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fence\"&gt;fences&lt;/a&gt;. Then, there are what are called \"partially transparent\" blocks such as &lt;a href=\"Slab\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt;, which are treated as transparent by the rendering engine. &lt;a href=\"Glowstone\"&gt;Glowstone&lt;/a&gt; is also treated as transparent, although you cannot see through any part of it. Solid transparent blocks can be used as \"floor\" blocks in villages. Semi-transparent blocks still block light from passing through (at least partially, as is the case with leaves or water), so they're still somehow considered opaque to the lighting engine, which appears to be where it counts. These partially transparent blocks will block the sunlight, and so will count as roof blocks. Fully transparent blocks still do not count. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; (both flowing and source blocks) are partially transparent, and will count as roof blocks. Leaves, slabs, and stairs count as roof blocks.\nCancelling out.\nThe rumor that two doors facing within a certain distance of each other will cancel each other out, causing neither of of them (or only one of them) to count as \"houses\", is not true. The doors on the left do not count as houses not because they are facing each other, but because each one has exactly one space covered by a roof block on either side.\nHere is an image that demonstrates the overlap between the areas checked for roof blocks by each of the two doors. The door on the left checks above the pink blocks, and the door on the right checks above the blue ones (but only in the center row that's inline with the doors, clearly). Purple blocks represent the area where the two zones overlap, and these spaces are checked by both doors:\nSince these doors both have the same number of covered spaces on either side, they don't have an \"inside\" or an \"outside,\" and therefore cannot be called \"houses.\" However, if additional blocks are placed behind these, they will be 6 blocks away from the far door, too far to be counted, but are still within range of the nearer door, creating the imbalance necessary to call them \"houses\":\nWith these additional blocks in place, the doors now are valid houses. This is my understanding, and the Village Info mod agrees:\nTransporting villagers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can transport villagers to new locations (for the purpose of starting new villages or baiting &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; traps) using a variety of techniques:\nBreeding and population cap.\nVillagers breed without player intervention, but there must be at least two adult villagers who can reach each other. If you are starting a village from scratch, or recovering from &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;zombie villagers&lt;/a&gt; and there are no villagers left (or only one), then you need to acquire more. The only ways to do that are:\nGiven a breeding pair, a village's population is maintained at 0.35 times the number of \"houses\" (defined above.) Specifically, villagers may mate if the current population (updated only once per second) is below 0.35 times the number of \"houses\" rounded down.\nResidents of a village which has not yet reached its population cap will occasionally go into \"love mode,\" indicated by animated hearts above their head (only visible if you have particle effects enabled, but still works even when you can't see it working). Much like with most animals, when two villagers are feeling \"romantic\" and can see each other, they will pathfind towards the other and \"kiss\" for a few seconds, after which a third, smaller (\"baby\") villager will spawn next to them. This new villager will be assigned a random profession (indicated by the style and color of its clothing), not necessarily the same as either parent.\nWillingness.\nVillagers must be \"willing\" in order to breed. After mating, they will no longer be willing and must be traded with again before becoming willing again.\nVillagers can become willing by the player trading with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. This will not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.\nVillagers can also become willing by having either 3 &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, 12 &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s 12 &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, or 12 &lt;a href=\"Beetroot\"&gt;beetroots&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory. Farmer villagers will throw harvested crops at villagers, allowing them to pick them up to obtain enough food to become willing.\nBreeding indefinitely.\nThere is also a bug or glitch where the villagers can be coaxed to breed indefinitely without regard to the population cap.\nVillagers need to be inside a sphere (radius = village radius) around the village center in order to breed, but the village population counts only villagers that are inside a box (width, length = 2\u00d7 village radius, height: 8 [always!]) around the village center. So with a sphere that can grow to any size, and a box that's always only 8 high, it should be apparent that there are some zones only covered by the sphere (above and below the village center).\nYou can reproduce/abuse this behavior by building 6 houses on the ground level (enough to set the villager limit to 2), drop 2 (or more) villagers into a 6 blocks deep hole, and leave one villager at the top to keep the houses \"alive\". The villagers in the hole will breed indefinitely, because they're not counted against the cap. As of Minecraft &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, you need to make the villagers willing to breed, by also giving them food (or give them a farm, a crop, with a farmer), or trading with them.\nIron golems.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn near the center of a village if it has at least ten villagers and 21 houses. Additional houses beyond the 21st will make no difference as far as golem spawning is concerned, although 29 would be needed to spawn ten villagers naturally. Additional villagers will allow more golems to spawn, in increments of one golem for every ten extra villagers (so 0-9 villagers allows no golems to spawn, the cap is set at zero; 10-19 raises that cap to one, 20-29 raises it to two, etc.). This cap only limits the number of golems in a village at any one time; as soon as one is killed or leaves the village boundaries, a new one can spawn in its place immediately.\nThe golem spawning zone is a 16\u00d716\u00d76 area centered around the center point of the village. As long as all the conditions are met (10 villagers, 21 houses, golem cap not reached), then each game tick (1/20 of a second) there is a 1/7000 chance the game will try to spawn a golem. When a golem is to be spawned, up to ten attempts are made to spawn a golem. A random spot is chosen inside the spawning zone, and if that spot is above a solid-topped block with at least 2\u00d72\u00d74 space above it (including liquids\u2014golems can spawn in water, which is key to most iron farm designs\u2014and transparent blocks), then a golem is spawned there.\nThe average expected spawning rate, if the golems are killed or flushed outside the village boundary quickly enough so that the cap is never reached and new ones are able to spawn in their place immediately, is roughly 10 golems per hour. A higher cap doesn't increase this rate beyond reducing the amount of time that the cap is filled while the newly-spawned golem is killed or removed."}

Adult villagers' outfits vary according to their occupation and &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; with them using &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s as currency. \nThey are also the most complex &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;, expressing a vast array of behaviors. \nSpawning.\nNatural generation.\nVillagers can be found in every type of &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, which can spawn in several &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;s and can cut into other biomes such as &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s. When the &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; is generated, unemployed villagers spawn in them, the number of which depends on the buildings in that village, as some buildings generate villagers inside and some do not.\nA cleric villager and cleric &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; spawn locked up in the basements of &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s (if the basement generates) under the &lt;a href=\"carpet\"&gt;carpet&lt;/a&gt; of the floor. , the villager and zombie villager inside igloo basements have random professions instead of always being clerics. The cleric villager can also turn into a leatherworker villager since the &lt;a href=\"cauldron\"&gt;cauldron&lt;/a&gt; in the basement is closer to the villager.\nCuring.\nGiving a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Weakness\"&gt;Weakness&lt;/a&gt; effect and then feeding it a &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt; starts the curing process. After five minutes, it transforms into a villager, displaying purple &lt;a href=\"Nausea\"&gt;Nausea&lt;/a&gt; status effect particles for 10 seconds after being cured. The villager retains the profession it had as a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;, if it had one before turning into a zombie villager. , if the zombie villager is player spawned, it adopts a randomly chosen profession. The villager can also be a nitwit, as the game counts it as a \"profession\" but the nitwit villager still can't work. If employed, the cured villager offers discounts on most of its trades.\nDrops.\nA villager, either adult or baby, does not ordinarily drop any &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; when killed. However, when a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; holds an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; or other item a villager is willing to &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; for, the item it offers in trade appears in its hands, alternating between items if there are multiple items the villager wants to trade. \nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, a villager drops .\nUpon successful trading, while willing to &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped.\nBehavior.\nMovement patterns.\nNitwit and unemployed villagers leave their homes at day and begin to explore the village. Generally, they wander inside the village during the day. They may go indoors or outdoors, periodically making mumbling sounds. Occasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, during which they stare at another villager for 4\u20135 seconds at a time. They continuously stare at a nearby player unless the villager is trying to get into a house at night, farm food, work, or flee from a zombie or illager. Baby villagers may jump on beds and play tag with each other, similarly to how baby &lt;a href=\"piglin\"&gt;piglin&lt;/a&gt;s and baby &lt;a href=\"hoglin\"&gt;hoglin&lt;/a&gt;s play tag.\n, baby villagers do not stop continuously in front of players, though they still do stare as they move.\nVillagers tend to not travel far from their beds in a large village unless the job site or the nearest gossip site (&lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;) is far from their beds.\nVillagers, like other mobs, can find paths around obstructions, avoid walking off cliffs of heights greater than 3 blocks, and avoid some blocks that cause harm. However, in crowded situations, one villager can push another off a cliff or into harm's way.\nVillagers emit green &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; if they join a village, set a bed, or acquire a job site/profession.\nVillagers run inside at night or during rain, closing doors behind them. They attempt to sleep at night, but if they cannot claim a bed, they stay indoors near a bed until morning. In the morning, they head outside and resume normal behavior. However, some villagers, such as nitwits, stay outside later than others unless being chased by an &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it moves quickly back within the boundary. A villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary forgets the village within about 6 seconds. Whether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to &lt;a href=\"despawn\"&gt;despawn&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nVillagers can open all wooden doors and find paths or blocks of interest behind the doors. However, they cannot open any trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors. Villagers can climb ladders, but do not recognize them as paths and do not deliberately use them. Any climbing of ladders seems to be a side effect of them being pushed into the block by another mob, (likely, and most often, other villagers). Unfortunately, this behavior can leave them stranded on the second floors and roofs of some village structures, as they lack the necessary AI to intentionally \"descend\" ladders. A simple fix for these situations is for the player to manually push the villager back toward the ladder hole and then install a &lt;a href=\"wooden%20trapdoor\"&gt;wooden trapdoor&lt;/a&gt; at the top, after the villager is returned to the ground level. One way to prevent a villager from climbing &lt;a href=\"ladder\"&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt;s is to break the first ladder touching the ground thus requiring a player to jump to the ladder to climb.\nGetting attacked.\nVillagers flee from &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"husk\"&gt;husk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s , &lt;a href=\"zoglin\"&gt;zoglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s (even if their crossbow has been broken), &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es within 8 blocks, and &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"illusioner\"&gt;illusioner&lt;/a&gt;s within 12 blocks /16 blocks . Like other passive mobs, villagers sprint away when attacked. Villagers do not run away from &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s (and their variants), &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"cave%20spider\"&gt;cave spider&lt;/a&gt;s since these &lt;a href=\"hostile%20mob\"&gt;hostile mob&lt;/a&gt;s are passive towards villagers, although a skeleton arrow might hit a villager by accident.\nPreferred path.\nVillagers favor pathways to reach a selected destination and try to stay in low-cost blocks, like the &lt;a href=\"dirt%20path\"&gt;dirt path&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; blocks. They also avoid jumping.\nJob site blocks.\nUnemployed villagers (other than babies and nitwits) seek employment at job site blocks (also referred to as workstations), and employed villagers use job site blocks to refresh their trades (see ). Villagers who have made their first trade can only claim a site block that corresponds with their profession, whereas tradeless villagers may change their profession to match a site block. \n, unemployed villagers claim job site blocks by searching for the nearest unclaimed site in a 48-block sphere. When a suitable site block is detected, the villager starts pathfinding to it, staking a provisional claim. This can only occur while the villager is awake. A provisional claim is released if the villager cannot reach the block within 60 seconds, however the villager may try again immediately. To fully claim the site and change profession, the villager must approach within a 2-block radius of the job site's center. When a job site block is fully claimed, its owner emits green particles, and no other villager can claim the block unless the owner relinquishes it. \n, all villagers search for unclaimed job sites in a 16 block radius and 4 block height. If a site block is found, it is added to a shared list of valid job site blocks for the whole village. An unemployed villager with a bed claims the first site block on that list and immediately change profession to match, regardless of distance or accessibility to the site block. A villager may make a claim while sleeping. If a villager cannot pathfind to their claimed site, both the block and the villager emit anger particles; the job site block may need to be broken before the villager relinquishes it. When a job site block is claimed, both the block and the villager making the claim emit green particles and the site block is removed from the list.\nGossiping.\nVillagers can store certain memories about players in the form of gossip. These get spread to other villagers whenever they talk with each other. Each piece of gossip is one of five types, and it stores a value as well as a target. Gossips generate and increase in value as a result of various player actions. The target is the player who caused the gossip. Together the gossip values determine a player's reputation with the villager, which influence trading prices and the hostility of naturally spawned iron golems.\nTrading with or &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager%23Curing\"&gt;curing a villager&lt;/a&gt; increase the value of the corresponding gossips for the targeted villager only. When a villager is attacked or killed, however, it instead generates the \"major negative\" gossip in every other villager it could see (eye-to-eye line of sight) inside a box extending 16 blocks from the villager in all coordinate directions.\nWhen a piece of gossip is shared, it is received at a lower value than the sharer has it. Gossips also decay a certain amount (see \"Decay\" column) every 20 minutes. Since \"major positive\" gossip have a share penalty equal to its max value and a decay of 0, it cannot be shared and never decays.\nA player's total reputation with a villager is determined by multiplying each gossip's value by their respective multiplier and adding the results together. For example, if a player has recently cured a villager for the first time but also attacked the villager twice, their reputation with that villager would be 5\u00d720 + 25 - 50 = 75. After 40 minutes the gossips have decayed twice, making the player's reputation 5\u00d720 + 23 - 10 = 113.\nThe prices of a villager's trades all get \"reduced\" by reputation times the price multiplier rounded down, meaning that a positive reputation lowers prices but a negative reputation increase them. The price multiplier is either 0.05 or 0.2 depending on the item, see &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;. Prices can not get lower than 1 or higher than the item's stack size. The exact function to calculate the price affected by the gossips is y = x - floor((5a + b + c - d - 5e) \u00d7 p), Where \"y\" is the final price, \"x\" is the base price, \"a\" is the value of , \"b\" is the value of , \"c\" is the value of , \"d\" is the value of , \"e\" is the value of , and \"p\" is the value of .\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron golems&lt;/a&gt; that were not built by a player become hostile towards players whose reputation with any nearby villager is -100 or lower. The golem checks all villagers inside a box centered on the golem and extending 10 blocks in every horizontal direction and 8 blocks in both vertical directions.\nPlayers can set villagers on fire using flint and steel or lava without affecting gossips. The same is true for TNT activated by redstone or a dispenser. However, TNT ignited directly by a player (using flint and steel, fire charges or flaming arrows) \"does\" generate gossip for damaged or killed villagers, because the TNT's damage is attributed to the player.\nPicking up items.\nVillagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned. Villagers do not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they do collect any &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wheat%20seeds\"&gt;wheat seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot%20seeds\"&gt;beetroot seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"torchflower%20seeds\"&gt;torchflower seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"pitcher%20pod\"&gt;pitcher pod&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; within range (bone meal can be picked up only by farmer villagers). These are the only items they can pick up, although the player may use the replace command to put a random item into a villager's inventory. Villagers can fill all 8 inventory slots with the same item. If a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player always picks it up first. If several villagers are next to an item, the same one picks up the item every time. Consequently, in constrained space, the same villager picks up any item dropped. This behavior prevents villagers from sharing food in a one-block space.\nWhen killed or converted to a zombie villager, any inventory item of the villager is lost, even when is set to .\nIf is , villagers cannot pick up items, and farmer villagers cannot plant or harvest crops.\nLike other mobs, villagers have four slots for worn &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, separate from their inventory. An adjacent dispenser can equip armor, &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s to a villager, but the armor is not rendered (except for carved pumpkins and mob heads). The equipment functions as normal; for example, a villager wearing an armor piece enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; can inflict Thorns damage to attackers, and a villager wearing &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Walker\"&gt;Frost Walker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; is able to create &lt;a href=\"frosted%20ice\"&gt;frosted ice&lt;/a&gt;. If a villager is converted into a zombie villager, the armor it was wearing is dropped, though it may be able to pick it up and equip it again.\nSharing food.\n, villagers collect bread, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, and wheat. If a villager has at least 24 of these items, it gives the extra amount to a villager with 4 or less of each these food items. That other villager can also do this until all villagers have shared all items they could (for example, on a group of three villagers one receives 60 bread, then it shares 36 to another villager to keep 24, and that same villager then shares 12 to the third villager).\nIn the case of wheat, villagers have a rather distinct behavior. They do the same as other crops, but if a villager has at least 32 wheat, it tries to give half of it to another villager, making both have 16 wheat.\nIf a villager has 8 full stacks of any kind of food or seeds and then tries to share with another, for example a bait villager in a farm where a hopper picks it all up, it leaves 24 in each stack in its inventory instead of calculating the total amount it has, and it always tries to maintain this minimum amount, thus it can never really empty its inventory down to 0 and clear a slot to pick up other stuff, unless it uses the items when trying to breed or when farming if they are a farmer.\n, if a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.\nTo share, a villager finds its first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager. When wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread, which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.\nFarming.\n, during the \"work\" portion of their schedule farmers tend nearby crops. \n, farmers tend crops within the village boundary. Villagers far enough outside the boundary of \"any\" village also tend nearby crops. Farmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 9 blocks away from the villager in the X and Z coordinates and up to 1 away in the Y coordinate (a 19\u00d719\u00d73 volume total).\nFor both editions,\nBreeding.\n, villagers can only attempt to breed while wandering (see below). Note however, villagers may not always follow their schedule; they may for example start instead of wandering if frightened, or wander instead of if there is no meeting place set in the village. Note however during the night villagers will always search for their beds rather than wandering, thus they cannot breed during the night. \n, wandering villagers may try to breed although there is no guarantee they will as villagers have multiple tasks to choose from while wandering. During a breeding attempt two willing (see below) villagers will look at each other and heart particles will appear around each of them. An attempt succeeds if an unclaimed bed can be reached via pathfinding within a 48 block radius of the breeding villagers. If successful, a baby villager will be created, 12 from each of the breeding villager's inventories will be consumed, and they must wait a 6000 &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; / 5 minute cooldown before attempting to breed again. The appearance of the child is randomly determined by either the biome type of the parents or by the biome where the breeding occurred. When the attempt fails anger particles are displayed, no baby villager is produced, and there is no cooldown before breeding may be attempted again. However, 12 food units are still consumed by each villager. Since villagers can't breed during the night they may produce up to two children a day maximum. \n a census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village are counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and the \"spherical\" boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they breed and produce a child. The &lt;a href=\"%23Appearance\"&gt;appearance&lt;/a&gt; is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs . \nFood Units.\nDuring breeding, food is required and consumed from the villager's inventories. Different foods supply different amounts of \"food units\" to the villager. &lt;a href=\"Carrot\"&gt;Carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, and &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s count for 1 food unit each while &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; counts as 4. \nWillingness.\nVillagers must be willing to breed. If a villager has 12 units of food in their inventory, they become willing. Breeding consumes the villager's food stock, therefore, after mating, villagers may cease to be willing until they regather a sufficient stock of food items.\nAny villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throws food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers consume the required food upon becoming willing. If is , villagers don't pick up food or break crops.\nBed Requirements.\nBreeding depends on the number of valid beds. If a villager is \"willing\" (see above), villagers may breed as long as there are unclaimed beds available within the limits of the village. require &lt;a href=\"bed\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;s with at least 2 empty blocks above the head (note that mobs view slabs as full blocks for pathfinding, so putting upper half slabs above a bed invalidates the bed). Job sites, jobs, doors, windows, or roofs are not required for villagers to breed. All baby villagers are initially unemployed. \nBaby villagers.\nBaby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will. They sometimes stop sprinting to stare at other villagers, the player, or an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;. If the iron golem is holding out a &lt;a href=\"poppy\"&gt;poppy&lt;/a&gt;, the children may cautiously take the flower from its hands. Baby villagers tend to group and chase one another around the village as if playing tag. They also jump on beds.\n&lt;a href=\"Illager\"&gt;Illager&lt;/a&gt;s ignore baby villagers until they reach adulthood.\nBaby villagers give gifts of &lt;a href=\"Flower\"&gt;poppies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wheat%20Seeds\"&gt;wheat seeds&lt;/a&gt; to players who have the effect . \nBaby villagers have a slightly bigger head than ; this also can be seen in other baby mobs in the game as well. \"Java Edition\" baby villagers don't have too big of a head, so they look like a tiny normal villager.\nBaby villagers can fit through 1\u00d71 block gaps.\nA baby villager becomes an adult 20 minutes after birth, even when in a boat or a minecart. Baby villagers with no AI do not grow up.\nLightning.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes within 3\u20134 blocks of a villager, the villager is replaced by a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt; that can't despawn. Even a baby villager that is struck by lightning is turned into a two-block-tall witch. \nIron golems also attack any villagers that turned into witches.\nIron golem summoning.\n&lt;a href=\"Villagers\"&gt;Villagers&lt;/a&gt; can summon &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s to protect themselves from hostile mobs. \nVillagers can summon an iron golem regardless of their profession (including nitwits) or latest working time.\n, a golem can spawn if there are at least 20 beds and 10 villagers. All villagers in the village must have a bed, and a profession with access to the profession block. It spawns in a 16\u00d76\u00d716 area around the village center and attempts to spawn once every 700 game ticks, or about every 35 seconds. One golem spawns per 10 villagers. The golem must be killed near the village as villagers have a long cooldown time for golems that wander away. \nPanicking.\nVillagers sometimes panic during a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20siege\"&gt;zombie siege&lt;/a&gt; by emitting water particles and shaking. During this time, Villagers refuse to sleep until the raid is over.\nIn \"Java Edition\", villagers panic if they see a mob that is hostile toward villagers, like a zombie, zombie villager, husk, drowned, zoglin, illager, vex, wither, or ravager and flee frantically from them, sometimes hiding in houses. In \"Bedrock Edition\", villagers panic by running around in circles around a bed in a village house, such as when a raid happens or when the player rings the village bell. \"Java Edition\" villagers in panic are more likely to summon iron golems. To see these mobs, the villager must have an unobstructed line of sight to it (eye-level to eye-level), and be within a certain range (spherical distance between feet center bottom-most point of the villager and hostile mob):\nZombies.\nZombies, zombie villagers, husks, and drowned seek out and attack villagers within a 35\u2013 to 52.5\u2013block radius (depending on &lt;a href=\"regional%20difficulty\"&gt;regional difficulty&lt;/a&gt;) or a 16-block radius (even when the villager is invisible). Zombies attempt to break down &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s, but only a fraction of zombies can do so and can succeed only when difficulty is set to hard. Zombies who cannot break doors tend to crowd around a door that separates them from a villager. If a zombie or a drowned comes across a set of doors with one open, it usually tries to go through the closed door.\nBoth zombies and drowned either kill villagers or convert them to &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s. The chance of the villager becoming a zombie villager upon death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard. Baby villagers can be infected by &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s as well. Drowned are able to convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking with a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; from a distance.\nRaids.\nDuring a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;, villagers flee from &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s and run to the nearest &lt;a href=\"Village%20house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;, similar to a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20siege\"&gt;zombie siege&lt;/a&gt;. For a villager to hide, the house must have a door and at least one bed.\nBefore the first raid wave , at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house. , the bell rings automatically regardless of whether a villager is nearby. , when a bell is rung, all illagers within 48 blocks get the &lt;a href=\"glowing\"&gt;glowing&lt;/a&gt; effect for 3 seconds. \nA villager often stays in the house it first entered, but may exit the house occasionally. The &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can still trade with villagers during a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn random occasions, the villager displays water &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; as if sweating.\n, once the player gains the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; status after defeating a raid, villagers give them a discount for their trades and throw them gifts related to their profession.\nFor a list of items that they can gift, see .\nStaring.\nVillagers stare at any player that stares at them, or goes near them. This also applies for some mobs, especially &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;. A villager first turns its head towards the player, then the body. Villagers can keep staring at the player unless a raid happens or a zombie comes and chases them off. \nSchedules.\nVillagers have set schedules depending on their age and employment status. Schedules define the villager's goals, which mostly determine how they behave throughout the day. However, their goals can be interrupted by higher priority behaviors most villagers have, such as fleeing from an attack, trading, and getting out of the rain.\nWorking.\nEmployed villagers spend most of their day standing next to their job site blocks. From time to time, they \"gather supplies\" by wandering a short distance away, then returning.\nSome professions have additional job-specific goals that are part of their work schedule:\nWhen a villager reaches its job site block, it commences \"work\". Two times a day, this action of working resupplies any locked trades. Villagers can resupply twice per day, even without having a bed or while sitting in a minecart. A villager can \"reach\" its job site block if the block is in any of the 8 directly adjacent or diagonal block spaces horizontally around it at the height of their feet, or at the 9 blocks below that. Villagers can still \"reach\" them diagonally, even if they can't see or touch the face of the block.\nEmployed villagers do not breed with each other during their work schedule. Nitwits and the unemployed do not follow this rule as they would breed with each other and the employed villagers.\nLeatherworker villagers work at any cauldron; the cauldron does not have to be filled with water in order for the villager to work at it.\nWandering.\nAll villagers wander from time to time, but for the unemployed and nitwits, they wander for the majority of their day. A wandering villager chooses a random block and walks toward it, then stands there for a variable amount of time before wandering again. If at any time it detects a job site block it can claim, it does so, assumes the skin for the associated profession, and immediately begins following the appropriate schedule.\nA villager attempts to claim a job site block by finding a path to a block next to one, showing angry particles when unable to reach it. After a villager fails to reach the job site block several times, it becomes unclaimed, indicated by showing angry particles on it. The villager loses its job site block and eventually becomes unemployed if the villager is at novice-level and no nearby job site block is available. Any other nearby unemployed villager has a chance to become the block's new owner. If there are no unemployed villagers nearby, then the villager who lost the job site block seeks for another unclaimed one or tries to reclaim the same unreachable one in an endless loop (this also happens for claiming beds).\nThe wander schedule includes a job-specific goal called \"exploring the outskirts\" that causes villagers to wander near the edges of the village. This enables them to detect new beds, job site blocks, bells, and houses that players have used to extend the village. \nDuring this time of the day, they may also share items.\nIn Java Edition this is the only time of day villagers are able to breed. As there are multiple tasks villagers may choose to do, there is no guarantee they will breed.\nGathering.\nLate in the day, adult villagers gather at a meeting place (the area around a &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;). When two villagers encounter one another, they mingle (look at each other and \"converse\" by humming at other villagers). \nIf a villager isn't close enough to detect a bell, it wanders randomly, searching for one.\nPlaying.\nBaby villagers wander randomly around the village. When they encounter another baby villager, the two of them follow each other for a while and sometimes run as if racing or chasing each other. \n, they sometimes stop to jump and bounce on a bed or to stare at an iron golem they encounter. If the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; offers them a poppy, the baby villager cautiously accepts it.\nReturning home.\nAll villagers head home a short time before sunset. They roam around until they get near their beds, then target a block beside the bed. Once they reach their beds, they do not go through a door again before sleeping.\nA villager who has no bed simply waits inside a house until morning. This includes players stealing a villager's bed to sleep in, mostly the villager stays in the house and doesn't move until sunrise. But sometimes, if they detect a unclaimed bed nearby they walk out of the house and towards the bed.\nSleeping.\nAt sunset, villagers lie down in their beds and remain there until morning. Villagers wake early if food is thrown at them , they are pushed out of bed, or if their bed is destroyed. They also wake up when their bed is , if they are , or when a bell is rung.\nIf possible, they return to sleeping in a bed after the interruption. #\nJumping on a bed with a villager sleeping in it doesn't cause the villager to get up. \nIn \"Java Edition\", villagers can be pushed on beds and sometimes turn their heads. A villager can be pushed off a bed, but most likely to go back to sleeping after staring at the player who pushed the villager for a few seconds. \nWhen sleeping in \"Bedrock Edition\", a villager's hitbox reduces to a cube restricted to the pillow part of the bed. If an anvil is dropped on the hitbox, the villager takes damage and wakes up. \nIn \"Java Edition\", dropping any anvil on a villager that is sleeping causes the anvil to bounce and drop as an item, and the villager remains sleeping and does not take damage. \nA villager who has no bed continues wandering in search of a bed to claim.\nVillagers follow their Overworld schedules regardless of which dimension they are in. They can sleep in &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, without causing the usual consequences of the bed exploding (See &lt;a href=\"Bed%23Sleeping\"&gt;Bed&lt;/a&gt;), if the Overworld's time is correct. This is because the daylight cycle continues in these dimensions, even though it is not normally apparent to the player.\nSometimes when a villager gets in a bed from another direction they turn their body until their head is on the pillow of the bed. Villagers also sleep with their eyes open, just like players.\nHealing.\nVillagers get a brief regeneration effect once leveling up in their profession. Pink regeneration particles appear when the villager is healing. \n, when villagers successfully sleep, they immediately heal themselves when waking up at dawn if they are damaged.\nProfessions.\nEach villager can have a profession except for the nitwit, indicated by their clothing as well as by the title at the top of the &lt;a href=\"trading%20interface\"&gt;trading interface&lt;/a&gt;. A villager can choose their profession by claiming a job site block. When they go to work, they use their daily schedule to get to their claimed job site block. Some professions, like farmers and librarians, do other things. Farmers plant crops, and librarians can inspect bookshelves. If an adult villager does not have a profession (either they are unemployed or a nitwit), they wander instead.\nA job site block can be claimed only if it is unclaimed and within a village boundary with at least 1 bed. Removal of a claimed job site block causes the owner to switch to another profession or become unemployed, provided that the villager has no prior trades with the player. If the villager has prior trades, it keeps its profession and claims a new job site block that matches its profession if one is available. So, once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever.\nNitwits and baby villagers cannot change their profession.\n, villagers summoned by a spawn egg or via command are always unemployed until they have claimed a job site block. , however, villagers summoned in similar ways have a random profession; their profession can be changed by a job site block, though.\nNovice-level villagers who have not yet traded can lose their profession and change into unemployed villagers.\nUnemployed adults actively seek for an unclaimed job site block and change into the corresponding profession.\nBelow is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires:\nNitwit.\nNitwit villagers wear robes that are green on top. They cannot acquire a profession, &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;, or gather around &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s, but are still able to breed. They are not equipped with a level stone since they cannot trade. Pressing on a nitwit in \"Java Edition\" causes it to grunt and bobble its head at the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. A nitwit must be born or spawned; no villagers change to nitwit from unemployed or a profession, and vice versa. Nitwits can be found naturally or by &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager%23Curing\"&gt;curing naturally spawned zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s. Zombie villagers can also be spawned as babies, so this is the only way to encounter baby nitwits in survival mode. , every baby villager has a 10% chance to become a nitwit when they become an adult, as well as having a different sleep schedule where they wander around the village for about 2000 ticks after other villagers go to sleep, before seeking a bed. If they can claim a bed, they arise in the morning 2000 ticks (1 minute 40 seconds) after the rest of the village wakes up. \nAppearance.\nVillagers and &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s have seven skin types corresponding to the biome they spawn in. Their appearance also varies based on their profession and their five tiers. They show which trade tier they have unlocked by a badge of a varying material on their belt. A new tier is obtained every time a player trades with a villager and the badge appears as stone, iron, gold, emerald, and finally diamond.\nVillagers have different outfits depending on their biome. Naturally generated villagers take on the outfit from the biome they were spawned in. When breeding occurs, the outfit of the child is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs, but , there is a 50% chance it's inherited from the biome type of the parents (equal chance for both parents). In case the villager's outfit is determined by biome but the biome has no specific villager type, it always becomes a plains villager. The outfits available are:\nVillagers have 13 professions and 2 non professions for a total of 15 outfits: \nTrading.\nThe trading system is a &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; mechanic that allows players to buy and sell various &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s to and from villagers, using &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s as a currency. Their trades can be valuable or somewhat meaningless, depending on the cost, the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s the player might get, and how the player treats the villagers. Only adult villagers with professions can trade; the player cannot trade with nitwits, unemployed villagers, or baby villagers. Attempting to do so causes the villager to display a head-bobbling animation and play the villager's declined trade sound.\n an employed villager allows a player to trade, making offers based on the villager's profession and profession level. All offers involve emeralds as a currency, and items related to the villager's profession. Trading can allow the acquisition of items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain, such as &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt;s with \"treasure\" enchantments (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"bottles%20o%27%20enchanting\"&gt;bottles o' enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Chainmail%20Armor\"&gt;chainmail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. When a villager gets a new trade, they receive 10 seconds of &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; I (totaling to of restoration), which emits pink particles. The villager also emits green particles suggesting contentment.\nCompleting a trade with a villager increases its professional level. Some trades grant higher levels to the villager than others. As it advances through its profession, the villager offers additional trades. When a villager unlocks a new trade at a higher level, it almost always grants more experience than lower-level trades.\nVillagers have a maximum supply of items and after the player has traded for an item that many times, the villager's supply of the item is exhausted. This results in the trade being temporarily locked. A player can continue to trade for the villager's other available items if any. Exhausted items are restocked when the villager works at a job site, up to twice per &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;.\n, librarian &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s have a 50% chance to sell enchanted books as part of their trades at novice, apprentice, and journeyman-level, and have chance to sell enchanted books at expert-level as part of their trades, meaning each librarian villager can sell up to four books. The price ranges between 5-64 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s per book. Based on the level of the enchantment and whether it is classified as a \"&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20mechanics\"&gt;treasure enchantment&lt;/a&gt;\" (meaning they are not obtainable by enchanting, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Mending\"&gt;Mending&lt;/a&gt;), which doubles the cost, or not a price is determined.\n, librarian villagers have a chance to sell an enchanted book as part of their trades at the novice, apprentice, and journeyman level, and have a 50% chance to sell an enchanted book at the expert level, meaning each librarian can sell up to four books. The price ranges from 5-64 &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s per book, depending on the enchantment's level as well as whether or not it is a &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20mechanics\"&gt;treasure enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey may contain any available enchantment (except Soul Speed and Swift Sneak) at any available level. See &lt;a href=\"Trading%23cite_note-enchanted-book-10\"&gt;trading notes&lt;/a&gt; for more information on enchantments and prices.\nClicking use on an unemployed or nitwit villager in \"&lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" causes it to grunt and bobble their head; doing so in \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" does nothing.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; on a villager always names the villager instead of opening the trading interface.\nSupply and demand.\nThe price of an item can rise and fall with changes in demand. The price of a traded item can rise when next resupplied, or fall from a risen price if not traded. Demand is stored per item, not per villager.\nTrade offering.\nWhen a player holds an item near a villager who wants that item, the villager holds up an item it offers in exchange. For example, a farmer villager who buys 20 &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; for one emerald holds up an emerald, offering it to a player holding wheat. Villagers do not offer trades that are currently out of stock. If the villager has more than one trade for an item, it cycles through the trades, offering a different item every few seconds. This kind of trading interaction makes it easier to find villagers who offer a particular trade, but the player must still open the trading interface to complete the trade. Note that villagers do not hold items to offer trades during their &lt;a href=\"Villager%23Schedules\"&gt;gather or sleep phases&lt;/a&gt;, even though it is still possible to trade with them.\nEconomic trade.\nVillagers have levels and require experience to unlock the next tiers of trade: level 1 is a novice, level 2 is apprentice, level 3 is journeyman, level 4 is expert, and level 5 is master. Villagers can resupply trades by themselves by working more at their job site block.\nPopularity or reputation.\n, villagers increase their prices of trades if a player's &lt;a href=\"popularity\"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; is low, (e.g. from &lt;a href=\"Damage/Mobs\"&gt;damaging&lt;/a&gt; villagers), and decrease it if their popularity is high (e.g. from trading with multiple villagers). Curing a &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; also increases the player's popularity by 10.\n, a villager's prices are affected by the player's &lt;a href=\"%23Gossiping\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with that villager rather than by village popularity.\nHero of the Village.\nWhen a player receives , players receive discounted prices on all the items traded by villagers in both editions. The also gets gifts. Each villager throws gifts related to its profession, and nitwits and unemployed villagers throw wheat seeds instead. These gifts range in value from common (like &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;) to rare items (like &lt;a href=\"chainmail%20armor\"&gt;chainmail armor&lt;/a&gt;). A player's popularity increases by 10 in \"Java Edition\" and doesn't increase in \"&lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;\". Villagers also shoot off &lt;a href=\"fireworks\"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt;, with different colored fireworks with no pattern.\nSimilar mobs.\nZombie villagers.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; kills a villager, it can turn the villager into a zombie villager, depending on the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;: 0% chance on Easy, 50% chance on Normal, and 100% chance on Hard. Zombie villagers also spawn naturally in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt; in the same conditions as a normal zombie, although much less commonly, with a 5% chance. Zombie villagers also spawn in &lt;a href=\"abandoned%20village\"&gt;abandoned village&lt;/a&gt;s (zombie villages) and &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s. They do \"not\" spawn from the zombie &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;.\nWandering trader.\nWandering traders are passive mobs that spawn randomly close to the player in both editions, or periodically in village gathering sites . Wandering traders also spawn near &lt;a href=\"bell\"&gt;bell&lt;/a&gt;s. Two &lt;a href=\"llama\"&gt;trader llama&lt;/a&gt;s spawn leashed to the wandering trader when a wandering trader is naturally spawned, and when summoned or spawned using a &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers may use emeralds to buy items from wandering traders without the need of unlocking the previous trade, but cannot trade items for emeralds. They also lock trades like villagers, but never unlock the trade, nor can they work at any job site blocks. Like villagers, wandering traders are attacked by most zombie variants (though they do not have a zombified form, they die if a zombie kills it, even on hard difficulty), &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es. \nWandering traders also drink a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Invisibility\"&gt;Potion of Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; at night (or when they see a hostile mob such as an illager or zombie). They also drink a &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk bucket&lt;/a&gt; in the morning to remove the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. They despawn after 40 minutes (even with a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; or in a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"boat\"&gt;boat&lt;/a&gt;) with their llamas.\nSounds.\nGeneric.\nVillagers use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nVillagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nTrivia.\nApril fools.\nOn April 1, 2014, Mojang announced that villagers have taken over the skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN) as an April Fools joke. This caused the player's current skin to turn into villager skins, and caused users to be unable to change their skins unless modifying the &lt;a href=\"launcher\"&gt;launcher&lt;/a&gt;.json file. Different career villager skins were used, including the then-unused nitwit villager (green robe).\nMany of the sounds were also changed, supposedly by the villagers. They seem to be similar to a villager talking (with words, rather than their normal sounds). The in-game music has also been altered to include villager like noises, and also features a villager version of the \"Game of Thrones\" theme on the title screen. The sounds originate from the sound resource pack created by &lt;a href=\"https%3A//youtube.com/%40elementanimation%3Fsi%3DEOW4-eHjh_c_0N28\"&gt;Element Animation,&lt;/a&gt; titled The Element Animation Villager Sound Resource Pack (T.E.A.V.S.R.P.), which is based on the villagers appearing in their fan videos. The villagers were voiced by Dan Lloyd, Director of Element Animation.\nThe skins and the sounds were reverted to the way they were before on April 2, 2014.

{"id": "110040", "revid": "31440879", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=110040", "title": "Villager (old)", "text": "Generic villagers were &lt;a href=\"passive\"&gt;passive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that inhabit &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s, with different professions, breed, and interact. Their clothing varied according to their occupation. A &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; could &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; with villagers, using &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s as currency. They were replaced with &lt;a href=\"Villager\"&gt;a revamped version of themselves&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Village%20%26amp%3B%20Pillage\"&gt;Village &amp; Pillage&lt;/a&gt; update.\nSpawning.\nNatural generation.\n, old villagers can only spawn in versions of Minecraft prior to 1.14. , old villagers can only spawn if they existed from a template world prior to &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.11.0\"&gt;1.11.0&lt;/a&gt;, and any old villager spawned after 1.11.0 outside a template world will be converted into &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager_v2&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaby villagers.\nVillagers will breed autonomously, but need doors and need to be willing in order to spawn baby villagers. After exactly 20 minutes during which the baby villager is within render distance, the baby villager will grow up to an adult. See &lt;a href=\"%23Breeding\"&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nCuring.\nVillagers will spawn if a player uses a &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"weakness\"&gt;weakness&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;v1 zombie villager&lt;/a&gt; in template world and then feeds it a regular &lt;a href=\"golden%20apple\"&gt;golden apple&lt;/a&gt;. It will then shake and turn into a villager within 0-5 minutes. During the change, the zombie villager can still burn in the sun.\nDrops.\nVillagers &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; nothing upon &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrade: 3\u20136 xp\nTrade while willing: 8\u201311 xp\nBehavior.\nMovement patterns.\nUpon spawning, villagers will leave their homes and begin to explore the village. Generally, they wander aimlessly inside the village during the day. They may go indoors or outdoors, and they periodically make mumbling sounds. Occasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, in which they will stare at another villager for 4-5 seconds at a time. In the case of players, they will continuously stare at them as long as the player is close enough, unless the villager tries to get into a house at night, farm food, or flee from a zombie.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt;, when a player attacks a villager, the villager will not run away, but anger particles will fly out from the villager if it is in a village. , villagers do not stop continuously in front of players. They will also &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt; away if the player attacks them.\nVillagers, like other mobs, will find paths around obstructions, avoiding walking off cliffs and some blocks that cause harm. However, in crowded situations it is possible for one villager to push another off a cliff or into harm. Villagers also occasionally walk off of ledges high enough to cause fall damage.\nAt night or during rain, villagers will run inside, closing doors behind them, and staying indoors until morning. In the morning they will head outside and resume normal behavior.\nVillagers will run away from &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es within 8 blocks.\nIf a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it will move quickly back within the boundary. A villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary will forget the village within about 6 seconds. Whether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to &lt;a href=\"despawn\"&gt;despawn&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nVillagers cannot open &lt;a href=\"trapdoor\"&gt;trapdoor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fence%20gate\"&gt;fence gate&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"iron%20door\"&gt;iron door&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere is evidence that villagers are prone to overcrowding certain areas of a village while leaving other areas completely empty. When moving inside, the AI prefers doors within 16 blocks (Euclidean distance). It also tends to prefer doors with fewer villagers nearby, however \"nearby\" in this case is only 1.5 blocks and, when moving inside, villagers prefer to move 2.5 blocks inside when the inside is to the south or east and therefore will be out of range of this check. During the day, it has been observed that villagers will tend to cluster near a trapped villager or any existing large cluster of villagers, likely due to the \"socialize\" AI routine overriding their inclination to wander.\nPicking up items.\nVillagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned. Villagers will not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they will collect any &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"seeds\"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"beetroot%20seeds\"&gt;beetroot seeds&lt;/a&gt; they happen to come within range of. These are the only items they are able to pick up, though the player may use the command to put an arbitrary item into a villager's inventory. If a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player will always pick it up first.\nEven when is set to , villagers that are killed with any of the available items above will not drop them once they are killed.\nAny items in these slots are lost if a villager becomes a zombie villager; a zombie villager has no inventory slots.\nIf is codice_1, villagers will not pick up items.\nA dispenser can be used, if adjacent to a villager, to place armor on it. While not visible in most cases (other than pumpkins and mob heads) the equipment will be fully functional; for example, the Thorns enchantment will hurt zombies that attack a villager with a piece of armor enchanted with the Thorns enchantment equipped.\nSharing food.\nIf a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; or 24 &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s, or 18 &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread or 12 carrots, potatoes or beetroot for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for Farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.\nTo share, a villager finds his first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager. When wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.\nFarming.\nAdult and baby brown-robed villagers, both farmers and other careers, will tend crops within the village boundary. Villagers far enough outside the boundary of \"any\" village will also tend nearby crops.\nFarmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 15 blocks away from the villager in X and Z and up to 1 away in Y (a 31\u00d731\u00d73 area total).\nBaby villager behavior.\nBaby villagers will sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will. They will sometimes stop sprinting to stare at an &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;. If the iron golem is holding a &lt;a href=\"poppy\"&gt;poppy&lt;/a&gt;, it might attract any baby villagers near it.\nBaby villagers in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt;s have a slightly bigger head than in the , this also can be seen in different baby mobs in the game as well.\nUnlike other breed-able mobs, the parents and child have no personal interactions other than socializing.\nZombies.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s will try to find and attack villagers within a 42 block radius (even when the villager is invisible), and will attempt to break down &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s. Zombies will only successfully break doors if the difficulty is set to hard, though only a fraction of zombies spawned in hard mode have the capacity to break doors. This also applies to zombie pigmen if they path find through a door. Villagers will run away from zombies, sometimes hiding in houses. The villager's only \"natural\" defense are the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s, which attack nearby hostile mobs. \nZombies will try to kill villagers, or convert them to &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;v1 zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s. The chance that the villager will become a zombie villager on death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard. Baby villagers can be infected by &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s as well.\nVillagers will also run from zombie pigmen, though the latter will not attack them.\n&lt;a href=\"Drowned\"&gt;Drowned&lt;/a&gt; will chase and attack villagers in the same way zombies will, and villagers will run from drowned in the same way they run from zombies. Drowned can also convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking from a distance with a &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt;.\nLightning.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes within 3\u20134 blocks of a villager, it will turn into a &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreeding.\nVillagers will mate depending on the number of valid &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s. If \"willing\" (see below), villagers will mate as long as the population is less than 35% (: 100%) of valid doors, rounded down. The type of villager that spawns is independent of the villager's parents.\nA valid door is any door within the village radius where the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks in a straight line on one side of the door is not the same as the number of \"outside\" spaces within 5 blocks on the other side of the door. A space is considered to be \"outside\" if it has nothing but transparent blocks above it all the way to the sky.\nA census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village and within 5 vertical blocks (: no apparent height limit) of the center will be counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and within the \"spherical\" boundary of the village will attempt to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they will mate with each other and produce a child.\nWillingness.\nAdditionally, villagers must be \"willing\" in order to breed. After mating, they will no longer be willing, and must be made willing again.\nVillagers can become willing by having either 3 &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, 12 &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;s, 12 &lt;a href=\"potato\"&gt;potato&lt;/a&gt;es, or 12 &lt;a href=\"beetroot\"&gt;beetroot&lt;/a&gt;s in one stack in their inventory. Any villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) will throw food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers will consume the required food upon becoming willing. \nVillagers may also become willing when the player trades with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. Most of the time, villagers becomes willing after the second or third trade. Green particles will appear if the villager becomes willing by trading. This will not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.8\"&gt;Java Edition 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, willingness was not implemented. The only factor needed is enough valid doors. \nProfessions and careers.\nEach villager has a profession, which can be identified by their clothing. Villagers also have careers specific to their profession. The player can identify a villager's career by reading the title at the top of the trading interface.\nBelow is a table listing the various villagers, with their careers in relation to their professions, as well as the IDs specifying these. While each profession has a 1 in 6 chance (16.67%) of occurring, the probabilities for individual careers to occur are more diversified. They are listed in the table as well.\nWhen a villager is transformed into a zombie villager, the profession of the zombie villager will remain unchanged. However, the career will be reset and randomly picked again if the zombie villager is cured, allowing for the player to get a villager with a new career and new trade offers. Old trade offers will disappear, even if the same career is chosen again.\nNitwit.\nThe nitwit villager is a villager that wears a green robe and cannot be &lt;a href=\"traded\"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; with.\nTrading.\nThe trading system is a &lt;a href=\"gameplay\"&gt;gameplay&lt;/a&gt; mechanic that allows players to trade &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and vice-versa with villagers. Their trades can be good or bad, depending on what the cost is and what &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; you might get. Trading is only available for adult villagers; the player cannot trade with baby villagers or the nitwit villager.\nRight-clicking a villager will allow a player to trade with them, and display their career. Villagers will make offers based on their profession and career, and will only make trades based on whatever offers they are making. Different offers may be viewed by pressing the left and right buttons next to the currently displayed offer. All offers involve &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt; as a currency, and some item pertinent to the villager's profession and career. Trading allows the acquisition of rare items that would otherwise be fairly difficult to obtain, such as chain &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. The trading mechanic allows players to get &lt;a href=\"bottle%20o%27%20enchanting\"&gt;bottle o' enchanting&lt;/a&gt; in survival mode. When villagers get a new trade, pink particles and green cross particles appear.\nAfter trading a new offer once, the villager will allow a new tier of offers. After 2-12 times an offer is repeated, the villager will lock the trade offer. That is, the villager will no longer offer this trade. When this happens, the player will have to use another new trade offer in the villager's window once (or several times if it is already used once), and then wait for a short time. If green particles appear, all trades unlock. That is, the villager will start offering all trades. There is a maximum number of tiers each villager can possess, varying by career. Once the villager has unlocked all tiers, it will not open any new ones. However, players will still be able to renew all offers by trading.\nRegeneration.\nWhen a villager gives off particles from a new trade, they get 10 seconds of Regeneration I, which gives them .\nCommands or external editors can help villagers get new trades. \nIf a villager unintentionally picks up certain seeds or crops, it will throw it to another villager to simulate trading between the villagers.\nSounds.\nVillagers used the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nVillagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.\nTrivia.\nApril fools.\nOn April 1, 2014, Mojang announced that villagers have taken over the skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN) as an April Fools joke. This caused players' current skin to turn into villager skins. This also caused users to be unable to change their skins. Different career villager skins were used, including the then-unused nitwit villager (green robe).\nMany of the sounds were also changed, supposedly by the villagers. They seem to be similar to a villager talking (with words, rather than their normal sounds). The in-game music has also been altered to include villager like noises, and also features a villager version of the \"Game of Thrones\" theme on the title screen. The sounds originate from the sound resource pack created by Element Animation, titled The Element Animation Villager Sound Resource Pack (T.E.A.V.S.R.P), which is based on the villagers appearing in their fan videos. The villagers were voiced by Dan Lloyd, Director of Element Animation."}

They tie with &lt;a href=\"piglin%20brute\"&gt;piglin brute&lt;/a&gt;s for dealing the third most melee damage in the game, following the &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; at damage and the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; at damage. \nThe vindicator's axe attack disables the player's &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; for 5 seconds, even when riding a &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Johnny\".\nA vindicator named \"Johnny\" (using a &lt;a href=\"name%20tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;, etc., or has its codice_2 tag set to codice_3) is hostile to every mob except &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s, other vindicators, &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s and players in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode. In &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt;, they also do not attack baby villagers, &lt;a href=\"illusioner\"&gt;illusioner&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s. This hostility extends to &lt;a href=\"vex\"&gt;vex&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;ravagers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Witch\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; in both editions.\n\"Johnny\" vindicators will also attempt to attack the &lt;a href=\"Ender%20Dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;, but it will not take damage.\nAll hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the \"Johnny\" vindicator in return, except for &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"endermite\"&gt;endermite&lt;/a&gt;s (as they die in one hit), &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elder%20guardian\"&gt;elder guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s (apart from their usual ramming behavior), &lt;a href=\"slime\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSince raid captains can instruct nearby pillagers to attack their target, naming a vindicator raid captain \"Johnny\" will cause other raiders to attack Johnny's target, even if they wouldn't usually. This can cause witches, vexes and ravagers to target one another, and can even cause ravagers to attack themselves. If this causes a witch to target a ravager, the witch will instead throw &lt;a href=\"Splash%20Potion\"&gt;Splash Potions of healing&lt;/a&gt;, since ravagers are raid mobs.\nThe codice_2 tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the codice_2 tag to codice_3 and it remains hostile in the same way as described. Conversely, the player can name the vindicator \"Johnny\" and set the codice_2 tag to codice_8, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.\nNaming a \"Johnny\" vindicator something else using a &lt;a href=\"Name%20Tag\"&gt;name tag&lt;/a&gt; will not set its codice_2 tag to codice_8, and it will continue to exhibit \"Johnny\" behavior.\nNaming a vindicator spawn egg \"Johnny\" and it on a &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt; has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named \"Johnny\".\nSounds.\nVindicators use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nVindicators also have entities' data associated with them that contains various properties."}

Vines are also naturally generated on &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; trees in swamps and &lt;a href=\"mangrove\"&gt;mangrove&lt;/a&gt; trees. , vines can also generate on dying oak, spruce, jungle and dark oak &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s. \nVines are found in &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;s and the allium room in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s.

Shears enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; are more efficient when used on vines; Efficiency II and above allows vines to be &lt;a href=\"instant%20mining\"&gt;instantly broken&lt;/a&gt;. Using an axe on vines can also increase efficiency, but does not allow for collection, even with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;. If multiple vines exist within the same block space, breaking one of them breaks all of them instead of just the one targeted and results in only a single vine dropping. Shears used by a dispenser cannot break vines.\nTrading.\nVines are sold by &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s for an &lt;a href=\"emerald\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;.\nBehavior.\nOn each block tick, the vine block has a 25% chance to spread in a randomly selected direction. Their spreading can be toggled by the &lt;a href=\"game%20rule\"&gt;game rule&lt;/a&gt;. Vines spread to adjacent blocks under certain conditions:\nVines cannot be grown using &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;.\nVines do not need light when growing.\nUsage.\nVines can be placed on the side of any block that fills its whole cube and blocks entity movement. They can also be placed on the bottom side of a block (although not the bottom side of another vine). However, a vine block without vines on any of the horizontal sides disappears if it gets an update from a neighboring block. Vines attached to the bottom of &lt;a href=\"stairs\"&gt;stairs&lt;/a&gt; are completely deleted by any block update.\nSeveral vines can be placed in the same block space, as long as they are facing different directions.\nVines can be climbed by standing next to them and holding the jump key. If there is a solid block behind the vines, the walk forward key can also be used.\nVines cancel a sprint if the player is sprinting, slowing the movement speed.\nVines absorb all fall damage, even without a solid surface nearby. on vines causes the player to hang, even if the vines are not adjacent to any surface.\nBlocks can replace vines if placed within the same block space. However, &lt;a href=\"item%20frame\"&gt;item frame&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"painting\"&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt;s cannot.\nComposting.\nPlacing vines into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nColor.\nBiome colors.\nThese values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.

{"id": "2632", "revid": "5110284", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2632", "title": "Void", "text": "The void is the name given to the empty space external to the world in any dimension, most commonly below it. In vanilla Minecraft, it can be entered by using a command or Map Editor, in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode, using glitches, or by reaching &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\nJava Edition.\nFalling at least 64 blocks (i.e: under Y=-128) into the void causes the health of any mob (except the ender dragon) to be depleted by about every , leading to the player's death in seconds at most. &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"totem%20of%20undying\"&gt;totems of undying&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Resistance\"&gt;Resistance&lt;/a&gt; effect and the &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; enchantment do not protect the player from dying in the void, and death occurs depending on the player's velocity, usually being around 250 blocks into the void. Other &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s can alter the death level slightly. It is possible to survive in the void if the player constantly eats &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20golden%20apple\"&gt;enchanted golden apple&lt;/a&gt;s. However, the only way to have enough of them is to have a &lt;a href=\"command%20block\"&gt;command block&lt;/a&gt; constantly giving them to the player. The player can also survive in the void by having &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Health\"&gt;Instant Health&lt;/a&gt; of a sufficient level (achievable only by commands). If commands are used to make the player invincible or bestow infinite health, the player falls until Minecraft crashes. A player who falls into the void on a server with anti-flying measures is kicked out regardless of having a flying mod. Riding a vehicle into the void results in the player being stuck in the vehicle until death. The void extends for 2 blocks (1.8\u00d710) on the Y-axis.\nThe void is black in the Overworld and Nether, and purple in the End. In the Overworld, the void also appears as having daylight if the player views from above sea level (Y=63; feet level Y=61.38). In the Nether, similarly, the void appears as the same color with the biome fog, if the player views above lava sea level (Y=31; feet level Y=29.38).\nOther &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt; may also fall through the void and receive the same damage as the player, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt;, which takes every . The &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; is completely immune to the void damage. All entities disappear at 64 blocks into the void. Any entity between 64 and 319 blocks into the void appears as black. In the Overworld and in the Nether, a barrier layer of &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; prevents the player from accessing the void. In &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;, however, the void is easily accessible due to the large gaps between the islands.\nBedrock and Education editions.\n, the player's health is depleted by every half second at Y=-65 and below. At Y=-104 an invisible &lt;a href=\"barrier\"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt; is created, preventing the player from falling further. This barrier can be bypassed by using commands such as codice_1, after which the player falls indefinitely until they crash the game or fly back up. In Creative mode, one does not die, giving free access to flying under the void. However, if the player goes to any coordinates beyond negative or positive X or Z of 8,388,608 blocks, the invisible barrier disappears due to blocks of any kind no longer being solid to the player (see &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20distance%20effects\"&gt;Bedrock Edition distance effects&lt;/a&gt; for more details). A similar phenomenon can also occur at certain lower coordinates in some instances.\nThere is daylight according to the current time in the void of Bedrock Edition.\n&lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt; also can't be boosted here using fireworks, making it fatal if the player does not have enough speed to return to a positive height.\nAll entities except &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s are damaged by the void. Withers summoned in the void are unable to shoot wither skulls since the game instantly deletes them, and they gradually lose health like other mobs.\nHistory.\nVoid fog.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, black void fog and the codice_2 particle effect were introduced. As the player descended below Y=17 in the Overworld, the void fog and particles would start to appear. As the player traveled deeper, the fog at the edge of the render distance would become closer until the player reached &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, where visibility was reduced to just a few blocks, beyond which was complete darkness. The gray void particles appeared below Y=17, as well as in the void.\nThe void fog was removed in snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2014w34c\"&gt;14w34c&lt;/a&gt;, the main reason being to improve performance. The codice_2 particle effect was also removed from the void, but stayed in the game until snapshot &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%2017w47a\"&gt;17w47a&lt;/a&gt; when it was removed as part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Flattening\"&gt;The Flattening&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

For the higher altitude Y levels 0 to 320, up to 10 monster rooms can generate, while up to 4 monster rooms can generate in lower altitude Y levels -58 to -1. It is possible, though unlikely, for multiple attempts to succeed. , monster rooms can generate as underground structures above sea level.\nMonster rooms are a &lt;a href=\"feature\"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; instead of a &lt;a href=\"structure\"&gt;structure&lt;/a&gt;, so they generate regardless of whether the \"Generate structures\" world creation option has been toggled off for said world. They also cannot be searched by the command.\nFor each attempt, a location (the position for monster spawner) and size (an open area with a width and length of 7 or 9 and a height of 6) is chosen. The attempt succeeds if the following conditions are met:\nIf the location passes, &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; are placed, then 3 attempts are made to generate each of two &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. To generate a chest, the chosen block must be empty and must have a solid block on exactly one of its four sides. The &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; is placed at the center of the monster room.\nThe monster spawner has a 50% chance of producing &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, a 25% chance of producing &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, or a 25% chance of producing &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. A zombie monster spawner also has the same chance (5%) of producing &lt;a href=\"zombie%20villager\"&gt;zombie villager&lt;/a&gt;s as in natural generation.\nCobblestone has a 75% chance to be &lt;a href=\"mossy\"&gt;mossy&lt;/a&gt; when it is on the floor of the monster room.\nYou can use the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt; codice_1 to generate a monster room only when you are under the specific location where the monster room could be found naturally.\nConstruction.\nMonster rooms are small rooms made of &lt;a href=\"cobblestone\"&gt;cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mossy%20cobblestone\"&gt;mossy cobblestone&lt;/a&gt; and contain a &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt; and up to 2 &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. Finding a monster room without a chest is unlikely but possible. Additionally, there is a rare chance of a monster room being found without a monster spawner. Occasionally, a monster room generates with its chests in such a way as to create a double chest. Monster rooms generate with either a &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt; (50% chance), &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; (25% chance), or &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; (25% chance) monster spawner. The monster spawner is always in the center of the monster room room, with chests located around the walls of the room (large chests can connect with the short side against the wall). Each block of the floor has a 25% chance of being cobblestone and a 75% chance of being mossy cobblestone.\nBecause the horizontal range for spawning mobs is 4 blocks from the monster spawner, it is possible for mobs to be spawned outside the walls of a 5\u00d75 monster room that is surrounded by air outside the walls."}

It cannot be obtained as an item or moved by a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;, and drops &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; orbs when broken.\nObtaining.\nMonster spawners cannot be obtained in &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt;, even with &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Touch\"&gt;Silk Touch&lt;/a&gt;.\nA monster spawner can be obtained in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative mode&lt;/a&gt; by taking it from Creative inventory, by using the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;, or by using . It is initially empty and inert, but can be configured to spawn a desired mob by a &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt; on the placed block.\nA , or command can also be used to obtain a monster spawner.\nBreaking.\nIf broken with a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, a monster spawner drops 15-43 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt;. When mined with anything else, it drops nothing.\nNatural generation.\nMonster spawners can generate naturally in the following places:\nUsage.\nThe monster spawner spawns mobs in an (at most) 9\u00d73\u00d79 volume (see ) around it when the player is within 16 blocks. Suitable spawning locations for the block's mob type are provided in or around the spawning volume. The monster spawner attempts to spawn four &lt;a href=\"Mob\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; around it, then waits from 10 to 39.95 seconds before attempting to spawn more.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt; difficulty, monster spawners still activate but do not spawn monsters . , &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"ghast\"&gt;ghast&lt;/a&gt;s do not spawn at all and other &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; mobs disappear immediately after spawning.\nMonster spawners are &lt;a href=\"transparent\"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt;, but they behave like in that they diffuse sky light coming from directly above. \n, they have a hitbox slightly smaller than a full block, and therefore, one can walk on the edge of a supporting full block directly below the monster spawner.\nMechanics.\nA monster spawner activates when a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; (that's not in &lt;a href=\"Spectator\"&gt;Spectator&lt;/a&gt; mode) comes within a spherical radius of 16 blocks from the center point of the block; i.e. 15.5 blocks from the monster spawner itself. an active monster spawner attempts to spawn mobs within a 4-block horizontal and 1-block vertical range; that is, in a 9\u00d73\u00d79 volume centered on the monster spawner. , the horizontal spawning range is 4 blocks &lt;a href=\"taxicab%20distance\"&gt;taxicab distance&lt;/a&gt;, creating spawning volume extending 4 blocks in each cardinal horizontal direction from the sides of the monster spawner; its horizontal cross-section is therefore diamond-shaped. Mobs can spawn anywhere in this range that is suitable, with mobs more likely to spawn closer to the monster spawner than farther away.\nWhile mobs are spawned at fractional x and z-coordinates (i.e. not aligned to blocks), they are spawned at an integer y-coordinate. Horizontally, a mob can spawn with its \"center point\" anywhere within range, but vertically, mobs spawn with their legs at either the same layer as the monster spawner block, one block above it, or one block below it. (Note that when there are other blocks slightly intersecting the mob's hitbox, they can sometimes glitch further away - often up - but this does not make it a true spawning point.)\nThe monster spawner attempts to spawn 4 mobs at randomly chosen points within the spawning volume, then waits anywhere from 200 to 799 ticks (10 to 39.95 seconds) before spawning again. As it waits, the mob model inside the block spins faster and faster. Except for the normal solid-block spawning requirement, all the remaining ones must be met (not in a solid block, correct light level, etc.), so the monster spawner often produces fewer than 4 mobs. When it does spawn, it emits a \"poof\", and more flame particles temporarily appear around it. If the monster spawner fails to spawn any mobs because it did not pick any suitable locations, it repeats this process every &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; until it succeeds. It only starts the next wait cycle after successfully spawning at least one mob.\nIf 6 or more mobs of the monster spawner's type have their &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt; intersecting a 9\u00d79\u00d79 volume centered on the monster spawner block or a 16\u00d710\u00d716 volume centered on the lower northwest corner of the monster spawner block , the monster spawner \"poofs\" without creating any mobs and then waits for the next cycle. This is checked before each of the four spawn attempts.\nSpawning requirements.\nThe monster spawner performs a relaxed version of the ordinary spawning check: the general solid block requirement is removed, but the volume (hitbox of the mob) is kept along with \"some\" other checks according to mob specifics. As a result, for some types of mobs to spawn in the outer planes of the spawning volume, some planes outside the volume may also need to be free of solid blocks to conform with the mobs' height, width, or other rules governing their individual spawn volumes. Examples:\nFor all of the volumes listed in the table, the horizontal plane is centered on the center of the monster spawner block. The height values begin at the plane below the spawner. For example, the 3.8-block high volume for blazes includes one block under the spawner and 1.8 blocks above the spawner. While the spawning volume for pigs is 8.9\u00d72.9\u00d78.9, the requirement of grass blocks that are necessary for pigs to spawn reduces the actual volume in which they successfully spawn to 8.9\u00d71.0\u00d78.9. Other mobs can spawn in mid-&lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring general rules about spawning on solid ground.\nThe spawn conditions do not include biomes for most mobs. As such, monster spawners can place mobs where they normally wouldn't generate. For example, a mooshroom monster spawner can operate in a plains biome as long as there are mycelium blocks within the spawn area because the mooshroom's spawning code checks only for mycelium. The reason mooshrooms are not actually spawned elsewhere is that the game does not normally try to spawn them in other biomes: only the mushroom field biome has mooshroom on the list of things to spawn.\nDisabling.\nThe way a monster spawner can be disabled depends on the entity it tries to spawn.\nFor a monster spawner that generates mobs that spawn only in dark conditions (light level = 0), a &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; placed on any side or top of the monster spawner is sufficient to disable it for the whole 9\u00d73\u00d79 volume.\nFor a &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt; monster spawner, a light level of 12 is required to prevent spawning. This can be achieved by:\nA monster spawner is also disabled by filling the spawning volume with &lt;a href=\"solid%20block\"&gt;solid block&lt;/a&gt;s. This is often used to disable &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt; monster spawners, as magma cubes can spawn in any light level. However, since all magma cubes require the space of a large magma cube in order to spawn, a clever placement of as little as 9 solid blocks a layer above the monster spawner (see right image) can completely disable it.\nCustom monster spawners.\n, using &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s, monster spawners can be customized:\nDetailed technical information about custom monster spawners can be found &lt;a href=\"%23Block%20data\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;.\n, monster spawner customization can not be done in the base game (i.e. without addons/behavior packs).\nNote blocks.\nMonster spawner can be placed under &lt;a href=\"note%20block\"&gt;note block&lt;/a&gt;s to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\nPiston interactivity.\nMonster spawners cannot be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by &lt;a href=\"sticky%20piston\"&gt;sticky piston&lt;/a&gt;s.\nData values.\nBlock data.\nA monster spawner has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nVideo.\n\"Note: This video is outdated, as monster spawners has been added to the Creative inventory in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.19.3\"&gt;Java Edition 1.19.3&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

This causes the mob that did the damage to retaliate in turn, and the two of them become locked into a duel until one of them dies. This is useful in combat as it distracts two monsters temporarily, kills one of them, and severely weakens the other.\nOnce a mob has taken damage from a mob or player, that mob or player is set as the mob's permanent target. This means that even if another mob or player attacks an infighting mob, the infighting mob does not stop trying to attack its permanent target. If a certain mob refuses to infight with another monster, it is likely because the player or a mob already attacked it, so the player or a mob was set as the mob's permanent target. That mob does not infight with any other mob until the attacking player or mob dies. If the attacker goes beyond the mob's sight range, this will reset the retaliating behavior and the mob will either return to neutral mode or search for a new target. This mechanic can be useful in &lt;a href=\"Survival%20multiplayer\"&gt;Survival multiplayer&lt;/a&gt;.

They do not naturally spawn in any other biome. A red mooshroom transforms into a brown mooshroom (and vice versa) when it is struck by &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Brown mooshrooms never spawn naturally. Red mooshrooms have a 5% chance of spawning as babies. &lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;Cows&lt;/a&gt; do not spawn in mushroom fields biomes.\nBreeding.\nA pair of mooshrooms can breed after being given &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;. A mooshroom cannot be bred with a cow unless the mooshroom has been sheared.\nFeeding wheat to a calf shortens its growing time by 10% of the remaining time. Baby mooshrooms do not have mushrooms on their backs. Mushrooms appear once the baby grows to an adult. Breeding two red mooshrooms has a chance to spawn a brown baby variant and vice versa.\nWhen breeding a red mooshroom and a brown mooshroom together, there is chance of getting a red baby variant, and a chance of getting a brown baby variant.\nDrops.\nWhen an adult mooshroom is killed, it drops:\nUpon successful &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped.\nShearing a mooshroom drops 5 corresponding &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s and turns the mooshroom into a normal &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;, emitting a smaller version of the\n&lt;a href=\"particles%23largeexplode\"&gt;explosion&lt;/a&gt; particle. The mushrooms don't grow back. This implies that mooshrooms are normal cows that have been infected with mushrooms.\nLike other baby animals, killing a baby mooshroom yields no items or experience.\nBehavior.\nMooshrooms have the same AI behavior as cows: they walk around slowly and aimlessly, huffing and mooing occasionally. They avoid danger such as cliffs, fire, or lava, but make no attempt to stay out of water. Although they behave similarly to cows, it is important to note that they are not the same as cows.\nA mooshroom follows a player holding &lt;a href=\"wheat\"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;. A lightning strike on a mooshroom switches its color, from red to brown, or brown to red.\nMilking.\nA mooshroom can be &lt;a href=\"milk\"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;ed by a &lt;a href=\"bucket\"&gt;bucket&lt;/a&gt; on it, yielding a &lt;a href=\"milk%20bucket\"&gt;milk bucket&lt;/a&gt;. Mooshrooms can also be using &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt;s to get &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20stew\"&gt;mushroom stew&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a small flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20stew\"&gt;suspicious stew&lt;/a&gt; related to that small flower the next time it is with a &lt;a href=\"bowl\"&gt;bowl&lt;/a&gt;.

Foliage can replace air on any of these blocks.\nBehavior.\n, all plants can be placed on moss except for &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cactus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fungus\"&gt;Nether fungi&lt;/a&gt; can also be placed on moss, but &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s can be placed only at light level 12 or below. , cactus, &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; are the only plants that \"cannot\" be placed on moss.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on moss blocks causes certain types of adjacent blocks to be replaced with moss blocks. To allow moss to spread to them, blocks need to have &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; above.\nWhen a moss block generates with air above it, it has a chance to have &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"azalea\"&gt;azalea&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"moss%20carpet\"&gt;moss carpet&lt;/a&gt; growing on it.\nSpreading specifics.\n, when bone meal is used on a moss block, first it is checked that the block directly above the moss block is air. If successful, maximum X and Z distances are chosen (independently from each other) with a 50% chance of being either 2 or 3. Then, in a rectangular area centered on the moss block restricted by those maximum distances, it is decided independently for each vertical column whether a block is converted to moss. This chance is 0% for the corners of the chosen area, 75% for the edges and 100% for the other columns. If this check succeeds a scan is started at a y-level one above the moss block to find a block with air above it. If the scan starts in an air block, it searches up to 6 blocks downward. If it starts in a non-air block, it searches up to up to 4 blocks upward. Both scans stop on the first block with air above it, even if it can not be converted to moss. The chosen block is converted to moss if it can be, and if it can (or already was a moss block) there is a 60% chance vegetation generates above it.\nSo for every bonemeal that is used, you get on average 27 moss blocks (varies widely though), which gives about 2.5 bonemeal when put through a composter.\nPiston interactivity.\nMoss blocks are destroyed and dropped as &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; when pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s. They do not stick to sticky pistons, &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;s.\nUsage.\nComposting.\nPlacing a moss block into a &lt;a href=\"composter\"&gt;composter&lt;/a&gt; has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\nHatching.\nA &lt;a href=\"sniffer%20egg\"&gt;sniffer egg&lt;/a&gt; hatches twice as fast as normal when on top of a moss block."}

They all can generate &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outpost\"&gt;pillager outpost&lt;/a&gt;s (except cherry grove ), with the meadow also being able to generate &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s and snowy slopes being able to generate &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of these biomes are the only places where &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn in the game. Like the &lt;a href=\"windswept%20hills\"&gt;windswept hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"emerald%20ore\"&gt;emerald ore&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in mountain biomes, especially at higher altitudes, and both &lt;a href=\"Coal%20ore\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"iron%20ore\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; ores are commonly found in the mountains. Underground, below the sea level, &lt;a href=\"infested%20block\"&gt;infested block&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ore%20%28feature%29\"&gt;blobs&lt;/a&gt; naturally generate in mountain biomes.\n&lt;a href=\"Deep%20Dark\"&gt;Deep Dark&lt;/a&gt; biomes and Ancient Cities also generates mostly under mountainous biomes, especially under jagged peaks, stony peaks, frozen peaks, snowy slopes, groves, cherry groves, meadows and savanna plateaus but also, to a lesser degree, under badlands, including eroded badlands as an eroded exception.\nVariants.\nThere are seven sub-biomes that can make up the mountains.\nSlopes.\nThese are the four biomes that can make up the slopes of mountains. These biomes usually generates in high altitudes beneath the peaks and hilltops but can also generate standalone in plateaus. \nMeadow.\nThe meadow is a grassy biome filled with patches of flowers and turquoise-green &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tall%20grass\"&gt;tall grass&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s spawn. All small flowers generate except &lt;a href=\"blue%20orchid\"&gt;blue orchid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tulip\"&gt;tulip&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lilies%20of%20the%20valley\"&gt;lilies of the valley&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"wither%20rose\"&gt;wither rose&lt;/a&gt;s. Rarely, a lone oak or &lt;a href=\"birch%20tree\"&gt;birch tree&lt;/a&gt; of any size can generate and always has a &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href=\"pillager%20outposts\"&gt;pillager outposts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Village\"&gt;plains villages&lt;/a&gt; can generate in this biome, making this the only mountain biome where villages can generate. , unlike most Overworld biomes, &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; patches cannot generate here. This biome is mainly next to &lt;a href=\"plain\"&gt;plain&lt;/a&gt;s, and separated from &lt;a href=\"cherry%20grove\"&gt;cherry grove&lt;/a&gt;s, regular &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s, regular &lt;a href=\"birch%20forest\"&gt;birch forest&lt;/a&gt;, or regular &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCherry grove.\nCherry groves are similar to meadows, but featuring &lt;a href=\"pink%20petal\"&gt;pink petal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cherry\"&gt;cherry&lt;/a&gt; trees identified by their striking pink leaves that drop petal &lt;a href=\"particles\"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt;. The cherry trees can generate densely enough create a cover of leaves. &lt;a href=\"Bee%20nest\"&gt;Bee nest&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s generate somewhat commonly on the side of the cherry trees. Cherry groves are mainly next to &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; and separated from meadows by &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGrove.\nThe mountain grove creates a forest of spruce &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s on the sides of a mountain, reminiscent of a &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt; but the surface is covered with &lt;a href=\"snow\"&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt; layers, &lt;a href=\"snow%20block\"&gt;snow block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"strip\"&gt;strip&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt; instead of grass blocks. &lt;a href=\"Rabbit\"&gt;Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and red &lt;a href=\"foxes\"&gt;foxes&lt;/a&gt; can spawn in this biome. This biome often generates next to snow slopes, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20taiga\"&gt;snowy taiga&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"taiga\"&gt;taiga&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe following mobs can naturally spawn here:\nSnowy slopes.\nThe snowy slopes is almost the same as the groves, with the difference being that there are no trees. It is a mostly barren biome covered in snow, multiple layers of snow blocks and &lt;a href=\"strip\"&gt;strip&lt;/a&gt;s of powder snow, with steep sides to the north or east also having stone cliffs covered with &lt;a href=\"snow%20layer\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Goat\"&gt;Goat&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in this biome alongside &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s. This is the only mountain biome where &lt;a href=\"igloo\"&gt;igloo&lt;/a&gt;s can generate. This biome generates usually next to groves, &lt;a href=\"snowy%20plains\"&gt;snowy plains&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"plains\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt;. Polar Bears can spawn in this biome.\nThe following mobs can naturally spawn here:\nPeaks.\nThere are three peak biomes that generate in areas with low &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Erosion\"&gt;erosion&lt;/a&gt;, high &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Weirdness\"&gt;PV value&lt;/a&gt;, and high &lt;a href=\"Biome%23Continentalness\"&gt;continentalness&lt;/a&gt; value, which means they generate only at the tops of the mountains that are tall enough to generate them. Jagged peaks and frozen peaks often generate on the peaks on different sides of large valleys.\nJagged peaks.\nThe jagged peaks biome is more likely to generate in taller and more jagged and pointy peaks that often pass the clouds and can peak at &lt;a href=\"Coordinates\"&gt;y=255&lt;/a&gt;. It is covered by a single layer of snow blocks with stone underneath often exposing ores such as coal, iron and emerald, and just like the snowy slopes, stone cliffs can generate in steep sides to the east or north with only a layer of snow covering them. Only goats spawn in this biome. , rabbits and polar bears also spawn here.\nThe following mobs can naturally spawn here:\nFrozen peaks.\nThe frozen peaks are covered by snow, snow blocks, with glaciers of &lt;a href=\"packed%20ice\"&gt;packed ice&lt;/a&gt; and occasional small blobs of ice. Packed ice cliffs can generate in steep sides to the east or north with only a layer of snow covering them. This biome usually generates in smaller and smoother hills, but it can also generate on taller and more jagged and pointy peaks but less compared to the jagged peaks biome.\nFrozen peaks use the same mob spawning chances as jagged peaks.\nStony peaks.\nThe stony peaks are a warmer variation of both the jagged peaks and the frozen peaks biomes that generates when a mountain peak is in a region with lukewarm biomes such as &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s, and it does not generate snowy slopes, groves, meadows or cherry groves in the slopes of the mountain. Instead, &lt;a href=\"savanna%20plateau\"&gt;savanna plateau&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;s often generate around it. It is mainly covered by stone with large &lt;a href=\"strip\"&gt;strip&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"calcite\"&gt;calcite&lt;/a&gt; and exposed ores.\nThe following mobs can naturally spawn here:\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Meadow.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Grove.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Snowy Slopes.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Jagged Peaks.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Frozen Peaks.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Stony Peaks.\nReferences.\n\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200e\u31648.

{"id": "103831", "revid": "50191588", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=103831", "title": "Mule", "text": "Mules are infertile offspring of &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;s that, when tamed, can be ridden and equipped with &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpawning.\nMules do not spawn naturally, but they can spawn through cross-breeding a &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"donkey\"&gt;donkey&lt;/a&gt;. Mules cannot breed with other mules.\n20% of mule &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s produce foals.\nAppearance.\nMules are the offspring of horses and donkeys and are closer to (but not quite) the size of a normal horse. Their ears, coats, and manes are like those of a donkey, though mules' coats are darker and reddish-brown. Like donkeys, mules cannot be equipped with armor but can be equipped with chests. Mules cannot have foals, much like mules in real life.\nUnlike almost all other mobs, mules with equipped saddles or chests do not render them when under the effect of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrops.\nUpon death, mules drop:\nIf equipped with a &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;, they drop those items, as well as any contents of the chest.\nUsage.\nTamed and &lt;a href=\"saddle\"&gt;saddle&lt;/a&gt;d mules can be used as a means of &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Mules cannot float on water when being controlled by a player. They can be ridden in water up to 2 blocks deep. In deeper water, the player is automatically dismounted.\nMules can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals. They can be pulled along and tied up using a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nTamed mules have the following &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt; available:\nEquipment can be placed on a mule by holding it and then on the mule, or by accessing its inventory. A mule\u2019s inventory can be accessed by mounting the mule and using control, or by and then or pressing the \"open inventory\" button on the mule.\nA mule starts out with just a saddle slot, but if it is given a chest, it acquires 15 more inventory slots that can hold anything the player wishes. Chests can be given to a mule by it with the chest in hand, and the chest cannot be removed except by killing the mule. Upon death, the mule drops the attached chest and its contents.\nFoals cannot be equipped with anything.\nRiding.\nOnce a mule is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, , and the mouse. The player dismounts using the control. For a long time, it was impossible for a player to use a nether portal or end portal while on a mule, until snapshot 24w21b, when minecraft added the new \"entitiesWithPassengersCanUsePortals\" gamerule, allowing minecarts, boats, and animals like pigs or horses to be ridden through a portal\nA ridden saddled mule automatically runs up any one block high slope. The mule and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The mule itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Mules cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.\nThe maximum speed of mules, when created by breeding a horse and a donkey, varies between 4.8375\u00a0blocks/second and 14.5125\u00a0blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.3\u00a0blocks/second). About 68% of mules are able to go faster than a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;. Any mule spawned with its spawn egg always has a speed of 7.525 blocks/second, which is slower than a minecart at full speed. Mules are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.\nRidden saddled mules have the ability of \"jumping charging\". When the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled mule can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Mules are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.\nBehavior.\nAll mules roam idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike sheep, the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Mules turn to look at any player that comes near. Any mule, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; without protest. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed mule, it rears and flails its front hooves.\nMules, like most mobs, can ride in a &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt; and boat. Unlike other passive mobs, mules slowly regenerate health.\nTaming.\nAdult mules can be tamed: with an empty hand, mount the mule repeatedly; when it no longer bucks the player and shows hearts, it is tamed. It is necessary to tame a mule in order to give it equipment or ride it for any length of time. \nTaming depends on the mule's \"temper\". Mules begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the mule, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The mule becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the mule.\nWhile riding an untamed mule, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid to give a general idea of the mule's speed. It is unknown whether there is any indication of jump height before taming.\nLike all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed.\nBreeding.\nLike their real-life counterparts, mules in \"Minecraft\" cannot produce offspring. The only way to produce a mule (other than using a spawn egg) is to cross-breed a horse with a donkey.\nFood.\nFeeding a mule food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; foals normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health. The table below lists the effects of the various foods mules eat.\nTo feed a mule, hold a valid food item and press on the mule. If the food is invalid, the player simply mounts the mule. Mules can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.\nStatistics.\nMules have three \"equine stats\" that vary from mule to mule: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the mule is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.\nSpawned values.\nWhen spawned in any way except breeding \u2013 for instance, using commands or using spawn eggs \u2013 mules are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.\nHealth.\nA mule's health ranges from 15\u201330, but tends toward the average of 22\u201323. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A mule with a non-even number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart. If the mule has lost one fewer health point than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.\nMovement speed.\nSpawned mules' speed is always 0.175; the player's normal walking speed is 0.1. The speed listed does not include any &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt; that affects the speed of a horse or a player. Bred mules have speed based on their parent's speeds, like all other horse breeding.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"Transportation%23Methods\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt;\" to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.\nJump strength.\nSpawned mules' jump strength is usually 0.5, which is enough to clear blocks. Other jump strengths can be found in bred mules, depending on the statistics of the parents (as explained later).\nBred values.\nWhen breeding a horse and a donkey, the foal's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined as &lt;a href=\"Horse%23statistics\"&gt;horses' stats&lt;/a&gt; are.\nSounds.\nMules use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nMules have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

There are various customization options that can be set by operators. These settings depend on the type of server and can create many different multiplayer experiences. \nTo change multiplayer settings in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, the world owner has to go to the world settings while not in the world, then select the \"Multiplayer\" tab, and are then given some options. \nThe first option is \"Multiplayer Game\". This option allows world owners to decide who can join them over Wi-Fi, by selecting an option on the \"Microsoft Account Settings\" dropdown. \nThe second option is called \"Visible to LAN Players\", which allows anyone on the same local network or Wi-Fi network the owner is on to join them, regardless of if they are a friend of theirs or not. There can be a maximum of 5/8 players at a time in a world.\n\"Java Edition\".\nTo enable multiplayer , the world owner has to first pause the game and press \"Open to LAN\", then the owner is then prompted some options:\nOnce the world is opened to the LAN, players on the same local network or Wi-Fi network as the world owner can join by going to the multiplayer section. Players who are going to join over Wi-Fi must do the following:\nAn important thing to note is that a Wi-Fi router Firewall/Computer Firewall can block you from joining/having others join your world. Ensure that no firewalls stop any incoming connections, though beware of the risks.\nDifferences from single-player.\nOnce making the world multiplayer, some differences are noticeable, with one being that game mechanisms do not stop working if the player pauses the game. For example, if the player has items being smelted in a furnace, pressing ESC does not stop the smelting process. \nGameplay in \"Minecraft\" is generally the same in both single-player and multiplayer. Multiplayer places more of an emphasis on community and collaboration between players, which is assisted by the multiplayer &lt;a href=\"%23Chat\"&gt;chat function&lt;/a&gt;. Multiplayer allows for the player to build and use contraptions that are intended for multiple players. In addition, there are many adventure maps and mini-games in which multiple players are required."}

They are the only place in the game where &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s are found, and have the special property that no hostile mobs normally spawn in them.\nDescription.\nMushroom fields generate in areas where the &lt;a href=\"continentalness\"&gt;continentalness&lt;/a&gt; values are the lowest, meaning they always generate as islands very far away from major landmasses, and are bordered by deep ocean biomes (which have the second-lowest continentalness values) of any temperature. Though in outdated versions, sometimes it connects landmasses. The islands have the occasional tendency to be close to one another, resulting in multiple mushroom fields separated by only a few hundred blocks.\nThe mushroom fields generate in usually flat islands and have &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s on the surface. Grass blocks that are placed by the player in this biome take on a bright green color, similar to the grass found in &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s. A large amount of brown and red &lt;a href=\"mushroom\"&gt;mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s cover the land. It is one of the only biomes, along with &lt;a href=\"swamp\"&gt;swamp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dark%20forest\"&gt;dark forest&lt;/a&gt;s, where &lt;a href=\"huge%20mushroom\"&gt;huge mushroom&lt;/a&gt;s generate naturally. &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20cane\"&gt;Sugar cane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; sometimes generate by the ocean.\nThe huge mushrooms generate with a density high enough to be a reliable source of &lt;a href=\"mushroom%20block\"&gt;mushroom block&lt;/a&gt;s, but low enough not to significantly obstruct vision. Here, mushrooms can grow in full sunlight. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; is a light gray color . This is the only biome where &lt;a href=\"mooshroom\"&gt;mooshroom&lt;/a&gt;s naturally spawn. Red mooshrooms, &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"glow%20squid\"&gt;glow squid&lt;/a&gt;s are the only mobs that spawn naturally in this biome; this also applies in &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mineshaft\"&gt;mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s, and other dark structures under the island, meaning the biome is mostly safe.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"monster%20spawner\"&gt;monster spawner&lt;/a&gt;s (found in mineshafts, dungeons, or strongholds) still spawn mobs, &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s still can spawn &lt;a href=\"illager\"&gt;illager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s along with &lt;a href=\"trader%20llama\"&gt;trader llama&lt;/a&gt;s can still spawn here, and the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; can still &lt;a href=\"breed\"&gt;breed&lt;/a&gt; animals, use a &lt;a href=\"fish%20bucket\"&gt;fish bucket&lt;/a&gt; to spawn fish, and spawn mobs using &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes in this biome still carry the small chance of spawning &lt;a href=\"skeleton%20trap\"&gt;skeleton trap&lt;/a&gt;s, and can transform red mooshrooms into brown mooshrooms or vice versa. If the player hasn't slept in three nights, &lt;a href=\"phantom\"&gt;phantom&lt;/a&gt;s spawn in the biome as well. Also, &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes generate underground allowing for monsters to spawn naturally.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a"}

Some types of music are triggered by events, while others play randomly while certain criteria are met. The song \"Alpha\" always plays instantly during the credits, and the song \"Boss\" always plays instantly while the player is in &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt; is undefeated or resummoned. Both of these tracks start playing in place of any already playing music. If the player is in the End and the ender dragon has been defeated, the normal End track plays for 15 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.\nIf the player is underwater in an &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; biome, random underwater tracks play randomly 10 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.\nIf none of the previous criteria are met, but the player is in the Nether, a random general &lt;a href=\"The%20Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; track or a Nether &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;-specific track plays, except &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt;s, which don't have any music. If the player is not in the Nether and is currently in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, a random track plays (Creative only on Bedrock). If the player is not in Creative but is currently playing (i.e., not on the menu screen), a random general track plays. These tracks all play 10 to 20 minutes after any currently playing tracks are finished.\nAll of these above conditions do not apply for music played with the command. As such, a second track may play overlapping the one played with commands.\nIf the player is on the menu screen, a random menu track starts playing after 1 to 30 seconds.\nMenu music stops playing when the player leaves the &lt;a href=\"main%20menu\"&gt;main menu&lt;/a&gt; and stops playing when a loading screen finishes. Game music stops playing when the player quits the world. When the game is paused , game music also pauses and resumes when the player exits the pause menu. , this is not the case because the game does not pause. All music regardless of type (including from ) stop playing immediately when the player sets the music slider in settings to 0, and won't continue afterwards.\nAll music as well as sounds in \"Minecraft\" are stored in the sound directory. However, the sound files are obfuscated and cannot be directly accessed. To get around with this, the sound directory can be extracted by the methods showed in &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Sound%20directory\"&gt;Tutorials/Sound directory&lt;/a&gt;.\nList.\nOverworld music.\nThese music tracks are played when the player is in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnderwater music.\nThese music tracks can be heard while the player's head is submerged in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in any &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt; biome.\nNether music.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnd music.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the &lt;a href=\"End\"&gt;End&lt;/a&gt; and throughout the &lt;a href=\"Credit%20Sequence\"&gt;Credit Sequence&lt;/a&gt;.\nMenu.\nThese music tracks play in the &lt;a href=\"main%20menu\"&gt;main menu&lt;/a&gt;.\nComposers.\nAll music in \"Minecraft\" was originally composed by &lt;a href=\"C418\"&gt;C418&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the game got more popular (specifically starting with the &lt;a href=\"Update%20Aquatic\"&gt;Update Aquatic&lt;/a&gt;, according to Mojang), others started to produce music and soundtracks for the game. Tracks for the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Update\"&gt;Nether Update&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%26amp%3B%20Cliffs\"&gt;Caves &amp; Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;: Part II, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Update\"&gt;The Wild Update&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trails%20%26amp%3B%20Tales\"&gt;Trails &amp; Tales&lt;/a&gt;, and were composed by &lt;a href=\"Lena%20Raine\"&gt;Lena Raine&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20%C3%85berg\"&gt;Samuel \u00c5berg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aaron%20Cherof\"&gt;Aaron Cherof&lt;/a&gt;. They also composed many recent ambient sounds. Some of the mash-up packs created by &lt;a href=\"4J%20Studios\"&gt;4J Studios&lt;/a&gt; and certain songs that play during &lt;a href=\"Mini%20games\"&gt;Minigames&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20Console%20Edition\"&gt;Legacy Console Edition&lt;/a&gt; include music by &lt;a href=\"Gareth%20Coker\"&gt;Gareth Coker&lt;/a&gt;."}

The format is comprised of a handful of \"tags\". Tags have a numeric ID, a name, and a . A user-accessible version in the form of is the stringified Named Binary Tag (SNBT) format.\nSNBT format.\nSNBT, also known as data tag, is often used in command . It can be described starting with enclosed in curly braces. One common usage of data tags is in commands, used to specify complex data for any entity.\nA data tag consists of zero or more attribute-value pairs delimited by commas and enclosed in curly braces. Each attribute-value pair consists of a tag name and the tag's value, separated by a colon. Some values, however, may be a compound tag and themselves contain attribute-value pairs, allowing a data tag to describe a hierarchical data structure. \nTag's name can be enclosed with double quotes if necessary.\nIt is different from the &lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; format; hence, any JSON used in NBT, such as &lt;a href=\"Commands%23Raw%20JSON%20text\"&gt;raw JSON text&lt;/a&gt;, must be enclosed within a string tag.\nNBT object.\nWhen the game is running, entities and block entities in loading chunks are stored in the memory. They are not stored with NBT, instead, they are just programmatic objects.\nWhen processing NBT operations, the game needs to generate programmatic NBT object from entities/block entities, parse SNBT into NBT object, modify entities/blocks based on provided NBT object, or convert NBT object into SNBT.\nGenerating NBT object.\nWhen generating NBT from an entity/block, the entity/block's properties are added into programmatic NBT object.\nNote that not all properties are added. For example, the value of whether a player is opening a chest won't be added into NBT object.\nA value is added with certain data type. For example, a resource location will be &lt;a href=\"Resource%20location%23Conversion%20to%20string\"&gt;converted to a string value&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese NBT objects will also be stored into game's save files as NBT files when the game quits or automatically saves. So the data structures that NBT tags describe and the data type for each tag are basically the same ones used in game's save files. These data structures are described in other articles and commands expect data tags to use the same attribute names (which are case-sensitive):\nConversion to SNBT.\nA programmatic NBT object would be converted to a SNBT when trying to get it with etc.\nAfter converted, a number is always followed by a letter (lowercase for b, s, f, d, and uppercase for L) except . For example, codice_2 for a short, codice_3 for a float, etc.\nAnd a string is always enclosed by double or single quotes.\nOther data types are expressed as the &lt;a href=\"%23Data%20types\"&gt;#Data types&lt;/a&gt; table above.\nConversion from SNBT.\nAn SNBT will be converted to a programmatic NBT object when parsed by the game.\nA number that followed by a letter (B, S, L, F, D, or their lowercase) is resolved to corresponding data type. For example, codice_2 for a short, codice_3 for a float, etc. The letter can be uppercase or lowercase. When no letter is used, it assumes double if there's a decimal point, int if there's no decimal point and the size fits within 32 bits, or string if neither is true.\nA square-bracketed literal is assumed to be a list unless an identifier is used: codice_6 for an int array and codice_7 for a long array.\ncodice_8 and codice_9 are converted as codice_10 and codice_11 respectively.\nModifying entity/block based on NBT object.\nModifying entity/block based on a programmatic NBT object is not a simple progress. All certain tags need to be resolved before changing properties of a block/entity. Note that only certain properties can be changed. For example, when using command to modify a block entity, its coordinates cannot be changed.\nIf a property needs a value of resource location and gets a tag, the string is &lt;a href=\"Resource%20location%23Conversion%20from%20string\"&gt;converted to a resource location&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf a property needs a value of JSON text and gets a tag, the string is parsed into JSON text object.\nIf a property needs a boolean value and gets a numeric tag, true if the number is not 0 after some rounding operation and conversion to byte.\nIf a property needs a boolean value and gets a non-numeric tag, the property becomes false.\nIf a property needs a numeric value of certain type and gets a numeric tag of wrong type, the value gets some rounding operation and converts to the required type.\nIf a property needs a numeric value and gets a non-numeric tag, the number becomes 0.\nIf a property needs a string value and gets a non-string tag, the string becomes an empty string.\nIf a property needs a list or array of certain type and gets a wrong-type tag, a empty list/array is got.\nIf a property needs a compound tag and gets a non-compound tag, a empty compound tag is got.\nTesting NBT tags.\nWhen commands such as , are used to match data tags, or &lt;a href=\"target%20selectors%23Selecting%20targets%20by%20NBT%20data%E2%80%8C\"&gt;nbt argument in target selector&lt;/a&gt; tries to target entity, the game converts SNBT into programmatic NBT object and gets programmatic NBT object from block/entity/storage, then compares the two NBT objects.\nThey check only for the presence of the provided tags in the target entity/block/storage. This means that the entity/block/storage can have additional tags and still match. This is true even for lists: the order and number of elements in a list are not considered, and as long as every requested element is in the list, it matches even if there are additional elements. For example, an entity with data codice_12 can be targeted by codice_13 or even just codice_14 even though the former represents a totally different position and the latter is not a valid position at all. Note that codice_15 can't match it, because an empty list can only match empty list.\nHowever, the order and number of elements in a byte/long/int array is acknowledged.\nThe requested data tags in the target entity/block/storage must match \"exactly\" for the provided tags to pass, including the data type (e.g. codice_16, an int, will not match codice_17, a double). Namespaces also can't omitted because in NBT object it is just a plain string that won't be resolved into a resource location (e.g. codice_18 will not match a stone item entity, it must be codice_19). The same is true for string of JSON text, which must be exactly the same to match the provided tag (e.g. codice_20 will not match any entity, it must be codice_21 or codice_22).\nBinary format.\nAn NBT file is a zipped Compound tag, with the name and tag ID included. The file in the zip must contain the Compound tag that it is as the first bytes. Some of the files utilized by Minecraft may be uncompressed, but in most cases, the files follow Notch's original specification and are compressed with GZip.\nTAG definition.\nA tag is an individual part of the data tree. The first byte in a tag is the tag type (ID), followed by a two byte big-endian unsigned integer for the length of the name, then the name as a string in UTF-8 format (Note TAG_End is not named and does not contain the extra 2 bytes; the name is assumed to be empty). Finally, depending on the type of the tag, the bytes that follow are part of that tag's \"payload\". This table describes each of the 13 known tags in version 19133 of the NBT format:\nThe List and Compound tags can be and often are recursively nested. It should also be noted that, in a list of lists, each of the sub-lists can list a different kind of tag.\nUsage.\n\"Minecraft\" sometimes uses the NBT format inconsistently; in some instances, empty lists may be represented as a list of Byte tags rather than a list of the correct type, or as a list of End tags in newer versions of Minecraft, which can break some older NBT tools.\nIn most cases, the files follow Notch's original specification and are compressed with GZip. But some of the files utilized by Minecraft may be uncompressed, or with (aka DEFLATE with a few bytes extra).\nAdditionally, almost every root tag has an empty name string and encapsulates only one Compound or List tag with the actual data and a name. Just like &lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"servers.dat\"&gt;servers.dat&lt;/a&gt;. For instance:\n, the root tag in an NBT file can sometimes be a instead of a . \n, all numbers are encoded in little-endian. This includes the size prefix before tag names, values and or values, as well as values in all numeric tags.\n, the &lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt; is uncompressed NBT file with an 8-byte header, consisting of a little-endian 4-byte integer indicating the type of the file, which is 3 (was 2 before latest update) for level.dat. It is followed by another integer containing the length of the file, minus the header.\nJSON and NBT.\n&lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight text-based data-interchange format. The standard of JSON text is specified at &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/\"&gt;EMCA-404&lt;/a&gt;. See also &lt;a href=\"JSON\"&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt;.\nJSON is very different from NBT. NBT is a data structure which can be represented by binary file or string. JSON is a text format for data-interchange. There are only six data types in JSON: JsonString, JsonNumber, JsonBoolean, JsonNull, JsonObject, and JsonArray. In NBT, there're more types for different numbers, and there're no null and boolean data types. In NBT, there're list, byte array, int array and long array, and elements in a list or an array must be in the same type. However, in JSON, there's only JsonArray, in which elements can be in different data types. The key of a tag in SNBT is allowed to be unquoted, while the key of a name-value pair in JSON must be double-quoted.\nSo conversion between NBT and JSON may lose a lot of information, and at the same time add a lot of redundant information. However, the conversion is sometimes used by vanilla game . Currently used in &lt;a href=\"custom%20biome\"&gt;custom biome&lt;/a&gt;'s ambient particle and &lt;a href=\"processor%20list\"&gt;processor list&lt;/a&gt;'s \"rule\" processor type. Below is how the vanilla game converts them.\nOfficial software.\nMojang has provided sample Java NBT classes for developers to use and reference as part of the source code for the &lt;a href=\"MCRegion\"&gt;MCRegion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20file%20format\"&gt;Anvil file format&lt;/a&gt; converter. Since &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.13\"&gt;Java Edition 1.13&lt;/a&gt;, \"Minecraft\" includes a built-in converter between the SNBT format and compressed NBT format, which comes with both the &lt;a href=\"client.jar\"&gt;client&lt;/a&gt; and official server.\nThe data generator from \"Minecraft\" is able to convert uncompressed Stringified NBT files with &lt;samp&gt;.snbt&lt;/samp&gt; extension in an input folder to GZip compressed NBT format files with &lt;samp&gt;.nbt&lt;/samp&gt; extension in an output folder, and vice versa.\nThe vanilla data generator can convert any GZip compressed NBT format to SNBT format. The file extension of a file can simply be changed, such as &lt;samp&gt;&lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/samp&gt; to &lt;samp&gt;level.nbt&lt;/samp&gt; and put in the input folder, and the generator then decodes the GZip compressed NBT data.\nHistory.\nThe NBT file format was described by &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; in a brief specification.\nThe original known version was 19132 as introduced in &lt;a href=\"Beta%201.3\"&gt;Beta 1.3&lt;/a&gt;, and since then has been updated to 19133 with the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20file%20format\"&gt;Anvil file format&lt;/a&gt;, which adds the tag. The NBT format dates all the way back to &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; with tags 0 to 10 in use."}

When spawned, an NPC displays a name hovering over its head. The default name is \"NPC\" with a &lt;a href=\"Formatting%20codes\"&gt;color code&lt;/a&gt; of codice_3, resulting in the name being yellow.\nTo spawn an NPC with its spawn egg, the player must have the Worldbuilder authorization, automatically granted to players in &lt;a href=\"Creative\"&gt;Creative&lt;/a&gt; mode, or by using the command.\nBehavior.\nNPCs have no AI. They can neither move nor be pushed by other entities. They also cannot take &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; nor be affected by &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s.

A saddled pig is renamed instead of being ridden. Using a name tag on any other mob that can be interacted with performs the action instead of being named. These mobs can be renamed if the player uses the name tag while crouching or standing in a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; because the portal suppresses the action.\nOnce a name tag is used on a mob, it is impossible to remove the name of that mob without the use of commands or external modifications.\nBehavior.\nRenamed mobs have their name displayed over their head in the same fashion as a mob named through a renamed &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;. Their names can be seen only if they are aimed at from four or fewer blocks away.\nMobs that are named using the name tag never despawn in the world, similar to tamed mobs. The exceptions are &lt;a href=\"wandering%20trader\"&gt;wandering trader&lt;/a&gt;s or if the mob is hostile and the difficulty is switched to \"&lt;a href=\"Peaceful\"&gt;Peaceful&lt;/a&gt;\", causing any hostile mobs or any named hostile mobs to despawn immediately. \nIf a renamed mob kills a player, the custom name is used in the death message in place of the mob type name. For instance, if a vindicator named \"Johnny\" kills a player, the death message is \"Player was slain by Johnny\". \nA renamed &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; also has a renamed health bar, and the boss bar doesn't regenerate."}

Nether fortresses are the only place where &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s spawn, the latter of which's &lt;a href=\"blaze%20rod\"&gt;blaze rod&lt;/a&gt;s being required to craft and fuel &lt;a href=\"brewing%20stand\"&gt;brewing stand&lt;/a&gt;s and craft &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Ender\"&gt;eyes of ender&lt;/a&gt; to access &lt;a href=\"the%20End\"&gt;the End&lt;/a&gt;. It also features &lt;a href=\"nether%20wart\"&gt;nether wart&lt;/a&gt; as loot, which is a key ingredient in &lt;a href=\"brewing\"&gt;brewing&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneration.\nNether fortresses generate in all Nether biomes. To do so, the game splits the Nether into regions in which one of either a fortress or a &lt;a href=\"bastion%20remnant\"&gt;bastion remnant&lt;/a&gt; can generate. The regions are 432\u00d7432 blocks and 480\u00d7480 blocks . \nEach region has a four chunk separation located on the south and east borders of the region in which neither a fortress nor a bastion can generate. \nThis leaves only a 368\u00d7368 block section or 416\u00d7416 block section where a structure can generate. \nTwo structures never generate in the same region, although they might overlap if they generate close to the separation border. , the chance of a fortress generating instead of a bastion is (40%), while the chance of a fortress generating instead of a bastion is (33.3%).\nNether fortresses can generate buried in &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;. In such a case, the interior is not filled with netherrack; all hallways and passages are clear except for open walkways and bridges. It is possible but rare for &lt;a href=\"glowstone\"&gt;glowstone&lt;/a&gt; or crimson and warped &lt;a href=\"huge%20fungi\"&gt;huge fungi&lt;/a&gt; to generate inside the fortress pathways.\nStructure.\nNether fortresses are large complexes composed of &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Bricks\"&gt;nether bricks&lt;/a&gt; that are supported by pillars that tower high above the &lt;a href=\"lava%20sea\"&gt;lava sea&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe fortress generation starts with a plain four-way crossing centered at chunk coordinates 11, ~, 11 of the designated &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fortress has two areas, an exterior area of open bridges and an interior area of enclosed corridors. Both the bridges and corridors can end in a unfinished passway structure or may simply end without elaboration. Fortresses can tunnel through &lt;a href=\"netherrack\"&gt;netherrack&lt;/a&gt;, giving the \"exterior\" areas an appearance of tunnels with nether brick floor and netherrack walls and ceilings. At broken sections the terrain is not cleared, which may create a tunnel that leads straight into a wall of netherrack.\nThe exterior consists of:\nThe interior of the structures have 1\u00d72 windows with &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;nether brick fence&lt;/a&gt;s as the windowpanes. The fences also form gate-like structures at the entrances of some rooms and corridors. Rooms include:\nBlocks.\nThe structure bounding box for the 4-way intersection is pictured above (top-down view), and consists of a 19 x 11 (height) x 19 volume centered on the floor block in the center of the intersection. This contrasts many of the other structure bounding boxes as their outlines tend to tightly follow the physical bounds of the structure.\nMobs.\nFortresses use a list of possible &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn that is separate from the rest of &lt;a href=\"the%20Nether\"&gt;the Nether&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of the biome the fortress generates in. This includes &lt;a href=\"zombified%20piglin\"&gt;zombified piglin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cube&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as two exclusive mobs not found anywhere else: &lt;a href=\"blaze\"&gt;blaze&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMobs spawn at a much higher rate if the fortress is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"soul%20sand%20valley\"&gt;soul sand valley&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warped%20forest\"&gt;warped forest&lt;/a&gt; biomes, as hostile mobs in these biomes (ghasts, skeletons, or endermen) spawn much less frequently, allowing most hostile mobs to spawn in the fortress.\nJava Edition.\nIn \"Java Edition\", the spawning algorithm has two checks:\nIf either check passes, it uses the special mob list for fortresses rather than the list for the biome when choosing the mob to spawn. The actual mob spawning proceeds as normal for the mob chosen from this list.\nBedrock Edition.\nIn \"Bedrock Edition\", instead of spawning anywhere within a structural bounding box, \"most\" mobs spawn only in \"structure spawn locations\" along varied-length lines spaced apart 4-11 blocks throughout the fortress. They are not set to a particular Y level other than \"inside the structure\" and are indeed columns several blocks high. They do not require any special type of block, any regular spawnable block will do. \nTo identify these spawning columns, glass panes can be placed all over the fortress, 1 block above surface blocks. This will keep the mobs stationary. (This technique works in Bedrock due to mobs spawning in the northwest corner of blocks.) Note that these spots may be on top of the raised side blocks, so these side blocks have to be removed before a glass pane grid can be placed. \n&lt;a href=\"Zombified%20Piglin\"&gt;Zombified Piglin&lt;/a&gt; spawns do not obey structure spawn locations; they can spawn anywhere in the fortress.\nLoot.\nFortresses generate nether fortress loot with chests in the indoor sections placed at some corridor turns."}

There were three separate formats used during these versions. In all formats, they were compressed with . The first format lasted from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20pre-Classic%20rd-132211\"&gt;rd-132211&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.12a%2003\"&gt;Classic 0.0.12a_03&lt;/a&gt; and only contained the blocks in the world. The second format lasted from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.13a\"&gt;Classic 0.0.13a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.13a%2003\"&gt;Classic 0.0.13a_03&lt;/a&gt; and contained a short header followed by the blocks. The third format lasted from &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.0.14a\"&gt;Classic 0.0.14a&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Classic%200.30\"&gt;Classic 0.30&lt;/a&gt; and contained a short header followed by serialized Java objects with lots of different data. Single-player levels had the extension \".dat\" or \".mine\". Levels used by the Classic servers were named \"server_level.dat\".\nThe Classic level format can be read by the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//github.com/bluecrab2/ClassicExplorer/releases/\"&gt;ClassicExplorer program&lt;/a&gt;. For the last format that used Java's Serializable interface, the easiest way to work with it was through the Classic server itself, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//minecraft.net/servers.jsp\"&gt;minecraft-server.jar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Development%20resources/Example%20Minecraft%20Classic%20Level%20Editing%20Class\"&gt;Sample code&lt;/a&gt; was provided to show how to build an editor on top of minecraft-server.jar.\nAccessing the array of bytes.\nThe most interesting part of a level was the block array. Each byte in this array defined a &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20data%20values/Classic\"&gt;block type&lt;/a&gt; at a corresponding location in the world. One generally had two options for accessing the byte array of blocks: \nThe &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; could deserialize the compressed .dat file directly back into an instance of a Level object inside of Java, thus having access to the instance of the Level object in exactly the same way the Minecraft Server does. This would allow the player to set the blocks, dimensions, spawn point and other aspects of the map directly by calling the methods on the instantiated Level object. Manual decompression is not needed before loading, because Java can compress and decompress gzipped files on the fly. To load the datafile back into an instance of the Level class, the player would need the class definition for the Level class. This was included with the &lt;samp&gt;minecraft-server.jar&lt;/samp&gt; file. An example of this could be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Development%20resources/Example%20Minecraft%20Classic%20Level%20Editing%20Class\"&gt;Development resources/Example Minecraft Classic Level Editing Class&lt;/a&gt;.\nOthers have read and modified the map's data by simply accessing the raw byte array in the datafile file. To do this, the player would decompress it, make changes to the bytes where the byte array is stored, and then compress it again. The 256x256x64 bytes (default dimensions) labeled blocks in each format were where the byte array was stored. The formula codice_1 will convert Minecraft coordinates to the byte number in the array."}

{"id": "118146", "revid": "53447031", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=118146", "title": "Java Edition Distance Effects", "text": "In , certain game mechanics start to break down as the player's distance from the center of the world increases.\nVanilla bounds (X/Y/Z \u00b10\u201329,999,984).\nOn the X/Z axis.\nTranslucent rendering breakdown.\nX/Z: 8,388,608.\nThe effects of this can first be seen after this point. The preferred method of testing this involves stacking two translucent blocks, such as two different colors of stained glass, in a square shape, and then walking up against this square to slow movement. When crossing from one block into another, the top face of the bottom block should not render at all until a certain distance is covered, at which point it should pop into view as expected.\nX/Z: 16,777,216.\nSaid effect's precision is now halved, allowing for the tops of two blocks at a time to appear periodically invisible.\nTemperature distribution precision loss.\nX/Z: 16,777,216.\nAs snow or rain fall is handled on a per-block basis, the effects of precision loss here can only be seen once when single-precision floating-point precision itself can no longer represent blocks (integers) individually. This can be fixed by changing the floats responsible for this to doubles, or even integers as these do not use any decimal points.\nBeyond this point, while not immediately obvious at first glance (especially due to the vertical variation in almost all biomes where this effect can be seen), the patterns resulting from snow landing on surfaces become much more angular than before, being commonly composed of large rectangles, thin lines and lone dots which are either filled with snow or have them completely absent. This is similarly true with water, with ice corresponding to cold blocks and water to warmer blocks.\nAs temperature varies with height, in order to properly see the effects of this, it is strongly recommended to build a flat plane for snow to accumulate on instead, or to generate a &lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; world with snow/ice set to generate with it as it would naturally. A modified Tunneler's Dream preset set to generate 94 layers of black concrete (Looking At Block should say 93 for the top concrete layer) is ideal for this case, providing a roughly 50/50 density of snowy and clear blocks, with black providing maximum contrast.\nTeleporting to 16,777,216 on both axes should show four quadrants - one with normal looking snow/ice generation, and three with far more angular features due to the precision loss exceeding a full block. During times of precipitation, it can be seen that the blocky patterns of snow/ice match up with the weather directly above - snowy areas have snowfall where areas with no snow cover have rain. This is obviously true anywhere and is unrelated to precision loss, but (especially in the case of already-generated worlds) this can be used to prove that the precision loss lies with temperature calculation and is not merely a world generation issue disjoint from it.\nSounds.\nX/Z: 16,777,216.\nSounds use single precision for placement instead of double precision, meaning that sounds can now be misplaced by a full block. This becomes more severe at every power of 2. This can be fixed by switching to double precision.\nBeyond the vanilla world boundary (X/Z \u00b129,999,984\u20132,147,483,647).\nHorizontal distances far beyond 29,999,984 cannot be reached within vanilla Minecraft. One chunk after this, there exists an invisible wall at exactly X/Z = \u00b130,000,000. Chunks will stop generating after 30,000,240 blocks. This is a manually added and intentional limit, meaning that it can be removed with very simple mods, allowing terrain to generate up to X/Z = \u00b12,147,483,647, even without other modifications.\nOn the X/Z axis.\nTranslucent rendering breakdown.\nX/Z: past \u00b133,554,432.\nThe effect's intensity will again double for every power of two crossed beyond this point. It also becomes very obvious in natural generation at extreme distances, specifically in cold areas; as ice and water are both translucent blocks and are intended to be visible through each other, viewing them when at such far distances from the origin will make very exaggerated versions of this effect obvious.\nFurther temperature distribution precision loss.\nAt X/Z = \u00b133,554,432, the precision is halved again, resulting in even more blocky snow and ice. This effect's precision is halved at every exponent of 2 from this point on.\nSound positioning errors.\nThe placement of sounds is halved at every exponent of 2 that is passed. It becomes very severe beyond 2 (268,435,456 blocks), where the precision can only represent multiples of 32. This can be fixed by switching to double precision.\nLighting engine breakdown.\nBevond X/Z \u00b133,554,432, lighting stops working and shuts down due to a lighting engine rewrite in 1.14. From 1.14 through 1.16, teleporting there shows the transition between light and dark. In 1.17 and above, the game crashes when the player tries to load a chunk in the dark side from the light side. Teleporting past it works fine and the game will not crash, even in 1.17 and above, but the player needs night vision to see the world normally. The reason for this is unknown, and more investigation on this is necessary, although the most likely guess is an integer overflow.[That remains to be tested]\nBeyond the 32-bit limit (X/Z \u00b12,147,483,647-9,223,372,036,854,775,807).\nThe dedicates 52 bits to the fraction, as opposed to the 23 bits used by the . As a result, beyond 2^30 or 1,073,741,824 blocks, the player would only be off by (2^30)/(2^52) = 1/2^22 = 1/4,194,304 blocks, which is absolutely indistinguishable from the distance back at spawn. This is around equivalent to the precision of 2 to 4 blocks out on Bedrock Edition.\nEach doubling, however, will indeed half the precision used, up to a point where every single element of the game ends up breaking down. With mods that replace 32-bit integers with 64-bit integers, it is possible to generate and render terrain up to 2^63 - 1 without crashing. These mods also include an optional Stripe Lands fix for easier exploration of extreme 64-bit distances.\n64-bit precision loss.\n\"Minecraft: Java Edition\" uses for entity positions and other calculations. Several mechanics which do not break down within vanilla bounds break down at very high distances similarly to Bedrock Edition, which in contrast, uses 32-bit floating point precision.\nOn the X/Z axis.\nMinor effects.\nAt 2^35 or 34,359,738,368 blocks, biome fill noise overflows on that coordinate leading the exposed stone taking place in many areas in older versions (that is under the assumption that they use 32-bit integers, as 2^31 \u00d7 16 = 2^35). In between the vertical stone slices, there are blocks which vary on which biome it is based on, such as dirt and sand, going all the way down to bedrock level. These are known as the biome fill Far Lands. Sandstone generation is rare at these distances, restricted to desert pyramids and villages. It is however possible to push the overflow farther using 64-bit integers. In newer versions, simplex noise is used for soil depth. When it overflows, it will make the soil always 3 blocks deep after a certain distance.\nAt X/Z = \u00b12^36 from spawn is where a spawn chunk glitch begins to occur as it would in Beta 1.7.3, by going on one horizontal axis while keeping the other close to or equal to zero. This spawn chunk glitch begins there as opposed to 524,288 blocks, or 32,768 chunks from spawn in Beta 1.7.3, as it used 32-bit integers, with 15 bits being dedicated for each axis, but it's unknown what the other two bits are dedicated for. It is even possible to interact and modify the blocks of this chunk, and it would affect the actual spawn chunk. This chunk glitch would occur at every multiple of 2^36 (2^32 chunks) from this point onwards, as it currently uses 64-bit integers, with 32 bits for each axis. When this overflows, the game is confused on what chunks to load, and it will load the spawn chunks, as these are always loaded. This is caused by the chunk coordinates stored in memory being a 64-bit integer for the entire coordinates rather than for each axis. Other chunks are only loaded when the player is near them, so the overflowing is unnoticeable outside of this spawn chunk glitch.\nAt X/Z = \u00b12^37, or 137,438,953,472 blocks from the center, the slowest method of travel becomes impossible, sneaking on &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Cobweb\"&gt;cobwebs&lt;/a&gt; while touching &lt;a href=\"powder%20snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt; and under the effect of &lt;a href=\"slowness\"&gt;slowness&lt;/a&gt; VI (achievable with a potion of the Turtle Master II) while using an item. It is also impossible to walk into an object at a 0.0025-degree angle. Lower angles do not yield similar results at lower coordinates. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 32,768 (multiples of 1/32,768) blocks. This is the equivalent precision loss at 256 blocks of distance in Bedrock Edition.\nAt 2^38, or 274,877,906,944 blocks, sneaking on &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Cobweb\"&gt;cobwebs&lt;/a&gt; and under the effect of &lt;a href=\"slowness\"&gt;slowness&lt;/a&gt; VI while using an item becomes impossible. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 16,384 (multiples of 1/16384) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 512 blocks of distance in Bedrock Edition.\nAt 2^39, or 549,755,813,888 blocks, sneaking on &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Cobweb\"&gt;cobwebs&lt;/a&gt; and under the effect of &lt;a href=\"slowness\"&gt;slowness&lt;/a&gt; V while using an item becomes impossible. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 8192 (multiples of 1/8192) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 1,024 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nAt 2^41, or 2,199,023,255,552 blocks, sneaking on &lt;a href=\"blue%20ice\"&gt;blue ice&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Cobweb\"&gt;cobwebs&lt;/a&gt; while using an item becomes impossible. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 2048 (multiples of 1/2048) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 4,096 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nAt 2^43, or 8,796,093,022,208 blocks, it becomes impossible to move in cobwebs on blue ice while using an item. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 512 (multiples of 1/512) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 16,384 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nAt 2^44, or 17,592,186,044,416 blocks, it becomes impossible to sneak diagonally on top of soul sand with cobwebs while drawing back a bow. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 256 (multiples of 1/256) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 32,768 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nAt 2^45, or 35,184,372,088,832 blocks, it becomes impossible to sneak diagonally on top of soul sand with cobwebs. Sneaking vertically and out starts to become jittery. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 128 (multiples of 1/128) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 65,536 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nModerate effects.\nEventually, some common forms of movement begin to glitch. In addition, blocks with detailed models begin to render incorrectly.\nAt 2^48, or 281,474,976,710,656 blocks, jitter is noticeable. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 16 (multiples of 1/16) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 524,288 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition. In modern versions, the skybox starts flashing first at this point, firstly appearing to change color very slightly, but this is barely noticeable at this point, but gets more severe every power of two, but this effect does not happen in 1.13 and earlier. Such effects have been recorded on the Y axis, long before 64-bit mods for new versions were available.\nMajor effects.\nAt 2^49, or 562,949,953,421,312 blocks out, fences and cacti begin to render incorrectly, their models and textures being distorted or stretched to a full block. Coordinates of all entities are multiples of 1/8.\nAt 2^50, or 1,125,899,906,842,624 blocks, moving while &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; becomes nearly impossible. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 4 (multiples of 1/4) blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 2,097,152 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nIt becomes increasingly more difficult to traverse the world on foot from X/Z = \u00b12^51 (or 2,251,799,813,685,248) blocks from the center onwards. In order to continue navigating around the world, Players need to use &lt;a href=\"Ender%20pearl\"&gt;ender pearls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Firework\"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trident\"&gt;trident&lt;/a&gt; (if raining or underwater), horseback, &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;boats&lt;/a&gt;, or any method that would be at least five blocks per second normally, meaning moving in normal walking speed is impossible. One can travel on foot past 2,251,799,813,685,248 by jumping one time and sprinting. One cannot jump normally either. The &lt;a href=\"Jump%20Boost\"&gt;Jump Boost&lt;/a&gt; effect does not work. &lt;a href=\"Stairs\"&gt;Stairs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slab\"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt; or blocks less than half a block tall are not working past this point. Entities less than half a block wide (such as &lt;a href=\"Item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"silverfish\"&gt;silverfish&lt;/a&gt;) will inevitably fall through the edges of blocks, but can still stand on the center of said blocks. This happens as a result of hitboxes of entities smaller than a valid position (unit of the last place on the double) getting their hitbox rounded to a width of zero, making them fall through the world. Status effect particles snap to the center of the player, causing them to bunch around the center of the screen. The coordinates of all entities are slices of 2, half-multiples of blocks, the equivalent precision loss at 4,194,304 blocks of distance from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nAt 2^52, or 4,503,599,627,370,496 blocks, coordinates of all entities are integers (1 block), meaning that all entities are on the edges of blocks. As a result, most entities less than one full block wide, including &lt;a href=\"players\"&gt;players&lt;/a&gt;, always fall through blocks. The only entities that can stand on blocks from this point onward are &lt;a href=\"Boat\"&gt;boats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minecart\"&gt;minecarts&lt;/a&gt; on rails (when placed correctly), &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bears&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ravager\"&gt;ravagers&lt;/a&gt;. Despite appearing to be more than one block wide, wardens will also fall through blocks due to their hitbox being less than a block wide. The player falls through blocks if the player rides any entity other than the ones described above, uses an ender pearl, or teleports beyond this coordinate. If only one coordinate exceeds this value, blocks will still have collision detection from the side. The player can still be considered \"under\" blocks, preventing &lt;a href=\"Phantom\"&gt;phantoms&lt;/a&gt; from spawning. Thus, it is theoretically possible to travel to and from the Stripe Lands in survival using above-average in speed &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;. The minimum movement speed is increased to ten blocks per second, meaning that sprinting, boats (except in frozen oceans), horses (except for the faster ones mentioned above), and swimming are no longer usable sources of movement. To fly in Creative mode, the player must sprint or look directly along an axis. In addition, flying at this coordinate is bumpy, even when the player is sprinting and looking directly along an axis. Most blocks that normally render as partial blocks are either stretched to become full blocks, or squished to become 2-dimensional, such as flowers and fences. The exception is a few blocks that render normally no matter how far out the player travels, such as &lt;a href=\"Chest\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bell\"&gt;bells&lt;/a&gt;, as they are treated as entities. If both coordinates exceed this value, partial blocks that normally render as 2D this far out become 1-dimensional and are therefore completely invisible (although it may be possible for a torch's flame to remain visible). Riding &lt;a href=\"Minecart\"&gt;minecarts&lt;/a&gt; on active &lt;a href=\"Powered%20rail\"&gt;powered rails&lt;/a&gt; becomes impossible. This is the same precision loss distance as it would be 8,388,608 blocks from spawn in Bedrock Edition.\nGame-breaking effects.\nAt 2^53, or 9,007,199,254,740,992 blocks, the floating point precision errors cause only blocks with even coordinates not divisible by 4 to render, and are stretched to 2 blocks wide. Blocks at other coordinates are rounded to the nearest multiple of 4 and render 2-dimensional. Blocks render only if they are \"exposed\" to air or another see-through block (such as &lt;a href=\"Glass\"&gt;glass blocks&lt;/a&gt;). This phenomenon is known as the Stripe Lands. In contrast, they start at X/Z \u00b116,777,216 in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt;, as the block rendering coordinates use 32-bit floats instead. In the Corner Stripe Lands, blocks with both coordinates 2 mod 4 render double length and double width, blocks with 1 such coordinate render 2D and double length, and blocks with no such coordinate render as one-dimensional (thus, the block is completely invisible unless the player is inside it). Coordinates of all entities are multiples of 2. This does not impact the way maps are rendered in any way. 2D blocks are non-solid, even from the sides. However, &lt;a href=\"Ghast\"&gt;ghasts&lt;/a&gt;, large &lt;a href=\"Slime\"&gt;slimes&lt;/a&gt;, and large &lt;a href=\"Magma%20cube\"&gt;magma cubes&lt;/a&gt; treat both 2D and 3D blocks as solid because they are more than 2 blocks wide. The minimum speed is increased to 20 blocks per second, meaning that slow Creative mode flight and &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt; are no longer possible to move with, leaving only flight by an elytra (either with &lt;a href=\"Firework%20rocket\"&gt;firework rockets&lt;/a&gt; or a Riptide trident) and teleportation by any means (such as by chorus fruit or commands). Because the majority of blocks do not render in the stripe lands, this is noticeable only when viewed on a map. Fast Creative mode flight only works if the player looks directly along an axis. Building can only happen in \"valid\" double positions, even with an optional Stripe Lands fix. The aformentioned skybox flashing gets to a point where it starts to change color every time the camera moves, flashing it weird blue and purple colors, although this flashing only occurs in 1.14 and onwards.\nAt 2^54, or 18,014,398,509,481,984 blocks, horizontal block rendering stops completely in older versions, leaving only vertical block rendering in its place, marking the start of the Slice Lands.[unofficial name] Blocks whose sides are not \"exposed\", such as naturally-generated water, are completely invisible, unless an optional Stripe Lands fix is applied. At this point, the slices are 4 blocks apart, but the gap widths double for every power of 2. Coordinates of all entities are multiples of 4. It is difficult to place blocks from this point onward. The player must look at an existing block and extend it along an axis. The only way to generate blocks (to place on) without external tools is to use &lt;a href=\"Structure%20block\"&gt;structure blocks&lt;/a&gt;, even with a Stripe Lands fix. Block rendering essentially stops completely in the Corner Slice Lands; almost all blocks are rendered as one-dimensional, and are therefore impossible to see. Only certain &lt;a href=\"block%20entities\"&gt;block entities&lt;/a&gt; and any normally visible &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; side textures render in this area, which means that due to the End having no liquids, this region is almost completely empty. Blocks in the Corner Slice Lands are only visible with the Stripe Lands fix being turned on. The minimum movement speed is now 40 blocks per second. As a result, &lt;a href=\"ender%20pearls\"&gt;ender pearls&lt;/a&gt; are useless at that distance, and teleportation is now only possible by chorus fruit, or by commands. Elytras either require a steep angle or a Riptide trident in rain to propel the player. &lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;Tridents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; shot from &lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Crossbow\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragons&lt;/a&gt; are the only other entities that can move horizontally beyond this point, other than the player, as ghasts can no longer move horizontally (but they do remain airborne), while large slimes and magma cubes that are four blocks large will fall into the void. In modern versions (at least from 1.12 if not earlier), the Slice Lands don't exist. Instead, the gaps at the Stripe Lands gets wider at every exponent of 2. In the Nether, even this far out, ghasts may still spawn.\nAt 2^55, or 36,028,797,018,963,968 blocks, the minimum movement speed is increased to 80 blocks per second, meaning that thrown &lt;a href=\"Trident\"&gt;tridents&lt;/a&gt; cannot move horizontally and the use of an &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; requires a &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; trident. It becomes impossible to look horizontally in third person view. Coordinates of all entities are multiples of 8. Ender dragons cannot move horizontally anymore either.\nThe Far Lands start at about 53.9 quadrillion blocks out in Beta 1.8 to 1.14, but due to the modulo patch, they don't exactly start at 9,223,372,036,854,775,807/171.103. Instead, they generate a bit after, about few million blocks. In Beta 1.8 to relase 1.7, they start at exactly 59,505,378,859,423,448 blocks. In 1.7 to 1.14, they start at 53,905,379,846,882,792 blocks, due to a very slight change in the coordinate scale, which is unnoticably small for the 32-bit versions, regardless of the world seed, and if the player kept on going on one axis while keeping the other at or close to zero, for every multiple of 2^36 inside the Far Lands, the spawn chunk glitch described above will occur inside the Far Lands. If the Stripe Lands fix is off, then the Far Lands, combined with the Slice Lands, result in trippy visuals, unofficially dubbed the \"Slice Far Lands\", as if the terrain was drawn on a canvas. In the negative directions, the Far Lands will start at exactly 2^63/171.103 or 53,905,378,846,979,747 blocks. The modulo patch works by taking the noise coordinate, stored as a double, converting it to a 64-bit integer, and taking its modulo 16,777,216. When the 64-bit integer overflows, the modulo breaks, and the noise coordinate will accumulate and reach 2^31, like it did in the older versions, where the double noise cooordinate was just converted to a 32-bit integer. The negative axes will start from 2^32, so the Far Lands will generate immediately after the 64-bit overflow.\nAt 2^56, or 72,057,594,037,927,936 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 16, equivalent to one chunk section. The visual gaps are 16 blocks wide. All entities are on the edges of chunks, although it is not noticeable at all, as almost all entities fall through the world before this could be noticed. The minimum movement speed is increased to 160 blocks per second, meaning that &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; cannot move horizontally and &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; starts to become less usable at low levels. Teleportation using &lt;a href=\"chorus%20fruit\"&gt;chorus fruit&lt;/a&gt; becomes impossible. More specifically, &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; I works only if the player looks directly along an axis and does it many times. \nAt 2^57, or 144,115,188,075,855,872 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 32, equivalent to two chunks section. The visual gaps are 32 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 320 blocks per second, meaning that levels of &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; below level II no longer work, and Riptide II barely works. More specifically, &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; II works only if the player looks directly along an axis and does it many times. Much like in Beta after 268,435,456 blocks out, frustum culling loses precision, causing terrain flickering to occur, As the game sometimes thinks you are facing somewhere you are not, and renders chunks accordingly. This is also a floating-point precision loss bug, and it happened a lot closer in Beta, as it used single precision for world rendering. It could only be noticed when the unit of the last place on the double exceeds a full chunk.\nAt about this distance, the Far Lands will start to repeat segments of the broken terrain that is generating. The reason for this is the selector noise generator, essential for terrain position, losing precision for each power of two; however, this remains to be confirmed. On both axes, the patterns repeat in a grid-like pattern.\nFurthermore, at around 184 quadrillion blocks from spawn, depth noise will overflow, but the effects are invisible within the Far Lands, As it dwarfs the incredibly large fraction value in the Far Lands.\nAt 2^58, or 288,230,376,151,711,744 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 64, equivalent to four chunks section. The visual gaps are 64 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 640 blocks per second, meaning that no method of vanilla movement works, even &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; III, leaving teleportation by commands as the only viable option remaining.\nAt 2^59, or 576,460,752,303,423,488 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 128, equivalent to eight chunks section. The visual gaps are 128 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 1,280 blocks per second, meaning that &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; levels below IX no longer work. The world is completely invisible with a render distance of 7 chunks or less without an optional Stripe Lands Fix. The phenomenon is called the Invisible Stripe Lands. With the Stripe Lands fix, the most severe terrain flickering in Beta can be seen here, as this is the equivalent precision loss effect of 1,073,741,824 blocks from spawn in single precision.\nAt 2^60, or 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 256, equivalent to 16 chunks section. The visual gaps are 256 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 2,560 blocks per second, meaning that &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; levels below XVIII no longer work. Any variation in the Far Lands has been almost entirely replaced by repeating patterns at this point.\nAt 2^61, or 2,305,843,009,213,693,952 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 512, equivalent to 32 chunks section. The visual gaps are 512 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 5,120 blocks per second.\nThe selector noise generator overflows at 4,312,430,291,606,100,245 blocks, causing the Farther Lands to appear. This makes every single repeating pattern in the Far Lands vanish, leaving no variation in the strips that generate. In the Corner Far Lands, this makes the terrain to appear completely flat. These have been named the Farthest Lands, and are a 64-bit version of the normal Far Lands.\nAt 2^62, or 4,611,686,018,427,387,904 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 1,024, equivalent to 64 chunks section. The visual gaps are 1,024 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 10,240 blocks per second.\nAt 2^63, or 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 blocks, terrain will stop generating, and the game will crash when trying to load any chunks beyond this point, unless a BigInteger mod is used, as this is the maximum 64-bit integer value. Coordinates of all entities are multiples of 2,048, equivalent to 128 chunks section. The visual gaps are 2,048 blocks wide, and the minimum movement speed is increased to 20,480 blocks per second.\nthe Y axis:\nStripe Lands.\nAs 52 bits are dedicated to the fraction in the double format rather than 23 in the single format, after 2^53 or 9,007,199,254,740,992 blocks out, precision breaks to consider only every second block, and so on. The rendering breaks down in an effectively identical manner to Bedrock Edition and yields the famous Stripe Lands as a result.\nFluids break down differently from blocks; while block rendering breaks down to form the usual stripes, fluids will instead stretch to the size of the precision loss, with the start of the Stripe Lands causing each liquid to become two blocks long, then four at the next doubling, and so on. In 1.14 or newer versions, the game freezes when rendering the Stripe Lands, so the Stripe Lands fix is nescassery to render terrain further out.\nBeyond the 64-bit Limit (X/Z \u00b19,223,372,036,854,775,808-2^1024).\nBeyond the 64-bit integer limit, the precision loss becomes greater by every passing exponent of two. It is possible to get terrain to generate and render at this distance, with the use of BigInteger mods. These mods also replace floating-point values with BigDecimals, which fix most distance effects, and terrain no longer flickers at extreme distances. These data types use an array of smaller numbers, as the number of bits in the computers are the maximum amount of memory addresses, and not the maximum size of a calculable value. Therefore, it is possible to calculate with 128, or even 256-bit integers, even on 32, or 16-bit systems. BigIntegers and BigDecimals do not overflow, and can go until the game's memory is filled completely with these numbers. This mod is available for 1.3.2, 1.12, and 1.20.1. These also include an optional, or an always turned-on Stripe Lands FIx. The BigInt mods for 1.12.2 and 1.20.1 also fixes hitboxes, so the player and other entities do not fall through the world, making the game completely playable at these distances, even beyond 2^1024, the maximum 64-bit floating point number. As a result, this completely patches the game to the point that the Stripe Lands are removed entirely. The 1.20.1 mod also fixes the skybox flashing as well as the lighting breakdown.\nOn the X/Z axis \nAt 264, or 18,\u200b446,\u200b744,\u200b073,\u200b709,\u200b551,\u200b616 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 4,096, equivalent to 256 chunks section. The visual gaps are 4,096 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 40,960 blocks per second. \nAt 265, or 36,893,488,147,419,103,232 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 8,192, equivalent to 512 chunks section. The visual gaps are 8,192 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 81,920 blocks per second. \nAt 267, or around 147 quintillion blocks from spawn, the biome fill noise generator, assuming it use 64-bit integers, overflows, resulting in the biome fill noise Far Lands in older versions. \nAt 269, or 590,295,810,358,705,651,712 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 131,072, equivalent to 8,192 chunks section. The visual gaps are 131,072 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 1,310,720 blocks per second. \nAt 270, or 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 262,144, equivalent to 16,384 chunks section. The visual gaps are 262,144 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 2,621,440 blocks per second. \nAt 277, or 151,115,727,451,828,646,838,272 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 33,554,432, equivalent to 2,097,152 chunks section. The visual gaps are 33,554,432 blocks wide. The minimum movement speed is increased to 335,544,320 blocks per second. At this point, it would take going faster than the speed of light to move, which is 299,792,458 blocks per second. To put it into perspective, the observable universe is 93 billion light years in diameter, or approximately 8.79 \u00d7 1026 meters, or blocks. It would take light 10.5 million years to reach that distance in Minecraft. As a comparison, the Andromeda Galaxy is 2.537 million light-years from Earth, and Messier 82, the Cigar Galaxy, 11.42 million light-years from Earth. \nAt 280, or 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 2,147,483,648, equivalent to 134,217,728 chunks section. The visual gaps are 2,147,483,648 blocks wide. \nAt 1,808,764,368,955,220,466,364,838 blocks, the Far Lands would appear in modern versions of the game, starting from 1.14, at exactly 2^25, or 33,554,432 times the distance of the normal 64-bit Far Lands. This is due to a change in the Far Lands patch, which now takes the double Noise Cooordinate, converts it to a 64-bit integer, and them divides it by 33,554,432. \nAt about 9 \u00d7 282, or 43,521,329,506,126,650,289,422,336 blocks on both axes, the Corner Farther Lands begin to thin out into pillars due to floating-point overflows in the quintic in the terrain generation algorithms. As the quintics are multiplied together on both axes, the degradation would happen much faster than on one axis. Some even dubbed this part of the degradation as the Pillar Lands [unofficial name]. \nAt around 6.75 \u00d7 283 or 65,281,994,259,189,975,434,133,503 blocks on both axes, the terrain will thin out to a skygrid, and at about 10/3 \u00d7 287 or 515,808,349,702,241,781,207,968,426 blocks on both axes, it will disappear completely. The Edge Far Lands and its further variations will generate normally well beyond this point. \nAt 2^84, or 19,342,813,113,834,066,795,298,816 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 34,259,738,368, equivalent to 2,147,483,648 chunks section. The visual gaps are 34,259,738,368 blocks wide. \nAt 2^89, or 618,970,019,642,690,137,449,562,112 blocks, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 1,099,511,627,776, equivalent to 68,719,476,736 chunks, or 2,147,483,648 regions section. The visual gaps are 1,099,511,627,776 blocks wide. \nThe precision will be halved every time the player passes an exponent of 2. \nThe Edge Far Lands will start to deteriorate at over 8.175 quindecillion blocks out on the X axis, giving way to the Fringe Lands. The first stage of the decay appears at 8.175100408620 x 10^48 blocks. The second stage is at 8.576 x 10^48 The third stage would begin at 9.162999 \u00d7 1048 blocks, and the fourth stage at about 1.0299981089 \u00d7 1049 blocks. The true hard limit of terrain generation is unknown, although it is predicted to be around 2.51 \u00d7 1051 blocks, but due to additional octaves of low and high noise, as well as selector noise starting to have their own Fringe Lands, the limit is likely much closer. In newer versions, the stages of the degradation would happen at those exact same numbers, but the terrain would thin out without the comb-like artifacts. When the terrain is completely gone, only water with a bedrock floor will appear. This ocean won't degrade, as it comes from an instruction in the game filling every air block below Y=63 with water (the uppermost layer of water is replaced with ice if it is located in a cold biome). This does not use a noise generator, meaning this would never overflow. On the Z axis, the degrading is much more gradual. It starts at 9.17 \u00d7 1048, and the terrain slowly fades out into a skygrid, which will thin out relly slowly. The hard limit here is predicted to be more than 10^100, a googol blocks, or ten duotrigintillion blocks, but extra octaves and noise generators make the end much closer than predicted, but the sheer size of this already makes a Minecraft world, under these instructions, 76 orders of base-10 magnitudes larger than the observable universe, which is a measly 93 billion light-years across in diameter! \n2^1024 is the maximum value for a 64-bit floating-point value in Java. Beyond this point, the player's coordinates would roll over to read \"infinity,\" as the 64-bit float has run out of bits to represent coordinate data, possible to achieve with Cheat Engine in Beta. There is also the likelihood that the game would crash, but it is not confirmed, and it may or may not happen at random. It's impossible to go further than this point without BigDecimals, as a value of \"infinity\" breaks rendering code in Java Edition. BigInts and BigDecimals can go and generate terrain much further out, as they don't overflow until they fill the game's memory. \nOn the Y axis \nSkygrid.\nThe skygrid is a distance effect that occurs in the Corner Fringe Lands. This effect occurred on Bedrock Edition until the Far Lands were pushed beyond the 32-bit integer limit in &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20beta%201.17.20.20\"&gt;Bedrock Edition beta 1.17.20.20&lt;/a&gt;, as a vanilla parity fix.\nDue to precision loss becoming more extreme at greater distances, features affected at it will behave different depending on how far out they are.\nRain and snow rendering.\n\"First affected bracket:\"\n\"First affected version: Unspecified Classic\"\n\"Last affected version: Indev 2010-02-14 2\"\n\"Second affected bracket:\"\n\"First affected version: Alpha v1.0.4\"\n\"Last affected version: Alpha v1.1.2_01\"\n\"Third affected bracket:\"\n\"First affected version: Beta 1.6.5\"\n\"Still affects the current release (1.19) and snapshot (1.19.1-rc1)\"\n\"Suspected to affect as far back as Beta 1.5, but cannot be reasonably tested due to frequent crashes\" \nBeyond this point on the Y axis, one can start to see the first signs of snow and rain jittering, up to 65,535 blocks. This can only be reasonably seen with snowflakes with a mainly horizontal trajectory, as vertical travelling snowflakes are moving at a speed where travel still appears mostly smooth. Beyond 65,536 and especially 131,072 blocks, the effect becomes very obvious for almost all snow.\nAbove 262,144 blocks, the first signs of geometrical distortion in the snow itself can be seen - very little non-misshapen snow is present beyond here, and most of it has transformed into either lone rectangles, or the odd paired rectangles similar in shape to a pause button.\nDeformations progress after every power of two surpassed from this point. Past 16,777,216 blocks, snow becomes a nearly unrecognizable pattern of suspended vertical lines.\nBeyond this point snow will just stop rendering, even when you go to -10 blocks lower then the 32-bit integer limit the snow acts like the 32-bit integer limit bug, but the sky remains fine, as it is completely unrelated. But, when going below the 32-bit integer limit, rain appears. It is unknown as to why this happens.\nBack when snow was added, when it is snowing, if you are at the coordinates of Y=114,688, there is a lighting bug with the snow. This is because the lighting system is based on a combination of block light and sky light. Block light is emitted by certain light sources or generated by other blocks (such as glowstone blocks, sea lanterns, shroomlights and froglights), while sky light is determined by the time of day and the presence of sky visibility.\nAt extreme coordinate values or distances far from the world center, the rendering engine may encounter limitations in its ability to calculate and propagate lighting correctly. It is possible that the lighting calculations have become inaccurate and/or inconsistent, leading to graphical glitches or anomalies like at Y=114,688 with snow rendering and even when the level.dat tries to process it the \nTranslucent rendering breakdown.\n\"First affected version: 13w41a\"\n\"Still affects the current release (1.19) and snapshot (1.19.1-rc1)\"\nThe effects of this can first be seen after this point. The preferred method of testing this involves stacking two translucent blocks, such as two different colors of stained glass, in a square shape, and then walking up against this square to slow movement. When crossing from one block into another, the top face of the bottom block should not render at all until a certain distance is covered, at which point it should pop into view as expected.\nThe buggy effect's precision is now halved, allowing for the tops of two blocks at a time to appear periodically invisible.\nThe effect's intensity will again double for every power of two crossed beyond this point. It also becomes very obvious in natural generation at extreme distances, specifically in cold areas; as ice and water are both translucent blocks and are intended to be visible through each other, viewing them when at such far distances from the origin will make very exaggerated versions of this effect obvious.\nTemperature distribution breakdown.\n\"First affected version: 16w02a\"\n\"Still affects 1.19 and snapshot 1.19.1-rc1\"\nAs snowfall and rainfall are handled on a per-block basis, the effects of precision loss here can only be seen once precision itself can no longer represent blocks (integers) individually.\nBeyond this point, while perhaps not immediately obvious (especially due to the vertical variation in almost all biomes where this effect can be seen), the patterns resulting from snow landing on surfaces become much more angular than before, being commonly composed of large rectangles, thin lines and lone dots which are either filled with snow or have it completely absent. This is similarly true of water, with ice corresponding to cold blocks and water to warmer blocks.\nAs temperature varies with height, in order to properly see the effects of this, it is strongly recommended to build a flat plane for snow to accumulate on instead, or to generate a &lt;a href=\"Superflat\"&gt;Superflat&lt;/a&gt; world with snow/ice set to generate with it as it would naturally. A modified Tunneler's Dream preset set to generate 94 layers of black concrete (Looking At Block should say 93 for the top concrete layer) is ideal for this case, providing a roughly 50/50 density of snowy and clear blocks, with black providing maximum contrast.\nTeleporting to 16,777,216 on both axes should show four quadrants - one with normal looking snow and ice generation, and three with far more angular features due to the precision loss exceeding a full block. During times of precipitation, it can be seen that the blocky patterns of snow and ice match up with the weather directly above - snowy areas have snowfall where areas with no snow cover have rain. This is obviously true anywhere and is unrelated to precision loss, but, especially in the case of already-generated worlds, this can be used to prove that the precision loss lies with temperature calculation and is therefore not a mere world generation issue disjoint from\nHistorical effects.\nDue to the incredibly large amount of documentation on effects in older versions of the game, all such content has been relocated to &lt;a href=\"/Historical%20effects\"&gt;/Historical effects&lt;/a&gt;."}

In the diagrams below, normal terrain where nothing is overflowing is marked in gray, one overflow in light blue, two overflows in magenta and three overflows in lime. This can be extended to an arbitrary whole number of dimensions, although there are currently no modifications that allow for 4D or above terrain generation.\nFacial / \"Edge\" / \"The Loop\".\nThe most commonly depicted form, this is the result of an overflow on only one axis. On a 2D plane, there are four different overflows possible, corresponding to the four edges of a rectangle. In 3D space, there are six different overflows possible, corresponding to the faces of a cuboid.\nEdge / \"Corner\" / \"The Stack\".\nThese are the result of an overflow on two axes. On a 2D plane, four cases of this are possible, corresponding to the vertices of a rectangle. In 3D space, there are twelve such possible intersections, corresponding to the edges of a cuboid.\nVertex / \"The Abyss\".\nA rarely encountered type, this can only be encountered with three axes overflowing at once, which is effectively impossible in any version without mods. There are eight possible regions for this case, corresponding to the vertices of a cuboid.\nNoise generator overflows.\n\"Java Edition\" employs a variety of different &lt;a href=\"noise%20generator\"&gt;noise generator&lt;/a&gt;s for shaping several aspects of terrain. These noise generators experiencing an integer overflow is what results in a set of \"Far Lands\".\nLow noise and high noise overflows.\n\"Low noise\" and \"high noise\" are two extremely similar noise generators used for generating the fundamental shape of terrain itself. As a result, if either of these overflows, the fundamental shape of terrain sees drastic changes. The simultaneous overflowing of these is what results in the conventional Far Lands generating.\nWhether low noise or high noise is used for generating terrain at a given position is determined by a third noise generator, referred to as selector noise.\nSelector noise overflows.\nSelector noise is a noise generator used to determine whether low noise or high noise is used to generate terrain at a given point. Once overflowed, where low and high noise are used becomes quite visually obvious, due to its now abrupt changes.\nBiome fill noise overflows.\nThe depth of the surface block corresponding to each biome is determined by a noise generator known as biome fill noise. Biome fill noise increments by 0.0625 units each block, or 1 unit every chunk, and thus will overflow at or around X/Z \u00b134,359,738,368. Overflowing is not visible without either extensive modding or manipulating the noise scale, as the overflow occurs well beyond the block render limit (\u00b12,147,483,647) and coincides almost exactly with the chunk overwrite limit."}

The Y Far Lands (aka the Sky Far Lands) were overlooked, but were fixed in Java 1.13.\nTechnical.\nThe Far Lands (Java Edition) were a terrain generation bug that occurred at \u00b112,550,824 along the X and Z-axes prior to Beta 1.8, as well as the Y-axis (technically) before Java 1.13.\nThe Far Lands generate because of an integer overflow error within Minecraft. The &lt;a href=\"noise%20generator\"&gt;noise generator&lt;/a&gt; that draws Minecraft's height map increases by 171.103 for every block, causing an integer overflow at approximately \u00b112550824 (sometimes \u00b112550821.) Multiplying the aforementioned numbers results in the 32-bit signed integer max value, which when overflowed, results in an extreme noise seed.\nLocation.\nOn the X and Z axis, the Far Lands and Farther Lands initiate as they did in Beta 1.7 and below (\u00b112550824), with an identical chance of offset at positive positions. However, due to the new height limits and new world generation, they are actually 256 blocks tall, instead of 128. And the Far Lands look more rounded. There is a world border at the 32-bit integer limit (2,147,483,647), which crashes the game upon approaching.\nAny attempt to quit the game near the 32-bit integer limit also results in crashing. \nOn the Y-axis, the Far Lands initiate at around twice the former number, which is therefore \u00b125,101,648.\nThe Farther Lands also generate at \u00b12,008,131,840 on the Y-axis, however, they cannot be generated without lowering the selector noise period.\nStructure.\nThe edge Far Lands and corner Far Lands, as well as their Farther variations, generate relatively identically to their pre-Beta 1.8 counterparts, but utilizing the entire height limit, causing them to generate all the way up to y=256 until they reach the sky Far Lands at y=+25,101,648 (and equivalently the void Far Lands at y=-25,101,648). Since the 20w06a snapshot and until 1.18.2, however, The Far Lands are thinner and more geometrical, with a cross-section made of perpendicular lines and rectangles.\nAs of 1.19, they appear as a giant wall of stone with caves in them.\nThe Fartherer and Farthest Lands exist in vanilla worlds but are impossible to access without using manipulated customized world presets that set noise periods ridiculously low (coordinate scale extremely high).\nFar Lands.\nSky Far Lands.\nThe Far Lands generate at positive values of the Y-axis past y=25,101,648. &lt;a href=\"Monolith\"&gt;Monolith&lt;/a&gt;s generate up to this point if the player can get them to generate.\nVertex Far Lands.\nWhen the Sky or Void Far Lands meet with the vanilla Corner Far Lands, many interesting terrain features can be sighted. The content of these intersections appears to vary throughout worlds, with some being completely blank, some completely solid, and some generating like regular Far Lands material. In some cases, exciting diagonal patterns with large absent chunks generate.\nDepth noise far lands.\nLike low/high and selector noise which respectively control the Far/Fartherer and Farther/Farthest Lands, depth noise can be made to overflow at a given position. By default, it overflows at 42,949,672.96 blocks. Due to the Far Lands initiating before it, the overflow in depth noise is effectively impossible to see. However, if depth noise is made to overflow before tradition far lands, achievable by pushing the far lands farther out than this distance or moving the depth noise far lands closer, the effects can be seen immediately as it overflows, the terrain will jump up a few blocks. Terrain after this point is slightly more boring than before due to depth noise controlling subtle variation, which no longer exists after the overflow due to it almost always being at the max possible value. Every so often, very long \"rifts\" characteristic of depth noise far lands can be seen, which extend for extremely long. These rifts end once they hit the point twice the distance of the first overflow, and rifts as a whole past this point do not seem to be able to come into existence. Rifts have also only been noted on the positive X axis and are yet to be found on the Z axis.\nThe Fartherer Lands.\nLike the Farther Lands, at about \u00b14,294,967,296 times further from the initiation first set, the third set of Far Lands (furtherer from Far Lands, henceforth named \"Fartherer Lands\", alternatively \"Furtherer Lands\") generates once X/Z coordinates reach \u00b153,905,378,846,979,747 blocks away. They are the 64-bit variation of the Far Lands. Fartherer Lands generates well past the chunk overwrite limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b134,359,738,368) and the block rendering limit (X/Z: &gt;\u00b12,147,483,647), thus it is impossible to see Fartherer Lands in game without modifying the noise scale. The Fartherer Lands do not generate in \nThe Fartherer Lands, without occlusion from any previous sets of Far Lands, generates a terrain that are stretched out to the extent that they are thinner and flatter than the Farther Lands, similar to transitioning Far Lands in Bedrock Edition. Due to how Fartherer Lands generates their terrain, the lands are reduced into flat panels, cuboids and strips of blocks (which was generating into some extent in Farther Lands but exacerbated in Fartherer Lands). Because of this, Fartherer Lands marks the end of \"Swiss cheese\" terrain (solid wall and infinite tunnels) of both Far Lands and the Farther Lands.\nCorner Fartherer Lands are differentiated from the Corner Farther Lands that the space between layers is larger than both Corner Far Lands and Corner Farther Lands, and the boundary between Edge and Corner Fartherer Lands are smooth in comparison to the boundary between Edge and Corner Farther Lands.\nThe Farthest Lands.\nThese are the 64-bit variation of the Farther Lands, and they generate 80 times farther away than the Fartherer Lands, when X/Z coordinates reach \u00b14,312,430,307,758,379,832 and are a result of selector noise overflowing at the 64-bit limit. Like the Fartherer Lands, it is not possible to see The Farthest Lands in game without modifying the noise scale.\nExperimentation with 1.12.2 Customized worlds (by multiplying the default 684.412 noise scale with 2^32, and then with 80 to cause them to show up at the regular Far Lands distance of 12550824.023) shows minimal, but still noticeable differences between the Fartherer and Farthest Lands. From these observations, the most noticeable difference between the Fartherer Lands and the Farthest Lands is that Farthest Lands generate highly repetitive terrain (especially in the Corner Farthest Lands, where the terrain repeats itself as you move further out), similar to Bedrock Edition Edge Far Lands past X/Z +6,275,412.\nAnother noticeable difference between the Fartherer Lands and the Farthest Lands is that Farthest Lands are considered to be unstable, and in some cases failed to generate, leaving only the ocean and the bedrock layer, like the Nothingness of the &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%20Far%20Lands\"&gt;Bedrock Edition Far Lands&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in a customized world preset, Farthest Lands begins to \"disappear\" from the topmost layer into bedrock layer (and disappears more slowly closer to the boundary of the Edge variations) as it moves away from the center of the world. In Beta 1.7.3 or modified 1.12.2, the skygrid can generate at these coordinates all the way until 300 septillion blocks. Also, in the same preset, the Farthest Lands appears to be different between +X/+Z, +X/-Z, -X/+Z and -X/-Z coordinates, one of which failed to generate. As such, Farthest Lands stands out in comparison of previous sets of Far Lands, which generates more stable terrain.\nThe Fringe Lands.\nThe Fringe Lands are a stage of terrain breakdown where the Far Lands begin to break down at extremely high distances, resulting in strip and comb like artifacts. The Fringe Lands were named by Allam A. who explored them using terrain generation mods, 1.12.2 customized worlds, his coordinate scale mods and the 1.3.2 BigInteger mod.\nX Fringe Lands.\nThe First Stage of Fringe Lands start at 8.1751e48 blocks at X axis where some stretches of terrain stops(or become comb lands)\nThe Second Stage of Fringe Lands start at 8.5766e48 blocks at X axis where more comb lands generate.\nThe True Fringe Lands start at 9.176239e48 blocks at X axis, this is where the far lands really break down.\nThe One block lines start at 1.0299e49 blocks at X axis, this is where only one block lines and some pillar lands/dotted lines generate.\nThe Far Lands at X axis almost stop at 2.05e49 blocks.\nThe Far Lands at X axis completely stop at 1.8283327x10^59 blocks but ends at 3.66x10^49 blocks due to additional octaves have their own fringe lands.\nThe Fringe Lands at Z axis last longer than the X ones and degrades into a Skygrid rather than Empty Ocean just like in bedrock edition.\nThe Z Fringe Lands.\nThe Fringe Lands at Z axis start at 9.176239e48 blocks and some stretches of terrain stop(or become comb lands)\nAt 1.0299e49 blocks at Z axis, the Far Lands start to degrade from the Far Lands into a Skygrid\nAt 3.68e49 blocks at Z axis, the last comb lands finally decay into the Skygrid.\nAt 2.359e51 blocks at Z axis, the Skygrid completely stop and the only thing that remains is the Empty Ocean.\nCorner Fringe Lands.\nThe Corner Fringe Lands appear much earlier at around 4.05E24 blocks diagonally\nThe Corner Far Lands degrade into the skygrid and the corner fringe lands appears at varying coordinate\nThe Fringe Farther Lands.\nThe Fringe Farther Lands near 1004065811 in other the axis will appear between 2.5E39 and 1E40 blocks\nVertex Fringe Lands.\nThis type of fringe lands only appears if you set the noise multiplier of X/Y/Z axis to 1E15, the vertex fringe lands degrade into the skygrid at much earlier coordinate of 1E17 blocks and this varies,\nEffects/.\nWhile completely unrelated to terrain, these effects occur coincidentally with Far Lands due to their shared extreme distances and are worth noting as a result.\nFloating-point precision errors with entities and particles.\nEven in modern versions of Minecraft, the floating-point precision errors still exist, but only with translucent block rendering, natural snow generation and snowfall at extreme heights.\nDarkness.\nIn vanilla Minecraft 1.14, the lighting system ceases to work beyond 2^25 (X/Z \u00b133,554,432) (though this distance is available only via editing source codes), however, it isn't like what would happen beyond X/Z=32,000,000 in older versions. Instead, everything abruptly becomes absolutely dark and ignores light sources. By pressing F3, it shows that the sky light level is 0, thus &lt;a href=\"undead%20mobs\"&gt;undead mobs&lt;/a&gt; do not burn when exposed to the sky. The chunks, however, are still solid and block physics still function. Night Vision can help to counteract the visual darkness; it is currently unknown whether the &lt;a href=\"Conduit%20Power\"&gt;Conduit Power&lt;/a&gt; effect works or not.\nExplanation.\nThe Far Lands happen for much the same reason as they used to. As 64-bit overflowing has not been patched, its breaking can be calculated by replacing 2^31 in calculations with 2^63. A table of useful values are as follows.\nTrivia.\nIn Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Ultimate\"&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Classic Mode\" route for Steve and Alex is titled \"Journey to the Far Lands\", in which the player faces off against other Super Smash Bros. fighters, all resembling mobs that appear in Minecraft.\nThe End.\nThe End was implemented after the Far Lands were removed, meaning that the End Far Lands never generated naturally."}

Putting the numbers together, a standard Minecraft map in Bedrock Edition prior to &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.17.30\"&gt;1.17.30&lt;/a&gt; or Java Edition before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Beta%201.8\"&gt;Beta 1.8&lt;/a&gt;, is about 25,101,642 blocks wide along the X axes and 25,101,650 wide along the Z axes. For comparison, the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about 40,075,000 meters.\nStructure.\nBoth areas of the Far Lands feature extremely strange terrain, although they are significantly different.\nIn both zones, any area beneath sea level, excluding regular caves, are flooded with water. The Far Lands generate &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, but most biomes are indistinguishable except by the color of grass. Desert biomes are covered in sand and snow-covered biomes are covered with snow, excluding the very top of the map due to the height build limit. Trees generate somewhat normally, but can be found only in the upper areas of the map due to the need for grass.\n&lt;a href=\"Ore\"&gt;Ore&lt;/a&gt;s can be found up to their respective maximum heights just like in the normal world. Unfortunately, due to the flooding, everything except for &lt;a href=\"coal\"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; can be extremely difficult to acquire. In the solid areas of the Far Lands, normal &lt;a href=\"cave\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt;s still generate but are limited and small. Along with the caves, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s (which are extremely rare) and &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in solid areas. &lt;a href=\"Water\"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; springs can be found out in the open and in caves.\nMuch of the open space in both areas are shrouded in darkness and thus hostile &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s run rampant, making the Far Lands as a whole incredibly dangerous. This is especially problematic in the Corner Far Lands due to its layered structure. The flooded zones have an abundance of &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;.\nEdge Far Lands.\nThe far lands edge boundary (that is, where it meets the regular map) looks like a solid wall, all the way to the top of the map (Y coordinate 127 in beta 1.8 and earlier) which is filled with gaping holes perpendicular to the edge. These holes are extremely long, perhaps \"endless\", and on the whole seem to change very little, however deep the player's adventures. They can be blocked, partially or completely, but these blockages are rare and temporary. This \"Swiss Cheese Wall\" pattern continues below ground level, to the bottom of the map, and appears to be partially caused by a large one-dimensional distortion in the output of the map generator. This area is sometimes called \u201cthe loop\u201d. Early versions of the Far Lands also looked much more like randomly placed pixels interpolated solely with diagonal lines.\nThe Edge Far Lands' average block composition: 36% &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, 25% &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, 23% &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, 10% &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;, 2% &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, and 4% others. (Based on a 14\u00d714 &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; selection)\nCorner Far Lands.\nAt a corner, when two perpendicular Edge Far Lands sections meet, the Corner Far Lands begin to generate. Unlike the infinite-length holes in the Edge Far Lands, the Corner Far Lands contains more normal terrain. This terrain is \"stacked\" on top of itself to create a bizarre sandwich with layers of ground and air, which gives it its nickname, \"The Stack\". Each layer looks like a giant floating continent, hovering over the next layer, which is shadowed.\nThe majority of the generated world is Corner Far Lands, as the \"normal\" map (before \u00b112,550,821 mark) makes only the center of the world, and the Edge Far Lands make only its continued sides.\nThe number of layers is not always the same and varies between five and seven (fusing together and splitting every so often). Layers can be grouped into three categories:\nSometimes, there are extremely tall pillars of gravel that stretch from the ground to the ceiling of a layer. Likewise, some of the beaches that collapse create pillars of sand all the way down to the ground, despite there not being that much sand, to begin with. The Corner Far Lands is also prone to having near-perfect diagonal lines being carved into the ceilings or floors of layers. If traced, these lines all intersect at the corner (X/Z \u00b112,550,821). This seems similar to how the Edge Far Lands have a consistent pattern along lines perpendicular to their edge, but is much less pronounced.\nThe Corner Far Lands' average block composition: 40% &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, 16% &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, 28% &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, 10% &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Grass%20Block\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt;, 2% &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt;, and 4% others. (Based on a 14\u00d714 &lt;a href=\"chunk\"&gt;chunk&lt;/a&gt; selection)\nThe Farther Lands.\nThe second set of Far Lands (henceforth called the \"Farther Lands\") generate when X/Z coordinates reach about \u00b11,004,065,811, which is about 80 times farther than where the first set initiates, at \u00b112,550,821 (this is due to the value corresponding to the \"Main Noise Scale\" value later found in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Customized\"&gt;Old Customized&lt;/a&gt; Worlds being 80 by default). The terrain is similar to the first set of Far Lands, but is more stretched out. They also have Edge and Corner types, which are described below. Sometimes you can see infinitely repeated patterns in the corner farther lands.\nThe Edge Farther Lands which extend off of Corner Far Lands are notably distinct from Edge Farther Lands which extend from Edge Far Lands - the former can and will have infinite horizontal air gaps whereas the latter will not.\nEffects.\nGameplay.\nPlayers experience extreme frame-rate drops and very high CPU usage, which continue until \"Minecraft\" freezes completely. The frame-rate drops do not occur in multiplayer servers, though the server itself lags depending on the server computer's RAM. In both single-player and multiplayer, the intense lag that is characteristic of the Far Lands is caused by massive numbers of falling &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt; entities.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightning\"&gt;Lightning&lt;/a&gt; bolts that hit surfaces at the top of the map (Y-coordinate 127) are invisible and do not cause a fire. The particles created when rain hits these surfaces are black instead of blue. Snow does not accumulate on these surfaces either (because there is no space) unless a top layer tunnel peeks out.\nDistance effects.\nWhen travelling away from spawn, every time the distance is doubled from the center of the world, there is an issue with precision, where entities and block hitboxes (where the block should be) still match the shape of the world, but what we see (the blocks) don't. This effect can first be seen at 4096 blocks away from spawn if observed closely, even though it is far less noticeable than what is seen when the player is close to the Far Lands. Past 8,388,608 blocks, the offset is an entire block, which is the extent of the effect seen at the Far Lands.\nIntentional limits.\nThe above distance effects worsen as the player reaches X/Z: \u00b132,000,000, because after X/Z \u00b132,000,000 blocks, the terrain no longer generates, and only air blocks that have the same textures as the surrounding terrain generate.\nPrevious versions.\nInfdev.\nOn the March 27, 2010 version of &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt;, terrain generation changed and the Far Lands began generating at X/Z \u00b112,550,820. The original shape of the Far Lands was different from Beta 1.7.3 and changed many times as the terrain generator changed. In this version, the Far Lands were more smooth and thick and had less rough edges. However, as the terrain became less thick over time, the Far Lands became more thin and sharp. Though the Far Lands existed in these versions, many of the side effects from before did not appear. However, fire particles and doors would act strangely.\nThe Far Lands would continue until the intended &lt;a href=\"world%20boundary\"&gt;world boundary&lt;/a&gt; of 32 million blocks.\nDimensions.\nThe Far Lands of the Nether and Sky Dimension share characteristics of the Overworld Far Lands, although with some differences.\nThe Nether.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nether\"&gt;Nether&lt;/a&gt; Far Lands are similar to the Overworld Far Lands, except generated with Nether terrain features, with a &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; ocean at Y=31.\nIn the Nether, the terrible lag associated with the Overworld Far Lands does not occur; most of the Nether is already dark enough for spawns in the first place, and there are fewer gravity-affected blocks (no sand, and gravel is rare).\nIf a &lt;a href=\"nether%20portal\"&gt;nether portal&lt;/a&gt; is created in the Far Lands of the Overworld, entering causes a teleportation to normal Nether, as X/Z 32,000,000, the limit at which block physics and lighting cease to function, divided by 8 (as 1 block in the nether corresponds to 8 blocks in the Overworld), is X/Z 4,000,000, within the limits of X/Z 12,550,820, where the distortion starts. Conversely, a nether portal built in the Nether Far Lands does not function, as even at the limit of 12,550,820 blocks at the beginning of the Far Lands, it would cause the player to come out at X/Z 100,406,560, far past X/Z 32,000,000. If a portal is entered beyond X/Z 4,000,000 in the Nether, it causes the game to crash. Entering a portal at exactly X/Z: 4,000,000 in the Nether teleports the player around 8-16 blocks from the 32,000,000 limit. \nThe Far Lands do not generate above the &lt;a href=\"bedrock\"&gt;bedrock&lt;/a&gt; ceiling.\nThe Nether can be a great way to reach the Far Lands in the &lt;a href=\"Overworld\"&gt;Overworld&lt;/a&gt;, as every block in the Nether counts as 8 blocks in the Overworld. The player must travel to 1,568,853 or higher to spawn in the Far Lands. Teleporting just a few blocks less allows the player to see the beginning of the Far Lands.\nSky Dimension.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Dimension\"&gt;Sky Dimension&lt;/a&gt; similarly has no trademark liquid and generates no water/lava, and also no bedrock generates. They appear squashed similarly to those of the End.\nThe Sky Dimension Far Lands appears just like the End Far Lands, but with Overworld features.\nThis is also the area where the player is most likely to find diamonds. In any other area, the islands do not spawn low enough for diamonds to spawn. The Sky Dimension Far Lands do spawn all the way to Y: 0, so the player can find rare ores inside the Far Lands.\nCause.\nThe terrain is generated based on 16 octaves of , specifically those used for &lt;a href=\"low%20noise\"&gt;low noise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"high%20noise\"&gt;high noise&lt;/a&gt;. Each noise generator takes floating-point inputs and uses those to interpolate between noise values at whole numbers. It does so by:\nIt covers an interval of [\u2212231, 231) without causing any problems. The problem is that many of the octaves cover a scale much smaller than a block, with up to 171.103 noise units per block. Indeed, 231 \u2248 171.103\u00d712,550,824.053. Thus, the effects of the Far Lands start 12,550,824 blocks away from the center of the Minecraft world. Once this value is exceeded, the integer is always 231\u22121 (2,147,483,647), picking the same noise values on that axis every time. This is the reason for the long unchanging tunnels in the Edge Far Lands, and plains in the Corner Far Lands.\nThe Farther Lands are caused by an overflow in &lt;a href=\"selector%20noise\"&gt;selector noise&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to the low and high noise that cause the initial set of Far Lands to generate; while selector noise does repeat more often than low and high noise, only half as many octaves are used, causing them to overflow much further out.\nAt the positive end, the remainder starts out relatively small but usually much larger than 1, and grows by 171.103 per block. At the negative end, the remainder starts at \u2212232. This value is then adjusted by ((6x\u221215)x+10)x3 for quintic interpolation. Even one block in at the positive end, this is already around 1011. The negative end starts all the way around \u22121049. For the Corner Far Lands, multiply the values of both edges. When interpolation (really extrapolation) is attempted with values as large as these, it produces similarly large output. That output completely dwarfs all other terms that would normally give the terrain its shape, instead effectively passing only the sign of this one noise function through.\nIt was fixed by taking the remainder of the input divided by 224. Noise repeats every 28 units anyway, so it has no side effects. However, it does prevent the overflow. By removing these instructions, the Far Lands can be returned to current versions of the game.\nThere are several other factors to the cause of the Far Lands, making things slightly more complicated:\nA table of relevant values are as follows:\nWhile most of these values have can be ignored, it can indeed be seen that the low and high noise increment by 171.103 each block, or 684.412 each sampling at four blocks; dividing 2,147,483,648 by this will indeed result in the value 12550824 being returned. Similar results can be seen for selector noise and therefore Farther Lands, and using the maximum signed 64-but integer instead of 2,147,483,648 provides the Fartherer and Farthest Lands distances. (Depth noise far lands are dwarfed by low and high noise overflowing and are impossible to see unless depth noise is made to overflow beforehand.)\nHistory.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

These are the first truly visible appearance of the Far Lands, although very visually, behaviourally and positionally distinct from convention.\nThis stone wall may not always start at exactly 33,554,432 blocks out - it is not uncommon to see a rough, repetitive boundary at this point, visually resembling the ridges of a radiator or the fins of a heat sync, in a similar way to how the usual Far Lands can generate a few blocks earlier.\nOn some seeds, the Far Lands don't have any rough appearance but are rather just smooth. Sometimes Far Lands on one axis can be smooth while on the other axis they're rough.\nWhile occurring at exactly a power of two, this is not a &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20hard%20limits\"&gt;hard limit&lt;/a&gt;, but rather due to the &lt;a href=\"noise%20generator\"&gt;noise generator&lt;/a&gt; settings for these versions themselves also being a power of two, returning this overflow point in the calculations can lead to lag or even a crash on the game.\nEffects.\nDistance effects.\nWalking to these Far Lands is impossible in normal gameplay as the game becomes unplayable well before this point due to a variety of distance effects. Even if a player could overcome the distance effects, beyond 16,777,216 blocks away blocks stop being solid (however, swimming in water is still possible), preventing the player from traveling any further.\nIntentional limits.\nIn versions after Infdev &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100313\"&gt;20100313&lt;/a&gt;, a world boundary was added at X/Z: \u00b132,000,000. After the boundary at X/Z \u00b132,000,000 blocks, the terrain no longer generates, and only air blocks that have the same textures as the surrounding terrain generate.\nGallery.\nInfdev &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100227-1\"&gt;20100227&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Far Lands in this version are difficult to observe due to many distance effects and blocks becoming non-solid at this distance. \nInfdev &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100313\"&gt;20100313&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100325\"&gt;20100325&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Far Lands are no longer able to be viewed without modifying the game, due to the addition of a world barrier at +/- 32,000,000 blocks away from spawn. Most of the distance effects present in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Infdev%2020100227-1\"&gt;Infdev 20100227&lt;/a&gt; have been fixed, so the player is able to walk around and interact with the terrain with little to no issue."}
{"id": "1006", "revid": "5290187", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1006", "title": "Java Edition Indev", "text": "Indev (short for \"in development\") was the third phase of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;'s\" &lt;a href=\"development%20cycle\"&gt;development cycle&lt;/a&gt; and the oldest version with \"Minecraft's\" &lt;a href=\"Survival%20mode\"&gt;Survival mode&lt;/a&gt;, which succeeded &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt; Mode, and was the second Minecraft development stage to have some of its versions released to the public. Indev was phased out in favor of &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; after infinite maps were to be added into the game.\nIndev was initially released on December 23, 2009 after &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; received requests to let the community try out new features he was implementing. Indev version 0.31 was put to the public at minecraft.net/indev and available only to people who had purchased the game (which cost \u20ac5), therefore making Indev the first paid version of \"Minecraft\". New features currently contained a more complex and realistic &lt;a href=\"lighting\"&gt;lighting&lt;/a&gt; scheme than &lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt; mode's and support for MD3 mob models, demonstrated by &lt;a href=\"Rana\"&gt;Rana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Boy\"&gt;Beast Boy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steve%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Steve (mob)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Steve\"&gt;Black Steve&lt;/a&gt;. Indev received 29 updates after this, gaining a few fundamental features to \"Minecraft\" as it went, which are listed below. During its lifespan, some updates were devoted mostly for testing new things, like &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es or &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. As it progressed, its gameplay became standardized to that of \"Minecraft\" today, however with far fewer features.\nPlayers would play on a limited map with dimensions determined by the shape and size characteristics. Gameplay was dramatically different from &lt;a href=\"Survival%20Test\"&gt;Survival Test&lt;/a&gt; and paved the way for future game modes to come. Players now had to use &lt;a href=\"tools\"&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, gather and prepare food differently, utilize &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt; and be wary of the time of day. Like Survival Test however, players still had to save their map to a file on their computer and reload it if they died.\nIndev's limited maps soon raised opportunity for a game changing idea. On February 23, 2010, Indev received its last update and work on &lt;a href=\"Infdev\"&gt;Infdev&lt;/a&gt; started, a new mode that would use maps that would have no boundaries and would go on forever. Indev remained available on minecraft.net during Infdev's life and into &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; mode. In September 2010, Indev, along with Infdev were removed from the site and cannot be officially played anymore. A few functions that Indev contained are no longer seen in \"Minecraft\" today, such as picking out map characteristics, having to save and reload maps and the isometric map viewer. These were replaced by &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s, automatic map saving, &lt;a href=\"respawning\"&gt;respawning&lt;/a&gt; upon death and a new infinite map viewer (which has been removed)."}

In Infdev 0227-0325, it appeared to be there, but saving the world yielded an empty file.\nWhile Alpha (and Infdev) levels use NBT files, they have a very different file format.\nFor details on the infinite map format, see &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20Alpha%20level%20format\"&gt;Java Edition Alpha level format&lt;/a&gt;.\nNBT structure.\nCalculating \"Pos\" tag of the tile entity:\npos = x + (y \u00ab 10) + (z \u00ab 20)\nCalculating X, Y, and Z from \"Pos\" tag:\nx = pos % 1024\ny = (pos \u00bb 10) % 1024\nz = (pos \u00bb 20) % 1024\nBlocks.\nThe block byte array is used to define the types of blocks that occupy a map.\nThe number of bytes in the array may be calculated by multiplying the dimensions of the map.\nY being the up direction rather than Z.\nFor hex values see &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20data%20values%23Blocks\"&gt;Block IDs&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo access a specific block from either the block or data array from XYZ coordinates, use the following formula:\n array index = (y * length + z) * width + x;\nData.\nThe Data byte array is used for lighting and extra block data.\nFor extended information on block metadata, refer to &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20data%20value/Indev\"&gt;Java Edition data value/Indev&lt;/a&gt;.\nLighting.\nThere are 16 levels of lighting for a block ranging from codice_1 (0, no light) to codice_2 (15, full light)."}
{"id": "1232", "revid": "5290187", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1232", "title": "Java Edition Infdev", "text": "Infdev (short for infinite development) was the fourth phase in the &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%23Development\"&gt;development cycle&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and is only playable in single-player &lt;a href=\"Survival\"&gt;Survival&lt;/a&gt; mode, and was the third Minecraft development stage to have some of its versions released to the public.\nInfdev succeeded &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Notch\"&gt;Notch&lt;/a&gt; decided to rewrite the game's code to allow terrain to be \"infinite\" and procedurally generated rather than finite. This principle of how maps are generated is similar to current \"Minecraft\" levels. Ever since Infdev, maps generated terrain theoretically 8 times the size of the Earth. Infdev was also the first appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Lands\"&gt;Far Lands&lt;/a&gt;. The edge of the map limits the world to 64,000,000 blocks by 64,000,000 blocks, or 4.096 billion square kilometers. For comparison, the Earth has a total surface area (including ocean) of 510 million square kilometers.\nPhases of Infdev.\nOne can split Infdev into, at most, three phases. \nPhase one started on February 27, 2010, and ended on March 25, 2010. This phase of Infdev was mostly for testing purposes, seeing as the player spawned with stacks of certain items in their inventory. Test structures, such as &lt;a href=\"Bricks\"&gt;brick&lt;/a&gt; pyramids and &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; walls, would generate throughout the world. This phase of the game brought all of Indev's features up to par with Infdev's infinite terrain. \nPhase two started on March 27, 2010 and ended on April 20, 2010. This phase of the game was mostly used to fix bugs in the game. The terrain generator changed many times throughout this phase, and a new save format was introduced, along with the ability to save up to 5 worlds in the client.\nPhase three started on June 7, 2010 and ended on June 30, 2010. This was the \"extra phase\" of Infdev, since all of &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;'s features had been caught up to Infdev's infinite terrain, and this phase mostly added new features. This phase saw the addition of many things, such as doors, signs, ladders and stairs. This phase also introduced &lt;a href=\"Seecret%20Updates\"&gt;Seecret Updates&lt;/a&gt;, which added things such as &lt;a href=\"minecart\"&gt;minecart&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"rail\"&gt;rail&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spawner\"&gt;spawner&lt;/a&gt;s. On June 29, 2010, Notch started to develop the offline client of the game, which no longer required the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; to use a browser to play \"Minecraft\". Since these versions only added new features, one could consider them as early &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; versions.\nAlpha replacing Infdev.\nBecause Infdev's main purpose was to catch an infinite terrain version up to par with Indev's content, that purpose was filled around June 2010. Infdev was replaced by the name of &lt;a href=\"Alpha\"&gt;Alpha&lt;/a&gt; as a sign of progression towards release. Infdev no longer gets updated, and its link has been removed from the Minecraft website.\nInfdev, along with &lt;a href=\"Indev\"&gt;Indev&lt;/a&gt;, were still available on Minecraft.net up until September 2010, and to play Infdev now, players must use the option for playing another version of the game in the new launcher.\nAlpha's transition was an arguably \"gradual\" one, as the version &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.0.0\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.0&lt;/a&gt; was originally an Infdev version, which was only retroactively defined as being Alpha v1.0.0 upon the release of &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20v1.0.1\"&gt;Alpha v1.0.1&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "691", "revid": "55924972", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=691", "title": "Armor", "text": "Armor is a category of items that provide &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s and certain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s with varying levels of protection from common &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; types, and appear graphically on the wearer (excluding non-humanoid wearers). These items include several different tiers of &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chestplate\"&gt;chestplate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"leggings\"&gt;leggings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, which can each be placed in designated armor slots of a player's &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; for use.\nObtaining.\nCrafting.\nA full set of armor consists of 24 units of a given material. A &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; with no corresponding armor pieces. Despite there being chain items, chainmail armor cannot be crafted. A full suit of Netherite armor needs 4 units of &lt;a href=\"smithing%20template\"&gt;smithing template&lt;/a&gt;s and 4 units of Netherite ingots (16 netherite scraps and 16 gold ingots); obtaining netherite armor requires combining a diamond armor piece with a netherite ingot and smithing template using a &lt;a href=\"smithing%20table\"&gt;smithing table&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor can be &lt;a href=\"Item%20Repair\"&gt;repaired&lt;/a&gt; by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; or in the crafting grid. The resulting item has 5% more &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; left than the original &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s combined, if the total durability of both of the armor pieces is more than the total durability that a piece of armor would have fresh from a &lt;a href=\"crafting%20table\"&gt;crafting table&lt;/a&gt;, but any &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; are lost. Repairing armor with an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; preserves and combines the enchantments, with a rising &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; cost for subsequent repairs on the same item.\nRepairing.\n&lt;a href=\"Anvil%20mechanics%23Unit%20repair\"&gt;Unit repair&lt;/a&gt;.\nA piece of armor can be repaired in an anvil by adding units of the armor &lt;a href=\"material\"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt;'s repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% of the armor item's maximum durability, rounded down. Chainmail armor can be repaired in an anvil using &lt;a href=\"iron%20ingots\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt;. Netherite armor can be repaired in an anvil using &lt;a href=\"netherite%20Ingots\"&gt;netherite Ingots&lt;/a&gt;.\nMob loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and their variants that spawn with armor have a small chance of dropping their armor when killed by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. When killed, the armor they drop can vary from 0 to full &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. Upon &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, zombies, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Villager\"&gt;zombie villagers&lt;/a&gt;, skeletons, &lt;a href=\"zombie%20pigmen\"&gt;zombified piglins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"wither%20skeleton\"&gt;wither skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s always drop any armor that they picked up and equipped. They may also be wearing enchanted armor that retains the enchantment when dropped.\nRarely, a mob can drop a chainmail armor item. This is the only other way to obtain chainmail armor besides finding it in buried treasure or trading with villagers.\n, &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s have a small chance to drop an iron &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;, iron &lt;a href=\"chestplate\"&gt;chestplate&lt;/a&gt;, iron &lt;a href=\"leggings\"&gt;leggings&lt;/a&gt; or iron &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, in a badly damaged state, with a possibility of having a random enchantment.\n, armorer &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s throw chainmail armor to &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s who have the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20the%20Village\"&gt;Hero of the Village&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nNatural generation.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"armor%20stand\"&gt;armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s are found in each taiga &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; outdoor armory, one equipped with an &lt;a href=\"iron%20helmet\"&gt;iron helmet&lt;/a&gt;, the other with an &lt;a href=\"iron%20chestplate\"&gt;iron chestplate&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrading.\nLeather armor can be &lt;a href=\"Trading\"&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; from leatherworker &lt;a href=\"villager\"&gt;villager&lt;/a&gt;s. These armor pieces have randomly determined color.\nIron armor, chainmail armor and enchanted diamond armor can be bought from armorer villagers.\nBartering.\n&lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglin&lt;/a&gt;s may &lt;a href=\"Bartering\"&gt;barter&lt;/a&gt; iron &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Speed\"&gt;Soul Speed&lt;/a&gt; when given a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;.\nFishing.\nLeather &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, often badly damaged, can be obtained as a junk item from fishing.\nChest loot.\n, a sealed room in &lt;a href=\"woodland%20mansion\"&gt;woodland mansion&lt;/a&gt;s can appear that has a chest always containing an &lt;a href=\"Efficiency\"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/a&gt; I leather cap or Efficiency I leather tunic or Efficiency I leather pants.\nProtection value.\nArmor points count for less as the attack strength increases: each done by the attack reduces the effective defense points by , but not below 20% of the armor points. In short, the stronger the attack force, the less the armor points protect the player.\nMore information on this can be seen in below.\nUsage.\nTo have any protective effect, armor must be worn by the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chestplate\"&gt;chestplate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leggings\"&gt;leggings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; are equipped by placing them in the head, chest, legs and feet slots of the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; next to the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s character, respectively. Armor can also be equipped by right clicking while held. If the respective slot already contains a piece of armor, they are swapped, and the original armor ends up in the player's hand.\nA chestplate provides the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings. For leather, iron, and diamond armor, boots have equivalent armor points as the helmet, but for chainmail and gold armor, the helmet trumps boots. A &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to providing protection, also gives the player the &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; status effect.\nEach armor piece consumes one inventory slot. They cannot be stacked.\nIf wearing any piece of gold armor, &lt;a href=\"Piglin\"&gt;Piglins&lt;/a&gt; become neutral towards the player, however &lt;a href=\"Piglin%20Brute\"&gt;Piglin Brutes&lt;/a&gt; remain hostile. If wearing any piece of leather armor, a player is immune to &lt;a href=\"Powder%20Snow\"&gt;freezing&lt;/a&gt; damage and FOV change. If wearing leather boots, players may walk on &lt;a href=\"Powder%20Snow\"&gt;powder snow&lt;/a&gt;. This grants the \"Light as a Rabbit\" &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;. \nTiers.\nThere are seven different types of materials of armor, including turtle shells. The six full sets are shown below in order from weakest (offers the least protection and is the least durable) to strongest (offers the most protection and is the most durable).\nThe is not part of a full set. However, its defense points match gold, chainmail, and iron &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;s, while its &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; is between iron and diamond helmets (276). In the game's code, its protection is equivalent to iron armor.\nOther.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s provide beneficial effects when worn, but provide no protection against &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nA carved &lt;a href=\"pumpkin\"&gt;pumpkin&lt;/a&gt; can be worn in the &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt; slot. It partially blocks the player's vision, but prevents &lt;a href=\"endermen\"&gt;endermen&lt;/a&gt; from becoming aggressive when the player looks at them.\n&lt;a href=\"Mob%20head\"&gt;Mob head&lt;/a&gt;s can be worn in the helmet slot. They cut a player's detection range by 50% for the corresponding mob, a bonus that stacks with potions of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sneaking\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt; are worn in the &lt;a href=\"chestplate\"&gt;chestplate&lt;/a&gt; slot, allowing the wearer to glide through the air.\nDyeing leather armor.\nLeather armor can be &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;d, and colors can be mixed.\nDefault color HEX code for leather armor is .\nSmithing/armor trims.\nSince the 1.20 \"Trails and Tails\" update, &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Template\"&gt;armor trims&lt;/a&gt; can be applied to armor through the &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20Table\"&gt;Smithing Table&lt;/a&gt;. These are cosmetic changes to the armor that are found in a variety of structures.\nMechanics.\nWhenever a piece of armor absorbs &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;, the armor itself is damaged, reducing its &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. After taking enough damage, the armor piece is completely destroyed.\nNote that if the damage is absorbed not by the armor itself, but by a protection enchantment of the armor, the armor is not damaged. &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchantments&lt;/a&gt; can also reduce the damage that armor normally does not reduce.\nDamage types.\nThe following types of &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor itself:\nThe following types of damage are \"not\" reduced by armor and have no effect on the armor itself:\nDefense points.\nArmor defense points are controlled by an &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;, codice_1. The &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s current protection level is represented visually by the armor bar. The armor meter is affected by the particular pieces that are worn as well as the tier of the armor. The following table shows the number of defense points added by default by each individual piece of armor, as well as the total points added by a full set of armor for each material. \nDifferent combinations of armor provide different levels of defense.\nArmor toughness.\nArmor can further protect the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; through a second &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;, . Normally, armor nullifies a lesser portion of damage from attacks that deal greater damage. Armor toughness resists this effect, mitigating the power of strong attacks. By default, only diamond and netherite armor provide toughness, with each piece granting +2 toughness for diamond and +3 for netherite.\nDifferent combinations of armor provide different levels of armor toughness.\nArmor toughness system includes a new formula for calculating damage:\nDamage protection.\n&lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; taken depends on the number of defense points, the toughness of the armor worn and the strength of the attack. \nBroken down, this means that each armor point gives 4% maximum damage reduction against an incoming attack. Without toughness, this max damage reduction is lessened by 2 percentage points for each hit point of the incoming attack. 2 defense points are worth 8% protection, so the total protection that can be achieved with armor is 80%. Diamond and netherite armors protect the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; from up to 80% of damage, iron provides up to 60% damage reduction and leather provides up to 28%.\nOne piece of diamond armor (granting +2 toughness) decreases the defense reduction value for each attack hit point to 1.6%. Two diamond pieces decrease it to % (about 1.3333%), three decrease it to % (about 1.1428%), and four decrease it to 1%. Netherite armor decreases this even further. One piece of netherite armor reduce the defense reduction value for every hit point to (about 1.4545%), two decrease it to (about 1.1428%), three decrease to (about 0.9412%) and four decrease it to 0.8%. The exact formula for the defense reduction in percent is:\nSimply put, as toughness increases, the amount of defense reduction done by high-damaging attacks is diminished, and as toughness approaches a high value (through &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;), the defense reduction caused by high-damaging attacks becomes negligible. The final damage reduction value of the armor is capped at a minimum of 0.8% damage reduction per armor point, and to a maximum of 80% total. If armor is cheated in so that the min cap is larger than the max cap, the min cap is ignored. An illustration of the armor reduction is given below.\nIn tabular form (with a toughness of 0), damages are:\nNote that these &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; values are lower if a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; wears pieces of diamond armor or has toughness added to the armor through &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;. Without using cheats, armor values of 16 and above are impossible to obtain without at least one piece of diamond or netherite armor.\nKnockback reduction.\nEach &lt;a href=\"netherite\"&gt;netherite&lt;/a&gt; armor piece gives 10% of knockback reduction, protecting 40% with a full set.\nEnchantments.\nArmor can be &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; to provide various enchantments. Enchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to protect certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;. Damage reduction from enchantments does not decrease the armor's &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt;. Armor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.\nAn armor's material determines how enchantable it is. The higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments (see &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20mechanics\"&gt;enchantment mechanics&lt;/a&gt; for details).\nAs with several &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, several different levels of protection are possible. The maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4). Protection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.\nEach protection enchantment protects against specific types of &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; wearing armor is subjected to &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 20, and then damage reduction is codice_2, giving a maximum reduction of (80%) at EPF 20. \nBecause of the caps in the calculation, it is possible to achieve maximum protection against specific types of damage with just three pieces of armor. For example, two pieces of armor with &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Protection\"&gt;Blast Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV (EPF 8 each) and a single piece with &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; IV (EPF 4) would give a total EPF of 20 versus explosions. Any additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).\nIf the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor. \nIt is possible using to obtain armor with an &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;. Using this method, a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; V enchantment on every piece. Following the algorithm above, we find that, because Protection V has an EPF of 5, the armor reaches the maximum EPF of 20 for all types of damage. Any higher Protection enchantments could be used to reach the cap with just one level XX (20) enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.\nThe table below shows all armor enchantments at their max levels:\nNote: Only one form of protection can be applied to a piece of armor (i.e. a chestplate cannot have both Fire Protection and Blast Protection, unless using &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;s to get all protection enchants in one piece of armor). Feather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider and Soul Speed are enchantments applicable only to boots. Respiration and Aqua Affinity are enchantments applicable only to helmets. Swift Sneak is enchantment applicable only to leggings.\nDurability.\nAny hit from a &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; source that can be blocked by armor removes one point of &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; from each piece of armor worn for every of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). The following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure.\nThe chart below shows the &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the durability per unit does not depend on the tier of the armor.\nThis means that for the same number of &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"iron%20ingot\"&gt;iron ingot&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt;s/chainmail/&lt;a href=\"diamond\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt; can take 1.5 more damage than leggings. Thus, &lt;a href=\"chestplate\"&gt;chestplate&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"leggings\"&gt;leggings&lt;/a&gt; offer more defense points per unit, but have less &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; per unit.\nArmor worn by a non-&lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; mob does not lose durability when attacked by any means. Helmets that are worn by undead &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s lose durability when exposed to &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; due to absorbing the mob's &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from sunlight.\nNetherite armor does not lose durability from &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nMob armor.\nMobs equipping armor.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s can spawn equipped with random armor pieces. Some mobs also spawn with the ability to pick up the armor on the ground and equip them. The probability of mobs spawning equipped with armor, whether the armor is &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;, the level of the enchantment of the armor, and how many pieces of armor a mob spawns with depends on the &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;; if a mob spawns with armor, the tier of armor (leather, gold, etc.) has a fixed probability:\nIt is impossible for zombies and skeletons to naturally spawn with netherite armor.\nThe protection provided by armor and armor &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; works the same with &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s as it does with &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe following mobs can spawn with armor:\nThe following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor on normal or hard &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe following do not naturally spawn with armor, but they do pick up dropped armor and their armor does not render:\nThese &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; can have armor equipped on them via &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, but do not pick up armor:\nThese &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; can have armor equipped on them via &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;s, but their armor does not render:\nThese &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s cannot wear armor through &lt;a href=\"survival\"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt; mode means, but if equipped with &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, their armor is visible:\nAll other mobs can be equipped via commands, although the armor cannot be seen.\n&lt;a href=\"Helmet\"&gt;Helmet&lt;/a&gt;s can protect mobs from burning in &lt;a href=\"sunlight\"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, depleting its &lt;a href=\"item%20durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; as it absorbs the &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the helmet loses all of its durability and breaks. &lt;a href=\"Pumpkin\"&gt;Pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;s, or anything placed into the head slot using commands, also protect mobs from burning in sunlight.\nDamage caused by any other source does not cause the mob's armor durability to decrease.\nHorse armor.\n&lt;a href=\"Horse%20armor\"&gt;Horse armor&lt;/a&gt; can be equipped on &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s to protect them from &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor points.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s naturally have armor points.\nData values.\nItem data.\nWhen leather armor is dyed, it has the following NBT:\nWhen armor is trimmed, it has the following NBT:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;\nHistory.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

{"id": "79833", "revid": "5811199", "url": "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki?curid=79833", "title": "Armor/Old", "text": "In &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; and before &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%201.9\"&gt;Java Edition 1.9&lt;/a&gt;, armor used a different formula to calculate protection values. Below are the formulas used.\nProtection.\nEach defense point () represents 4% damage reduction. A full 20 defense points indicates 80% damage reduction.\nEnchantments.\nArmor can be &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;ed to provide various enchantments. Enchantments can provide more protection or allow armor to protect certain types of damage that armor doesn't normally protect against, such as fall damage or fire. Damage reduction from enchantments do not decrease the armor's durability. Armor enchantments do not appear on the armor bar.\nAn armor's material determines how enchantable it is. The higher a material's enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments (see &lt;a href=\"enchantment%20mechanics\"&gt;enchantment mechanics&lt;/a&gt; for details).\nAs with several enchantments, several different levels of protection are possible. The maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4). Protection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum.\nEach protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage. The amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment.\nThe EPFs for each enchantment and level are the result of the following formula:\nwhere formula_2 is the codice_1 (rounding down) operation.\nWhen a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 25, multiplied by a random value between 50% and 100%, rounded up, and capped again at 20. The damage is then reduced by 4% per point of total effective EPF (for example, a total effective EPF of 20 reduces damage by 80%).\nBecause of the caps in the calculation, it's possible to max out protection against specific types of damage with only three pieces of armor. For example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 11 each) and a single piece with Protection III (EPF 3) would give a total EPF of 25 versus explosions (before the remainder of the calculation). Any additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable).\nIf the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor. For example, a full suit of diamond armor reduces damage from attacks by 80%\u2014if each piece of armor also had a Protection IV enchantment (EPF 5 each), the enchantments would further reduce damage by 40% to 80% each time, for a total damage reduction of 88% to 96% (i.e., 80%, plus 40%-80% of the remaining 20%).\nIt is possible, using the /give command, to obtain armor with an enchantment level higher than what is normally obtainable via normal survival. Using this method, a player could give themselves, for example, a full set of diamond armor with a Protection V enchantment on every piece. Following the algorithm above, we find that, since Protection V has an EPF of 7, only 3 pieces of the armor need to have Protection V in order to reach the maximum 25 EPF for all types of damage (with 3 pieces of armor with Protection V and one piece with Protection IV, one's EPF is still 26, but the step between Protection IV and Protection V is 2 EPF, so the cap would not be reached without the third piece of Protection V armor). Any higher Protection enchantments could be used to allow the cap to be reached with only one enchantment, rather than having a full set of enchanted armor, but would be wasted if all pieces shared the same level enchantment.\nTo calculate the average amount of extra protection given by a set of armor, use the following formula:\nTo find the total protection of the armor set, simply add the extra protection to the standard percentage."}

It can also hold &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and be posed (but these are not possible in &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition\"&gt;Java Edition&lt;/a&gt; without commands).\nObtaining.\nAn armor stand can be broken by quickly it twice, dropping itself and any armor placed onto it.\nNatural generation.\nTwo armor stands are found in each taiga &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; outdoor armory, one equipped with an &lt;a href=\"iron%20helmet\"&gt;iron helmet&lt;/a&gt;, the other with an &lt;a href=\"iron%20chestplate\"&gt;iron chestplate&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\n&lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s can use armor stands to hold &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mob%20head\"&gt;mob head&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Commands\"&gt;Commands&lt;/a&gt; can be used to give them other &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. The stand does not have a GUI, so players interact with it directly. Armor stands are also able to be placed in different orientations, similar to &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sign\"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;s. Armor stands are &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entities&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to be pushed by &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt;s, moved by flowing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, pulled with &lt;a href=\"fishing%20rod\"&gt;fishing rod&lt;/a&gt;s, pushed by players (with knockback), and bounced by &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s. \n armor on the stand places the armor if done on a bare spot. Conversely, clicking on armor with a bare hand removes the armor and places it in the highlighted hotbar slot. It is not possible to take or place items from the armor stand's hands unless playing on Bedrock Edition.\nArmor, mob heads, or carved pumpkins can be automatically placed on armor stands with a &lt;a href=\"dispenser\"&gt;dispenser&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor stands can be customized further to have arms, pose, disobey gravity, dual wield and other things by summoning them using with &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Command%20NBT%20tags%23Armor%20Stand\"&gt;NBT tags&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn maps heavily using &lt;a href=\"command%20blocks\"&gt;command blocks&lt;/a&gt;, armor stands can be used to keep &lt;a href=\"scoreboard\"&gt;scoreboard&lt;/a&gt; objectives that are 'global' to the map, run &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt;, etc. \n, the pose of the armor stand can be changed by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the button on mobile devices) while sneaking, or by using a redstone signal. There are 13 possible poses. Armor stands can also hold items by interacting with the armor stand (or pressing the button on mobile devices) while holding an item that cannot be worn.\nBehavior.\nBecause armor stands are entities, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and rest on non-full &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"snow%20layer\"&gt;snow layer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"slab\"&gt;slab&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAny &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; on the stand drops when the stand is broken. Armor stands can display &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; and all forms of &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;d armor. The effects of most enchanted armor have no effect when on an armor stand, with three exceptions: \nArmor stands are not damaged by &lt;a href=\"cactus\"&gt;cacti&lt;/a&gt; but can be broken by &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. An armor stand destroyed by an explosion or a firework does not drop as an &lt;a href=\"item%20%28entity%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;. Armor stands in water and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; at the same time are not consumed by the lava.\n, armor stands can be affected by &lt;a href=\"status%20effect\"&gt;status effect&lt;/a&gt;s. They can be 'killed' by &lt;a href=\"Harming\"&gt;Harming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"lingering%20potion\"&gt;lingering potion&lt;/a&gt;s, lava, &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"campfire\"&gt;campfire&lt;/a&gt;s, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, yielding no armor stand item. If an armor stand is equipped with an item or armor, that item or armor is considered as \"naturally-spawned equipment\" with an 8.5% chance of dropping when the armor stand \"dies\" from the &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Damage\"&gt;Instant Damage&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20%28status%20effect%29\"&gt;Wither&lt;/a&gt; status effect. If the dropped item is any form of &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; or armor, it drops in a badly damaged state because the game considers it as \"naturally-spawned equipment\".\nThe stand wobbles slightly when being hit by the player.\n, it is possible to create an armor stand with arms using the &lt;a href=\"command\"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possible to change an armor stand without arms into a stand with arms by using the command. The commands are as follows:\nSounds.\nArmor stands use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nArmor stands have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the &lt;a href=\"entity\"&gt;entity&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\nNote: This video is outdated as Zoglins now attack armor stands"}

The number of tipped arrows created depends on the potion inside the cauldron. When the cauldron is full, 16 arrows can be tipped. When the cauldron is full, up to 32 arrows can be tipped and when the cauldron is full, an entire stack of 64 arrows can be tipped. This is more efficient than using lingering potions as up to 21 and 1/3 arrows can be tipped per potion.\nUsage.\nWhen fired, arrows fly in a affected by gravity and drag in &lt;a href=\"air\"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt;. The arrow's velocity is multiplied by 0.99 every game tick, and it also experiences 20 block/s2 of downward acceleration induced by gravity.\nArrows travel approximately 3 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s when fired parallel to a flat plane with no charge, 15 blocks average with medium charge, and 24 blocks average with maximum charge. When fired from a fully charged bow, arrows can travel 120 blocks if fired from an optimal angle. The maximum height an arrow fired by a bow can reach is around 66 blocks.\nAn arrow fired in water experiences much more drag than in air: it moves less than 8 blocks before completely losing horizontal speed and falling straight down, although the knockback of the arrow remains unaffected. It also leaves a trail of bubbles in its wake.\nThere is a random variable to the trajectory of an arrow, given by codice_1 for the x, y, and z coordinate. The inaccuracy is relatively small, becoming noticeable over larger distances. The inaccuracy of different arrow delivery devices may differ. Dispensers fire with an inaccuracy of 6, while bows fire with an inaccuracy of 1.\nAn arrow's speed determine the damage it inflicts. The damage inflicted is calculated by multiplying the arrow's &lt;a href=\"%23Entity%20data\"&gt;damage value&lt;/a&gt; with its velocity in blocks per &lt;a href=\"Tick%23Game%20tick\"&gt;game tick&lt;/a&gt;. When fired from a fully-charged unenchanted bow, arrows do of damage, with a smaller chance to damage for up to via critical hits. They inflict up to damage from a medium-charged bow, and from a bow with no charge. Arrows fired from dispensers always do of damage unless their velocity is modified by an external source. Arrows fired from &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s do to of damage.\nArrows trigger &lt;a href=\"Damage%23Immunity\"&gt;damage immunity&lt;/a&gt; on hit. However, unlike other methods of damage that may bypass invulnerability under certain conditions, arrows hitting the mob while it is invulnerable lose all speed and drop to the ground, dealing no damage unless they contact another mob.\nArrows also stick into objects they come in contact with and remain there for one minute before disappearing; the distance from the object and the angle determine how far into the target the arrow penetrates. Such arrows may be &lt;a href=\"%23Retrieving\"&gt;retrieved&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the arrow has any custom potion effects (NBT tag codice_2), all potion effects, including vanilla potion effects (NBT tag codice_3) are removed 30 seconds after the arrow stops moving.\nIf an arrow is stuck in a block, and that block is broken or disappears (e.g., &lt;a href=\"leaves\"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; upon decay), then the arrow falls straight down and damages entities below, but never deals a critical hit. The 1-minute despawn timer is then refreshed, meaning it will take another minute for the arrow to despawn.\nArrows bounce off players and mobs immune to damage, like a player in Creative mode, a &lt;a href=\"wither\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; under the \"wither armor\" effect, and a perching &lt;a href=\"ender%20dragon\"&gt;ender dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrows shot through &lt;a href=\"lava\"&gt;lava&lt;/a&gt; or (if there's at least a 2 block gap) &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; catch on fire and show an appropriate animation until they pass through water. Like arrows shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, they can set other entities they hit on fire for 5 seconds as well as ignite TNT and campfires.\nAn arrow shot at any kind of boat, boat with chest, or minecart causes the vehicle to break, dropping any components (including container contents).\nArrows can get visually stuck in players , although not any mobs. They appear as regular arrows regardless of type.\nRedstone circuits.\nAn arrow can activate a wooden &lt;a href=\"button\"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;, wooden &lt;a href=\"pressure%20plate\"&gt;pressure plate&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tripwire\"&gt;tripwire&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"target\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt;. An arrow will continue to power these blocks until it is removed or moved out of the \"activation zone\", either due to despawning, or being picked up. Target blocks emit a redstone pulse for one second, as opposed to the static depressed state of the other switches. Non-wooden switches are not affected by arrows.\nWhen arrows are fired into the sides of blocks, they change their orientation to point more downward than their original flight path might indicate. This can cause them to intersect and thus trigger switches above them that they didn't actually hit, or block rails above them.\nExplosions.\nArrows are affected by explosions while they are in flight. Since explosions can increase the speed of an arrow, they can also increase the damage dealt by them. \nVariants.\nTipped arrows.\nTipped arrows are arrows that imbue a potion effect when hitting a mob or player. The duration of the effect is that of the corresponding potion, if applicable, and is not affected by the power of the arrow. The status effect is the same as the regular power effect for the potion. If a bow is enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, tipped arrows are still consumed. \nThe types of arrows are:\nArrows of Harming (and arrows of Healing when used against undead mobs) do not add a static amount of damage to the arrow. Instead, the arrow's damage is first calculated, then checked to see if it is below . If the arrow's damage is less than 12, the Harming effect of the arrow makes up the difference, to ensure the arrow does exactly . Therefore, an unenchanted bow cannot deal more than 12 damage using Harming (or Healing) arrows, as it can deal a maximum of damage on level ground. However, if the arrow would deal more than 12 damage, the harming effect is entirely neutralized. This means that bows enchanted with Power I through Power III has a chance to not utilize the arrow at full charge, and any Power level above III never utilizes Arrows of Harming effectively at full charge when against unarmored mobs or players. \nNo-effect tipped arrows.\nIt is possible to craft tipped arrows using &lt;a href=\"Lingering%20Potion%23Lingering%20water%20bottle\"&gt;lingering water bottle&lt;/a&gt;s as well as Awkward, Thick, and Mundane &lt;a href=\"lingering%20potion\"&gt;lingering potion&lt;/a&gt;s. If crafted with a water bottle, the arrow is called an arrow of Splashing. If crafted with Mundane, Awkward, or Thick potions, it is called a tipped arrow. Tipped arrows crafted from different potions do not stack, as resultant tipped arrows all have different potion tags.\nIn Bedrock Edition, all four kinds as well as the long mundane tipped arrow aren't obtainable either in creative, by cauldrons, by crafting, or by commands.\nAll four kinds generate blue particles in flight and upon landing, but otherwise behave like regular arrows. In particular, arrow of Splashing has no effect on fire and campfires and when shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, can light campfires and TNT just like regular arrows on fire. \nUncraftable tipped arrows.\n, the uncraftable tipped arrow is a tipped arrow with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay. It is available in two variants that don't stack together:\nThe uncraftable arrow doesn't differ from regular arrows in behavior when used as a projectile.\nSpectral arrows.\nA spectral arrow confers the &lt;a href=\"Glowing\"&gt;Glowing&lt;/a&gt; status effect for 10 seconds. The Glowing effect creates an outline of the target, which is visible through blocks, and colored based on the target's &lt;a href=\"team\"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; (white by default). Even if a bow is enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Infinity\"&gt;Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, spectral arrows are still consumed. Spectral arrows can be acquired through &lt;a href=\"bartering\"&gt;bartering&lt;/a&gt; or crafted by combining 4 &lt;a href=\"glowstone%20dust\"&gt;glowstone dust&lt;/a&gt; with one arrow, yielding 2 spectral arrows.\nSounds.\nArrows and spectral arrows use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nMetadata.\n, arrows use the following item data values:\nEntity data.\nNormal and tipped arrows.\nArrows have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nSpectral arrows.\nSpectral arrows also have entity data that define various properties of the entity.\nHistory.\nHistorical sounds:"}

An attribute always has a base value, and may have any number of modifiers. Attributes also have a default value (used when spawning a mob with an undefined attribute base), and hard-coded minimum and maximum values. Modifiers act on an attribute's base, but the calculated value is always capped by the minimum and maximum.\nMinimum and maximum are inclusive unless specified otherwise or they are equal to 1.7\u00d710308.\nNote that attribute modifiers that have the same UUID and affect the same attribute do not stack; only the one that most recently affected a player or mob has an effect, overriding the previously affecting modifier(s).\nAttributes available on all living entities.\nThese attributes are found on all living entities, including players.\nAttributes for players.\nThese attributes apply to &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAttributes for horses.\nThese attributes apply to &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAttributes for bees and parrots.\nThese attributes apply to &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"parrot\"&gt;parrot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAttributes for zombies.\nThese attributes apply to &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s.\nProperties of unknown attributes.\nWhen the game finds an attribute with an unrecognized name, it applies these properties to it.\nModifiers.\nModifiers act upon the base value of an attribute, increasing or decreasing it. Note that the resulting value after modification is capped by the attribute's minimum and maximum. Like attributes, modifiers have a name, however, this name does not define the modifier's behavior. Instead, a modifier's behavior is determined by its operation. Modifiers also carry an amount to their modification, and a &lt;a href=\"UUID\"&gt;UUID&lt;/a&gt; to uniquely identify the modifier.\nOperations.\nA modifier's operation dictates how it modifies an attribute's base value. Three operations exist:\nadd (amount +/-): Saved as operation 0. Adds all of the modifiers' amounts to the current value of the attribute. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:0} and {Amount:4,Operation:0} with a Base of 3 results in 9 (3 + 2 + 4 = 9).\nmultiply_base (amount % +/-, additive): Saved as operation 1. Multiplies the current value of the attribute by (1 + x), where x is the sum of the modifiers' amounts. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:1} and {Amount:4,Operation:1} with a Base of 3 results in 21 (3 * (1 + 2 + 4) = 21).\nmultiply (amount % +/-, multiplicative): Saved as operation 2. For every modifier, multiplies the current value of the attribute by (1 + x), where x is the amount of the particular modifier. Functions the same as Operation 1 if there is only a single modifier with operation 1 or 2. However, for multiple modifiers it multiplies the modifiers rather than adding them. For example, modifying an attribute with {Amount:2,Operation:2} and {Amount:4,Operation:2} with a Base of 3 results in 45 (3 * (1 + 2) * (1 + 4) = 45).\nThe mathematical behavior is as follows:\nThe game first sets X = Base, then executes all Operation add, then sets Y = X, then executes all multiply_base modifiers, and finally executes all multiply modifiers.\nVanilla modifiers.\nAs stated before, a modifier's name can be anything, and this does not affect its behavior. The following are known modifier names and values used in vanilla Minecraft. Note that some UUIDs are generated on-the-fly, while others are represented as fixed strings in the code - these have been listed as well. Do not add UUIDs to this table for modifiers where they are not listed - if a UUID is not listed, this means that it is different every time the modifier is created."}

Axolotls attack &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"guardian\"&gt;guardian&lt;/a&gt;s; this makes axolotls useful for assisting with aquatic combat. Axolotls grant &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpawning.\nAxolotls spawn underwater in the &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; biome and when there is a &lt;a href=\"clay%20block\"&gt;clay block&lt;/a&gt; less than five blocks below the spawning space.\nColors.\nAxolotls can be one of five colors: pink (leucistic), brown (wild), gold, cyan, and blue.\nWhen breeding axolotls, there is a (0.083%) chance of the offspring having the blue mutation, leaving (99.917%) chance of matching one of the parents (including blue parents).\nBehavior.\nAxolotls are passive toward players and can be attached to &lt;a href=\"lead\"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt;s. Axolotls give &lt;a href=\"Regeneration\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; I for per axolotl in the fight, up to a duration of , and remove &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Fatigue\"&gt;Mining Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; when a player kills a mob that is in combat with an axolotl.\nAxolotls attack all &lt;a href=\"aquatic%20mob\"&gt;aquatic mob&lt;/a&gt;s except &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s and other axolotls. They also attack the &lt;a href=\"drowned\"&gt;drowned&lt;/a&gt;. An axolotl deals points of damage per attack. However, axolotls do not attack the player.\nAfter killing a non-hostile mob, there is a two minute cooldown before another non-hostile mob can be hunted. Axolotls prioritize attacking hostile mobs over non-hostile mobs.\nIf an axolotl takes damage underwater, it may play dead, dropping to the ground for while gaining Regeneration I. Hostile aquatic mobs ignore healing axolotls. There is a chance for an axolotl to play dead to recover . In addition, if either a random integer from 0\u20132 (inclusive) is less than the amount of incoming &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, or the axolotl's health before the damage is dealt is less than 50% of its maximum health, it plays dead. \nAxolotls can leave the water and wander about on land. When an axolotl leaves the water, it wanders as far as 8 or 9 blocks beyond the water's edge before returning to the water, as long as there is water at least 2 blocks deep within 16 blocks of the axolotl. If 2-block-deep water is outside this range, the axolotl can wander off randomly on land in search of more deep water, and die after exposure out of water. Axolotls are not attracted to shallow (1 block deep) water. They require water at least 2 blocks deep within 16 blocks to pathfind to the water.\nAxolotls can also die out of water as passengers in a boat. Unlike &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dolphin\"&gt;dolphin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"squid\"&gt;squid&lt;/a&gt;, axolotls do not die on land in &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt; or in a &lt;a href=\"thunderstorm\"&gt;thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most mobs, axolotls cannot be moved by flowing water. However, they are still affected by &lt;a href=\"bubble%20column\"&gt;bubble column&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs aquatic mobs, axolotls take extra &lt;a href=\"damage\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Impaling\"&gt;Impaling&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. Unlike other aquatic mobs, they cause nearby &lt;a href=\"pufferfish\"&gt;pufferfish&lt;/a&gt; to inflate.\nAxolotls can be renamed by placing a bucket of axolotl into an &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt;, the same as if renaming any other item. Axolotls that are picked up with a &lt;a href=\"water%20bucket\"&gt;water bucket&lt;/a&gt; and placed back into the world do not despawn.\nBreeding.\nAdult axolotls can be led and bred with &lt;a href=\"buckets%20of%20tropical%20fish\"&gt;buckets of tropical fish&lt;/a&gt;. After breeding, a baby axolotl spawns and 1\u20137 &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; is generated. The parents cannot be bred again for 5 minutes or 1 minute . The baby axolotl has a chance to be the rare blue variant; otherwise, it inherits the color of one parent at random. Babies follow adults, and grow to adulthood in 20 minutes. The growth of baby axolotls can be accelerated using buckets of tropical fish; each use reduces the remaining growing time by 10%.\nSounds.\nAxolotls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nAxolotls have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

Application of bone meal gives an azalea or flowering azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3\u00d75\u00d73 area above it that is clear of all blocks that are not leaves or logs.\nBee nests.\n&lt;a href=\"Oak\"&gt;Oak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"birch\"&gt;birch&lt;/a&gt; trees grown from &lt;a href=\"sapling\"&gt;sapling&lt;/a&gt;s that are within 2 blocks of any flowering azalea have a 5% chance to grow with a &lt;a href=\"bee%20nest\"&gt;bee nest&lt;/a&gt; containing 1 to 3 bees."}

There are three different variants of the badlands biome.\nDescription.\nBadlands biomes feature large mounds of &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt; bands, in layers of various colors; specifically, red, orange, yellow, white, light gray, brown, and regular terracotta may all naturally generate. At high altitudes, the topmost layer of stained terracotta is often weathered into regular terracotta, most often on plateau tops. At low altitudes, the terrain surface is weathered into a layer of &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"red%20sandstone\"&gt;red sandstone&lt;/a&gt; if floating), with orange terracotta under it extending to Y=63. The underwater surface is covered with a layer of orange terracotta, and in shallow water, sometimes interspersed with some white terracotta; in deep water, sometimes interspersed with some &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBadlands biomes can usually be found bordering &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s, and they usually do not border &lt;a href=\"ocean\"&gt;ocean&lt;/a&gt;s, but they can also generate by the ocean in areas with mountain peaks. Normal badlands and eroded badlands often appear on the two banks of a river.\n&lt;a href=\"Cactus\"&gt;Cactus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dead%20bush\"&gt;dead bush&lt;/a&gt;es generate frequently across the landscape, similarly to &lt;a href=\"desert\"&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;s, but dead bushes are more common than in deserts, and cactus are rarer. &lt;a href=\"Sugar%20cane\"&gt;Sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s may generate along water.\n&lt;a href=\"Mineshaft\"&gt;Mineshaft&lt;/a&gt;s generate at much higher elevations in these biomes, often exposed to fresh air. Their supporting &lt;a href=\"planks\"&gt;planks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s are made of dark oak rather than oak. Additionally, extra &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore\"&gt;gold ore&lt;/a&gt; generates up to elevation Y=255 (rather than the normal Y=32), and at much higher rates than the rest of the world, making badlands tunnels excellent sources of gold.\nWhile all badlands biomes are rich in unique &lt;a href=\"Terracotta\"&gt;building materials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gold%20ore\"&gt;gold ore&lt;/a&gt;, there are no &lt;a href=\"passive%20mobs\"&gt;passive mobs&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"tree\"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; are uncommon because they appear only atop wooded badlands. So, food cultivation can be difficult.\nBadlands biomes never &lt;a href=\"rain\"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;, meaning &lt;a href=\"lightning\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; strikes are impossible. The exceptions are the &lt;a href=\"river\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt;s that cut through the badlands, where it can still rain and cast lightning.\nTerracotta band generation.\nThe colors of specific &lt;a href=\"terracotta\"&gt;terracotta&lt;/a&gt; layers in these biomes are almost the same throughout all badlands biomes for any particular world. Each world seed generates 192 layers of terracotta for each Y-coordinate to pick from. At each horizontal coordinate, each layer may shift up and down by at most \u00b17 blocks based on a noise.\nVariants.\nThere are three badlands biome variants (badlands, wooded badlands and eroded badlands), with three removed variants (badlands plateau, modified badlands plateau, and modified wooded badlands plateau) in previous versions.\nBadlands.\nThe badlands is the ordinary badlands biome.\nThe following mobs are naturally spawned here\uff1a\nWooded Badlands.\nThe wooded badlands generates groves of trees at high &lt;a href=\"altitude\"&gt;altitude&lt;/a&gt;s, and therefore is the forest variant of the badlands. The uppermost layers of terrain is &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt; trees and &lt;a href=\"grass\"&gt;grass&lt;/a&gt; growing on them. Here, the grass and oak leaves take on a dull greenish-brown color darker than that of the &lt;a href=\"savanna\"&gt;savanna&lt;/a&gt; biome, giving it a droughted appearance; additionally, all naturally generated trees are small variants. This variant is a rare source of wood in the otherwise barren badlands. The forest begins generating above elevations of roughly Y=103. This variant generates at higher &lt;a href=\"humidity\"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; values compared to the default badlands, which means that it can often be found bordering &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt;s, or having &lt;a href=\"lush%20caves\"&gt;lush caves&lt;/a&gt; underground.\nWooded badlands use the same mob spawning chances as badlands.\nEroded Badlands.\nThe eroded badlands features unique formations of terracotta , narrow spires that rise up from the red sand floor of the biome's drainage basins. This biome is intended to resemble the famous in Utah, USA, which features hoodoos across its landscape.\n, eroded badlands use the same mob spawning chances as badlands. , passive mobs can spawn here.\nSounds.\nMusic.\nThese music tracks play while the player is in the Badlands."}

Flowing &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; also breaks bamboo shoots, but not mature bamboo stalks.\nNatural generation.\nBamboo generates in widely scattered single shoots within &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s. Bamboo generates much more densely in the &lt;a href=\"bamboo%20jungle\"&gt;bamboo variant&lt;/a&gt;s of jungles, covering large areas of the landscape. Bamboo does \"not\" generate in &lt;a href=\"sparse%20jungle\"&gt;sparse jungle&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMob loot.\n, a &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt; drops 1 bamboo when killed. &lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; does not affect the drop rate.\n, a panda drops 0-2 bamboo when killed. Looting increases the drop by 1 per level.\nFishing.\nBamboo can be found while &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"jungle\"&gt;jungle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"biome\"&gt;biome&lt;/a&gt;s as a junk &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nWhen broken, any bamboo &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; placed or grown above it is also broken. A bamboo block drops itself as an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; if a &lt;a href=\"piston\"&gt;piston&lt;/a&gt; pushes it or moves a block into its space. When bamboo is first placed as a shoot it's not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it. After growing at least one block taller it becomes solid and can't be destroyed by water. To transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it.\nUnlike most plants, bamboo cannot be &lt;a href=\"Composter%23Composting\"&gt;composted&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarming.\nBamboo can be planted on &lt;a href=\"moss%20block\"&gt;moss block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"grass%20block\"&gt;grass block&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dirt\"&gt;dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"coarse%20dirt\"&gt;coarse dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rooted%20dirt\"&gt;rooted dirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gravel\"&gt;gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mycelium\"&gt;mycelium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"podzol\"&gt;podzol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sand\"&gt;sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"red%20sand\"&gt;red sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20sand\"&gt;suspicious sand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"suspicious%20gravel\"&gt;suspicious gravel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mud\"&gt;mud&lt;/a&gt;, bamboo shoot, or on itself. At default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every . When &lt;a href=\"bone%20meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt; is on it, it grows by 1\u20132 &lt;a href=\"blocks\"&gt;blocks&lt;/a&gt;. Bamboo can grow up to 12\u201316 blocks tall. The top of a bamboo plant requires a &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; level of 9 or above to grow.\nBecause bamboo breaks in almost the same way as &lt;a href=\"sugar%20cane\"&gt;sugar cane&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Sugar%20cane%20farming\"&gt;a sugar cane farm&lt;/a&gt; can be easily adapted to this use. While water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.\nPandas.\nBamboo &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s are eaten by &lt;a href=\"panda\"&gt;panda&lt;/a&gt;s and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas. Bamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 8 &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s of bamboo are within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements. At this point, the &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can feed them bamboo and they &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;mate&lt;/a&gt; to have a baby.\nFuel.\nBamboo can be used as fuel for &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;. Each bamboo item smelts 0.25 &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. Crafting two bamboo into a &lt;a href=\"stick\"&gt;stick&lt;/a&gt; and using that as fuel is equivalent, smelting 0.5 items. \nBamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.\nFlower pots.\nBamboo can be placed in a &lt;a href=\"flower%20pot\"&gt;flower pot&lt;/a&gt;, where it retains the design it has in its item form.\nAppearance.\nThe appearance of bamboo changes as it grows. When first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot, which has no &lt;a href=\"hitbox\"&gt;hitbox&lt;/a&gt;. When it grows one &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; taller it grows to 2 pixels in length and width and the top block has leaves coming off it. At 3 blocks, the top 2 blocks have leaves and at 4 blocks the bamboo expands to 3\u00d73 pixels. At 5 blocks tall, the top 3 blocks have leaves on them. As the bamboo grows, the leaves move up and stay at the top 3 blocks. Destroying a block of bamboo does not change the appearance of the blocks below it. Bamboo is oriented at a random position in the block that it is in."}

A piston can move up to twelve blocks at once.\nObtaining.\nBreaking.\nA piston can be broken using any &lt;a href=\"tool\"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; with equal efficiency, and always drops itself.\n, it is faster to break them with a &lt;a href=\"pickaxe\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. The pickaxe is also the preferred tool for breaking the head when extended.\nNatural generation.\nThree sticky pistons generate as part of each &lt;a href=\"jungle%20temple\"&gt;jungle temple&lt;/a&gt;. Five sticky pistons also generate in each &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20City\"&gt;ancient city&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nPistons are always placed facing toward the player. When powered, the piston's wooden surface (the \"head\") starts extending immediately ; or either later or immediately, depending on how it was powered, . When it extends, it &lt;a href=\"%23Pushing%20blocks\"&gt;pushes&lt;/a&gt; at most 12 blocks. The piston makes a sound that can be heard within a 31\u00d731\u00d731 cube centered on the activating piston. Any entities in the path of the extending head are pushed with the blocks. If there is no place for the entities to go, the block pushes inside them, suffocating &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s if the block is not transparent when pushed into the eye height of the mob.\nWhen a piston loses power, its head retracts. Like extending, this retraction starts immediately ; or, depending on how it was powered, after 1 tick . It finishes retracting after it starts. A sticky piston also pulls the block attached to its head, but not any of the other blocks it may have pushed.\nSticky pistons stick to a block only when retracting, so a block next to the piston head can be pushed aside by another piston and sticky pistons cannot hold falling blocks horizontally against gravity. , pistons finish extending early and start retracting if given a pulse shorter than . These shorter pulses cause sticky pistons to \"drop\" their block, leaving it behind when trying to push it with a short pulse. Also, this causes the block to end up in its final position earlier. However, if they receive a short pulse and don't have a block to be pushed, they pull the block which is 1 block away.\nA piston that pushes a &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt; bounces any entity that it displaces in the direction the piston is facing. In addition, when a slime block is moved by a piston, any movable blocks adjacent (not diagonally) to the slime block also move. See the \"Slime blocks\" section below for more details.\n, blocks that stick to walls (such as levers) can be placed on pistons or sticky pistons.\nLimitations.\nPistons can push most blocks, and sticky pistons can pull most blocks, except those listed in the table below. A sticky piston simply leaves a block behind if it cannot pull it.\nPistons cannot push blocks into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; or beyond the top of the map. They also cannot push more than 12 blocks. If the requirements for a block to be pushed are not met, the piston simply does not extend.\nPistons do not move blocks that are \"attached to a block\", as they detach and drop as an item.\nPowering pistons.\nPistons can be powered in various ways:\nSlime blocks and honey blocks.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt; is pushed or pulled by a piston, while moving, adjacent blocks also move with the slime block, unless a non-piston movable block stops the blocks that are \"grabbed\" by the slime blocks. These blocks may in turn push other blocks, not just the blocks in the line in front of the piston. For example, a slime block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which in turn has to push additional ground blocks in the direction of motion just as if it were being pushed directly by a piston.\n&lt;a href=\"Glazed%20terracotta\"&gt;Glazed terracotta&lt;/a&gt; is an exception; it \"does not\" move when adjacent slime blocks are moved. The same occurs when a slime block is moved by an adjacent slime block. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled as a unit by a single piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube. A slime block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons ignores the immobile block. But if an adjacent block could be moved but is prevented by the presence of an immobile block, the slime block is prevented from moving.\nSlime blocks are not pulled by a non-sticky piston, nor are they moved if an adjacent (non-Slime) block is moved by a piston. The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d73 collection of Slime Blocks may be pushed or pulled by a sticky piston as long as no other movable blocks are adjacent to it. A piston cannot move itself via a \"hook\" constructed of slime blocks, but self-propelled contraptions can be created with multiple pistons. For that, see the article &lt;a href=\"Tutorials/Flying%20machines\"&gt;Tutorials/Flying machines&lt;/a&gt;. The same happens for the &lt;a href=\"honey%20block\"&gt;honey block&lt;/a&gt;, but it does not stick to slime blocks.\nTechnical components.\nPiston head.\nThe piston head is a technical block used as the second block of an extended piston. A block state defines whether it is a normal or a sticky piston head. It can be placed using the command or with the &lt;a href=\"debug%20stick\"&gt;debug stick&lt;/a&gt;, though if not part of a proper piston, it disappears after receiving any &lt;a href=\"block%20tick\"&gt;block tick&lt;/a&gt;, such as when a block is placed next to it unless the player uses the debug stick. It drops nothing.\n, the normal and sticky piston heads are distinguished by a block state. , they use separate block IDs, and it can be obtained as an item via inventory editors.\nMoving piston.\nThe moving piston, also known as block 36 due to its &lt;a href=\"Java%20Edition%20data%20values/Pre-flattening/Block%20IDs\"&gt;pre-flattening block ID&lt;/a&gt;, is an unobtainable technical block that contains part of a piston head, and/or part of one or two blocks that the piston is carrying into or out of the grid cell (including blocks carried indirectly via &lt;a href=\"slime%20block\"&gt;slime block&lt;/a&gt;s). Since moving blocks vary in how much of each grid cell they occupy, they can't be stored as normal &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;s and are instead stored as &lt;a href=\"block%20entities\"&gt;block entities&lt;/a&gt;. It is overwritten with air, the piston head or the carried block at the end of the piston stroke; but if it is placed through editing and no piston is connected, it remains indefinitely.\nIt is invisible and non-solid , and cannot be broken without the use of &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"TNT\"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt;. Although it is non-solid, fluids cannot pass through it. It also prevents players from building at its location. &lt;a href=\"Mobs\"&gt;Mobs&lt;/a&gt; can see through it, but cannot walk through it.\nThe game treats the block as a &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; block when it comes to the player's footstep sounds. It is similar to &lt;a href=\"Invisible%20Bedrock\"&gt;Invisible Bedrock&lt;/a&gt; in properties with the exception that the player can walk through the moving piston but not invisible bedrock.\nBlock data.\nThe moving piston has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.\nSounds.\nGeneric.\n (piston):\n (arm):\nData values.\nBlock states.\nThe codice_1 and codice_2 blocks use following block states:\nBlock data.\n, a piston has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block."}

Oak trees sparsely generate, making wood scarce should one not want to tear down village houses or battle &lt;a href=\"pillager\"&gt;pillager&lt;/a&gt;s in outpost for wood. Additionally, the amounts of grass can prove to be a nuisance when building a shelter or &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;ing.

The sunflowers make for a good source of yellow dye and a makeshift compass, as they always face east. The &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spawning\"&gt;spawning&lt;/a&gt; is otherwise no different from the regular plains. \nSunflower plains are most commonly bordered by regular plains or &lt;a href=\"cherry%20grove\"&gt;cherry grove&lt;/a&gt;s, and separated from &lt;a href=\"flower%20forest\"&gt;flower forest&lt;/a&gt;s by rivers.\n, villages and outposts still generate here, but in \"Java Edition\" they don't.&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nHistory.\nBefore alpha 1.2.0, flatter areas similar to plains existed within \"plains\" landforms, which were randomly generated across the world as true biomes did not exist yet.

The nine default player skins are known as Steve, Alex, Noor, Sunny, Ari, Zuri, Makena, Kai, and Efe with all unchanged skins being split between these nine skins.\nAppearance.\nThere are nine default player &lt;a href=\"skin\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;s, known as Steve, Alex, Noor, Sunny, Ari, Zuri, Makena, Kai, and Efe, assigned to each player based on their account ID if they do not use a custom skin.\n Steve:\n Alex:\n Noor:\n Sunny:\n Ari:\n Zuri:\n Makena:\n Kai:\n Efe:\nThe player's skin can be changed. The nine default skins also have \"classic\" and \"slim\" shapes.\nThe player's appearance is commonly obscured by equipped &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"turtle%20shell\"&gt;turtle shell&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as other equipable items such as &lt;a href=\"elytra\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"carved%20pumpkin\"&gt;carved pumpkin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"head\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt;s. Players are also the only entity capable of having &lt;a href=\"cape\"&gt;cape&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as deadmau5 ears, depending on the account.\n, if shot with an &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; or stung by a &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;, the arrow/stinger will appear physically embedded inside of the player for a given time. These do not apply to other mobs.\nUnlike their \"Java Edition\" counterparts, &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition\"&gt;Bedrock Edition&lt;/a&gt; players periodically blink; this feature does not apply to custom skin models.\nDifferences between editions.\nJava Edition.\n, the player can choose from Steve, Alex, Ari, Efe, Kai, Makena, Noor, Sunny, or Zuri. These nine models can be customized by downloading free skins from trusted websites or by using an editing program, but in the &lt;a href=\"Demo%20mode\"&gt;demo&lt;/a&gt; or when playing offline, the game randomly chooses any of the nine skins as the current skin.\nBedrock Edition.\n, the player can choose between Steve, Alex, Ari, Efe, Kai, Makena, Noor, Sunny, or Zuri in-game, which sets both the skin and the model for custom skins. However, Bedrock Edition also allows the usage of &lt;a href=\"skin%20packs\"&gt;skin packs&lt;/a&gt;, each of which has a selection of free skins. On Windows and mobile devices, skins can also be imported from a PNG file. Some skins can be purchased as DLC. Bedrock Edition also features &lt;a href=\"Character%20creator\"&gt;a skin creation system&lt;/a&gt; with purchasable apparel and features. \"Java Edition\" versions of the nine skins are automatically available for free in Bedrock Edition.\nReach.\nA player has two kinds of reach. The area forms a three-dimensional cylinder because it encompasses vertical and horizontal distances:\nHealth and hunger meters.\nThe player has 10 full hearts or 20 health points. One full heart represents two &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health points&lt;/a&gt;. When the player's &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar is at or higher, health slowly regenerates by every four seconds, but when it is at with saturation remaining, health regenerates by every half second. The hunger bar depletes faster from energy-intensive activities like &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jumping\"&gt;jumping&lt;/a&gt;, attacking &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be refilled by eating &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;. If the hunger bar is at or lower, the player does not regenerate health unless in Peaceful &lt;a href=\"difficulty\"&gt;difficulty&lt;/a&gt; (or under the effect of certain &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;s). While the hunger bar is at , the player is starving and proceeds to lose health. On Hard difficulty, starvation kills the player. On Normal difficulty, it brings health down to . On Easy difficulty, it brings health down to . On Peaceful difficulty, the health bar recovers regardless of hunger, but still depletes from starvation damage, and the hunger bar does not lose any points even when under the effect of hunger.\nRespawn immunity.\nThe player does not take damage for 60 game ticks (3 seconds) upon respawning from death.\nMovement.\nThere isn't a simple hard-coded maximum velocity for walking, sprinting, etc. The maximum is a result of a base acceleration countered by \"friction\" or air resistance. The base acceleration for walking is 0.098, and sprinting is 30% faster than that. Velocity is increased by this acceleration value every tick (1/20th of a second), then the player is moved by the resulting velocity, then the velocity is multiplied by the friction value of the block they are walking on. For most blocks, the friction value is 0.546. As the player walks forward, each tick their velocity goes +0.098, *0.546, +.098, *0.546, +0.098, and so on. The result is that eventually, the 0.546 multiplier counteracts the 0.098 increase, so the player doesn't go any faster. The formula for this \"terminal velocity\" is a/(1-r), where a is the acceleration, and r is the block's friction. 0.098/(1-0.546) \u2248 0.2159 meters/tick = 4.317 meters/second. Sprinting is 30% faster than that; About 5.612 meters/second. Flying is similar, but the base acceleration is 0.49 and the \"friction\" is 0.91, which comes out to ~10.89 m/s.\nThe player walks at a nominal rate of 4.317 meters (blocks) per second. That's about 15.5 kph or 9.7 mph, which is a 3:51 kilometer or a 6:12 mile. This means that the player can walk a total of 5181 blocks (5.2 km) in one &lt;a href=\"Daylight%20cycle\"&gt;\"Minecraft\" day&lt;/a&gt;, if walking in a straight line, ignoring hunger, and not sprinting or sneaking. For sneaking and sprinting statistics, see below.\nSprinting.\nThe player can &lt;a href=\"sprint\"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;, draining the hunger bar considerably while doing so. The player sprints approximately 5.612 blocks per second, as opposed to the regular pace of 4.317. That's 20.2 kph or 12.6 mph, which is a 2:58 km or a 4:46 mile. The player can usually jump four blocks horizontally when sprinting, although they can jump five blocks with a correctly timed jump and enough momentum. The swiftness &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt; increases momentum. The player cannot sprint if the hunger bar is at or less. Sprinting is activated by double-tapping the forward key (default ), then holding it, or by holding the sprint key ( [ if using a Mac] by default) while pressing the forward key. Holding the sprint key in &lt;a href=\"Creative%20mode\"&gt;Creative mode&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"flying\"&gt;flying&lt;/a&gt; causes the player to fly faster.\nSneaking.\n&lt;a href=\"Sneaking\"&gt;Sneaking&lt;/a&gt; is a feature activated by pressing and holding the sneak key (default is ). Sneaking prevents players from falling more than half a block, making it highly useful for building horizontally outward over space. Going past the edge of a block and stopping sneaking does not result in falling off that block. The player can still dismount blocks while sneaking by jumping over the block's edge. In &lt;a href=\"Multiplayer\"&gt;Multiplayer Mode&lt;/a&gt;, a player's name tag will be grayed out in \"Java Edition\" or completely disappears in Bedrock Edition when they sneak, to relate to the fact that sneaking will make them harder to see.\nJumping.\nThe maximum height a player can &lt;a href=\"Jumping\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt; without the &lt;a href=\"jump%20boost\"&gt;jump boost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"effect\"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt; is about 1.2522 blocks ( blocks) in Java Edition. The jump height on Bedrock Edition is shorter because the game uses an outdated, pre-&lt;a href=\"Combat%20Update\"&gt;Combat Update&lt;/a&gt; value of 1.1875 ( blocks).\nSwimming.\n&lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;Swimming&lt;/a&gt; occurs when the player is sprinting (by double pressing W or pressing Ctrl/Cmd) while the player is submerged underwater. Swimming has the same animation as crawling.\nCrawling.\nCrawling occurs when the player is in an area less than 1.5 blocks high and prevents suffocation. Crawling will also work in Bedrock Edition if the player goes from swimming into a one-block-high area straight after exiting the water.\nGameplay HUD.\nThe onscreen &lt;a href=\"heads-up%20display\"&gt;heads-up display&lt;/a&gt; (HUD) consists of the player's &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bar, &lt;a href=\"hunger\"&gt;hunger&lt;/a&gt; bar, &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; bar, and &lt;a href=\"hotbar\"&gt;hotbar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; rating bar appears above the health bar if the player is wearing armor and the oxygen bar appears if the player is submerged in &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; or is suffocating in a block. The HUD also contains the crosshair and a held object or fist. The HUD can also be toggled by .\nAs mentioned in the Gamemodes section, if the player is in Creative mode the health, hunger, and experience bars including armor rating and oxygen bubbles are hidden and only the hotbar is visible. Despite this, the player can still collect experience, wear armor, and will still display the screen tilting animation when dying from /kill or the void. In Spectator mode even the hotbar, crosshair, and held object/fist are hidden and the hotbar only appears as a player spectating list when a number is pressed or the mouse is scrolled.\nExperience.\nExperience points (XP) can be gained via &lt;a href=\"experience%20orbs\"&gt;experience orbs&lt;/a&gt; when killing mobs or mining certain minerals. The current level is indicated by a green number above the HUD, and the experience points can be used to enchant weapons, tools, or armor with different useful attributes and skills (see &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20table\"&gt;enchanting table&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;s require experience to use.\nThe level increases by obtaining enough experience points. All levels and points are lost upon death but can be partially restored by picking up the experience orbs at the place of death.\nExperience is also obtained through activities such as &lt;a href=\"Breaking\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, mob &lt;a href=\"breeding\"&gt;breeding&lt;/a&gt;, killing certain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"trading\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsername.\nPlayers in-game are referred to by a username. These are used to target the player with &lt;a href=\"commands\"&gt;commands&lt;/a&gt; and differentiate other players. \n, usernames must be 3\u201316 characters, although there are exceptions for players with under 3 characters, who bought the game early in its development. There are four people who have done this, their usernames being \"G\", \"F\", \"X\", and \"8\". Players can change their username no more than once every 30 days. When the player changes their username, the previous username is available for other users to claim after 37 days. Because players can change usernames every 30 days, a player can manage two usernames without anyone being able to take either of them. If the player has a username under 3 characters and changes it, the old sub-3-character username is permanently unable to be obtained again. This also applies for symbol names. The username can be changed on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//minecraft.net/profile\"&gt;preferences page&lt;/a&gt; of minecraft.net.\n, usernames chosen in-game must be 3\u201332 characters. Users can choose a username and change it unlimited times from Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Profile. Alternatively, users that sign in with a will have the username set to match their . Gamertags can be modified on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//social.xbox.com/changegamertag\"&gt;Choose your new gamertag page&lt;/a&gt; of xbox.com for a fee of 9.99 except if changing from the gamertag generated upon account creation.\nPlayer names appear above their head as nameplates, typically in white letters within a dark transparent rectangle. Player nameplates can also be seen through solid blocks and other obstructions, although a player can &lt;a href=\"sneak\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; to dim the nameplate's visibility when in sight, or hide it completely when out of sight or in Bedrock Edition.\nCustomization.\n, players can change skins on the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//minecraft.net/profile\"&gt;preferences page&lt;/a&gt; of minecraft.net or the \"&lt;a href=\"Minecraft%20Launcher\"&gt;Minecraft Launcher&lt;/a&gt;\" by uploading a PNG image file, which then replaces the default skin. Players also have the option to have three or four pixel-wide arms on the character model.\n, players can change their character's appearance from the Main menu or Pause menu -&gt; Character where 5 character slots are shown. Edit Character will open the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creator\"&gt;Character Creator&lt;/a&gt; where a skin, which synchronizes between signed-in devices, can be created by selecting pre-made components, altering their height, and selecting a slim or wide arm width. Players alternatively have the option to select from Classic skins within Skin packs obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; or, for the Windows 10, iOS/iPadOS, and Android versions of the game, import a PNG image file. Classic Skins will not synchronize between signed-in devices.&lt;br&gt;\nPlayers can also choose 6 &lt;a href=\"Emotes\"&gt;Emotes&lt;/a&gt; per character slot and select or remove a cape.\nSounds.\nPlayers use the Players sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\nData values.\nEntity data.\nPlayers have entity data associated with them that contain various properties."}

The format is also used within &lt;a href=\"level.dat\"&gt;level.dat&lt;/a&gt; files to store the state of the &lt;a href=\"singleplayer\"&gt;singleplayer&lt;/a&gt; player, which overrides any &lt;player&gt;.dat files with the same name as the singleplayer player. These files are in &lt;a href=\"NBT%20format\"&gt;NBT format&lt;/a&gt;.\nItem structure.\nItems are used both in the player's inventory and Ender inventory, and in chest &lt;a href=\"Chunk%20format%23Block%20entity%20format\"&gt;tile entities&lt;/a&gt;, dropped item entities, furnace tile entities, brewing stand tile entities, and Villager trading recipes. Sometimes a Slot tag is used to specify the slot the item is in, such as with chests; other times there is no Slot tag, such as with dropped items.\nGeneral Tags.\nItems with durability can be made unbreakable and never lose any durability. Additionally, items can have specifications for Adventure mode to describe which blocks may be broken with them.\nAttribute Modifiers.\nAll items can be given &lt;a href=\"Attribute%23Modifiers\"&gt;Modifiers&lt;/a&gt; which affect various &lt;a href=\"Attribute\"&gt;Attribute&lt;/a&gt;s of the player or mob wearing or holding them. Note that if an item has default attribute modifiers, these cease to exist if this tag is added (e.g. a diamond sword given an empty AttributeModifiers list no longer provides a boost to damage). Also note that default attribute modifiers do not use this tag, and as such, it does not appear on a natural item.\nBlock Tags.\nBlocks can be given tags to specify what blocks they may be placed against in Adventure mode, and to specify what Tile Entity NBT tags to apply to them when placed.\nDisplay Properties.\n&lt;a href=\"Leather%20armor\"&gt;Leather armor&lt;/a&gt; can be colored, and all items can have custom display names and lore. Various tooltips can also be hidden.\nEnchantments.\nThere are two ways enchantments are associated with items; the first way is that the item is actually enchanted and the enchantment affects the behavior of the item, and the second way is that the item is an &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20book\"&gt;enchanted book&lt;/a&gt; which simply stores the enchantments without actually affecting the behavior of the item. There is also the RepairCost tag which tracks &lt;a href=\"anvil\"&gt;anvil&lt;/a&gt; usage for items, making them more costly with every use of the anvil.\nStoredEnchantments tooltips are not displayed if edited onto an item other than an enchanted book. Enchantments stored in Enchantments, however, are always displayed in the tooltip and cause the item to glow, even if they cannot have any effect.\nPotion Effects.\n&lt;a href=\"Potion\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"splash%20potion\"&gt;splash potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lingering%20potion\"&gt;lingering potion&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"tipped%20arrow\"&gt;tipped arrow&lt;/a&gt;s can have multiple, customized effects via the CustomPotionEffects tag. These effects are added to the default effect under the Potion tag if present. In addition the color can be overridden with the CustomPotionColor tag.\nArmor Trim.\nWhen armor is trimmed, it has the following NBT:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;\nArmor Stands, Spawn Eggs and Item Frames.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%20stand\"&gt;Armor stand&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spawn%20egg\"&gt;spawn egg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Item%20Frame\"&gt;item frames&lt;/a&gt; may contain potential entity data.\nBook and Quills.\n&lt;a href=\"Book%20and%20quill\"&gt;Book and quill&lt;/a&gt;s use NBT data to save their contents.\nWritten Books.\n&lt;a href=\"Written%20book\"&gt;Written book&lt;/a&gt;s use NBT data to save their contents as well as miscellaneous extra information.\nBuckets of Aquatic Mob.\n&lt;a href=\"Bucket%20of%20aquatic%20mob\"&gt;Buckets of aquatic mob&lt;/a&gt; may contain potential entity data.\nBundle.\n&lt;a href=\"Bundle\"&gt;Bundle&lt;/a&gt;s use NBT data to save what item is stored.\nCompasses.\nWhen used as a lodestone compass, &lt;a href=\"compass\"&gt;compass&lt;/a&gt;es store information about their targeted &lt;a href=\"lodestone\"&gt;lodestone&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrossbows.\n&lt;a href=\"Crossbow\"&gt;Crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s use NBT data to save what item is charged in the crossbow\nDebug Sticks.\n&lt;a href=\"Debug%20stick\"&gt;Debug stick&lt;/a&gt;s use the NBT to save the block state to edit for each block.\nFirework Rockets.\n&lt;a href=\"Firework%20rocket\"&gt;Firework rocket&lt;/a&gt;s use the tag tag to store information about their effects.\nFirework Stars.\n&lt;a href=\"Firework%20star\"&gt;Firework star&lt;/a&gt;s use the tag tag to store information about their effects.\nMaps.\n&lt;a href=\"Map\"&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt;s may be scaled.\nPlayer Heads.\n&lt;a href=\"Head\"&gt;Head&lt;/a&gt;s of the player variety can be associated with a specific username to take on the skin of that player when placed.

Upon the release of &lt;a href=\"Bedrock%20Edition%201.2.0\"&gt;Bedrock Edition 1.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the \"\"Pocket Edition\" subtitle was dropped and the edition was unofficially dubbed \"Bedrock Edition\"\".
