He and a Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; assassinated the guards of the town. He was killed by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; when he tried and failed to assassinate the archdruid. Sometime afterwards, he was resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; as a Forsaken and joined the &lt;a href=\"Warfront\"&gt;Horde war effort&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLorash claimed to have been born in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; during the exile of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;. During the winter in which the Highborne were trapped in the mountains, Lorash's father went out hunting despite the cold, losing two fingers to frostbite and eventually not returning at all. Lorash lived through centuries of warfare with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, during which he saw pieces of his childhood friends decorating Amani villages. Years later, during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, his mother was killed and raised into undeath. All the while, he grew to resent the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; for having exiled his kin and not coming to his people's aid.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; briefed Lorash and a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Rifen\"&gt;Rifen&lt;/a&gt; on the plan of attacking night elven outposts and patrols in Ashenvale. Lorash wasn't bothered by the idea of starting a war with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and was more concerned about what would be in it for him, with Saurfang assuring him that the rogues would be duly rewarded.\nLorash and Rifen proceeded to attack a group of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt; led by Commander &lt;a href=\"Anaris%20Windwood\"&gt;Anaris Windwood&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; arrived and told Anaris of rogue attacks throughout Ashenvale, Rifen seized the opportunity and dropped on Anaris from a treetop, killing her. The blood elf and Forsaken managed to kill six Sentinels before they were forced to retreat. While Lorash escaped, his partner was mortally wounded and captured.\nSome time later, Lorash encountered the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chikkers\"&gt;Chikkers&lt;/a&gt;, and they agreed to work together to dispatch the night elves. While perched on a tree branch, Lorash ambushed a group of night elf &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s moving through the treetops, using poisoned shurikens to kill two of them before running across the branches in the opposite direction, leading the druids away from the battle lines until he landed on a branch that was only capable of holding a single creature's weight. When four of the druids leaped to his branch, he stepped off and landed on the ground far below. Lorash, Chikkers, and the goblin's pet &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28crawler%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; were easily able to dispatch the druids that fell to the ground when the branch snapped under their weight. Moments later, the trio was forced to hide when &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself arrived to pay his respects to the fallen druids. Lorash considered attacking the archdruid, but Chikkers convinced him not to. After Stormrage left, Chikkers told Lorash that he would not risk helping him ambush Malfurion but agreed to back him up until then.\nLorash was determined to try and ambush Malfurion, despite Chikkers trying to talk him out of it. Eventually, Lorash was left on his own and attempted to ambush Malfurion, dropping on him from above with daggers drawn to separate his head from his neck. At the last moment, however, Malfurion stepped aside and immobilized Lorash in entangling roots, pinning him to the ground. The archdruid told the blood elf that the sin'dorei had no reason to aid in the invasion of Ashenvale, for the night elves and blood elves had once been kin and had fought together as recently as on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Lorash told Malfurion of his family's history until &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself suddenly arrived at the scene, distracting Malfurion. Lorash saw his opportunity and attempted to kill Stormrage by throwing his last two shurikens. However, Malfurion noticed his attempt and immediately caused the root around Lorash's neck to squeeze, crushing his throat. In his last moments, Lorash wondered if he would see his family on the other side.\nTides of Vengeance.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Lorash was resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; as a Forsaken. According to him, he accepted the gift of undeath quickly after being offered, and hopes he gets another chance to fight Malfurion, to return the favor of being decapitated. He is found in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nLorash relocated to the rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and stood guard outside a northern wall. After the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; retook the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he was seen sitting above the portal room.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nThe val'kyr hardly had to even offer before I was back on my feet. What else did you expect?\n&lt;Lorash considers for a moment.&gt;\nI do hope I'll get another chance to cut off Malfurion's head. See how HE likes it."}

He was the father of &lt;a href=\"Alexi%20Barov\"&gt;Alexi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weldon%20Barov\"&gt;Weldon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jandice%20Barov\"&gt;Jandice Barov&lt;/a&gt; and husband of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Illucia%20Barov\"&gt;Lady Illucia Barov&lt;/a&gt;. Like Jandice and Illucia, he is now an agent of the Scourge found in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexei Barov is one of the six bosses that must be defeated to summon &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;. He also guards &lt;a href=\"The%20Deed%20to%20Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;The Deed to Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAlexei Barov is no longer a boss. However, he appears in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Talking%20Skull\"&gt;Talking Skull&lt;/a&gt;, who asks adventurers to kill Darkmaster Gandling and cleanse the darkness that has taken hold of Scholomance. He reveals his &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Lord%20Alexei%20Barov\"&gt;true form&lt;/a&gt; upon Gandling's demise.\nAbilities.\nHe has a damaging &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; (Unholy Aura, deals 150 Shadow Damage per second to any nearby enemy) similar to the one &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; has. &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; are extremely helpful, if not imperative, to fight him. He also casts Immolate and Veil of Shadow, a curse that reduces healing effects on the target. It should be removed immediately if its on the tank.\nDuring the fight itself he has 2 guardian &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s with him. Don't even try pulling them separately, as the three are linked.\nIt is common when a party reaches these rooms for Alexei to be the first of the six bosses killed to summon Darkmaster Gandling. This fight is more difficult than that of any of the other bosses, or that of Gandling himself. Any party that can defeat Alexei is virtually guaranteed to be able to finish the instance.\nStrategy.\nBecause of Barov's Unholy Aura, it's important no matter what strategy used that he is tanked in a place where the Unholy Aura won't be damaging non-melee classes. One of the best places is at the bottom of the stairs in Gandling's Study; casters and hunters can do damage to Barov and heal &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; classes from near the door between the crypt and the study or the corners of the study. But tanking Barov in a corner of the crypt or even down where he originally stands will do.\nPriest and hunter.\nHave the priest stand on the right set of stairs while the hunter places a &lt;a href=\"Freeze%20Trap\"&gt;Freeze Trap&lt;/a&gt; right where the priest stands. The priest can then &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;shackle&lt;/a&gt; the LEFT mob. The undead guards are around the same speed as the boss so it is likely that the mob will get to the trap before Barov. The priest must then run a few steps back while the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;sunders&lt;/a&gt; Barov and everyone else does as much &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; on him as possible. If the mob will cool before Alex dies, have an offtank take a few hits while the rest of the group keeps attacking Barov. The priest will need to keep an eye on the shackled guard in case a reshackle is needed (which, for most groups, will be likely).\nAlternate for priest and hunter.\nHave the hunter and the tank stand on one of the stairs down to Barov, and the rest of the party at the other. Have the hunter start the encounter by firing on Barov; immediately after, have the priest shackle one guard and the tank rush the other. The hunter must now &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt; Barov upstairs and around the upper ring of Gandling's Study while the party defeats the unshackled guard, then the shackled one. After both are defeated, the hunter will bring Barov back downstairs (or simply &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;) where the tank engages Barov in the lower level of the study. After 5 sunders, melee DPS will need to move in while the hunter and casters stay out of Barov's AoE; if possible have the tank engage Barov hold at the bottom of the stairs while casters stay in Barov's original room or right at the doorway to the Study.\nMage and priest.\nStart the encounter with the priest shackling a guard. The mage will then need to &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; Barov. (Use level 1 frostbolts to cause minimal &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; but retain the &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt; effect \u2014 it's far more important at this point that the tank will be able to take Barov's aggro quickly than Barov being damaged.) The mage will then need to use frostbolt, &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; to kite Barov around the upper ring while the rest of the party defeats the unshackled guard. Unless the mage is doing really well with his health during the kiting, you will probably want to reshackle the guard and bring Barov downstairs immediately after the unshackled guard falls.\nPriest only.\nShackle one guard and make sure the &lt;a href=\"offtank\"&gt;offtank&lt;/a&gt; can take care of the other one while the rest of the party dpses Barov.\nHunter without a priest.\nHave the hunter send their pet to tank one of the adds and the main tank take the other add. At the same time the hunter hits Barov with a arcane shot and then runs with Aspect of Cheetah switched on. The hunter runs up the stairs and then kites Barov round the balcony. It is important to maintain maximum range otherwise the hunter takes damage from Barov's shadow aura. Once the adds are downed the hunter jumps back down and enters the room again the tank picking up Barov on his return. It is important that Barov is held well into the room otherwise you may risk immediately aggroing Gandling when Barov dies, if he's the last of the 6 bosses before Gandling.\nMage kiting.\nIf you have a frost mage with you, you can use this tactic. Have the main tank start the fight at the top of the stairs on the right side of Barov's room. You must start with a ranged attack. You will then start a blizzard on top of the stairs where the guards and Barov will be coming from. You should be standing in the entrance-way to the room. As soon as you have gained aggro on the guards, break your blizzard and move out into the main chamber. Proceed to kite the guards with your various frost spells. I find it easiest to go to the upper floor and to move around the edge of the room. If the guards are getting too close, simply jump down the lower floor, and hit them as they come around and down the stairs. This should allow enough time for the other players to take out Alexei and then you can either drag the guards back inside, or the party can move out to you. This one takes a bit of practice, but once mastered, can be highly effective. Alternatively, the mage can pull Alexei to begin with, and pull him around the upper floor. Provided judicial use of Blink and a barrier spell, and Major Health Potions, a reasonably geared mage can survive until the rest of the party have dispensed with the other two guards, and can come to the mage's aid. It is likely that you will need to be healed at some point - depending on how fast the two guards can be killed - so build aggro against Alexei with the odd instant cast. A priest's Shadow resistance buff is extremely useful to this strategy, due to the fact that Alexei's damage buff can be partially resisted.\nPaladin Fear.\nIf you have a paladin in the group you can have him cast Turn Undead on one of the adds and they very rarely leave the room. When the Turn Undead wears off the paladin will then be able to recast fairly soon and keep the add out of the battle until Alexei has been brought down. **NOTE: If there is a priest in the group the other add can be shackled to be out of the fight as well.\nRetribution Paladins.\nIf you have a Retribution Paladin in the group, have instead of the tank calling out the adds, follow this strategy, first to cast repentance on the add causing it to be incapacitated for a minute so long as no one hits it, and cast Turn undead on the other add thus freeing you and the group to take out Alexei quickly. Repentance lasts only a minute the same amount of time it takes to recharge the spell, this strategy will allow the group to only fight Alexei and later get rid of the adds once they've taken care of Alexei, this strategy also works very well as a solo strategy.\nDruid kiting.\nIf you have a druid available to kite, you can start off with the druid using a combination of starfire-moonfire on Alexei to obtain aggro. The two guards are picked off by the party, while the druid shifts to Cat form and uses Dash to kite Alexei away from the group, occasionally using Faerie Fire(Feral) if the druid has it available. Once Dash wears out, the druid can shift to bear form and continue to keep Alexei occupied, either by running or offtanking. Once the party gives the \"All clear\" shout, use Bash on Alexei to gain some distance and run him back to the party.(Strategy by Xenigma, Stonemaul server)\nHunter kiting.\nThe hunter drops an ice trap at the top of one set of stairs, where the rest of the party begins. The hunter pulls Alexei, two of the remaining party members tag the guards. The hunter kites Alexei around the top of the study, or better, to Ras Frostwhisper's chamber if it has been cleared ahead of time. One of the guards will freeze, kill the other. Typically, even in low dps groups the second guard has fallen by the time Alexei reaches Ras's room, giving plenty of time to mana up, bandage, and heal before he returns. If not, the hunter can allow Alexei to approach, feign, then pop up, run back with him, and tag him again in Gandling's Study, rekiting him over and over again until the party is ready. I prefer to kite to Ras's room because of the corners in Gandling's Study. With a weak or lower leveled group, every health point will count when killing this guy because of the aura. You can avoid that almost entirely on the Ras kite. Once the guards are down and the party is ready, let him return after a feign and kill him. It's helpful to mark the farther guard with a skull and tag the closer guard first to ensure that it is the one that freezes and that the ice trap isn't broken.\nLoot.\nAlexei Barov has a chance to drop one of the following items.\nIn Hearthstone.\nAlexei's living form appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"\"Alexei Barov stayed at Scholomance despite leasing it to Kel\u2019Thuzad. He says it\u2019s for \"supervision.\"\"\""}

Chosen by Odyn, the strongest vrykul have their spirits lifted to the Halls by the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, where they fight eternal, shiny and gold. The Valarjar can be given either mighty, golden Stormforged bodies, or become Val'kyr themselves with power over life and death.\nThis army was originally created as an equivalent to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, who Odyn judged unworthy for the task of protecting &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, until the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; cursed the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; and his army to be trapped within the Halls for ages. During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the spell that kept them imprisoned was lifted with Helya's recent death, freeing Odyn and his golden warriors for good. From a section of the Halls named &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;, which served as their &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt;, the Valarjar fought alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt; under the lead of the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Battlelord&lt;/a&gt;, the champion of the All-Father.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers, the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; follows the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, with the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"shieldmaiden\"&gt;shieldmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s in his army being referred to as warriors of the Light.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; equivalent to the Valarjar, loyal to &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nServing as Prime Designate over a relatively young &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan%20keeper\"&gt;titan keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; often walked the world disguised as a variety of beings, in order to observe his charge. In particular, Odyn would be drawn to the mighty &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, whom he admired for their courage and tenacity. Much of the time, Odyn would mingle among the vrykul. After witnessing their battle with the serpent &lt;a href=\"Ysildar\"&gt;Ysildar&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn became further sure of his view that they were a fearless race gifted with nobility and valor. When the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Titan Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; chose to empower the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; as Azeroth's principal defenders, Odyn was angered by the decision, instead believing the vrykul to be a more worthy choice.\nDespite Odyn's protests, the Dragon Aspects were given their duty. Odyn broke from his keeper brethren and decided to empower his own guardians in the form of the vrykul. The &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20Watcher\"&gt;Titanic Watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; raised a section of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; into the skies, transforming it into a new seat of power known as the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, which he intended to populate with a new army of warriors. Odyn proclaimed to all vrykul that the most worthy individuals to fall in combat would be reborn as Valarjar and guardians of the world.\nIn order to deliver the spirits of his chosen dead from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, he sought to create winged harbingers known as &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, who would be capable of crossing the boundaries of life and death. Helya protested against the turning of her fellow &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; into Val'kyr and threatened to bring the Halls of Valor back down on Azeroth. Odyn turned on her and transformed her into the first of the Val'kyr. For ages, Helya and the other Val'kyr brought the souls of the valiant dead to the Halls of Valor, where they were trained by Odyn himself.\nThough all had gone according to Odyn's design, Helya would forever resent her forced servitude. Eventually, at the urging of the corrupted Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, she used her power to seal the Halls of Valor, preventing Odyn or the Valarjar from accessing the outside world. The imprisonment of the Valarjar within their own fortress would last for thousands of years, as Helya herself began to take charge of vrykul souls from her new realm of &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThough Odyn and the Valarjar remained largely confined to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; for millennia, many heroic vrykul souls chosen by Odyn continued to be collected by his Val'kyr and taken to the floating fortress. Odyn himself was also still able to roam the outside world as an observer, favoring a disguise as the sage &lt;a href=\"Havi\"&gt;Havi&lt;/a&gt;. Among the vrykul of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; in particular, the legend of the Valarjar remained quite alive and widespread, and many sought a worthy death in combat to join Odyn's elite.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn and the Valarjar remained locked within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, which orbited high above the land. Odyn would take interest in the arrival of mortal forces to battle the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s', observing their initial &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;setback&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he would pick a specific mortal &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; to act as his new champion, granting them overall command of the Valarjar themselves. This warrior, who became known as the Battlelord, was saved from death while fighting the Legion, and though taken to the Halls of Valor at Odyn's behest, was freely able to leave the complex at will.\nEager to join in the war against the demonic invaders, Odyn would use the Battlelord as his tool in directing the Valarjar. An area of the Halls known as &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; became an &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt; for the many mortal warriors involved in the war, and the resources of the Valarjar were once more used against the enemies of Azeroth. Odyn would also aid the Battlelord in acquiring one of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; in existence to better fight the Legion. Using the &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20Map\"&gt;Eye of Odyn&lt;/a&gt; to see events across the Broken Isles and beyond, the Valarjar now began to wage a limited war against the Burning Legion, striking in key areas. At the same time, the Battlelord continued their own campaign. In &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, the small encampment &lt;a href=\"Valdisdall\"&gt;Valdisdall&lt;/a&gt; was inhabited by Valarjar vrykul loyal to Odyn, and served as a base for much of their operations against the Burning Legion and the Helarjar.\nThough Odyn influenced events in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; when it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt; and demons, the Valarjar were unable to play an active role. However, mortal &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; would eventually travel into the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; itself to pursue &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. There, Odyn determined to test these champions and set the Valarjar and other denizens of the Halls to besting them. The mortals would succeed in facing down all the challenges the Valarjar could pose, confronting and defeating both the God-King and Odyn himself, and thus securing the Aegis.\nLater, Odyn would discover that Helya had developed a way of turning even the souls of Stormforged Valarjar into her twisted &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. Outraged, he would rally a force of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; and, having tested them himself personally, he sent them into &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of vanquishing Helya. They would battle through waves of the Sea-Witch's minions, before confronting her. After a desperate fight, they were successful in killing Helya, and in doing so freed Odyn and the Valarjar from their millennia-long containment.\nAfter finally slaying Helya, the Valarjar would also recover her &lt;a href=\"Helya%27s%20Horn\"&gt;horn&lt;/a&gt;, capable of commanding the legions of kvaldir. Though unredeemable, Odyn hoped to put the kvaldir to good use, and had the Battlelord use the horn to direct them against key Legion targets around the Broken Isles.\nClass Campaign.\nOver time, more preparations were made to ready the Valarjar for the coming war. The Battlelord would recruit &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Hjalmar%20Stahlstrom\"&gt;Captain Hjalmar Stahlstrom&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the training of new &lt;a href=\"Valarjar%20Aspirants\"&gt;Aspirants&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Einar%20the%20Runecaster\"&gt;Einar the Runecaster&lt;/a&gt; was brought on board to expand the powers of Skyhold. With these advancements, the Valarjar would become significantly more disciplined and organized, taking on the form of a truly formidable army.\nIn order to further strengthen their forces, a plan was made to unite the titanforged &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; from ancient times. Set to accomplish this, the Battlelord departed on a quest to recover the &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt;, capable of summoning the Keepers. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt;, the artifact was tacked to the great worm &lt;a href=\"Jorhuttam\"&gt;Jorhuttam&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. The Valarjar marched on &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; seeking the beast, and would ultimately vanquish it in a fierce battle.\nBefore the Gjallarhorn was used, however, the Valarjar first continued to bolster the position in the fight against the Legion. In doing so, they gained the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Savyn%20Valorborn\"&gt;Savyn Valorborn&lt;/a&gt;. The Val'kyr would now rally the most worthy shieldmaidens in Odyn's name, adding greatly to the armies of Skyhold. At this time, Odyn would also turn his attention once more to &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, dispatching the Battlelord into the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt; to confront the Sea-Witch. Though she would survive the battle, Helya suffered a significant defeat at the hands of the Valarjar.\nNow content with their position, Odyn and the Valarjar used the Gjallarhorn to summon Ulduar's keepers. However, they were to discover that the titanic fortress had been overrun by the Burning Legion, with &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow guardians unable to leave. The Battlelord departed immediately with Valarjar in tow for Ulduar and cut their way through the demonic invaders to reach the keepers. Both Thorim and &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; would be rescued from the demons, though the latter ended up getting trapped through one of the invaders' portals to the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. After returning to Skyhold, Thorim pledged himself and the forces of Ulduar to the Valarjar, who now devised a plan to save Hodir.\nWith their armies prepared, the Valarjar launched an attack on the demonic gateway at &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to appropriate the portal to reach Niskara. Hymdall then opened the portal, allowing a large force led by the Battlelord to push into the demon world. As the other Valarjar battled the Legion across the ruined plane, Thorim and the Battlelord located Hodir and slew his captor &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ran%27zara\"&gt;Lady Ran'zara&lt;/a&gt;, freeing him from demonic influence.\nHaving achieved victory on Niskara, the Valarjar returned to Skyhold and were greeted by Odyn. Hodir would also pledge himself to the war against the demons, and Odyn rewarded his Battlelord with every more power for their &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapon. The Valarjar themselves would meanwhile continue the fight against the Legion alongside &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegionfall.\nThe war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; eventually began to see some success, and the demons responded by opening a massive new offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Representing the Valarjar, Odyn (as Havi) attended a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with the other orders, where they planned their next move. All would watch as the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; launched his new attack from the Tomb.\nA new faction was subsequently formed when the order halls united into the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. These orders now pooled their forces and waged war as one on the Broken Shore, based from &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;. The Valarjar themselves would also establish an outpost at &lt;a href=\"Aalgen%20Point\"&gt;Aalgen Point&lt;/a&gt; closer to the Tomb of Sargeras. Odyn and the Valarjar personally dealt with a remnant &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt; presence at &lt;a href=\"Felrage%20Strand\"&gt;Felrage Strand&lt;/a&gt;.\nA token Valarjar presence would also be sent to the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" during the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which the Battlelord would play a major role in.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Valdemar%20Stormseeker\"&gt;Valdemar Stormseeker&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn has heard about the Azerothian heroes' search for &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, and his vrykul forces have gathered what they could during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, several of Odyn's Val'kyr began to go missing, and even those sent to find them did not return. When an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; found and freed &lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to the Halls of Valor and revealed to Odyn that &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; was still alive and corrupting his Val'kyr into &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; with the eye that he gave up long ago, now the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurious, Odyn declared that this \"insult\" could not stand and ordered the heroes to create an instrument, the &lt;a href=\"Ilskahorn\"&gt;Ilskahorn&lt;/a&gt;, with which they would lure his Eye to battle, and to recruit a group of worthy Val'kyr to accompany Danica in battle. After the heroes and Val'kyr managed to defeat the Eye, and forced it to flee back to its master's side in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;, both Odyn and the Maw Walkers' allies rejoiced, emboldening their continued advance against &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers.\n\"The following fought as part of the Valarjar during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but are not members of the faction.\"\nReputation.\nFaction description.\n\"These are the chosen warriors of &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, sworn to his service in life and death.\""}

Danath requested that they join him at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, as he had an important mission that required their expertise. As the warrior hero arrived, Danath told them to look upon the terrible sight before them, and rhetorically asked how many disasters must they face before they could at last find peace. He was relieved that the warrior adventurer had survived the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; when so many brave heroes were lost. He hung his head in a moment of silence, before explaining that he had been recalled from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to aid the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in its darkest hour. It was crucial that they learned from their mistakes, he claimed.\nIf he was to assist in this war, he needed firsthand information, Danath said. He would fly to the Broken Shore and see the battlefield for himself. The warrior's record as a proven &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; was unquestioned, and they were there during the battle. Danath could use their insight, so he asked them if they would accompany him to the Broken Shore. Danath didn't anticipate engaging the enemy, but that close to the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, one could never be sure he claimed. As they rode elite &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s above the Broken Shore, a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; siege weapons bombarded the two warriors. Danath ordered evasive maneuvers, but his gryphon was hit and caught on fire. As he fell towards the ocean, Danath told the warrior hero to get out of there, and that he would find a way.\n Horde\nA warrior adventurer freshly arrived in Dalaran was intercepted by the orc &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; who had important concerns about &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. Eitrigg explained that Saurfang was not the same since their loss at the\u00a0Broken Shore. Though he led well and slew many, he had taken their defeat hard. Fearing that Saurfang was determined to return to the Broken Shore, and that he would bring doom upon himself, Eitrigg asked the warrior hero if they could speak to him. The warrior hero accepted, and Eitrigg went to seek out &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and see if he could help too.\nAs the warrior hero arrived to Krasus' Landing, Saurfang knew that they were sent by Eitrigg, whose concerns he called noble, but unnecessary. Saurfang admitted that the recent events weighed heavily on him. He felt like he needed to do something, and explained that he could find no glory in the battle for the Broken Shore, that too many died but he did not. The anger within him was growing every minute that he stared at the storm. Saurfang claimed that he would return to the Broken Shore, for those under his command, and that he would kill demons until their glory was found and his honor restored. He told the warrior hero not to counsel against this, as he was set in his ways. The hero answered that they would then go with him, because no one should fight alone. Saurfang said that death was their likely end on those shores. The warrior knew this, yet Saurfang could see the determination in their eyes. Perhaps they had honor to regain there as well, he thought.\nSaurfang told the warrior hero that they should not worry, that he was not chasing his own death. He told them that they would fly in and scout the ideal point of attack. The demons were still drunk on their victory, but Saurfang and the hero would put a swift end to their revelry, and bring honor to their dead. Saurfang gave the hero his spare mount, &lt;a href=\"Makka\"&gt;Makka&lt;/a&gt;, and together they flew to the Broken Shore. Saurfang analyzed the island from above and was deciding on an appropriate target (such as the soul engine or the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;) when a group of Legion siege weapons bombarded the two warriors. He told the hero to fly low and dodge the blasts, but his mount was hit and caught on fire. As he fell towards the ocean, Saurfang ordered the warrior to make them pay.\nOne last stand.\nUnfortunately, the warrior hero's mount was hit too, causing them to fall onto the shore, where a group of aspiring &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; warriors who were fighting against &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The vrykul didn't seem hostile, and the warrior hero could hear their leader, &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald%20Drakeborn\"&gt;Ragnvald Drakeborn&lt;/a&gt;, telling the warband to shrug off their wounds, for another battle awaited. As the hero approached the vrykul, they surprised &lt;a href=\"Finna%20Bjornsdottir\"&gt;Finna Bjornsdottir&lt;/a&gt;, who said that &lt;a href=\"Havi\"&gt;Havi&lt;/a&gt; didn't mention that reinforcements would be so \"short\". Ragnvald replied that the old seer was mad, but rarely wrong. He told the hero to join them and prove their valor as more demons approached. The warriors successfully repelled the demons led by &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lord%20Dakuur\"&gt;Fel Lord Dakuur&lt;/a&gt;, one of the demons summoned before the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; by . As the calm settled, a golden &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt; descended upon the battlefield to collect the souls of the worthy. The warrior hero watched the ritual as the Reclaimer lifted the spirits of &lt;a href=\"Haardgrim\"&gt;Haardgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alrik%20the%20Slayer\"&gt;Alrik the Slayer&lt;/a&gt;, telling them that &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; had judged them worthy for his &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls&lt;/a&gt;, and that they would come with her to glory. As the three flew towards the skies, Ragnvald told them to watch over him from above, and to save him a seat in the great Halls.\nDemonic reinforcements led by the &lt;a href=\"mo%27arg\"&gt;mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; brute &lt;a href=\"Bezzeredes\"&gt;Bezzeredes&lt;/a&gt; arrived, but as they were defeated by the warband, the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malgalor\"&gt;Malgalor, Lord of Butchery&lt;/a&gt; set foot on the battlefield, killing all remaining &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, save for &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald%20Drakeborn\"&gt;Ragnvald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Finna%20Bjornsdottir\"&gt;Finna&lt;/a&gt; and the warrior hero. Ragnvald, reinvigorated by this challenge, was eager to meet the death Havi promised him. Finna on the other hand claimed that killing the demon could be a better idea. Ragnvald replied that together, they may yet indeed be victorious. Either way, he would not go down easily.\nThe battle was terrible, and Finna was the first to fall. Ragnvald would follow eventually, leaving the warrior hero as the last man standing. Malgalor could not understand how they could resist. Feeling death approaching, he cast &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Rupture\"&gt;Fel Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, killing himself and taking the warrior hero with him. Danica the Reclaimer had noticed this valorous sacrifice, and descended again to whisk the warrior away.\nSkyhold.\nThe hero awoke on a golden floor, with Danica standing before them. She welcomed them to &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;, where she claimed that the brave lived on forever. She reassured them and told them that they were not dead, as Denica had indeed been directed to collect them before their demise by Odyn himself. She then took the hero to Odyn, giving them a tour of the facility first. She showed them the Eye of Odyn, which sees all on Azeroth, as well as the Forge of Odyn, where the mightiest weapons of the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; are crafted by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Master%20Smith%20Helgar\"&gt;Master Smith Helgar&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest smith in the Halls of Valor. Across the way lied the Arena of Glory, where warriors vied for supremacy in epic combat. Finally, they went through the Great Mead Hall where drink and stories flow freely. Denica went ahead and announced the hero to Odyn, and told them to be respectful. As the hero arrived, Odyn stood up. He said that he had foreseen the coming of a mighty champion to these shores. One who would slay countless foes and prove their valor time and again. One who would lead his armies to victory against the great darkness that sought to devour the world. The hero had proven themselves the greatest living warrior on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It is for this reason that Odyn saved them.\u00a0He proclaimed:\nAs the greatest warrior in these Halls, the hero required a great weapon to do both their will and Odyn's, he said. The &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; had looked down on Azeroth and found &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt; worthy of their hands. He left it to the hero to choose which one they wished to seek out and wield against the Legion. They would recover the others in time. The hero made their choice, but Odyn knew which one they would choose.\nPreparations.\nThe new weapon the hero had acquired was very powerful, but Odyn said that his smiths had mastered crafting over thousands of years. He told the hero to speak to Master Smith Helgar and see what improvements could be made. Helgar was amazed by the craft; the artifact was mighty, and he could already see the potential that they could unlock. He showed the hero the mighty Forge of Odyn, which had been working for longer than the hero's race had existed. Their weapon was powerful, and it would take Odyn's personal Forge in order to work it. Helgar believed they could work the artifact to provide various improvements, provided the hero had enough experience with it. The artifact had much unused potential, and the hero would return there often as they got more acquainted with it.\nDanica the Reclaimer told the warrior hero that it was time to begin the war for Azeroth. They had prepared a tool for them called the Eye of Odyn, a powerful scrying and communication device. With it they would be able to see the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, direct and send orders to their champions, and enact their own special operations from Skyhold. The Val'kyr took them to &lt;a href=\"Skyseer%20Ghrent\"&gt;Skyseer Ghrent&lt;/a&gt;, who would help them manage the Eye, and for whom it had been a while since he had talked to the living. Being slain in combat had given him a calmer outlook in this emergency than other warriors.\nGhrent explained to the hero that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; thought they were dead. Punishing them for that assumption would be quite the surprise. He said that the Eye allowed the Valarjar to see all across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and assign warriors to various tasks. He told them to take a look at the Eye, and then choose their first area of operation. Ghrent had already picked out the best spots. As more opportunities arose, he would bring them to the hero's attention. The warrior hero thus descended on the Broken Isles and went on to accomplish their tasks.\nOdyn's summon.\nSometime later, while traveling the streets of Dalaran, the hero met Danica the Reclaimer, bearing an important message for them. The Val'kyr told them that Odyn would like to speak to them at once. He was convinced that as they had grown in power, they were ready to take direct command of his armies, and would like to begin preparations. He awaited their arrival, and his forces stood at the ready. The warrior returned to Odyn, who was glad to see them: as he predicted, they had grown in power and continued to prove their worth. He told them that they would soon command one of the greatest armies in existence, but before his own\u00a0Valarjar\u00a0followed their every command, they had to prove their ability to lead. The hero was to speak to the two &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; champions who ascended into these &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls&lt;/a&gt; with them, and tell them it was time for the hero to assume their duties as &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s chosen.\nFinna Bjornsdottir said that they would gladly follow, as she had seen what they were capable of and that they had no fear of death. Ragnvald Drakeborn understood that the hero was put in charge, and he found it generally unwise to question the gods: Odyn said that the hero would lead, so they would lead. As the hero was now ready to command the Valarjar, they went to Skyseer Ghrent., who explained that the souls that made it to these\u00a0Halls\u00a0were brave, that this was why they were there after all. But valor alone did not make for an effective army. The hero would need someone who could train those who would be\u00a0Valarjar to fight with discipline. Ghrent told them to have their champions send word to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Hjalmar%20Stahlstrom\"&gt;Captain Hjalmar Stahlstrom&lt;/a&gt;. Unruly &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; berserkers may not fear death, but they would fear Hjalmar Stahlstrom enough to make them follow the hero's orders. Ragnvald was thus sent to find Stahlstrom, one of the greatest vrykul captains, who would train a combat-ready force for the Valarjar.\nReady for war.\nAs they returned to &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;, Ghrent told the hero to speak to Stahlstrom and see that the Valarjar were armed and ready for battle, which was necessary to win a full-fledged war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The captain immediately started to recruit &lt;a href=\"Valarjar%20Aspirants\"&gt;Valarjar Aspirants&lt;/a&gt;. Their enemies' transgressions had gone unchecked for long enough. It was time for the Valarjar champions to deal with them, backed up with the newly recruited troops. Ghrent informed the hero that one of their own had been taken prisoner by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s sworn nemesis, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. If their forces managed to bring back &lt;a href=\"Einar%20the%20Runecaster\"&gt;Einar the Runecaster&lt;/a&gt; alive, he could aid them in using powerful runes to advance the power of their armies.\nAs the Runecaster was successfully rescued, Ghrent told the hero that being a leader was not just about sending troops to combat. They would also make decisions about how they would train and how to improve their armies. The hero thus spoke to Einar the Runecaster and let him know how they would like development to progress, and what improvements and upgrades to bring to &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gjallarhorn.\nGhrent then told a story to the hero, that once, the mighty titanforged &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; acted as one. Ever since Odyn broke off to create the Valarjar, not even Odyn's own son &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; was bound to follow his father's advice. There was however one hope to unite the forces of &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt; was a gift given to &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; before Odyn's departure. The keepers of Ulduar are oathbound to answer the call of the Gjallarhorn were it to be sounded as it would signal that the end times were near.\nThe hero went to discuss this with Hymdall, who told them that they had proven themselves most thoroughly time and again. There could be no doubt that they were the one to lead &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s armies into the final battle. They however had to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt; so that they may signal to their allies that the end times were upon them. He explained that &lt;a href=\"Svergan%20Stormcloak\"&gt;King Svergan Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; was the last known living guardian of the Horn, and that they should thus seek his spirit in the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Fallen%20Kings\"&gt;Field of Fallen Kings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horn's guardian.\nThe spirit of &lt;a href=\"Svergan%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; explained that safeguarding the &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt; was his duty. He would do what was right, but first he had to ask for the hero's aid. His family was disavowed by the mystics of his time, and his grave was ransacked. He could not find peace while his family heirlooms were in the hands of the servants of the false &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;. The hero thus searched the Runewood and killed traitor &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20King\"&gt;Crown of the Forgotten King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Signet\"&gt;Stormcloak Signet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drakerider%27s%20Medallion\"&gt;Drakerider's Medallion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bonespeaker mystics had used these heirlooms to tie Stormcloak's soul to this world, and under their curse, his spirit could not enter the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. But the fire that bound his soul through their foul magic would be the same fire that would undo this bond. The hero approached the soul pyre in &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt; and threw Stormcloak's belongings into the flames. His spirit appeared in front of them; he could feel their curse weakening. Mystics began to stream into the room in an attempt break the ritual but, stopped by the hero, the ritual completed, killing the remaining Bonespeakers in the process. The Bonespeakers couldn't deny Stormcloak his place in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; any longer, his soul was his own again.\nHe thanked the hero for doing this for him. Stormcloak had sworn an oath to protect the &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt; with his life, and so he did. He told the hero to tell &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; that his Gjallarhorn was consumed by the great worm, &lt;a href=\"Jorhuttam\"&gt;Jorhuttam&lt;/a&gt;. It devoured an entire army of Stormcloak's men who were swallowed whole, trying to fend off the beast. The hero thus went and told Hymdall, who said that they had to track the Great Worm at once, and that it would surely be a great battle. The Valarjar needed the &lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt; to compel the armies of Ulduar to join their cause. If the worm swallowed it, they would dig through the very earth until they found it in its entrails, said Hymdall. The hero thus sent champions of the Valarjar to track &lt;a href=\"Jorhuttam\"&gt;Jorhuttam&lt;/a&gt;. In the mean time, &lt;a href=\"Svergan%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Svergan Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; was brought back to life in the Halls of Valor. He lived again, and he was eager to fight once more.\nJorhuttam.\nThe Valarjar armies tracked the beast to the highest peak in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, where it was protected by hostile &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;. The traveled to &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; where they met the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jarum%20Skymane\"&gt;Jarum Skymane&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning that the hero was after the Great Worm, he told the hero that he knew these mountains inside and out and that if they helped him avenge his village, he would help them find Jorhuttam.\nJarum's village was razed by the &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20tribe\"&gt;Frostcrag tribe&lt;/a&gt; drogbar\u00a0who worshiped Jorhuttam. The hero agreed to help him avenge his village and slew the drogbar, including their very leader &lt;a href=\"Dorgrub%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Dorgrub the Cruel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Ugrul%20Skullcleaver\"&gt;Ugrul Skullcleaver&lt;/a&gt;. As the hero upheld their end of the deal, Jarum said he would do the same, and gave them &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Drums\"&gt;Frostcrag drums&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0which the drogbar banged on in order to summon Jorhuttam to feast. The hero found the Great Worm's feeding mound, and used the drums to lure her out. After a great battle, the beast was slain, and The Gjallarhorn recovered.\nDefending the Broken Isles.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; suggested to bolster their own forces before calling upon their &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; allies to join them in the final conflict against the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. There still remained much to do in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and victories there would give them the momentum they needed to crush the enemy.\nImportant tasks remained. The &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; were under attack by &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt; vrykul led by &lt;a href=\"Runemaster%20Skomjorn\"&gt;Runemaster Skomjorn&lt;/a&gt;, powerful armaments were lost when the great ship Vaesska sank in the sea of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;, and a group of mighty warriors loyal to Odyn was captured by &lt;a href=\"Sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giants&lt;/a&gt; and were being forced to fight in their underground pit in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; by Pitmaster Rudi. Champions of the Valarjar were sent to aid the Valkyra and crush those who had betrayed Odyn, kill &lt;a href=\"Wavemistress%20S%27revess\"&gt;Wavemistress S'revess&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Zithreenai\"&gt;Zithreenai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; forces and retrieve the armaments, and to free the enslaved warriors, respectively.\nFinally, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Savyn%20Valorborn\"&gt;Savyn Valorborn&lt;/a&gt; arrived to aid in bolstering the Valarjar's numbers. She ushered some of the most valorous\u00a0&lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0shieldmaidens into the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. She would rally the worthy in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s name.\nHelya's demise.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; was angered by Helya's madness. The Valarjar could not fight on two fronts and succeed. If they were to give themselves the room they needed to fight off the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0they had to deliver a decisive victory against\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. Not her armies, not her lieutenants, but the mother of the underworld herself. The hero was thus sent to the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Maw of Souls&lt;/a&gt; to finally put an end to her threat. It was a glorious victory, which Helya had unfortunately survived, but now she would think twice about moving against the Valarjar with the hero leading the armies of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hero had also recovered &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;'s blade from &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, and realized what a fierce combatant he would make, were he to fight on their side. They believed that Odyn could perhaps be persuaded to force the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0King's spirit to fight along their army. They thus told Odyn that King Ymiron had been defeated, and that he fought fiercely. Odyn said that was to be expected. Ymiron was a cruel and evil ruler, but he always did fight with great ferocity.\nAs the hero said that they wanted him to join their army, Odyn replied that this was absolutely out of the question. King Ymiron betrayed his people and doomed them to a cursed existence. He might have died while fighting valiantly but &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; abhorred him, and the feeling was mutual. The\u00a0hero agreed, but asked what better punishment could there be than to be forced to serve him for the rest of time. Odyn laughed a deep booming laugh. He said they were a devious one, and that they were right, that would amuse him. King Ymiron was thus brought back to life to serve in Odyn's army.\nUlduar's Oath.\nOdyn told the hero that he was once leader of all of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They were charged by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0themselves to protect the world. Once he gave up on the post of Prime Designate, he gave up any measure of influence over the other keepers. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0came from a time before their falling out, however. A time of an ancient oath of honor. Odyn wanted to invoke that oath, and he was certain Thorim would answer the call. &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; was thus told to blow the Horn.\nAn image of &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; appeared. In distress, he explained that though they were oathbound to answer the call of the Gjallarhorn, they could not. The halls of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; had been overrun by the armies of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They were fighting bravely but the &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;' numbers were endless. Odyn told Thorim to hold them off, for he would send champions to his aid.\nThe battle for Ulduar.\nThe hero ran to the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aerylia\"&gt;Aerylia&lt;/a&gt; and asked to be sent with any forces that were ready to Ulduar's aid. The Valarjar jumped from &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; and descended upon &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. They arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Antechamber\"&gt;Antechamber&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Finna%20Bjornsdottir\"&gt;Finna Bjornsdottir&lt;/a&gt; noted that Ulduar was completely overrun. It was time for battle. The hero, Finna, &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald%20Drakeborn\"&gt;Ragnvald Drakeborn&lt;/a&gt; and other Valarjar fought\u00a0their way through &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s that were attacking a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rune%20Sentinel\"&gt;Dark Rune Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Mender\"&gt;Iron dwarf mender&lt;/a&gt; who, glad to be found, joined and assised them as they made their way further in. After killing packs of &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;imps&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinel left to fight his own way, while the &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; headed to the entryway of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Walkway\"&gt;Shattered Walkway&lt;/a&gt; and began to fight a hateful &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;. The demon however stroke the Mender with a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; bolt, killing him.\nDvalen Ironrune.\nAs the Valarjar progressed, &lt;a href=\"Finna%20Bjornsdottir\"&gt;Finna&lt;/a&gt; noticed someone fighting fiercely ahead. &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald%20Drakeborn\"&gt;Ragnvald&lt;/a&gt; added that he appeared to be an iron dwarf, and was surprised that he was still alive. Finna came up to the dwarf and told them that they were quite brave and fierce for one so small, and asked them what had happened here. &lt;a href=\"Dvalen%20Ironrune\"&gt;Dvalen Ironrune&lt;/a&gt; replied that they should fight the demonic Lieutenant Gom'tok first, and talk later.\nThe demon slain, Dvalen thanked them for helping, saying he was getting weary. He explained that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; appeared out of nowhere, and that they probably had a portal nearby which they had to find. He led the way down from\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattered%20Walkway\"&gt;Shattered Walkway&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"The%20Observation%20Ring\"&gt;Observation Ring&lt;/a&gt;, with the Valarjar fighting though &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;imps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s, and elite &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;. They jumped over barriers of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; flames and helped a &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Champion of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s. The giant thanked them, and stayed behind to rest for a bit.\nReaching winter.\nContinuing further into\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"The%20Halls%20of%20Winter\"&gt;Halls of Winter&lt;/a&gt;, Dvalen said that\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; was cut off from the rest, and that the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s would surround him soon if they didn't get to him fast. He quickly ran ahead to engage the next group of demons to save another &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Mender\"&gt;Iron Dwarf Mender&lt;/a&gt;. That was a rough fight for the iron dwarf who decided to stay behind and keep the way clear while the Valarjar would move forward and help Hodir. They reached a great door behind which was Hodir's room. The champions and &lt;a href=\"Dvalen%20Ironrune\"&gt;Dvalen&lt;/a&gt; grabbed a chain and, all together, pulled and used their strength to force the door open.\nIn the middle of the room was Hodir, wrapped in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; beams, fighting off the inquisitor &lt;a href=\"Felwarden%20Elreth\"&gt;Felwarden Elreth&lt;/a&gt; and his demonic hounds. Upon killing Elreth, the beams dissipated, and &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s appeared. The threat eliminated, the hero spoke to &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; did not expect a mortal to fight so fiercely, and thanked them. He said that there was no time to lose, and that they had to get to &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. The mighty Keeper walked over to a wall of ice blocking the other entryway to the &lt;a href=\"Observation%20Ring\"&gt;Observation Ring&lt;/a&gt;, and smashed it. The Valarjar followed Hodir down the hallway. He opened the door to Thorim's domain and forcibly made way past the barrier formed by lightning orbs. A fel structure was erected in the middle of the room, forming a large fel portal.\nHelping Thorim.\nHodir replied that he would be surprised, for the mortal slayed &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s as swiftly as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fenryr\"&gt;Fenryr&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0hunted wild deer. Thorim said that he would be the judge of that. There were plenty of demons, and he would see if Odyn chose well. The demons kept coming, crush one and another would take its place, Hodir said. He would try to stem the flow as the hero would go through the passage to the north that led to the balcony, and thus Thorim. &lt;a href=\"Dvalen%20Ironrune\"&gt;Dvalen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; thus broke off to fight the flow of demons coming from the portal.\nThe hero entered the main area and took the passageway with &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald%20Drakeborn\"&gt;Ragnvald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Finna%20Bjornsdottir\"&gt;Finna&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnvald felt that the hallway was too quiet, and had a bad feeling. Suddenly, spiders fell from the ceiling, and onto Ragnvald's head. They fought the broodlings and pressed on while minding the spiders hanging above. As they reached the doorway, Brood Queen Morvaniss and more spiders barred their way. But they were dealt with, and the champions managed to reach &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; to help him fight the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ran%27zara\"&gt;Lady Ran'zara&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, she cast a spell that stunned everyone, allowing her to escape through the portal.\nHodir would not let her get away however, and chased Ran'zara through the portal leading to &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, which closed behind them. Thorim turned to the hero and told him that they fought well. He was wrong to question &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s choice. The forces of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0would stand behind the Valarjar if they were willing to aid them in finding Hodir. Thorim said that Hodir had always been too impulsive for his own good. His judgement was accurate about the hero, however. He did not think it possible for a mere mortal to be worthy of Odyn's blessing, he said before teleporting everyone back to &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack to Skyhold.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; sincerely thanked the hero upon their return. That\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was gone was unfortunate he said, but things could have gone much worse and thanks to the hero, &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0did not fall to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; that day. Thorim told the hero that they showed bravery in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, and that he would fulfill his oath to answer the call of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gjallarhorn\"&gt;Gjallarhorn&lt;/a&gt; by unleashing the wrath of thunder upon their enemies. &lt;a href=\"Dvalen%20Ironrune\"&gt;Dvalen Ironrune&lt;/a&gt; said he was sworn to protect\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and, if it wasn't for their aid, he would've failed that promise. He would be glad to work by the hero's side and smash the fiends that attacked Ulduar.\nAftermath.\nApproaching Odyn, the Keeper said that as &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0valiantly went through that demonic portal, he should've earned an honorable death, but instead was taken prisoner by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0scum. Odyn always imagined the battles of the end days to take place here in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but now they would bring the fight to the enemy if it meant sparing one of their own that terrible fate. &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0believed that with the right power source, he could reactivate and redirect the Legion's own gateways.\nOdyn thus ordered the Battlelord to gather demonic runestones from &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and let the final conflict begin. The Legion would rue the day they set their sights on Azeroth. The raw power of the runestones would indeed allow\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to temporarily open a tear into demonic &lt;a href=\"worlds\"&gt;worlds&lt;/a&gt;, but they would not be enough. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0hid its presence in far away worlds with dark magic. The Valarjar needed a greater runestone so that Hymdall could hone in on their enemies across the cosmos.\nAs the Valarjar prepared to launch an attack on the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s\u00a0own world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, it was important to not give reprieve to their enemies in\u00a0this world, said Odyn. While they sought to secure enemy gateways, the hero would return to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and carry on the battle against those who stood against them. As for the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Demonic%20Runestone\"&gt;Greater Demonic Runestone&lt;/a&gt;, it was retrieved from the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dantalionax\"&gt;Dantalionax&lt;/a&gt; in the castle of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe gateway.\nThe time had come to make a move against the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion had multiple portals across the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Should the Valarjar succeed in securing one while it was still active,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0would be able to use the gathered runestones to direct it to whatever hellish world\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was trapped in, proclaimed Odyn. The search for a suitable gateway thus began. The Valarjar investigated &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;, but it was not suitable for their plans. They were sent to &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt; instead, which they found was the only place powerful enough to take the Valarjar to &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. Hymdall would however need to wrest it from the Legion first. The\u00a0Valarjar\u00a0succeeded in capturing the Legion's gateway, and it was now time to deliver a decisive blow to the enemy; they would not wait for them to strike here.\nAssault on Niskara.\nThe Valarjar joined their forces at &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;. There, was standing at the inactive gateway Thorim, Dvalen Ironrune, Finna Bjornsdottir, and Ragnvald Drakeborn. Hymdall was at the front and center of the group, surrounded by Stormforged Valarjar and Valarjar Shieldmaidens. The corpses of demons lay scattered about the area. Hymdall claimed that the Legion were not the only ones who could reach through the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;cosmos&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to strike their enemies. The hero gave the word to Hymdall to open and maintain the gateway from this side. It was time.\nAs the Valarjar ascended into the gates of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; told them that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would regret ever laying their sights on his domain. His armies were at the hero's command, and he would lead them to victory. The golden warriors were immediately assaulted by &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt; riders, warlocks striking from above. The hero launched themselves onto one of those Niskaran felbats, and killed its rider. The others would suffer the same fate.\nThe Battlelord drove their weapon into the felbat, who screeched in pain, causing them to dive near &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; who was fighting off a group of demons. Together, they fought the &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s attacking the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, before heading to the area where &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; was held. There, a fel-corrupted Hodir stood, with three &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailers&lt;/a&gt; channeling fel energies into the titanic Keeper. They rushed to his defense, but as the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were slain, Hodir yelled:\nThe Valarjar valiantly fought the fallen Keeper, but &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ran%27zara\"&gt;Lady Ran'zara&lt;/a&gt; returned, claiming that she would not let them destroy her newest pet. Fortunately she could not withstand the might of the Valarjar, and as she was killed, the fel energy dissipated. Hodir was freed from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s influence. &lt;a href=\"Hymdall\"&gt;Hymdall&lt;/a&gt; thus opened a portal for them to return to Skyhold.\nConclusion.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; thanked the Battlelord once more. Without their help, one of Azeroth's mightiest guardians would have fallen into the hands of the Legion. The hero had proven they were capable of leading his armies and defeating the Legion in their own territory. Hodir told the Battlelord he was in their debt, that the winds of the north were now at their service, and that he would gladly fight along their side in\u00a0Odyn's army.\nOdyn told the Battlelord that he had been watching them. Time and again they had led the\u00a0Valarjar\u00a0to war with their weapon held high. Time and again the &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had thundered with the cheers of their victory. Now that the enhancements to the Forge of Odyn were completed, it was time that their weapon's true potential was unleashed. The Battlelord and Odyn met at the Forge where the Keeper held the following speech."}

Formerly known as a Cradle of Life and used as a place of experimentation by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s similar to &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, this vale of golden flowers and trees served as the seat of power for the rulers of Pandaria, such as the mogu rulers following the death of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; came to Pandaria bringing their &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; with them, the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; decided to reopen the gate after sealing it following the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance and Horde proved themselves in aiding the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt; in defeating the &lt;a href=\"Shao-Tien%20clan\"&gt;Shao-Tien mogu&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; used the vale's power as a means to revive the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s power utterly destroyed the eastern half of the vale, causing some to refer to it as the Vale of Eternal Sorrows. Following the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; planted a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al tree in the center of the destruction, providing hope that the vale will heal one day now that Pandaria need no longer fear the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;seven breaths&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nIn the years that the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s were on Azeroth, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms was a place &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; created and experiment with forms of life, like &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;. All three locations were places where the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; had coalesced. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s emerged from these cradles of life.\nFreya also crafted and planted the tree &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%20%28tree%29\"&gt;Fu Zan&lt;/a&gt; in the Vale. It grew strong and tall, drinking deeply from the vale's resonant power, and more trees arose around it. Lush forests, both in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and in the walking world, sprang to life across the region. The Wild Gods, later known as the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; by the inhabitants of Pandaria, gathered near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and Freya approached them, giving them her staff to protect, while she set off north to fight an evil.\nAt the same time, they were fighting the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and their servants, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, so they created the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; to be guardians of the Vale and fight off the waves of mantid. When the Old Gods were defeated and the titans became silent, the mogu continued their work until the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; swept through the land. Unsure of what to do, the mogu started forming into clans and began fighting with each other, until &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; rose and united the clans. Lei Shen and his mogu enslaved the creatures of Pandaria and forced them to build the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Great Wall&lt;/a&gt; to block the mantid from his new &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; and protect the Vale at the same time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; had their beginnings in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, evolving from &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s fortunate enough to live near the enchanted pools of the Vale. The magic of the pools expanded their minds and grew their bodies until they became one of the great ancient cultures of Pandaria. At some time following the departure of the titans, but before the rise of Lei Shen, the &lt;a href=\"jinyu%20empire\"&gt;jinyu empire&lt;/a&gt; ruled over Pandaria from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. During the reign of mogu emperor Lei Shen, the mogu invaded the jinyu kingdoms and slaughtered all who opposed them, presumably wresting from them control of the Vale.\nWhen the mogu were &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, the capital was moved east to the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the Vale's gates were closed off to the outside world, to all but the chosen few who become a member of a small group of caretakers known as the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;, the guardians of the valley, keeping it pristine and safe, with occasional help from the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;. After the Vale was sealed off, it became something of a mythical place in pandaren culture. The land's towering waterfalls, white-capped peaks, and beautiful architecture have spawned legends, myths, and poems, such as the \"Song of the Vale\".\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Vale after having purged himself of his burdens, and it was in the Vale that Shaohao became one with the land to save Pandaria from the Sundering. It is said that all the trees in the vale blossomed as he entered, and continued to blossom for thousands of years.\nMists of Pandaria.\nMagic waters flowing from the Vale eventually seeped in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, and its &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt; became a source of large crops of giant vegetables.\nIn more recent times, the Golden Lotus have become increasingly concerned after spotting mogu scouts that somehow circumvented the gates. They are in need of the Shado-Pan's aid again, and perhaps new strangers as well, should they prove worthy of the privilege. Any adventurer who is able to aid the Golden Lotus will quickly discover that the mogu intend something grander than simple scouting within the Vale. &lt;a href=\"Xin%20the%20Weaponmaster\"&gt;Xin the Weaponmaster&lt;/a&gt; has gathered several Mogu clans under his banner at &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shao-Tien\"&gt;Shao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; to the west have begun a full-scale assault on the Vale, and their plot ties in with the return of the master of all mogu, the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nBleeding Sun.\nThe Golden Lotus learned that a child within the Vale was destined to join their order, but after testing several pandaren children at the Shrine were unable to locate the child. &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; then appeared and found his way to &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Dezco&lt;/a&gt;'s sons, announcing that one of them was destined to serve the vale. The Tauren unwilling to be departed from either of his children decided to leave the Vale and return to Mulgore in secret. However he was intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Mokimo%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Mokimo the Strong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weng%20the%20Merciful\"&gt;Weng the Merciful&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rook\"&gt;Rook&lt;/a&gt; who choose to protect until he had left. However the group was ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Shao-Tien\"&gt;Shao-Tien&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and in the end only one of Dezco's two sons survived. While Dezco was free to leave for &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to give &lt;a href=\"Redhorn\"&gt;Redhorn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mokimo\"&gt;Mokimo&lt;/a&gt; in order for him to serve the Vale and the Golden Lotus.\nVol'jin: Shadows of the Horde.\nFollowing the rebirth of the Thunder King, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; ordered the Zandalari to begin the process of resurrecting his generals. Learning this &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shado-pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt; allies sought to prevent the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite their best efforts, the group was captured, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Dao\"&gt;Brother Dao&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Shan\"&gt;Brother Shan&lt;/a&gt; used as two of the four sacrifices and Warlord Kao was reborn. The quick actions of Vol'jin and &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt; protected the lives of &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Cuo\"&gt;Brother Cuo&lt;/a&gt; from the Mogu's wrath. Disgruntled at this Warlord Kao directed the Zandalari to return him to his &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt; and the group, prisoners and all, departed for the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nEscalation.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; ordered his &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to excavate the vale in order to find artifacts. The goblin mining crew unearthed a dark secret. \nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nThe Vale's desecration by the Horde excavation and subsequent unearthing of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; by Garrosh has stirred the final Sha prime, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;. The immense corruption laid waste to the once beautiful landscape, and the lesser sha now roam the swath. Mogu'shan Palace and the mogu statues were also damaged. The &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Blossom\"&gt;Eternal Blossom&lt;/a&gt;s, the namesake of the Vale, started to die despite having once been said to never wilt.\nThe water pools have been warped by the Sha energies and reformed into an elemental horror, &lt;a href=\"Immerseus\"&gt;Immerseus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; have determined that they will work together to rebuild the Vale, with a cleansed tree given by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Azeroth, the Vale has been cleansed thanks to the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nNow visibly restored, the Vale has become the base of operations of Keeper &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; and mogu loyal to him, the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from his prison the Vale came under attack both from N'Zoth's forces and from mogu seeking to take advantage of the chaos to claim the Vale for themselves. Ra and the Rajani worked with the Golden Lotus to protect the land.\nGetting there.\nThe very short quest chain to open the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20August%20Celestials\"&gt;Gate of the August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; begins at level 87 in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. There, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;, the White Tiger, is hearing petitions to open the gate, but he has tests for members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after the disaster at &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Over the objections of &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, Xuen accedes to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Dezco's&lt;/a&gt; requests to open the gate. After &lt;a href=\"A%20Witness%20to%20History\"&gt;A Witness to History&lt;/a&gt;, the gate is opened and adventurers can travel into the vale at their leisure.\nAlternatively, any player of any level can enter the Vale of Eternal Blossoms by traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Fallback\"&gt;Shado-Pan Fallback&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, climbing the stairs within to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;, and then jumping off of it into the Vale. A &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; can also open a portal to the faction hub in the Vale for players of any level.\nGeography.\nThe land contains six sacred pools, which are the lifeblood of the vale. Each of these powerful pools represent a positive emotion and is capable of healing wounds that even the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is not capable of. Only five of the pools can be seen, while the last is found deep within the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach pool corresponds with the negative emotions of the sha: Anger, Despair, Doubt, Fear, Hatred, and Violence. They are the pools of Fellowship, Hope, Faith, Courage, Love, and Peace.\nRecently the Bilgewater goblins have begun excavating the &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Fields\"&gt;Summer Fields&lt;/a&gt; in search of an artifact by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s orders. During the dig, they destroyed one of the sacred pools.\nLater, all of the pools have been corrupted by the Sha of Pride and reformed into an elemental named Immerseus. The eastern part of the Vale is either withering or covered in Sha energy. Mogu'shan Palace was damaged in the process and a hidden entrance to some sort of inner complex was unearthed.\nQuests.\nThe Vale of Eternal Blossoms is driven primarily by a single faction, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;, the caretakers of the Vale. The Golden Lotus has long been peaceful, with little need to fight inside their tightly locked valley, but when things come to conflict, the Golden Lotus seek out the nearby &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; to aid them. Though players are working for the Golden Lotus for the entirety of their time within the Vale, they are also fighting alongside several Shado-Pan heroes along the way, aiding the Shado-Pan at the &lt;a href=\"Setting%20Sun%20Garrison\"&gt;Setting Sun Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, and are joining the Shado-Pan in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall.\nIn working for the Golden Lotus, players are able to experience more than 100 daily quests within the Vale, by far the most daily quests for a single faction in the game. Each day, after aiding the Golden Lotus in fending off mogu attacks near the central Vale, players can expect to be sent to random locations, each location seeded with random quests, and each quest environment featuring random variations to the monsters, defenders, traps, and other features located there. To provide even more variety, a mogu attack force roams the vale, moving to different locations each day, so players may find that the peaceful village is now being raided by the mogu, or that the normally spider-infested ruins have been turned into an established mogu camp, entirely changing the experience at these locations for the day. No matter what reputation the players have or where they were sent in the vale, they are getting to end their day with one of more than 20 unique boss fights that were constructed just for this zone.\nResources.\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;"}

She eventually became an enforcer for the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and accepted the position of an advisor and bodyguard to Varian in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, with the caveat that she retain her &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;independence&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, taking pride in her people's traditions and defending their tribulations and loyalties. However, she herself acts independently of the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Thalassian government&lt;/a&gt;, and has formally joined neither the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; since her introduction but is fiercely loyal to Varian and his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;.\nValeera herself maintains that her loyalties are personal, to her friends and her ideals.\nBiography.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nWhen Valeera was young, her family was killed by &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s. She survived both the bandits and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, eking out a &lt;a href=\"thief\"&gt;living by stealing&lt;/a&gt; what she needed. One time, she stole a scroll to find that it contained information on her own family: her ancestor &lt;a href=\"Relfthra\"&gt;Relfthra&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and member of the secret &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Order of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. However, one day when trying to steal a shaman's talisman, she was caught and jailed. Showing her fighting prowess by injuring several of the guards in the process, it's possible that is how she attracted the attention of the Arena promoter. The day before she was to implement her escape plan, Valeera was sold to &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; so she could join &lt;a href=\"Bloodeye%20Redfist\"&gt;Bloodeye Redfist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; in team combat in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, Bloodeye was killed and Broll told Valeera the stories of both Rehgar and Bloodeye.\nAfter Bloodeye's funeral pyre, Valeera and Broll were being transported in a caged wagon to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to be trained as &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;s. On their way, they were joined by a &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; who had washed up on the seashore with no memory. When they reached Orgrimmar, they were caged once again; the human who did nothing but brood, while the two elves argued.\nThat evening in the cages, Broll offered the human a meditation remedy, and the man had a brief flash of memory. The meditation was interrupted by Valeera, which nearly caused her and Broll to come to blows. Valeera, Broll, and the amnesiac human trained in the ways of the gladiator in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and learned to look out for one another, since rival gladiators would test their mettle against the novice team in fights to the death while their trainers would gamble on the outcomes. Eventually the three traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; in Feralas where the gladiatorial contests took place. After many bloody battles, they emerged the victors of the Crimson Ring tournament. Impressed by Varian's skill at arms, the crowd gave him the orcish moniker Lo'Gosh; which means &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;\"Ghost Wolf\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter winning the Dire Maul gladiatorial contests, Rehgar sold Valeera to &lt;a href=\"Helka%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Helka Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, a gladiator mistress, for 2000 gold. Helka wanted Valeera to lead an all-female gladiator team consisting of an orc and a troll. However, soon after they set out for an exhibition game on the Merchant Coast, Valeera escaped with the wyvern &lt;a href=\"Bristlefur\"&gt;Bristlefur&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera then went searching for Broll and Lo'Gosh, who had escaped from &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;. As she followed them, she discovered that an &lt;a href=\"Daerion%20the%20Assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; was also trailing them. She eventually caught up with the assassin and, after catching him off guard, killed him with the help of some local beasts. Worn out from the fight, she was rescued by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; who saw great things in her.\nAegwynn reunited her with Broll and Lo'Gosh, who was revealed to be the lost king of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The three were determined to stay together and set out for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to return Varian to his rightful throne. During the trip across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera helped Varian and Broll defend the ship against attacking &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, but during the fight she absorbed the arcane energies of a &lt;a href=\"Naga%20sea%20witch\"&gt;Naga sea witch&lt;/a&gt;'s trident; this act was what started her addiction to &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter she arrived at &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, she, Varian, Broll, and a dwarf called &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; started the journey towards &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. On their way they were stopped by &lt;a href=\"Vendellin%20Soulfire\"&gt;Vendellin Soulfire&lt;/a&gt;, a blood elf &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; sent to assassinate Varian. He placed the mark of &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; upon Valeera and by doing so caused the demon Kathra'natir to possess her.\nBecause she was infected with the fel energies of a demon, her addiction was exacerbated. During Valeera's lapses of self control, the demon would occasionally gain influence and take control of her body. When the group got to Ironforge, Lo'Gosh and Magni conversed and were secretly being followed by a bearded man. Valeera sensed arcane energy being manipulated and witnessed the man creating a dagger with the intent to kill Lo'Gosh. Valeera quickly subdued the man, but he transformed into a black dragon and fled. She was left behind in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to adjust from her withdrawal from magic while the rest of her companions embarked on a mission to rescue &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt;. Secluded in her room, the demon tried to take control of her body by feeding her feelings of abandonment, using visions of her deceased parents to verbally abuse her. Valeera regained control of her senses when a vision of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; told her she was not alone and that she had people like Broll and Varian who loved her. She later rendezvoused with Varian and Broll after their mission, informing them that she was better and in control of herself again.\nWhen the group got to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, she helped reveal &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s treachery and traveled with King Varian back across the sea to finally kill her. After Onyxia's death, Varian offered both Broll and Valeera a permanent place in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, in which they could act as Varian's bodyguards and advisers. Valeera and Anduin convinced Varian that he should create peace between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but when the peace summit was about to happen, Broll was summoned to Darnassus, which saddened Valeera. Aegwynn cheered her up, telling her that she has talents but also burdens and responsibilities. During the summit, &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Twilight Hammer's attack was repelled; the peace summit was ruined and both the Horde and Alliance were left in distrust of one another.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked Stormwind, Valeera stayed in Theramore to investigate the perpetrators of the ambush. Valeera made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; to rescue her son &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for her cooperation in revealing the identities of her masters. She later partnered with &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt; and traveled with him to &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to save Med'an. They found Med'an hanging on the dead body of the &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and rescued him. However, before they could get away from the ruins of Ahn'Qiraj, they were intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; who fell Meryl with one strike. Valeera absorbed some magic from Meryl and Med'an in order to grow strong enough to fend off Cho'gall, giving Med'an, who had just regained consciousness, enough time to heal Meryl. Cho'gall was still too powerful to defeat and, becoming desperate to stay alive, Valeera offered herself willingly to the demon inside her in order to use the demon's power to fend off Cho'gall. When Meryl regained consciousness, he teleported them all away from Cho'gall. When they reached a secure location, Valeera, still possessed by Kathra'natir, lusted over Med'an's power and tried to possess him but Med'an was able to reject Kathra'natir's advances. Meryl, who alongside the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; had banished Kathra'natir thousands of years ago, challenged the demon to possess his powerful magical body instead in order to lure the demon away from Valeera's body. As the demon tried to possess him, Meryl proved himself the stronger of the two wills and repressed the demon within his body. Meryl then asked Med'an and Valeera to never tell anyone about what happened between him and the demon.\nShe later aided the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; with recruiting new members, defending Theramore and aiding Med'an and Garona in battling Cho'gall. She was last seen at the funeral of Aegwynn. She returned to Stormwind City and remained there until around the time of the Lich King's death.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera appeared underneath a statue complaining about the hospitality of the Alliance and urging the Alliance and Horde to remain focused on the threat of the Lich King.\n\"Her appearance in Stormwind during the Scourge attack would later be contradicted by the events of the comic, where she helped &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; to save &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; during that time.\"\nValeera also appeared in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; next to &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Wrath of the Lich King quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;The Battle For The Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nIt is implied by Broll Bearmantle during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; that her recent use of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic in her fight against Cho'gall may lead to a resurgence of her magical addiction. When Broll visited Stormwind, he asked Varian about Valeera. Varian responded that the young blood elf left Stormwind a few weeks ago and no one knows where she is.\nValeera pledged herself to &lt;a href=\"House%20Wrynn\"&gt;House Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, serving King Varian as his personal spy. Over the years, Anduin also used her to send messages without Varian knowing.\nLegion.\nNow one of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera is within the sewers of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in the secret &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. She aids in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Akaari%20Shadowgore\"&gt;Akaari Shadowgore&lt;/a&gt; and the retrieval of the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Uncrowned begins looking into the suspicious activities of and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera works on deciphering an encrypted letter that had been clutched in the hands of the dead &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; and asks that the rest of the Uncrowned work to throw SI:7 off her trail. Eventually, Valeera discovers the location of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Raven%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Raven's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, a gem created by &lt;a href=\"Havi\"&gt;Havi&lt;/a&gt; long ago for his pet ravens &lt;a href=\"Huginn\"&gt;Huginn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muninn\"&gt;Muninn&lt;/a&gt; and then taken by &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. With the Raven's Eye, she could decipher the message that Amber Kearnen had held. A &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;fellow Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of the Uncrowned retrieves it for her from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. After deciphering Kearnen's message, Valeera, and the Uncrowned learn that Shaw has been replaced by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera carried &lt;a href=\"The%20Kingslayers\"&gt;The Kingslayers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anguish\"&gt;Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;, if the player was not a rogue, representing the Uncrowned.\nBefore the Storm.\nHaving remained close to the Wrynns and now serving as &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;'s personal spy and deliverer of secret messages that even &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; didn't know about, Valeera was tasked by Anduin to send a letter to &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; about initiating a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;meeting between Forsaken and their living relatives&lt;/a&gt;. Although Valeera admired Anduin's optimistic efforts to make the Horde and Alliance true allies, she cautioned him to be careful as it is likely that many would not support it.\nValeera later reported back to Anduin that &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt; had refused to accept Anduin's letter out of fear it would endanger his chieftain. However, she explained that Perith would read the letter instead and tell Baine the contents of the message. She also gave Anduin a letter from Baine which hinted to Anduin that he had been pressured by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to cut off all contact with him, as well as a small chip of Baine's horn to serve as a memento of their friendship. As Anduin lamented that his pool of trusted comrades was growing smaller, Valeera reassured Anduin that he can always count on her friendship but warned him as king, he cannot afford to trust unwisely.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nContinuing to serve as a messenger between Baine and the Alliance, after meeting with Baine for his message in &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;Plunder Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera snuck up onto the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; and informed &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; that Baine wanted to meet Jaina secretly outside the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to right a &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;wrong&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde had inflicted on the Proudmoore family. Jaina initially didn't trust Valeera, until Mathias Shaw reminded her that Valeera had been a trusted friend of Varian.\nValeera was later present for Anduin and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s meeting, guarding &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; while the former spoke with the latter. She later attended Saurfang's funeral.\nValeera was alongside &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; when he announced to King Anduin that his agents of the were unable to track down N'Zoth. She later witnessed the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by an advisor, who is none other than &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; wishing to help defeat the Old God.\nShe later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; to inform the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; had returned and was working with &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. She subsequently sent the Speaker to aid Magni and Wrathion in their efforts, while hoping that the rest of the Horde and Alliance could set aside their squabbles to face &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; (N'Zoth's manifested desire for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;) a &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar%20%28Vision%20of%20Stormwind%29\"&gt;version of her&lt;/a&gt; can be found recruiting adventures to battle a corrupted Shaw.\nFollowing the fall of N'Zoth and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Valeera informed the Speaker that the leaders of the Horde had gathered together in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to nominate a new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, and that their presence had been requested. Following the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; in favor of a Warchief, she declared that a new era was beginning. While not directly stated, it was implied that she was the one that delivered the terms for the armistice between the Alliance and the Horde.\nValeera met with Shaw in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; where she asked him what he was going to do next. This prompted him to say that there was someone he'd like to get to know better. Valeera then encouraged him to find happiness while he could.\nShadows Rising.\nValeera was sent by Anduin to &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in order to find out if the Horde had any knowledge of Sylvanas being in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, to which Baine responded negatively.\nDeath Rising.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began to &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; gone, Valeera asked Horde heroes to report to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; in Orgrimmar. After Lor'themar revealed that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; had been abducted, she revealed that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who neutralized her attackers.\nAfter remarking how she would not partake in the political posturing between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, due to having friends on both sides, she spoke with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and the two affirmed a friendship between them.\nThe War Within.\nValeera can be found in a small tavern in a hallway above the main city on the Isle of Dorn, Dornogal. She is seated at a table with a full drink, a Hearthstone game in progress and a sullen and nearly naked Millhouse Manastorm (whose cup is quite empty). When the player character interacts with Valeera (who has kept her clothing), she notes that the Alliance and Horde forces that have already arrived seem to have things under control.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nDialogue.\nI am ready to go wherever is needed, do whatever it takes, to assure the goals of the Uncrowned are met.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nGossip.\nIt saddens me that the Alliance and Horde can only seem to set aside their differences in the face of total annihilation.\nIf we do prevail against N'Zoth, will you yet again turn your blades on each other?\nIf history has anything to teach us, it is that peace between the Alliance and Horde is perilously short-lived.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nValeera is a in \"Heroes of the Storm\".\nSpeculation.\nStatus with Quel'Thalas.\nValeera's current standing with her homeland is unclear. She proudly identifies herself as a &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, and has defended her people's courses of action (including the alliance with Illidan and the naga, the methods of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;siphoning magic&lt;/a&gt; to deal with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; addiction, joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;'s bigotry, etc.) multiple times throughout the comic series. Her background was a point of lingering contention between her and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, who declared blood elves traitors to the Alliance and disapproved of her mana-tapping ways, though the two would gradually go to form a close friendship. She was born and raised in Quel'Thalas, and when not in her armor, Valeera wears red clothing, the color of the blood elves. Valeera survived the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion and was evidently present in Quel'Thalas throughout its reconstruction and the spreading of Illidan's teachings, where she acquired her emerald eyes. She seems to have eked out her life independently as a pickpocket some time after this, before being thrown into &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s prison cell for a failed attempt at stealing an orc's talisman in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Valeera appears to be generally welcome in Horde lands, at least in Orgrimmar and in Thunder Bluff, unlike her fellow rogue &lt;a href=\"Renzik\"&gt;Renzik&lt;/a&gt;, she apparently does not make a secret of her allegiance to Anduin, even leaving through a portal to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; with the Alliance after Saurfang's funeral.\nRelatives.\nGiven their last names, she may be related to the blood elf paladin &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Lord Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifact.\nBecause Valeera wields &lt;a href=\"The%20Kingslayers\"&gt;The Kingslayers&lt;/a&gt; when drawing the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; if the player character is not a rogue, it could be speculated that she was the one who canonically foiled the plot of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; to bring about the downfall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, which would fall in line with her established loyalty to &lt;a href=\"House%20Wrynn\"&gt;House Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, she could have been given the weapon just for that occasion.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Together, they created the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt;, which brought arcane into balance using nature as a vessel. Over time, Farodin's masters faded away, and only he remains.\nMany years ago, exiles from &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt;. Farodin took pity on them and gifted them with an arcan'dor. For a time it sustained them and they were safe, but it did not last forever. The arcan'dor became unstable and died, and in a flash of wild magic the elves were twisted, becoming the &lt;a href=\"fal%27dorei\"&gt;fal'dorei&lt;/a&gt;. The remains of the arcan'dor are known as the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Locus\"&gt;Shattered Locus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarodin then kept watch over an arcan'dor seed at &lt;a href=\"Moonshade%20Sanctum\"&gt;Moonshade Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; for 10,000 years. A &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; who would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Theryn\"&gt;Theryn&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; was exposed to the seed, giving him peace. After \"Theryn\" was discovered by the exiled &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Kel%27danath\"&gt;Arcanist Kel'danath&lt;/a&gt; and became one of his test subjects, Farodin later came across the sleeping Kel'danath and woke him with his blade at his neck. Once he learned that Kel'danath was trying to cure the withered, he left him be.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the seed after learning about it through Theryn's memories, the seed was stolen by fal'dorei that intended to use its power to return to the surface. Farodin and the adventurer slew the fal'dorei and quickly took the seed to Shal'Aran, where it could drink of the ley line there and grow. Beneath the arcan'dor, the nightfallen would be renewed. Eventually, the Shal'Aran arcan'dor began to show signs of failing in the same way as the one in Falanaar, with its arcane and nature magics unbalanced and the arcane threatening to devour it whole. In order to balance them out, Farodin requested the adventurer to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Purified%20Life%20Essence\"&gt;Purified Life Essence&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nStep carefully."}

It is the eastern way into &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the other being &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the west.\nHistory.\nValgarde was the first home of the lucky few who survived &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' betrayal. It started as a small settlement with a decent anchorage in &lt;a href=\"Daggercap%20Bay\"&gt;Daggercap Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe town got built up and grew when the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; entered it at the start of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. While the port is across the river from &lt;a href=\"Wyrmskull%20Village\"&gt;Wyrmskull Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul were still slumbering at the time it was built, making passage easier. &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Admiral%20Keller\"&gt;Vice Admiral Keller&lt;/a&gt; had command of Valgarde when the expedition started, and it was a sleepy little nothing of a town when he first arrived.\nA month later, the vrykul were awake. It was then periodically attacked by a group of &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s, and by &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; riders raining fire from the sky. Vice Admiral Keller said \"We'd been here a month when those malformed giants appeared out of thin air.\" At some point, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; stayed in Valgarde.\nSince this time, the Alliance icebreaker \"&lt;a href=\"Northspear\"&gt;Northspear&lt;/a&gt;\" runs from Menethil Harbor in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; to Valgarde, regular as gnomish clockwork.\nExploring Azeroth: Northrend.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the town was visited by the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. They stopped by the inn for a few pints and learned that the focus of the remaining soldiers has become exploration and diplomacy, but due to the proximity to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmskull%20Village\"&gt;Wyrmskull Village&lt;/a&gt; the walls of Valgarde still see regular attacks from the vrykul.\nIn the RPG.\nValgarde is the only established &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and it is the obvious arrival point for anyone traveling to this continent. The town is led by &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Randalvarr\"&gt;Magistrate Randalvarr&lt;/a&gt; and a ruling council.\nDescription.\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, Valgarde is a rough &lt;a href=\"Port\"&gt;seaport&lt;/a&gt; where you can find all races, occupations, and characters floating through here. It is an excellent place to find information about Northrend in general, and to hire guides or buy equipment before setting out. It is also the only place in the continent where you can hire passage off this ice-coated land, back to warmer and more civilized continents. Of course, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and occasional monsters attack the town frequently, but its strong walls never fail and the watchtowers provide ample warning.\nMost people who arrive in the town purchase low, fur-lined caps with flaps for the ears, or headbands that slant down in back, or thick hoods, anything to keep their ears from ringing when outside. Small farms dot the landscape of the Fjord, particularly near Valgarde. Thanks to this city, humans dominate the region and the majority of people live here except for &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"trapper\"&gt;trapper&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nValgarde was founded by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition to Northrend after the prince disappeared when he went to search for &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Stranded in this frozen continent and without the ships to return to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, which had been burned by Prince Arthas, the humans and dwarves built the town and some fortifications around it to protect it. As Valgarde grew, its residents forced the Drakkari and furbolgs back into the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, making the region safe enough for brave farmers to till the land.\nThe remaining dwarves from &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition hid within ruins or gathered with humans in Valgarde.\nSpeculation.\nValgarde appears to be similar to a Viking town from the concept art, this would make sense due to the fact Northrend's climate is similar to northern Scandinavia. It is most likely a reference to the Swedish town of Valsg\u00e4rde, the site of a large number of Viking archaeological sites dating from the 6th - 8th centuries.\nThe exact location of Arthas' original landing zone seems to have undergone a &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt; from ' to \"World of Warcraft\". In Warcraft III, it is on the border of &lt;a href=\"Daggercap%20Bay\"&gt;Daggercap Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which lies in the Howling Fjord. ' keeps this view. In \"World of Warcraft\", however, it has been moved to the southeastern &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shore%20%28Dragonblight%29\"&gt;Forgotten Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the presence of &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Baelgun's Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt; in the Fjord, it is probable that the original concept for Valgarde in \"World of Warcraft\" was still meant to be Arthas' original landing zone but that it was eventually retconned so that the questlines of the Forgotten Shore could happen. It is also possible that at some point &lt;a href=\"Westguard%20Keep\"&gt;Westguard Keep&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s base and that the Forgotten Shore was the former Scourge base that Arthas took over for at least two missions.\n\"\" reaffirms the idea that it was founded by Arthas' forces."}

Later he regained his identity and became a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Later &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; allied with Mordis. He appeared to befriend her under the guise of helping her find her friends, but he had dark plans for her.\nHistory.\nValimar Mordis was originally a human noble who ruled a small &lt;a href=\"Barony%20Mordis\"&gt;barony&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains of Alterac. He tried to rule with the same compassion and strength as his forebears. During his reign, he befriended a tauren named &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, an explorer from the continent of Kalimdor. His long and successful rule was ended by the Scourge, who brutally massacred him and all of his subjects. Upon resurrecting him as an undead slave, the Scourge used him as one of their more powerful warriors. The Baron committed many evil deeds whilst under the Scourge's influence until he killed a mage during a raid on an Alliance town. He described it as his horror and disgust at his actions rising to the surface, allowing him to become his own master.\nManaging to elude the Scourge chasing him, the Baron then returned to his old home, only to see it in ruins. His old friend and ally, Trag, was still there however; and protected the land from intruders. Valimar acted as if he was glad to see Trag again (though he actually only intended to use him) and together they hunted the Scourge. They hunted one in particular, a ghoul called &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt;, who wielded an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Orb of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; - an artifact used to revive ancient beasts for the Lich King's service. However, the Baron had his own plans for the orb. He intended to use it in order to spread the will of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and create his own army of undead, and he didn't care who he used in order to achieve that goal. When the Baron intended to use the innocent &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt; (who - unknown to anyone, including her - was actually the avatar of the Thalassian &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;) to power the Orb, Trag closed his fist around the Baron's hand, destroying the artifact and causing a &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; he had summoned to crash onto the castle."}

Instead, they waste their incredible powers constantly bickering and fighting each other.\"\nAbilities.\nValiona and Theralion share an health pool as well as threat. They do not reset upon landing or taking off.\nTheralion.\nWhen the encounter begins, Theralion immediately takes to the air, while Valiona engages the attackers on the ground. The twin dragons share a single health pool, and each alternates between being airborne and fighting on the ground.\nTheralion uses the following abilities while on the ground.\nTheralion uses the following abilities while in the air.\nValiona.\nWhen the encounter begins, Theralion immediately takes to the air, while Valiona engages the attackers on the ground. The twin dragons share a single health pool, and each alternate between being airborne and fighting on the ground.\nValiona uses the following abilities while on the ground.\nValiona uses the following abilities while in the air.\nTwilight Realm.\nBeing struck by Theralion's Dazzling Destruction or Valiona's Deep Breath pulls players into the Twilight Realm. In this alternate plane of existence, spheres of volatile twilight energy float around and detonate if touched. Collapsing portals appear randomly throughout the area, and players may use a portal to return to the material plane. Each portal disappates after a time. In Heroic Difficulty Shifting Reality also pulls players into the Twilight Realm.\nStrategy.\nWhen you enter the chamber, Valiona will be on the right and Theralion on the left. Valiona will start out fighting the raid while Theralion flies around, then they switch places periodically and repeat this process for the duration of the fight. Theralion's phase lasts somewhat longer than Valiona's.\nBefore each transition, the airborne dragon will cast an ability (Dazzling Destruction for Theralion, Deep Breath for Valiona) that transports those afflicted to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Realm\"&gt;Twilight Realm&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Fiend\"&gt;Twilight Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s can be found. Although both abilities can be avoided with relative ease, killing six Twilight Fiends is the objective of the &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Double%20Dragon\"&gt;Double Dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fight has a hard enrage timer of ten minutes.\nValiona.\nWhile Valiona is on the ground, positioning is a balancing act between spreading out for Theralion's Twilight Blasts but grouping up to minimize damage taken from Valion'as Blackout. When a party member receives Blackout, everyone can group up close behind the dragon, at which point the healer can safely remove the debuff. The party should then spread back out as quickly as possible.\nWhen Valiona begins to cast Devouring Flames, she will turn to face the direction of the blast. Those within her cone of attack should run through her, or otherwise ensure they are not in front of her in order to avoid the damage. If you find yourself in a bad spot where running through Valiona may take too long, your best bet is to run farther away from her which will reduce the damage devouring flames does to you and may save you.\nAfter two Blackouts, Theralion will cast Dazzling Destruction, which creates two large void zones three separate times in a row that do damage and transport those that stand in them to the Twilight Realm. He will insta-kill anyone left standing here after about 10 seconds. He will then land and Valiona takes off. Another Blackout will come during Dazzling Destruction.\nTheralion.\nDuring Theralion's phase, people need to group up to absorb the damage from Twilight Meteorite does while strafing to avoid Fabulous Flames and staying out of Deep Breath. Those affected by Engulfing Magic need to run away from the raid and keep healing/attacking, or simply stop any action until the debuff goes away.\nThere are different approaches to handling this phase, but usually people will mark someone to follow, or possibly split into groups (such as melee and ranged), so you can move together to avoid the fire while minimizing the damage from Twilight Meteorites. Alternatively, the raid can spread out and whoever is affected by Twilight Meteorite can run into the melee group to share the damage. This second method means less movement and potential damage lost due to Engulfing Magic, and requires less coordination, but potentially increases the burden on healers.\nAfter two Engulfing Magics (about 120 seconds), Valiona will take a deep breath and fill one third of the room with flames. She will do this three times to different areas of the room, much like &lt;a href=\"Felmyst\"&gt;Felmyst&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and the raid needs to move somewhere not affected by Deep Breath each time she begins to cast it. Once she is done, Valiona will land, Theralion will take off, and Phase 1 begins again.\nSolo strategy.\nIf going for the &lt;a href=\"Double%20Dragon\"&gt;Double Dragon&lt;/a&gt; achievement, begin the encounter and then stand still until the phase transition. Make sure to stand in the area of effect to transition to the shadow realm. Once on the other side, stand in the center of the room and turn on V-key health plates. Adds are small and hard to make out in the ground clutter, so the health bars will help. They barely have 10,000 health, so use quick attacks to finish them off. The achievement will be awarded the instant the sixth has been killed.\nOnce done, just blow up the dragons. None of the abilities hit particularly hard.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The fight ends when the raid has succeeded in healing Valithria up to 100%, while adds spawn in decreasing intervals.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and Valithria appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; assisting &lt;a href=\"Merithra%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWar against the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Valithria was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and placed within &lt;a href=\"Frostwing%20Halls\"&gt;Frostwing Halls&lt;/a&gt; wing of the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Heavily wounded, the Lich King ordered the Scourge to hasten her destruction and to leave only bones and sinew for her reanimation. However, Azeroth's champions were able to successfully beat back the Scourge and heal her wounds.\nAfter she was restored to her powerful self, she changed to the form of a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; and explained a few things about &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; to the adventurers.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nYears later when the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, Valithria appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; where she called on heroes to save &lt;a href=\"Thessera\"&gt;Thessera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Verdisa\"&gt;Verdisa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Karkarius\"&gt;Karkarius&lt;/a&gt; from being ensnared by the void. She then assisted in empowering the &lt;a href=\"Reforged%20Emerald%20Essence\"&gt;Reforged Emerald Essence&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nValithria can be found within the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; has returned to Azeroth from &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;. She sleeps in the grove, not too far from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs an encounter.\nThe fight is a chaotic battle for survival. The loss of a tank or a healer could easily result in a wipe.\nThis boss is available since February 2, 2010 on US servers and February 3 on EU servers.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the door behind Valithria is now open by default. Previously, a non-healing class could not complete this encounter and thus was unable to progress any further in the raid.\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Gluttonous%20Abomination\"&gt;Gluttonous Abomination&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rot%20Worm\"&gt;Rot Worm&lt;/a&gt;.\nRot worms spawn in 7-10 per abomination when it dies.\nSetup.\nValithria starts at 50% health and the objective is to heal her up to full. Between half and two-thirds of the healers should concentrate on her, while the other healers keep the raid up. This usually translates to 1 Raid healer and 1-2 healers on Valithria (10 Man) or 2 raid healers and 3-4 healers on Valithria (25 Man).\nAdds spawn from the gates. In 25 player, all four gates spawn adds, in 10 player it's only the front two. The spawn rate increases over time. After 7/? (10/25 player) minutes, Suppressors and Blazing Skeletons start to spawn continuously, which usually leads to a quick wipe.\nA basic strategy is to loosely assign one group of tanks and damage dealers per add portal.\nPositioning.\n10 Player.\nSince only the closest two gates spawn adds, the back half of the room can be ignored (except when dream portals are opened). One or two damage dealers should be assigned to deal with suppressors. Suppressors can spawn from either side or both at once and only have about 35,000 or so health. The tanks should stand in the middle between the two gates to handle any Archmage or Abomination that comes out. Valithria's healers should set up near her, but close enough so that the tanks can still see them in the event that something needs to be pulled off of them.\n25 Player.\nThe raid should split up into two groups, one positioned to the right of Valithria, the other to the left. Each group is responsible for the adds that spawn on their side, and should only take care of adds on the other side if all adds are dead on their side or they migrate over. Healers assigned to Valithria should stand in the middle of the room \"within\" Valithria, and only move to jump into portals. This forces the adds to move through the kill groups on either side of her and reduces the chance of migration and missed adds killing the healers. Follow the same kill priorities, and techniques as for 10 player.\nAdd portal groups.\nThe add portal groups should use the following priority list:\nDream Portals.\nEvery 30 seconds, Valithria provides portals to the Dream. These portals initially appear as small green orbs on the floor even before they can be entered. The Valithria healers should move close to these orbs and enter the portals as soon as they appear. Only one person can use each portal.\nThe Dream is a version of the room where only Valithria, several green orbs, and the players who entered exist. The objective is to float through as many green orbs as possible. When a player touches an orb it explodes (no damage) and provides a stacking buff (Emerald Vigor), which increases mana regeneration and healing done. After a few seconds, the players automatically return from the Dream and rejoin the rest of the raid. Now they spam heal Valithria until the next portals spawn. As the portals spawn every 30 seconds, and Emerald Vigor's timer is 35 sec, it should never run out and stack sizes should gradually increase up to over 30 near the end of the fight.\nSince Emerald Vigor also increases damage done, it may be possible to have DPS classes enter the portals. Preferably this should be a class with low ramp-up time, namely Warriors, Combat Rogues, Hunters, Shaman or any other class/spec that takes a short amount of time to do a large amount of damage.\nThe Dream can also be used to avoid getting killed before a wipe. With good timing and a little luck, it's possible to enter the dream and drop out only after combat has finished. After the end of combat there are a few short seconds to run out of the area before respawn.\nIf players stand in a Frostbolt Volley from an Archmage, they are slowed even while in the Dream. For this reason it's important to interrupt Frostbolt Volleys. Paladin and priest healers can quickly cleanse themselves, druid healers can shapeshift out of the effect - so make extra certain to interrupt if a shaman is going in.\nStrategy.\nOnce the groups are all positioned properly, begin the fight by pulling the four Risen Archmages that are present in the room at start. They stand in a square shape around the boss on 25 player, or in a semi-circular shape between the boss and the raid on 10 player. These mobs should die quickly.\nThe healers assigned to Valithria should take a portal when they spawn, and aim to collect as many stacks as possible each time. DPS classes shouldn't need to take the portals, however having a couple of good DPS building stacks can make life easier later on when the adds start spawning a lot faster.\nNear the end of the fight, when Valithria's health is already high, use Bloodlust/Heroism and don't enter the portals again. The proper moment for this has to be found out by experience. Assume a raid normally uses Bloodlust after the 6th portal phase and then wins after the 8th. That same raid would defeat her faster when they would use Bloodlust after the 7th portal phase, and not enter the 8th portals.\nHeroic Mode.\nAlthough semantically very different, the actual encounter has only a few differences on Heroic mode. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Driven by tradition, the Alliance consists of powerful cultures and groups bound not by desperation or necessity, but by their deep commitments to abstract concepts like nobility, honor, faith, justice, and sacrifice. Striving to represent these high ideals, its many different peoples all contribute their technical, arcane, and spiritual wisdom toward the shared goal of preserving order on Azeroth and creating a peaceful and just world.\nThe Alliance is an evolution of the original &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and the memories of the allegiances and idealism of the Alliance of Lordaeron\u2015centered in the homonymous continent\u2015served as the ultimate inspiration for the new Alliance of the present day. The modern organization has the bulk of its forces on &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the south-eastern continents of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the members of the previous Alliance (such as &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;) are members of the Grand Alliance.\nThe Alliance has throughout the \"Warcraft\" story remained the only force that can match up to the Horde. These two factions have warred several times with their predecessors (&lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;) having clashed together in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s. In the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the last major conflict as of \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", the controversial acts by the Horde &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; eventually caused a Horde rebellion led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, leading to a temporary unity between the two factions when Saurfang asked &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, High King of the Alliance, for aid in assaulting &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to end both the reign of Sylvanas and the enmity between their factions. Ultimately, Sylvanas &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;killed Saurfang and abandoned the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Fourth War, though many argue that efforts at peace likely will not last, or cannot forgive the atrocities of the past. Currently the Horde and Alliance are in an \"uneasy armistice.\"\nThe Alliance is one of the two factions that player characters belong to\u2015the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; being the other\u2015as determined by a given character's &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, which can be either). Besides race, being a member of the Horde or Alliance affects gameplay through what &lt;a href=\"settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation factions&lt;/a&gt; and in some cases &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"encounter\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt;s the player may access. Faction mechanics also prevent Horde and Alliance players from &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; with each others or making &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;s together, and most &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; gameplay involves Horde players fighting against Alliance players. The divide between the Horde and Alliance\u2014in regard to gameplay mechanics, story elements, and sometimes in social aspects like &lt;a href=\"faction%20pride\"&gt;faction pride&lt;/a&gt;\u2014acts as the core element of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" experience.\nHistory.\nAlliance of Lordaeron.\nThe Alliance of Lordaeron was the union of the seven human kingdoms, along with the dwarves of Khaz Modan (which also included the gnomes of Gnomeregan) and Aerie Peak, the high elves of Quel'Thalas, and others with major political influence including the Church of the Holy Light.\nAftermath of the second invasion.\nEvents of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; led to an alliance with both the night elves, Alliance refugees, and the Horde. This alliance of Azeroth's defenders defeated the Burning Legion at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. While the night elves and Kalimdor Alliance, led by &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, became permanent, tensions began to erupt with the Horde. At the crux of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the corrupted scion of Lordaeron &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; laid the Alliance of Lordaeron to waste - beginning with the murder of his father and the annihilation of Lordaeron itself. He attacked Quel'Thalas shortly after, ransacking the elven homeland and nearly scouring the high elves from Azeroth. The survivors of this massacre proclaimed themselves &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in honor of their peoples' fall, and joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron prior to abandoning it due to racism on behalf of its commander. The Alliance resistance also fell apart after falling to treachery from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s fall and the devastation of the northern kingdoms, the rebuilt city of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; became the new base of the Alliance, with the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; becoming their staunchest and closest geographical allies. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; had been unable to help in the Third War as they were dealing with their own issues closer to home \u2014 namely a &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt; invasion of their city. Because an invasion of troggs paled in comparison to the might of the Scourge, the gnomes decided they would fight their war alone. In the end, following &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;'s treachery, they were forced to flee &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and with their High Tinker, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, settled in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the dwarves as refugees. Indebted to their allies for their hospitality in their time of need, the gnomes again offered their services to the Alliance. The night elves, dealing with the loss of their immortality and having been exposed to the world outside their forests once more, decided they would have to make alliances with the wider world. Because of the animosity with the orcs for their continuing lumbering of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves, in the end, joined the Alliance.\nIn the absence of his liege &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the regent of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, looked into a number of potential alliances, though after &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Anvilward\"&gt;failed renegotiations&lt;/a&gt; with the Alliance, opted not to rejoin it a third time\u2014instead allying with the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A small number of &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; who did not become sin'dorei have chosen to rejoin the Alliance in recent times, with others never really having left in the first place. However, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in particular took it upon themselves to warn their new Alliance allies of the high elves; the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s part in bringing about the War of the Ancients figured heavily in the night elves' retelling of high elf history.\nA few years later, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; joined the Alliance, partly due to their shared affinity for the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; as well as animosity towards the orcs due to their &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20genocide\"&gt;history on Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Stranded a world away from home, and having been urged towards Azeroth by the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of finding new potential allies, they managed to establish a new base on Azeroth from the wreckage of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; as well as gain the trust and cooperation of the Alliance. Shortly afterwards, afterward, Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and his noble refugees played a key role in urging the Alliance to &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invade Outland&lt;/a&gt; and disrupt the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s nefarious activities. Armed with their unshakable faith in the Light, the draenei ventured to their embattled former home &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; as steadfast members of the Alliance and defeated their ancient rivals after reuniting with other survivors of their race.\nThe Alliance later assembled the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and won a costly &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, with their former champion &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; becoming the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; after the death of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. Just prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes' leader, High Tinker &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, led an . It was a successful first maneuver, and the gnomes have managed to carve out a tenuous foothold in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, near the gates of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, whose King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; abandoned the Alliance prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, also rejoined the faction. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to attack and invade Gilneas unhindered. The Greymane worgen fought the Forsaken in Gilneas and &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; ever since, but most of their non-worgen citizens fled Gilneas to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who created the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; that spread to Gilneas in the first place, felt obliged to help the Greymane worgen, and created a dwelling in Darnassus, the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt;, for them to seek refuge in as the war for their home rages on. Afterward, Gilneas was re-inducted into the Alliance, with King Greymane personally moving to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to assist his fellow ruler Varian.\nWhile fending off Horde expansionism, the Alliance also sought to protect their scarred and broken world from utter devastation during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterward, Theramore is &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the leaders of the Alliance, outraged at this matter, completely devote themselves into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war against the Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the parting of the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and concurrent to the full-scale global escalation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt; also joined, finding values among the Alliance races resonant with and similar to their own.\nAs tensions between the Horde and the Alliance exploded in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; served as a mediator as well as a commander, tempering the cold tactics of war with an eye toward creating lasting peace. King Varian's leadership was tested as he successfully united the Alliance amid the pressures of war. The Horde, however, under the weight of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s command, continued to fracture. The trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; soon rebelled, and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; was consequently placed on lockdown. Warchief Garrosh had sent crews into the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in search of resources to push his war machine forward. In the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, Garrosh seized the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;desiccated heart of an Old God&lt;/a&gt; to use as a tool of war, unleashing horrors upon the sacred valley, and consequently caused tensions to reach a boiling point. This culminated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;invasion of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with the help of a &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Horde rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Varian's success solidified his position as &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;high king&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of all Alliance forces.\nFollowing the events of &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned to be tried in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Before the trial could conclude, aided by &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt; who could manipulate the timelines, Garrosh escaped to , and prevented the orcs from ever drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, creating an untainted &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of . High King Varian Wrynn declared &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on the Iron Horde and formed an Alliance expedition under the command of numerous talented commanders, primarily stationed at &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;, to face the orcish menace.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invaded the Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian personally led the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;counterattack&lt;/a&gt;. The brutal fighting forced both the Alliance and the Horde to retreat, and Varian Wrynn sacrificed his life to allow his allies to escape. King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his father and was entrusted with the command of the Alliance's armies amidst the war against the Burning Legion.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance sought new allies to replenish their depleted ranks and bolster their forces in the event of future Horde aggression. Thanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance recruited both the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; to their coalition.\nFollowing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance and Horde entered a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; against each other. King Anduin Wrynn led &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;an all-out siege on Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, defeating most of the Horde forces stationed there, but Sylvanas managed to &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; the ruins, preventing the Alliance from establishing it as their stronghold in the region. &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts subsequently led to the formal induction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, and in part due to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s assistance, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; also rejoined the Alliance shortly afterward under her leadership, lending its formidable naval might once again to the Alliance cause.\nTowards the end of the conflict, the Alliance joined forces with &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries in an effort to take down &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. However, before fighting could start at Orgrimmar, Varok Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more of his faction's blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. During the duel, Saurfang was able to get Sylvanas to admit that she considered the Horde nothing, which caused the Warchief to kill him and abandon the Horde altogether. In the aftermath of Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's betrayal, the Horde rallied together once more, with most of her former loyalists defecting to his revolution.\nSometime later, the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; and the recently-appointed &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; joined the Alliance.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; ended in an uneasy armistice, not all the Alliance leaders were as supportive of the peace efforts as others, with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; especially doubting its lasting effectiveness, and arguing that the Horde would inevitably attack them regardless. In its aftermath, King Anduin declared &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; as the Lord Commander of the Alliance forces, with the task of finding Sylvanas Windrunner. Despite overwhelmingly massive losses on both sides, in the end, the Alliance won both the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, essentially returning most of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to their sovereign control. It has also made considerable gains in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; in particular, such as rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and reclaiming &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Sylvanas defeated &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and shattered the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance united with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces that were attacking &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, the leaderships of both the Horde and Alliance grouped with Bolvar and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and decided to send their &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to enter the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; in order to rescue the recently-captured &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, the Alliance joined the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, during which they successfully rescued the leaders. Furthermore, each champion personally joined one of the four main &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and aided them in their conflicts. The Alliance, Horde, and the Covenant forces were ultimately victorious, with &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; being killed within the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Zovaal's defeat, the truce between the Alliance and Horde continued to hold. For several years, Turalyon ensured that the Alliance regained its forces lost in the last war. When the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were re-revealed to Azeroth, both factions sent a &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;joint expedition&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. During this time, the Alliance gained the allegiance of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, following their awakening on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and joined the Aspects in their &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Chieftain Hatuun&lt;/a&gt;'s request, he met with a group of &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Arzal%27kal\"&gt;Arzal'kal&lt;/a&gt; who wished redemption for their past sins and ultimately allowed them to join the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and thus the Alliance.\nOrganization.\nThe faction is not a uniform governmental body, but rather a coalition of mutual military and economic aid between many member states, consisting of different races across Azeroth. Diplomacy is key within the Alliance, as the leaders of each member state hold supreme authority over their own politics, including their internal laws, economy, and military forces. The respective leaders hold no obligations to lend these resources to the faction's common cause, and can use them to accomplish their own interests without any consequences in their relationship with the allied powers.\nHowever, the troops and resources deployed to the common cause from the member states or through &lt;a href=\"Hero%27s%20Call%20Board\"&gt;Hero's Call Board&lt;/a&gt;s are not always acting on behalf of their home nation's independent leadership, but often united under common leadership in groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral%20Jes-Tereth\"&gt;Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Naval%20Command\"&gt;Alliance Naval Command&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20High%20Command\"&gt;Alliance High Command&lt;/a&gt; supposedly plays a key role in orchestrating this enormous joint army. The position of de facto leader of the Alliance permanently rests with the patriarch in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;House of Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, or a Regent Lord to serve temporarily in his place. The High King is undisputedly looked to for maintaining the Alliance and its policies, as well as coordination of the workings of the Alliance forces in order to safeguard the Alliance's interests and defense. To help with organizing and leading the Alliance forces, the High King regularly confers with the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s, and diplomats. Villages and settlements not affiliated with any distinct Alliance nation but have sworn fealty to the Alliance maintained by the monarchs of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; pay taxes to those kingdoms in order to sustain the Alliance's upkeep. Decisions concerning the faction as a whole \u2014 such as the induction of new member states \u2014 are traditionally made by being voted on by the full-fledged members' illustrious leaders or their representatives. Those meetings can be called by any of the member state leaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be the heart of the Alliance by a majority of the faction's citizens, and the kingdom of Stormwind is described as the most powerful and influential of the human kingdoms and in fact of the entire multiracial Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, being the home of High King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, acts as the unofficial capital of the Alliance and often serves as the meeting point for leaders of the member states: During the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings%23At%20Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Alliance Elemental Invasion Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, leaders of the Alliance met at the Keep to discuss world issues and mutual defense.\nCulture.\nProud and noble, courageous and wise, the Alliance races work together to preserve order in Azeroth. The Alliance is driven by honor and tradition and are bound together by a sense of brotherhood and a deep commitment to uphold their common noble ideals. The races of the Alliance look out for one another. Every member is expected to provide aid to Alliance members in need, whether they be human, gnome, or otherwise. When united against a common foe, their loyalty to one another and their resolve becomes unquestionable.\nThe Alliance have proven themselves to be fierce combatants, often giving their lives when called for.\nEven now, as always, humans are the glue that holds the Alliance together, being the most numerous and diplomatic of the member races. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;, symbol of the human kingdom of Stormwind, was adopted to also serve as the symbol of the entire Alliance.\nThe concept of cooperation and \"unity\" appears to be an extremely important one to the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was successfully able to unite the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; under his leadership despite their initial differences and internal conflicts, causing &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; to remark how even as the Alliance managed to successfully bind itself ever closer together, the Horde under &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; ripped itself apart. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; once told &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; that if unified, the Alliance was unstoppable even without a navy, and their rallying battle cry at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was \"Stand as one! For the Alliance!\"\nLeadership.\n - \n - \n - \n / \n &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; \n / \n &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt; \nMembership.\n&lt;a href=\"Human%20nation\"&gt;Human nation&lt;/a&gt;s.\ns - The primary race of the Alliance that makes up the majority of their forces. When the human nations of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; learned of the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the human kingdoms strategically united to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and finally end the threat of the vile orcish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Even when the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; ravaged &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the devastated human kingdoms sought refuge in the southern kingdoms, with many brought under the protection and security of the restored &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The humans eventually regrouped and made &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; the heart of the new Alliance. Under the heroic leadership of King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, humanity holds fast to the principles of honor and justice and seeks to maintain the honor and might of the human nations. The humans of the Alliance are determined to reclaim their lost lands and forge a new destiny for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. A destiny that many hope will usher in an age of lasting peace for the Alliance. Following the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his father as the king of Stormwind and High King of the Alliance. They are strongest in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. They also have many strongholds and camps in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following nations remain in the Alliance:\n &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;Horse&lt;/a&gt; - For centuries the humans have been using &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s as mounts.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The Kingdom of Ironforge consists mainly of the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; of dwarves, which still reside in the ancient city of all the dwarven clans. They pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Bronzebeards gained dominance over &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. During the Cataclysm, to prevent the mountain from collapsing, King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; performed a ritual in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; which saved the mountain but the process petrified him into a diamond statue. With its king impaired, Ironforge was left in political turmoil after &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of King Magni, declared her &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; the rightful ruler of the kingdom. In order to prevent civil war, the leaders of each clan formed a council to govern the dwarven races and share the kingdom. Its capital is the city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, located in northern &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Ram\"&gt;Ram&lt;/a&gt; - The Dwarves, living in the high mountains of Khaz Modan, have tamed and befriended the native Barak Tor'ol &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt;s, whom they use as mounts.\n &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; - The Wildhammer train &lt;a href=\"Gryphons\"&gt;Gryphons&lt;/a&gt; to act as mounts and companions, and later introduced them to the other Alliance kingdoms, most notably Stormwind, where their popularity grew tremendously to rival that of the dwarves.\n &lt;a href=\"Boar\"&gt;Boar&lt;/a&gt; - When the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; moved to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; they faced many dangers, from trolls to wild beasts. To counteract the threats, they begun to tame and befriend the local boars. A strong and dangerous &lt;a href=\"Hambone\"&gt;Hambone&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the care of the league.\n&lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;.\n - Heirs to an ancient civilization spanning more than ten thousand years, the reclusive night elves lived peacefully for centuries in the shadowy forests of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; until the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; when they allied with the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. However, the continuous deforesting actions of the orcs in the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; forced them to break away from the Horde and remain allied with the Alliance alone. Their capital was the city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, located on the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href=\"Stormrage\"&gt;completely healed and blessed recently&lt;/a&gt; only to be destroyed by the Horde soon after, subsequently re-settling at least temporarily within their former home &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves make up the bulk of the Alliance forces in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, their ancestral lands. \n - The &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;, \"Those Who Remain Hidden\", were guardians and keepers of ancient knowledge and forgotten lore, a secretive organization based in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Some of its members returned to the night elven society after their long exile to make amends and begin to train new generations of night elven &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\n is the last of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order which he led on the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, founded around the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and formerly close allies of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; - Although the vast majority appeared to be relatively unaligned, several have joined the Alliance as of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, fighting alongside Alliance forces in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Nylaria%20the%20Haunted\"&gt;Nylaria the Haunted&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raize%20Shadespear\"&gt;Raize Shadespear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elerion%20Bladedancer\"&gt;Elerion Bladedancer&lt;/a&gt; apparently led the Illidari delegation to the Alliance, establishing a camp in the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, the former having helped saved Anduin Wrynn's life in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\n Night elves &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; - Raised into undeath as &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s by Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"war%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;war of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, some of them wished to return among their people after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. With the agreement of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and the help of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt;, they managed to rejoin their people and the ranks of the Alliance.\n &lt;a href=\"Saber\"&gt;Saber&lt;/a&gt; - The &lt;a href=\"Nightsaber\"&gt;Nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s are the traditional mounts of the Sentinels, used to regularly patrol and secure their territories, and as companions and hunters. Notable examples include &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadumbra\"&gt;Shadumbra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28nightsaber%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s - Intelligent creatures the elves use as flying mounts, they assist their &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20rider\"&gt;rider&lt;/a&gt;s in combat when necessary. Notable examples include &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snowstorm%20%28hippogryph%29\"&gt;Snowstorm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jai%27alator\"&gt;Jai'alator&lt;/a&gt;, bonded to Shandris Feathermoon.\nThe night elves have many allies from nature:\n&lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\ns - Led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;. Cousins of the dwarves, sharing the lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomes joined with their long-time allies to provide technological wonders like &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s to aid the Alliance in its fight against its enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; called on them for aid. Yet they were forced to decline because they were suffering from their own internal problems, as their long-time capital &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, was invaded by deformed &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in a great betrayal orchestrated by &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;. The gnomes had to flee and find refuge in their cousins' arms in Ironforge, where they built &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt;. After , the Gnomes established &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; and are trying to reconquer their old capital. Grateful to their allies for the hospitality given to them in their time of need, the gnomes have become more dedicated to the Alliance than ever before. They have even begun to adopt the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, the primary religion of their allied neighbors.\n - Only is known to have rejoined his former comrades.\n &lt;a href=\"Mechanostrider\"&gt;Mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt; - The highly intelligent and resilient gnomes have devised their own unique robotic mount to use, the mechanostrider.\n &lt;a href=\"Flying%20machine\"&gt;Flying machine&lt;/a&gt; - Perhaps the greatest and most prominent military contribution of the gnomes to the Alliance as a whole and used since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, these machines have become an indispensable part of the Alliance's air support for years.\n&lt;a href=\"Exodar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\n - Refugees of the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race fleeing their corrupted brethren on their home planet &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei (\"Exiled Ones\" in their native tongue) have been traveling the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; seeking allies to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and its leader &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; who had tricked and corrupted leading members of their people. They eventually crash-landed on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and made peace with the native orcs, until the Legion triggered the &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;orcish onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, and the draenei once again had to flee from the Legion and the forces of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; by stealing the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the satellites of the &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Once again their vessel crash-landed, this time on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They made the \"Exodar\" their home, and formed an alliance with the native &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for joining the Alliance. When the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened, the draenei offered their services in the Alliance's crusade against the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, many kept their pledge of friendship to the Alliance, although some stayed in Outland to heal their former adopted homeworld and those they left behind.\n - A group of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; rejoined their unmutated brethren under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;. Some serve as shaman in the Alliance and some work as laborers within the \"Exodar\" itself.\n - Following the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a group of man'ari eredar followed &lt;a href=\"Arzaal\"&gt;Arzaal&lt;/a&gt; in his quest for repentance and were allowed to rejoin the draenei after a meeting with Prophet Velen.\n &lt;a href=\"Elekk\"&gt;Elekk&lt;/a&gt; - The draenei have brought with them their huge &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt; beasts from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, whom they use as mounts.\n&lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The &lt;a href=\"Tushui\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; is a pandaren faction of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; that has decided to join the Alliance ranks, considering the coalition's code of conduct very similar to their own. The Tushui are living a venerable life through meditation, rigorous training, and moral conviction. They don't have their own capital, but most of them made their home in the human city of Stormwind, along with their leader who can teach aspiring monks of the Alliance their famed combat techniques. The Tushui pandaren are contemplative, focused on abstract ideals of justice and morality, and believe that a principled life is the only one worth living.\n &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20turtle\"&gt;Dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt; - The pandaren have long sought mounts that embody their values: patience and strength. With a naturally armored hide, even gait (no matter how heavy the passenger), and the relaxed attitude that welcomes long journeys, the Dragon Turtle is perfect for the pandaren adventurer.\n&lt;a href=\"Void%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Void elves&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The &lt;a href=\"ren%27dorei\"&gt;ren'dorei&lt;/a&gt; are the exiled &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; followers of the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Umbric\"&gt;Umbric&lt;/a&gt; who sought to harness the corruptive magic of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Attacked by a &lt;a href=\"void%20ethereal\"&gt;void ethereal&lt;/a&gt; who sought to drive them mad and transform them, they were rescued by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had gained mastery of the Void herself on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Accepting her leadership and guidance, they pledged their loyalty to the Alliance. Alleria has vowed to train these void elves to control the shadows within them and to prove themselves to those who doubt or judge their abilities wrong. Their current capital is the &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, teetering on the brink of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Voidstrider\"&gt;Voidstrider&lt;/a&gt; - These shadow-infused striders embodies the elves' commitment to harness the power of the Void in the name of the Alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\n - For untold millennia, the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; waged battles, skirmishes, and sabotage against the Burning Legion throughout the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei most committed to their long crusade would undergo a ritual to become Lightforged, infusing their bodies with the very essence of the Holy Light. They all knew they might not survive their final assault on Argus. However, after finally achieving victory on Argus and ending the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the Army of the Light has undertaken a new mission: protecting Azeroth from rising threats and helping the Alliance push back against Horde aggression. Their current capital is the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", orbiting around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Warframe\"&gt;Lightforged Warframe&lt;/a&gt; - These machines are truly fearsome instruments of war, capable of dealing and withstanding much damage, even capable of flight.\n &lt;a href=\"Vigilant\"&gt;Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; - After the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the former Gatekeeper &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Quoram\"&gt;Vigilant Quoram&lt;/a&gt; has joined the Lightforged draenei abroad the \"Vindicaar\". \n &lt;a href=\"Elekk\"&gt;Elekk Felcrusher&lt;/a&gt; - A longtime companions of the draenei, the stalwart elekk are conditioned to charge headlong into darkness without fear.\n&lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;weyrn&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The Obsidian Warders is a weyrn charged with defending the allies of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and protecting its strongholds. Whether it is deployed to reinforce draconic legions or guard the skies alongside &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, this weyrn is the embodiment of the &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt;'s aegis. Currently under the authority of the &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt;, the Warders trained to be the bulwark that enemy forces will break upon. \nAlliance forces.\nWhile a huge portion of the Alliance's military power consists of representatives from the faction's member states, there are also several examples of organizations within the Alliance which do not belong to any of the member states and instead of answering to a particular racial leader, they are organized by the leader of the Alliance, the High King of Stormwind, and his advisors. However, while these organizations are not tied directly to any of the member states, the sub-organizations within them are often sent by one of the member states.\n &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; - The collective maritime military force of the various members of the Alliance. \n The &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Remaining members of the former &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, who were joined by the new forces of the Alliance with the re-opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; - The military umbrella organization overseeing the Alliance forces that have established themselves throughout Northrend, formerly unified under King Varian Wrynn's command.\n &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; - An elite special ops regiment composed of Alliance veterans, taking part in most Alliance wars. \n &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt; - A fierce army that has historic ties to the island stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, affiliated with both the &lt;a href=\"Admiralty%20of%20Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Admiralty of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. They have joined the forces of the Alliance in an effort to repel the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, gain control of the strategic island and re-open the island to serve as a prison once again. \n - Alliance forces in Pandaria, stationed at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; - The core of Alliance expedition to Draenor, situated in Lunarfall garrison in , led by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. They maintain several outposts throughout various areas of Draenor.\n &lt;a href=\"Wrynn%27s%20Vanguard\"&gt;Wrynn's Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; - Alliance expeditionary forces in Draenor, fighting against their Horde counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Spear\"&gt;Vol'jin's Spear&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;. Their main base of operations is &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt;, located on a small island south of Ashran proper. \n &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Hand of the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; - Alliance forces in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, stationed at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Lion's Watch&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; - An Alliance contingent of soldiers empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther members and allies.\n &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Nation of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; - A city-state founded by &lt;a href=\"magocracy\"&gt;magocrats&lt;/a&gt; who were charged with cataloging and researching every spell, artifact, and magic item known to mankind. It was a staunch supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; until its destruction by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, the mages worked tirelessly to rebuild their magical city under the protection of a magical dome. When completed, they lifted their city to the skies of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The Kirin Tor declared neutrality during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; but later pledged itself to the Alliance after it was discovered that some of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; were abusing their resources to aid the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; left the Kirin Tor due to a vote being decided to let the Horde back into the city during the war against the Legion.\n The &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20Hold\"&gt;Stillpine Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\n - A few high elves have chosen to join the Alliance in recent years (initially to the chagrin of the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;new elven allies&lt;/a&gt;), though their compliance in the secession from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in bitter memories. They can be found scattered in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, formerly in &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; before its destruction, and various minor settlements.\n The &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20renegades\"&gt;Scarlet renegades&lt;/a&gt;, based in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\n The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Originally clerics and warriors, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; created this new martial order of the church to combat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n The feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt;, based at &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; after their victories in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\n The &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Redeemed\", a surviving clan of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; residing in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Nagrand.\n &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;Pearlfin tribe&lt;/a&gt; - A tribe of &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; with their home in &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. They are in constant war against the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;. They were the first natives encountered by the Alliance survivors that shipwrecked on Pandaria's shores. Though initially distrustful of strangers, they became part of the Alliance forces, after it was discovered that hozen were already in league with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \n &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade clan&lt;/a&gt; - A clan of &lt;a href=\"ankoan\"&gt;ankoan&lt;/a&gt; who recently took the fight back to the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;'s doorsteps in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; after they had killed their leader. When the Alliance forces shipwrecked in the region, they befriended the Waveblade while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; allied with the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ankoan%20Tidehunters\"&gt;Ankoan Tidehunters&lt;/a&gt; are ankoan that are &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign%20followers\"&gt;troops&lt;/a&gt; that participate in various &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign%20missions\"&gt;War Campaign missions&lt;/a&gt;.\n - There are some pandaren who seem to affiliated with the Alliance, but are not directly related to the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Mojo%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mojo Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who wandered the world and explored places like &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; on his own instead of on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and befriended the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; shortly after they crash-landed. They have helped spread the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; to the other Alliance races.\nAlthough not officially part of the Alliance, the following groups have allied themselves with the Alliance:\n &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; - There are various Alliance-friendly &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; within the Shrine of Seven Stars located in &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance's primary base of operations in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Westwind%20Rest\"&gt;Westwind Rest&lt;/a&gt; - After being aided in retaking their town, the Pandaren of Westwind Rest have joined the Alliance.\n &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt; - Though not officially aligned with the Alliance, the villagers of Paw'don Village grant Alliance members sanctuary in their village.\n &lt;a href=\"The%20Frostborn\"&gt;The Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; - A mysterious newly discovered faction of frost dwarves. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; thinks they migrated from &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; with many making &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt; their home since there are no records of them in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, those at Frosthold have befriended the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 unlike the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and welcomed all Alliance members into their homes.\n &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt; - The main governing body of the Draenei nation-state in alternate universe's Draenor since 's demise.\n - While mostly &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; for in-game purposes, individual &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; seem to have at one point or another effectively affiliated themselves with the Alliance (whose races overall appear to have an older and deeper affinity for the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; than the Horde), such as &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; during his time in the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and , who helped the draenei annihilate the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Fleet\"&gt;Iron Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in defense of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; after being successfully restored by , and further empowered the Alliance adventurer's legendary ring with its ultimate blessing. Before its destruction and being purified by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; was also friendly towards Alliance players, and hostile to Horde players. &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; was the one who prompted Velen and his followers to reach Azeroth in the first place, urging them to seek out new allies, and later sent &lt;a href=\"General%20Tiras%27alan\"&gt;General Tiras'alan&lt;/a&gt; to help &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; defend &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; from the invading Horde. The very existence of the draenei and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; owes itself to the naaru, and their vessels including the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; are also directly derived from them. \nBases of operations.\nCapital cities\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nNight elves.\nRealizing they needed help to survive in this new world and to oppose the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which chose their continent as its new home, the night elves reluctantly joined the Alliance. Commerce began between &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves, as the two cultures shared values and ideas. The night elves remained withdrawn, however. There are still many places considered too sacred for dwarves or humans to venture into, and only when they\u2019re drunk do they really loosen up around other Alliance races."}

Instead, the name was later given to the next large conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough at war, the two sides have worked together on several occasions to combat larger threats, whether directly or through intermediary organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian and the newly appointed Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; declared an end to open hostilities, so long as both sides uphold honor. However, despite their leader's peaceful intentions and repeated decisive victories when fighting alongside each other during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, tensions persisted between the two sides. The armies clashed in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; where both sides believed the other had a super-weapon that they intended to use on them.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at last made its return, both High King Varian and Warchief Vol'jin were killed in action during the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the Horde for Varian's death, now wish to renew hostilities with the Horde. The newly appointed Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, becomes a focus of Greymane's aggression. Meanwhile, Windrunner seeks to strengthen the Horde by scheming of ways to create new &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; is exacerbated as the Alliance and Horde come to blows on the demon-infested islands.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, with the Legion defeated and Azeroth left scarred by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' final attack, tensions between the two superpowers once again reached a fever pitch as they scrambled for the new &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; resource. As the two sides recruit &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;new allies&lt;/a&gt; to bolster their depleted ranks, the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; begins.\nPrelude.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFive years after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the fragile truce between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; had all but evaporated. In the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; entered a partnership of convenience with the Horde while the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s emerged from ages of solitude to join the Alliance. For another year the armistice held, though tensions continued to mount as worldwide conflicts drew the two sides closer to all-out war and fighting erupted in strategic &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite these frequent skirmishes, the Horde and Alliance often set aside their differences and joined forces to face a number of threats.\nAlliance commanders decided to establish new fortifications at the abandoned &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; towers in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to tighten the noose around their enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde also entered a pact of friendship and mutual assistance with the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, furthering the long-standing enmity between the Revantusk &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who were considered enemies of the Horde.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn time the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; led them through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to wage the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Following the year-long campaign in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde returned to Azeroth with a new ally in the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, the long-missing &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; put an end to 's schemes and returned to reclaim the throne of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Attempts at diplomacy between &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Wrynn soon fell apart as a peace conference in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; was ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Attention quickly turned northward, however, as the looming threat of the bore down on the mortal races of Azeroth.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBolvar Fordragon and Garrosh Hellscream, appointed as the supreme commanders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; respectively, led their forces to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; where they &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;waged war against the Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Though fighting a common enemy, tensions between the Horde and Alliance grew swiftly until spilling over after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. During the resulting &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Varian Wrynn, grief-stricken over the loss of , and the state of the former &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; which the Forsaken held within human captives in order to test on them the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;, lashed out at Thrall and declared war against the Horde. Hostilities continued to escalate for the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, including an &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;aerial battle&lt;/a&gt;, until the Lich King was finally defeated.\nCataclysm.\nThe Shattering.\nWith both factions recovering from war, the Alliance and Horde attempt to resume their tentative peace declared by their respective faction's peace treaty. Yet &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s aggression against the Alliance has not abated. While the Horde was recalling its forces back to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh's forces waylayed an Alliance carrier wrecked at sea. He disposed of most of its crew, reasoning that it was in Horde waters, though a distressed &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; urged him to relent. Garrosh then gave the survivors supplies and rations, informing them that they had witnessed both the Horde's might and the Horde's mercy.\nPolitical tensions continued to rise as the night elves of Darnassus have refused trade with the Horde and barred them from Ashenvale in protest of the Wrathgate. With the Horde's supplies being depleted on account of the war with the Lich King and the unusual droughts affecting &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, things were looking bleak for the Horde. Relations worsen as Twilight Hammer orcs under the guise of Horde forces, kill and skin night elf sentinels to frame the Horde. Then &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; had refused to publicly condemn the night elf massacres; making it seem as if the Horde tacitly supported them. In an effort to quell the rising tensions, attempted to pursue diplomatic talks with his fellow night elf druids. Yet the talks became violent when the druid meeting was attacked by Twilight Hammer orcs believed to be sent by Garrosh Hellscream, acting warchief of the Horde.\nThree years have passed since the military forces of the Alliance and Horde first set foot on the shores of Northrend, and they now wage war amidst the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;disasters&lt;/a&gt; wrought by 's return to the world. The catastrophic &lt;a href=\"Second%20Sundering\"&gt;Second Sundering&lt;/a&gt; left the resources in the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; diminished, making the factions fight for what has been left. Thrall has left the Horde to lead the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts in preventing the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;rift&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; from tearing apart the world, and has appointed the ambitious Garrosh Hellscream as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde in his absence. &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; , convinced that the Horde has remained unchecked for too long, continues to lead the Alliance.\nThe day before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance forces streamed out of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; and marched up the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, besieging &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; as dusk fell. Then, in the heart of the night, they force-marched southward, leaving their campfires burning behind in order to surprise attack &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; at dawn's first light. They also attacked &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the heart of orcish territory, despite the peace that was previously negotiated between them and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, moving to take the Horde settlements there.\nInvasion of Gilneas.\nEmploying the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise a mighty army, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have begun a bold campaign to secure their hold over &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. By orders of the new Warchief of the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken mobilize and move into &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; to secure a port for the Horde in southern Lordaeron. The Forsaken have conquered much of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and have been battering the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; with their siege weapons. The Forsaken soon aligned themselves with &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Wolfcult\"&gt;Gilnean Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt; and helped him infiltrate Gilneas so that he could spread the worgen curse and sow civil discord in Gilneas. The &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; then caused the Greymane Wall and many of the nation's defenses to fall, allowing the Forsaken to invade freely. The &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt;, now transformed into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, attempt to fight off the invaders as best they can. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; arrive in Gilneas, bringing both vital military aid and the truth behind the worgen curse. Likewise, Orcs reinforce the Forsaken forces, causing an escalation into an all-out battle between the Alliance and the Horde in the region. The Forsaken, against the orders of the Warchief to cease production, unleash their devastating &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; against Gilneas. Many of the survivors flee across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, where the night elves grant them sanctuary.\nAfter the Gilnean refugees settled in Darnassus and Gilneas was re-inducted into the Alliance, King Genn Greymane traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to plan with King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; the Gilneas warfront. With the power-hungry Forsaken assaulting the Alliance in the north, the potential of Gilneas for an Alliance foothold in the north, and understanding the plight of their new allies; the king's finest were sent to ensure victory \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nLed by High Commander &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;, the 7th Legion fleet arrived to the shores of Gilneas, where they discovered a large Horde fleet, likely the fleet that was coming with the Gunship during the first phase of the invasion. To clear a way for landing troops, the 7th Legion used Gnomish submarines to blow up the enemy ships. As the Horde's fleet was destroyed the 7th Legion landed troops and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; was liberated by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken command had ordered a counter-attack on the city but it was then discovered that the remaining Hordes forces were wiped out by the worgen of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; led by Lord &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; worgen led by &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;. With the mainland under Worgen control and the city liberated by the 7th Legion, the Forsaken forces fled back to the Gilnean coast, making their last stand. Gilneas was eventually freed by the Alliance and officially rejoined it for the first time since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. After that, the Alliance began to push further into Lordaeron, with the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Clan\"&gt;Stormpike Clan&lt;/a&gt; brigade marching into the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the mages of Dalaran reinforcing the Alliance from the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s crater and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, and the Gilneans retaking &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nForsaken offensive.\nThe Forsaken forces later march onto the town of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and annihilated most Alliance life with in the region by deploying a potent strain of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; led the ones who managed to escape Southshore and fled to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt; is left inhospitable, and will be so for several decades. The ramifications of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; forced the high echelons of the Horde to reconsider the free use of such a potent weapon. Instead, the Horde has issued a diluted version of the Forsaken Blight for the Forsaken to use. The town of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt; was later finally destroyed by the Forsaken, concluding the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; campaign initiated by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; years ago. Some &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Refugee\"&gt;Hillsbrad Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s followed Magistrate Henry Maleb to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where they have been taking refuge. A few Hillsbrad residents and &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Burnside\"&gt;Magistrate Burnside&lt;/a&gt; stayed behind and led a resistance but were eventually defeated and imprisoned by the Forsaken war machine. Those who stayed to defend Hillsbrad eventually became prisoners in what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsaken prison where the mad &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; cruelly experiments on his prisoners and even fellow Forsaken. When the other Forsaken discover that Forsaken are being turned mindless, he is punished for his ill-doings.\nEven with Gilneas falling into the hands of the Forsaken, the fighting between the Gilnean worgen and the Forsaken continues. Bloodfang worgen who had recently allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed three Orc gunships that had arrived. The ships were full of supplies, weapons and soldiers. Later, the Forsaken kill some of the Hillsbrad refugees on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and resurrected them, bolstering Forsaken forces and somewhat making up for the loss of the three &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; gunships. However, after this attack, many of the Hillsbrad refugees decide to take the Worgen curse offered by Darius, rather than be resurrected as Forsaken. Later, the Forsaken discovered that lord &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; are having a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt;, and Sylvanas sent a squadron of elite &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Veteran Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Forteski\"&gt;Master Forteski&lt;/a&gt; to trap and slay the Worgen leaders. However, the Forsaken soon discovered that instead of trapping an enemy, they were trapped themselves. As a result, the whole squadron of elite Forsaken Troopers were destroyed.\nA convoy of &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Veteran Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s and Forsaken catapults were ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; while attempting to cross &lt;a href=\"Olsen%27s%20Farthing\"&gt;Olsen's Farthing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The ambush resulted in all those Forsaken troopers being killed and the destruction of the Forsaken catapults. &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Torok\"&gt;Warlord Torok&lt;/a&gt; sent Sea Dogs to fight the Hillsbrad worgen that were swimming to the &lt;a href=\"Decrepit%20Fields\"&gt;Decrepit Fields&lt;/a&gt; from Fenris Isle. The Sea Dogs attacked the Hillsbrad worgen and the worgen were eventually defeated after killing many of their ranks.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, sneaked their way into Gilneas and aided the Gilneas Liberation Front in retaking Gilneas City. Together, the Alliance forces were able to neutralize &lt;a href=\"Rutsak%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Rutsak's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadwatch%20Outpost\"&gt;Dreadwatch Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken forces eventually had to fall back to Silverpine Forest but not before recovering the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; and the Gilnean traitors, whom they raised to undeath as Forsaken allies. The Gilneas Liberation Front continued to harass Forsaken forces in Silverpine while the 7th Legion retook &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s in the Gilneas Liberation Front used their bear form in guerilla warfare against &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Front\"&gt;Forsaken Front&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the loss of a few Horde battalions. Eventually, the Horde forces learn of this tactic, and it becomes ineffective after counter-measures are implemented.\nEventually, the tide turned. The worgen and their Alliance allies were driven back. The town of &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; was conquered by Forsaken forces and its magi inhabitants converted to Forsaken. Another town, &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, was burned to the ground and the Alliance's battle plans were stolen thanks to Lord Godfrey's guidance. In a final push, Alliance and Gilnean forces met the Forsaken army on the &lt;a href=\"Battlefront\"&gt;Battlefront&lt;/a&gt; for one final battle. The Forsaken emerged victorious as the Gilneas Liberation Front was coerced to retreat after Sylvanas kidnapped Lorna Crowley, and blackmailed &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; with threats to raise Lorna as an undead slave. The celebration was short-lived though as Lord Godfrey and his allies unexpectedly betrayed the Horde and assassinated Sylvanas. When Sylvanas was brought back to life, she remains determined to get her revenge on Godfrey and the Alliance, and the Alliance's push on Silverpine was stemmed.\nGilneas was not lost to the Alliance, Sylvanas' leading the invasion into the area was halted by Godfrey's betrayal. Currently, the only assaults by the Horde are &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;by sea&lt;/a&gt;, as they are attempting to re-establish a land base in Gilneas, having lost all of them prior. The invasion by sea, which is ongoing, has met an issue as the Gilnean forces have been heavily reinforced by the Alliance, currently, the Horde has been unable to properly re-establish a land base on the coast, as the Alliance has met them to deter or repel these attempts.\nFollowing the events at Silverpine Forest, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; have since been fighting a guerrilla war with the Forsaken forces at Hillsbrad. They are later found allying with the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; and have been amassing their forces at &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the efforts of and Horde adventurers, the Bloodfang and Stormpike coalition had their ranks thinned and their plans to launch an all-out attack were uncovered. &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; asked for reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt;, but were denied by , who despises the Forsaken's methods and tactics in their campaign. Cromush panics at the Frostwolf Clan's abandonment but later composes himself and sends Horde adventurers to blow up the Alliance vanguard forces before their offensive on Hillsbrad could begin.\nForsaken forces are later found establishing &lt;a href=\"Galen%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Galen's Fall&lt;/a&gt; for their impending invasion on the nation of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. To aid them in their efforts, they have recruited the fallen prince of Stromgarde, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. He aids Horde adventurers in taking the legendary sword, &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, so that the Forsaken may use it as a weapon for the Dark Lady.\nForsaken forces have since tried to invade the Hinterlands and launched an all-out assault on the &lt;a href=\"Highvale\"&gt;Highvale&lt;/a&gt; high elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. The combined Alliance forces were able to drive back the Forsaken assault and retain their hold over Quel'Danil Lodge.\nWith the weakening of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; after the War against the Lich King, the Alliance forces led by have claimed the western part of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; forces led by have claimed the eastern part of the city. After annihilating the remnant Scourge forces in the area, the Alliance and Horde fought each other for control of the whole city. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken \u2014 their ranks bolstered by the use of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise their slain foes \u2014 pushed the Alliance out of the city and conquered Andorhal.\nOther conflicts in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; fight against the orcish &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, having recently rejoined the Horde, battle for control of this strategic mountainous region. The Twin Peaks are crucial for staging effective offensives against the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, who currently control the Twilight Highlands.\nTo the south, the humans of &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt; are able to launch an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt; orcs in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and steal supplies from the town. The humans had managed to defeat the orcish army, pushing it all the way to Stonard and laying siege to the town. However, the defenders of Stonard were able repel the siege, but never recovered the stolen supplies. The outcome ended undetermined as the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; managed to save &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;, but failed to seize control of the swamps, as their armies were defeated by the humans of &lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to secure their kingdom's back yard.\nThe Horde have also conquered &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt; from its previous inhabitants and have been launching raids on the Alliance forces of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. They are planning to weaken the Alliance so they can wrest control of the &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Mines\"&gt;Nethergarde Mines&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, the mainline Alliance and Horde forces turned their attention to this previously neglected region. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; expanded eastward, setting up new camps such as Stormfeather Outpost in former &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; territory. The Horde presence was augmented with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, who took over &lt;a href=\"Hiri%27watha\"&gt;Hiri'watha&lt;/a&gt;, converting it into &lt;a href=\"Hiri%27watha%20Research%20Station\"&gt;Hiri'watha Research Station&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken then had tried to lay siege to the &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil\"&gt;Quel'Danil&lt;/a&gt; but the defenders of the Alliance managed to repel the attack.\nOff the coast of Tol Barad, &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Hellscream's Reach&lt;/a&gt; fought over control of the isle against the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzshara.\nAll-out battles have erupted in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Off the coast of Kalimdor, on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins were caught in the crossfire between an Alliance fleet and a Horde ship that contained an important passenger. Seeing as the Alliance would have killed all who witnessed their attack, the goblins chose to ally themselves with the stranded &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and fought against the Alliance forces. After rescuing a captured &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance and taking back control of the cartel from &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;'s greedy schemes, the Bilgewater Cartel was sent to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and was officially inducted into the Horde. The Bilgewater Cartel has since established a new city in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, to replace the loss of &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. In a show of good faith to their new allies, the goblins have reshaped Azshara to resemble a giant Horde symbol. They have also begun constructing a massive war fleet for Garrosh Hellscream. Yet they have also come into conflict with the naga, &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20tribe\"&gt;Blackmaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs, and the Alliance forces of &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde was able to prevent a potential alliance between the Blackmaw tribe and the Alliance by framing the Alliance with an assault on their tribe. They also drove back most of the Alliance forces to Ashenvale after assassinating their commanders and destroying their ancients.\nAshenvale offensive.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;'s elven defenses weakened, Warchief Garrosh Hellscream finally decides to take the night elven forest for the Horde. Garrosh personally led his troops into the neighboring borders of Ashenvale. While his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt; had made considerable progress over the course of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, it is a far cry from the ambitions that Warchief Hellscream desires to achieve. Garrosh plans to create a massive city in the heart of the forest, one with the potential to rival &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in size and power. With rich minerals ripe for the taking, and all of the tools needed to see his people grow, Garrosh surges viciously through the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; ranks and cuts a swathe of destruction straight to the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Grove\"&gt;Silverwing Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Having brought down a number of tamed &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; captives from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; that he domesticated by holding their young hostage, Garrosh plans to see his dreams of expansion realized.\nHis attack on the Grove results in a decisive Horde victory. Garrosh reflects on how the forest that gave &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; such harsh resistance is falling, piece by piece, and wonders what the mighty Grom would have made of this triumph. He concludes that not even Thrall could deny his prowess at this point, and will hail him as the champion of the orcish race and the entire Horde. Garrosh's plan is twofold - he had gained knowledge of a meeting between the leaders of the Alliance and strikes at this point in order to lure out &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. As he had expected, the priestess \u2014 along with Alliance reinforcements \u2014 arrives on the scene to relieve the waning sentinels, though the Horde unleashes the magnataur upon the Alliance's ranks. In the ensuing chaos, Tyrande was struck down and wounded by orc archers. Confident in a victory, Garrosh also takes the fray.\nThe battle is interrupted by the arrival of worgen reinforcements led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, who proceed to fight back several magnataur. On several occasions, Garrosh and Varian clashed and did battle; with both leaders matching each other's attack, blow by blow, and killing all who interfered with their duel. Though evenly matched at first, Varian eventually gained an advantage. Varian had been fighting with an in-explicit focus and unyielding vigor. While Garrosh was tired, Varian was still full of stamina, which allowed Varian to press on his attack. Garrosh is fought back at this point, and Varian succeeds in wounding him and disarming Gorehowl. A dying magnataur separates the two combatants, and Garrosh composes himself. He prepares to rush at Varian once more, though is held back by several &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;; urging Garrosh to retreat. Garrosh grudgingly complies, though not before swearing to kill Varian himself.\nSince then, General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; has taken advantage of their victory at Ashenvale to commission more fortifications and outposts at Ashenvale's Alliance-controlled borders. Yet the night elves' troubles are far from over, as an enormous volcano has erupted in central Ashenvale. As the night elves struggle to deal with the chaos caused by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde is seizing what it perceives to be a golden opportunity.\nSecond Ashenvale offensive.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh took on the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, and as one of his first campaigns, he led the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in taking &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde, with the help of his new goblin allies. After a successful attack on Talrendis Point in Azshara, the Horde was able to take control of all of Azshara. As the grip of the Horde tightened in northern Kalimdor, the night elves began to test the defenses of the Horde outposts in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to siege both the &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Ramparts\"&gt;Mor'shan Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;. With the arrival of Horde reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde Guards at the Mor'shan Ramparts were able to defeat the attacking Sentinels. Pushing north from the Ramparts, the Horde took control of &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Outpost\"&gt;Silverwing Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and an orcish warlock even poisoned the Forest Heart, which struck a huge blow to the Sentinels. By poisoning the Forest Heart, and also by using demonic magics, the Horde was also able to break the siege of Splintertree Post. Horde covert operatives killed the commanders leading the siege of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt;, despite the death of the Sin'dorei Ambassador stationed in the keep. With the successful defense of Splintertree and the Lumber Camp, the Horde was free to continue the push west.\nAfter the sieges of Splintertree and Warsong Lumber Camp were broken, eastern Ashenvale was under complete Horde control, save for &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Song\"&gt;Forest Song&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde armies pressed westward, taking control of &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt; by using a corrupted form of a water elemental, and also began an attack on Raynewood Tower and &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Retreat\"&gt;Raynewood Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, killing many of the druids and &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt; stationed there. However, the Horde was not able to deliver the finishing blow at Raynewood, as the Druid leader continued to revive the Dryad defenders of the post. The Horde even started firebombing &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, and with victory in sight, they moved in to take &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few remaining Alliance encampments. If Maestra's Post fell, all of Darkshore and eventually Teldrassil would be vulnerable to continued Horde attacks. While the siege of Maestra's Post was beginning, the Horde engineers at the captured Alliance base of Silverwind Refuge were finishing up a giant bomb, designed to be used on the night elves in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the Horde battalions started to move south to reinforce Krom'gar's army in Stonetalon, bringing the bomb south with them.\nThis success was short-lived, however, when the mobilized armies of the &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; were able to break the siege of Maestra's Post, and pushed the Horde out of Astranaar. After pushing the Horde out of Astranaar, the Alliance armies reinforced Raynewood retreat, breaking the siege there by taking on the shade of the Ancient spirit of Shadumbra, and killing many Horde soldiers and destroying their demolishers in the process. Alliance heroes rebuilt &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;Dartol's Rod&lt;/a&gt; which allowed them control over the &lt;a href=\"Furbolgs\"&gt;Furbolgs&lt;/a&gt; near Silverwind refuge, using them to weaken the Horde army there enough to allow the Sentinel's to retake the camp. The Alliance military moved back eastward, cleansing the tainted Forest Heart and killing the Horde overseer at the Lumber Camp, along with a Sin'dorei Ambassador. At this point, only pockets of Horde resistance remained, bringing the war full circle, in favor of the Alliance.\nDuring the siege of Orgrimmar, the night elven sentinels were able to push through Eastern Ashenvale, and eventually reach the Capital City of Orgrimmar, bringing the gates of the city down with Glaive throwers. Following the siege, Azshara remains firmly in the hands of the Horde after the battle of Talrendis Point, in return for the relinquishment of Horde outposts in Ashenvale.\nBarrens.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; the Barrens have been split into the Northern Barrens and the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. King Varian Wrynn has not backed down from Garrosh's aggression, nor has the rest of the Alliance. In the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde defensive post &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Rampart\"&gt;Mor'shan Rampart&lt;/a&gt; is under attack by the Alliance. In turn &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; is now under attack by Horde forces.\nSince Warchief Garrosh wants to defeat the night elves and conquer the whole of Kalimdor under the banner of the Horde, offensives into the Southern Barrens have been sent in response and secured territory once belonging to the Horde for Varian and his allies. The humans of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; have sent their army and tried to establish a military line between night elf territory and Theramore. The Alliance forces were able to take the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; just before the Cataclysm affected the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to expand into the Northern Barrens. Alliance forces streamed out of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; and marched up the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, besieging the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; as dusk fell. Then, in the heart of the night, they force-marched southward, leaving their campfires burning behind, and overran the Horde forces at Honor's Stand at dawn's first light. The Alliance has since been trying to fortify themselves in Honor Stand after the Cataclysm left their defenses in disarray while also dealing with the Horde resistance in &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Hill\"&gt;Hunter's Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Southern Barrens, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces have invaded the eastern lands while the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has maintained control of the west. The Alliance has constructed a new &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;military outpost&lt;/a&gt; to try to solidify their control of their new territory while the Horde has &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;done the same&lt;/a&gt; to prevent further Alliance expansion. The &lt;a href=\"Battlescar\"&gt;central region&lt;/a&gt; between the two forts has become a war zone as the factions fight for control. The Alliance launched an attack on the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; and the forces of Bael'dun Keep helped by firebombing Camp Taurajo. &lt;a href=\"General%20Hawthorne\"&gt;General Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt; had tried to avoid civilian casualties by opening a gap on the eastern part of the camp so that the civilians can escape. However despite Alliance efforts to preserve civilian lives, the heavy artillery and airstikes fired from Bael'dun Keep caused many Horde casualties, along with civilian casualties who died from fatal injuries or opportunistic attacks from savage &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s. The destruction of Camp Taurajo has stirred the Horde and bolstered their resolve. The Horde has begun efforts to drive the Alliance back as a result. The new &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Bloodhilt\"&gt;Horde general&lt;/a&gt; made an example of General Hawthorne by sending Horde adventurers to assassinate him on the streets of the &lt;a href=\"Battlescar\"&gt;Battlescar&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to the Horde, Hawthorne had worked to avoid civilian casualties, and his death at the hands of the Horde served to cement Alliance resolve in the region. In the initial counter-attack, &lt;a href=\"Gann%20Stonespire\"&gt;Gann Stonespire&lt;/a&gt;, already upset by the dwarves of Bael Modan wiping out his tribe, parts way with the Horde, and leads an angry mob of Tauren civilians to attack &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; to avenge the destruction of Taurajo and the killing of the Stonespire Tribe. While mortally wounded by &lt;a href=\"Marley%20Twinbraid\"&gt;Marley Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt;, Gann manages to blow up the dwarven fortress known as &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Keep\"&gt;Bael'dun Keep&lt;/a&gt;, ironically killing Marley Twinbraid. Marley's father &lt;a href=\"General%20Twinbraid\"&gt;General Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt; later finds the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Weezil%20Slipshadow\"&gt;Weezil Slipshadow&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblin, in the ruins of Bael'dun Keep and desires vengeance against the Horde for the destruction of Bael Modan. He orchestrates a retaliatory strike against the goblin workers in &lt;a href=\"Frazzlecraz%20Motherlode\"&gt;Frazzlecraz Motherlode&lt;/a&gt;. He sends Alliance adventurers to kill every goblin miner they can find and blow up the mine. Following General Hawthorne's death, General Twinbraid takes command of the Alliance armies in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther conflicts in Kalimdor.\nThe Alliance have since sought out new ways to expand north, using their navy to establish a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Coast\"&gt;Merchant Coast&lt;/a&gt; and attempting to re-establish themselves in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde established &lt;a href=\"Krom%27gar%20Fortress\"&gt;Krom'gar Fortress&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt; oversees all Horde military operations in the region. The forces of Northwatch have broken through the Horde's blockade in the south and occupied &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Valley\"&gt;Windshear Valley&lt;/a&gt;, to the west. From the northern front comes an onslaught of night elf soldiers. Krom'gar's army has so far been able to defend themselves from their assaults and have expanded to go on the offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the area. The Alliance enters an alliance of convenience with the Grimtotem clan of &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20Post\"&gt;Grimtotem Post&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance forces agree to supply the Grimtotem there with weapons in exchange for protection from the Horde and free reign to move freely through their territory. Together, the Grimtotem and the Alliance beat back the Horde and slay four of the Horde's most fearsome generals at the battle for &lt;a href=\"Greatwood%20Vale\"&gt;Greatwood Vale&lt;/a&gt;. After which, the Alliance continues to kill Horde reinforcements from Ashenvale and Azshara hoping that enough dead bodies will deter the Horde from advancing. Krom'gar grows more paranoid and orders the bombing of &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt; while also slaughtering their allies in &lt;a href=\"Cliffwalker%20Post\"&gt;Cliffwalker Post&lt;/a&gt;. Warchief Garrosh Hellscream arrives in the aftermath of the chaos and punishes Krom'gar for his ill-doings. Garrosh then disbands Krom'gar's army and focuses his efforts on the campaign in Desolace and the Southern Barrens.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde have employed the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; to attack the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. Having uncovered the Shatterspear's war plans, the night elves of Lor'danel launched an offensive on the trolls and attacked the Shatterspear tribe, destroying their village and nearly wiping them out.\nOff the coasts of Tanaris and Tol Barad, the Horde has scored naval victories over the Alliance.\nGreat Sea.\nThe war even extends to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; where naval battles are fought for control of key trade routes.\nTides of War.\nQuest for Pandaria.\nWhile on reconnaissance for the mission for the upcoming battle against Theramore the \"&lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Warchief's Fist&lt;/a&gt;\" stations itself off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Aldrek\"&gt;Captain Aldrek&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Horde presence causes the Alliance to send the \"&lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt;\" under the command of &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Heller\"&gt;Captain Heller&lt;/a&gt; to monitor them.\nBy the time and &lt;a href=\"Stormstout\"&gt;Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; found themselves aboard each ship (the pandaren having been separated at sea), the captains agreed to send a diplomat to each ship in order to ensure peace. In reality, both captains ended up imprisoning &lt;a href=\"Baenan\"&gt;Baenan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nita\"&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance and Horde diplomat respectively, in order to ensure that their demands would be met with. However, this action would ensure a mutiny would rise up against Heller, while Chen would decide to free the imprisoned Baenan. \nThe \"Warchief's Fist\" would ultimately be destroyed when &lt;a href=\"Talithar%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Talithar Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt; decided to aid in Chen and Baenan in their escape attempt by detonating all the gunpowder ammunition for the ship's cannons. At the same time the \"Elwynn\" would be destroyed during the mutiny against Heller, who was killed by .\nThe only known survivors of this incident are Chen, Li Li, Nita, Baenan, \u200e, Atropa, and .\nAttack on Theramore Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, incensed at the lingering &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; presence on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, resolved to crush the nation of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. Shortly before calling a meeting between his fellow Horde leaders to voice this notion, he devises a strategy to wipe the isle out completely. A &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragon\"&gt;Blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; escort is slain (presumably by Garrosh's agents), and the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a powerful item capable of augmenting the destructive capability of already-formidable weapons of destruction\u2014is delivered to the warchief. Some of the Horde leaders are dubious of this attack, and voice opinions against it. Regardless, it is set in stone, and the assault begins.\n, , , , and are present to rally their troops for the war, while and send and two blood elven ships of warriors to assist on their behalf. Similarly, sends and a Forsaken regiment on hers. The Horde begins their campaign by conquering &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The tauren and trolls marched from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;, assaulting the Alliance outpost from the west. Meanwhile, the Forsaken and blood elves sail from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and launch a naval attack from the east and the orcs finishes the assault by attacking from the north, using &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic magic to summon &lt;a href=\"lava%20elemental\"&gt;lava elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to besiege Northwatch and decimate the outpost and its Alliance defenders. After a long delay to entice the Horde's bloodlust, Garrosh eventually leads the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;, which has also fallen. After looting the fort's siege weapons to be used for their attack on Theramore Isle, the Horde marches on to &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Jaina Proudmoore herself gains knowledge of this looming attack, thanks to a disheartened Baine Bloodhoof's prior warning. Jaina scrambles to defend her home, quickly earning the support of King and his top generals, including and . She also gains the reactionary support of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, who agree to send several mages (including himself) to act as a deterrent, reasoning that doing nothing would be tacit support of Garrosh's war. The defense of Theramore is ill-fated, however: Garrosh reveals that the entire ordeal had been a feint attack, in order to gather the best and brightest of the Alliance in one place, and then annihilate them with a Focusing Iris-empowered &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance discover this too late, and the nation of Theramore is utterly obliterated.\nJaina is horrified by the loss of all she had worked for and the deaths of her friends and people. She travels to beseech the Kirin Tor once more and demands their aid against the Horde. Though committed to making sure Garrosh Hellscream will answer for Rhonin's death, the Kirin Tor are unwilling to give Jaina their support to destroy Orgrimmar: having just lost their leader as a result of getting involved in the war and their belief that Jaina's plans could lead to the deaths of many innocents who had nothing to do with the bombing of Theramore. King Varian, too, is wary of simply attacking Orgrimmar head on, and instead advises caution. King Varian and Prince Anduin are also against using dishonorable tactics to fight the war. The Horde in the aftermath of Theramore's fall has set up an effective naval blockade of Kalimdor. While the Alliance regrouped to rebuild their fleet and counterattack the Horde, Jaina was too impatient to work with the Alliance and instead went to fight the Horde using her own methods.\nJaina eventually poises herself to destroy &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation with the stolen &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; however, is able to stay her hand. Instead, she uses the Iris to summon an army of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to save the Alliance fleet, which was sent to besiege &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and eventually Orgrimmar. The Horde's enthralled &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt;s nearly annihilated the fleet if it wasn't for the intervention of Jaina Proudmoore. With the Alliance fleet rescued, Jaina and the Alliance fleet remnants sailed to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, routing any Horde presence in that area and reclaiming the ruined Alliance outpost, thus ending the Horde's blockade of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the aftermath of these events, Jaina's restraint in the face of despair endears her to the high council of the Kirin Tor, who vote her in as their new leader. Jaina herself maintains that while her black rage against the Horde had dissipated (according to her, perhaps partly wrought on by residual energy of the mana bomb), she still fully believes that Garrosh must be removed from power for the good of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and is therefore perhaps not cut out to lead a neutral faction. What becomes of this remains to be seen.\nThe aftermath of this turn of events for the Horde is equally dark: Vol'jin, having privately given up on all hope for Garrosh, falls back to his isles to plot his next move. Baine is somewhat relieved that Garrosh had called off his immediate blockades and conquests, though is stunned to learn it is simply a means to an end\u2014Garrosh now intends to wage a war of genocide against the Alliance rather than conquest. Thrall himself is guilt-ridden for how far Garrosh has been allowed to go, holding himself responsible.\nGarrosh proclaims that all men, women, and children are to enlist in the Horde's war against the Alliance, and any found shirking their duties will answer to the Kor'kron, now run by the ruthless &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blackrock\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; forces. The slightest hint of betrayal is brutally snuffed out by Malkorok, as both Kelantir and Farley learn to their sorrow; and some of the Horde's more moderate races essentially find themselves held hostage for their good behavior, such as the neighboring trolls and tauren, geographically most at risk of Garrosh's wrath.\nInvasion of Pandaria.\nPandaria.\nThe war eventually spreads to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;: a naval battle between the Alliance and the Horde left the survivors stranded on the beaches of Pandaria. Rescue parties of those factions' elite soldiers set out to explore the mysterious, fog-shrouded continent and establish a foothold on the newly discovered land. Its peace was shattered as a result of the conflict. Both factions try to gain the favor of local &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and other races such as the &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; in order to add their strength to their own armies and spread their influence over Pandaria.\nOne of the major battles which took place in &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Serpent's Heart&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the unleashing of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Sha of Doubt&lt;/a&gt; due to a tremendous surge of negative energy which weakened the malicious entity's shackles. Most of the forces were obliterated as a result of this, but commanders of both factions (&lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;) survived and were taken to &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; for recuperation. Still, as the Alliance and Horde explored Pandaria, they began to help the native population defend themselves from grave threats such as the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt;, and others.\nThe Skyseeker and the Wandering Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;The Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;, an Alliance gunship that was escorting Horde prisoners from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, somehow crashed on the great turtle-island &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;. The factions were eventually discovered by the turtle-island's adventuring &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; denizens and were helped in repelling the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Saurok\"&gt;Saurok&lt;/a&gt;. Then, both factions have agreed to heal the wounded turtle after the wreck of the Skyseeker was dislodged. The community of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; were divided however, as the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui&lt;/a&gt; expressed their interest in lending their aid to the Alliance; where as the &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; found themselves closer to the Horde's way of life and these decisions have turned the old comrades into sworn enemies.\nPurge of Dalaran.\nTwo months following the rediscovery of Pandaria, the main and &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Offensive\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces finally arrive on the myth-shrouded continent. Both the Alliance and Horde land on opposite sides of the beach of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; and established their main bases of operations: &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict at &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; reached its peak, with both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fighting each other to drive their enemies from the new continent. While the Alliance tries to stem the occupation by Horde forces by freeing the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; from Horde control and thus gaining the pandaren's favor, Garrosh had the Horde tear through &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; ruins to discover more information about the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient mogu artifact of immense power. Not wanting to waste orc lives for such a dangerous endeavor, delegates this task to the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elven\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, neglecting to warn them of the mogu danger and resulting in several blood elven casualties. himself is incensed at this callous disregard for his people's welfare, and rifts continue to form between the Regent Lord and the Warchief. The Alliance, discovering Garrosh's intent to find the Divine Bell through their own that infiltrated his ranks, secured the bell first and sought to protect it within the city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. herself personally placed wards and enchantments on Darnassus to protect it from any would-be thieves. However, the Horde calls upon agents of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; to assist in circumventing Jaina's protections, and several Horde members succeed in subtly entering the city and stealing the Bell from the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. They teleport the Divine Bell outside the city, subsequently handing it to .\nTo the Sunreavers' surprise, however, their involvement in the theft of the Divine Bell was uncovered by the current ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina Proudmoore, who proceeded to expel the Sunreavers from the Kirin Tor, imprisoning all those who surrendered peacefully inside the Violet Citadel, and putting to the sword all those who resisted. She calls upon the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and several Alliance troops to assist with the purge. In the early stages of the purge, many Sunreavers are killed in action while others are killed while attempting to flee, and many more (including bewildered civilians) are sent to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; as prisoners of war.\nIn a desperate attempt to locate and break out the Sunreavers, led a strike force within the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, fighting his way through the city to forewarn the unaware Sunreavers of the impending arrest, securing reliable escape routes for those broken out, and attacking the Alliance and the Silver Covenant. Rommath succeeds in his mission, culminating in locating and breaking Aethas out of his imprisonment in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath and Aethas escape the city and return to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, where Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; are overseeing portals funneling in the escaped Sunreavers. Relations between Lor'themar and Garrosh break down, as well as putting an end to the talks between the regent lord and &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that they were secretly engaging in in order to bring Quel'Thalas back into the Alliance. Lor'themar is also enraged at Jaina's actions, even calling her a witch and giving a speech in which he declares his belief the modern Horde exists because of supposed Alliance bigotry. Though driven back to Hellscream's Horde, Lor'themar hopes dearly that Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;new treasure&lt;/a&gt;, bought with the blood of Lor'themar's people, destroys him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; prepare to mobilize &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath states that Theron himself would make a fine Warchief, and the regent lord notes that it may indeed come to that, demanding his blades and vowing that the next move will belong to him.\nFollowing the purge, Jaina meets with King Varian Wrynn and pledges the Kirin Tor to the Alliance. Varian, upon hearing about the purge, reveals to Jaina in disappointment that he was attempting to bring the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance through secret diplomatic means, and that by attacking &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;their people&lt;/a&gt; she has forced their hand. An unapologetic Jaina states that such endeavours are foolish as once &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; means always Horde and that he should not show weakness of such a sort. Varian returns to the war, with only the unified Alliance at his side.\nLiberation of Echo Isles.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, having returned to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; with his beloved &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and their newborn child, is roped into Garrosh's conflict after the Warchief attempts (and fails) to murder &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Narrowly surviving the attempt on his life with the help of &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and Horde heroes, Vol'jin has them contact Thrall and save the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; from Garrosh's tyranny. Thrall leaves to do so, reiterating what his vision of the Horde\u2014when it was simply an idea in the desert of Durotar\u2014had first entailed.\nThrall finds the isles under martial law, the Darkspear rounded up by Thrall's very own &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. After relieving the isles of their control, Thrall ponders how best to deal with Garrosh, concluding that simply challenging him for the right to the Horde would be ill-advised at this point. Instead, he takes up leadership of the isles in the Darkspear heroes' absence, and plans to confer with Vol'jin before making any rash moves.\nFate of the Divine Bell.\nAfter hearing about the Horde's acquisition of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; began searching for a means to counter its power. His research has led him to an item known as the Harmonic Mallet. The Harmonic Mallet was last seen in the hands of the Monkey King. The tomb of the &lt;a href=\"Monkey%20King\"&gt;Monkey King&lt;/a&gt; is located in &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;, where he and his mogu adversary are frozen in jade. As legend has it, the Monkey King and a &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt; named the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jade%20Warlord\"&gt;The Jade Warlord&lt;/a&gt;\" were in the middle of a duel until both of them somehow became petrified in jade. Anduin discovered an incantation to release him from the jade imprisonment but it would release the Jade Warlord as well. After the Alliance champion defeats the Jade Warlord, the Monkey King asks the champion to solve his three riddles in exchange for the whereabouts of the &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Mallet\"&gt;Harmonic Mallet&lt;/a&gt;: an instrument used by the Pandaren rebels in ancient times to counter the mogu's Divine Bell by turning its power into pure harmony. After solving his riddles, the Monkey King revealed that he had to break the mallet and sent his minions to hide its pieces in the far away corners of Pandaria in order to prevent it from falling into Mogu hands. Anduin and the Alliance player then go on a quest to reassemble the Harmonic Mallet.\nWhen news reached the Alliance that Horde forces were amassing in huge numbers at &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Emperor's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, everyone expected Garrosh to use the Divine Bell. Knowing that time was of the essence, Anduin stole the Harmonic Mallet and went to stop Garrosh personally. The player witnesses Garrosh make a speech about the Horde's grand destiny, and how he will use the Divine Bell to erase weakness from his orcs and create a stronger Horde. Garrosh rings the Divine Bell and it turns his &lt;a href=\"kor%27kron\"&gt;kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; into Sha. After they are dispatched by the player, Prince Anduin Wrynn intervenes and tries to deter Garrosh from using the Divine Bell. Anduin's pleas fell on deaf ears, however, and Garrosh used the Divine Bell to sha infest his champion &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt;, who the player then has to fight. Though Garrosh encouraged his troops to master the Sha energy, in the end, none of his champions were able to do so. In the aftermath of the battle, Anduin used the &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Mallet\"&gt;Harmonic Mallet&lt;/a&gt; to turn the Divine Bell's chaos into pure harmony. This stuns Garrosh but Garrosh recovers and strikes at the bell and destroys it; causing its rubble to fall on Prince Anduin. The impact of the bell has caused Anduin's bones to shatter. Believing Anduin dead, Garrosh lets the Alliance champion leave to relay the fate of Anduin to King Varian; thereby illustrating the price for his continued defiance. The player discovers that Anduin still lives and retrieves Anduin's broken body from the ruins. Using a signal flare for immediate evacuation, they fly to Lion's Landing where Varian mourns and tends to his son, ordering for &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; to be sent to their location at once. Both Varian and Jaina Proudmoore are furious at this assault and swear to make Garrosh pay.\nIsle of Thunder.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, face off to lay claim to &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Emperor Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;island stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and the treasures contained therein.\nThose who have earned her trust through their heroics will be tasked by Jaina to assault the Thunder King's &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Staff of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; to absorb his power from his dais in the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Pinnacle of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. With the Thunder King's power fused with her staff, Jaina plans on using the Thunder King's terrible power on Garrosh when the time comes. Meanwhile Lor'themar also takes an interest in Lei Shen's \"&lt;a href=\"blood%20golem\"&gt;blood golem&lt;/a&gt;s\" and sets his top archmages to harnessing their power as leverage against Garrosh should the Horde fall to anarchy.\nDarkspear uprising.\nGarrosh orders the excavation in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, violating the sanctity of the land, which greatly angers &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and orders the Horde to leave the Vale. &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; states that not all of the Horde follow the warchief's orders anymore and tries to apologize for the desecration. Dezco requests for an opportunity to bring Hellscream to justice and make things right with the pandaren. Taran Zhu acquiesced to Dezco's appeal and gives the Horde until the season's end to remedy the situation. At the same time, Vol'jin returns from his recuperation and a major anti-Garrosh uprising erupts in Durotar and the Northern Barrens. In response to this, the Kor'kron have enforced martial law in the entirety of orcish territory and erected new fortified outposts to cull the rebellion.\nBattlefield: Barrens.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;While the Alliance grows stronger amid the pressures of war&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde, under the weight of Garrosh's command, continues to fracture. The Darkspear Trolls are rebelling, Orgrimmar is on lockdown, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;the Warchief has sent crews into the Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and into the Northern Barrens in to push his war machine forward.\nFor Horde champions, it's time to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Ki%27ta%20Arrowtusk\"&gt;Ki'ta Arrowtusk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; who will lead you to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. He's alive and well thanks to &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;'s aid and he's not alone. Both Chen and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; are with him but he needs the aid of more members of the Horde to truly rebel. Things aren't all that peaceful in the Village and Horde champions soon need to help deal with the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; who have managed to lock down the Troll section of Orgrimmar and are looking to take control of other Darkspear Troll strongholds before things get too out of hand.\nOnce Horde champions have purged the Kor'kron from Sen'jin Village, they'll be sent to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; as Vol'jin works his way and his troops toward Orgrimmar.\nRazor Hill is just a temporary stop for Vol'jin and the rebellion, but before they can move on toward their ultimate goal, they're going to need supplies \u2013 lots of supplies. Horde champions will be asked to go out into the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to steal supplies from the various Kor'kron supply locations.\nAfter months of preparation, the Alliance war machine is turning toward the heart of enemy territory. But &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; doesn't want to commit any regular forces until he knows exactly what to expect. spies outside of Orgrimmar were sent to scout out a naval landing site, learn the enemy's weaknesses, and give Alliance landing forces any advantage they can find.\nUsing top-secret SI:7 gadgetry, the king's scouts got an early look at the forces that will be arrayed against them when they assault Orgrimmar and also discover that the Horde is falling apart. The trolls are in active rebellion. By escalating this rebellion, the SI:7 agents have devised a plan to sow chaos and bloodshed behind enemy lines without risking a single Alliance soldier. SI-7 agents, after witnessing the might of Garrosh\u00b4s power structure, knew that it'd be most practical to work with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in order to bring Hellscream to justice and put an end to the ongoing war.\nAlliance players are being sent personally as an envoy of the Alliance to the rebel leader: Vol'jin of the Darkspear. With a little deft political maneuvering, Alliance players earn his trust, securing a potential Alliance beach landing and ensuring that trolls and orcs kill one another up and down Durotar.\nBy killing Kor'kron in the Barrens and delivering their stolen supplies to the rebels, the Alliance ensure that Garrosh's power structure crumbles around him.\nBattle on the High Seas.\nThe war between the Horde and Alliance isn't confined to land. Both factions are in the midst of a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20on%20the%20High%20Seas\"&gt;battle for naval supremacy on the High Seas&lt;/a&gt;. After numerous clashes, the Alliance and any Horde rebels within the Horde fleet eventually call for a ceasefire and decide to focus their naval strength against Orgrimmar.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nInfestation of the Vale.\nThe discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;ancient Titan vault&lt;/a&gt; buried beneath the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; gave Garrosh access to the dark heart of Pandaria itself, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;. The actions of the warchief led to the unthinkable: the awakening of the last and the most dangerous sha prime, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;, and its subsequent corruption of the Vale. This rallied the world's faction to finally &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;besiege Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreparations for the Siege.\nHigh King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; has rallied the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; war fleet and has managed to breach &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s blockade over &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Their fleet comprising of reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;; sailing on Alliance ships armed with heavy artillery, has set sail for &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;, blocking every access to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and preventing any reinforcements coming from the sea. Also, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s command began marching with siege weapons towards &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, planning to use them once &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Gates\"&gt;gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the meantime, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; rallied their forces, gaining control of most of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;; they also obtained the support of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, which supplied them with heavy siege weapons. Many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish citizens of Durotar who opposed Garrosh joined the rebelling forces as well. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; sent reinforcements across the sea from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, planning to regroup them with the rest of the rebels once the Alliance attacked Bladefist Bay. Garrosh, however, was prepared for the siege and managed to bring reinforcements to the city before the start of the rebellion. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;'s command was charged to protect &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Landing\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Landing&lt;/a&gt; against the invading naval forces, &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and his forces were sent to defend the main gate, and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; legions were placed inside the city, guarding the underground entrance to Garrosh's compound. Garrosh also gained the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;, earning reinforcements from them as well.\nThe final push.\nAfter mopping up the damage in the Vale, a combined Horde and Alliance force launch an attack on the capital, ultimately leading to the underground part of the city and a final confrontation with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; himself. Once defeated, Garrosh is taken in custody by &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; to let him face trial in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, a solution approved by both &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter that, with the agreement of the other &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leaders, Thrall appoints &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; as new Warchief of the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; tells Varian to take advantage of the Horde's weakness to dismantle it, but Varian chooses to stop the war, and warns Vol'jin that if his Horde fails to uphold honor, as Garrosh's Horde did, the Alliance will return to end it.\nPost-war aggressions.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe forces of the Alliance and Horde under &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; cooperated during the start of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; invasion and worked independently without attacking one another across the campaigns on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; focusing on the real threats.\nThe Alliance at least on one occasion helped the Horde - to defend &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt; against Hellscream's submarine. Despite the truce, the Alliance and Horde engaged in skirmishes on the isle of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;. They also attacked one another in several naval missions across Draenor's seas. In &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thuldren\"&gt;Thuldren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glyza\"&gt;Glyza&lt;/a&gt; help the opposite faction after being captured by &lt;a href=\"Penny%20Clobberbottom\"&gt;Penny Clobberbottom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glirin\"&gt;Glirin&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. \nLegion.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; neared its end, the Horde had become overwhelmed by the attack and was forced to retreat. This, in turn, however left the vulnerable Alliance to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had to sacrifice his life to ensure his remaining forces got out alive. Unknowing of the Horde's plight members of the Alliance such as Jaina and Genn held to the Horde to blame for Varian's death and Genn became determined to get his vengeance against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Horde departed for &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, the forces under the command of newly appointed &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would be attacked by the Alliance forces under the command of Genn Greymane. In the ensuing struggle, the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" would be destroyed by the Horde. As champions ventured forth to claim the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas made a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and acquired the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt; to bind the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; into her service in order to make more Forsaken. However, while trying to dominate Eyir, Sylvanas was attacked by Genn who declared he would avenge Varian, Gilneas, and his son as he attacked at her; eventually knocking her down. Genn then charged at her but Sylvanas evaded him and shot a poisoned arrow at his shoulder, thus turning Genn human. Sylvanas taunted Genn by saying she overestimated him and calling him an \"old wolf\". Genn then revealed that he stole Sylvanas's magical lantern during his last charge and smashed it on the ground, thus freeing Eyir. Sylvanas watched in shock and anger as Eyir was released from her binds and disappears. Genn walked out of the vault, snapping the shaft of Sylvanas' poisoned arrow lodged in his shoulder, and told Sylvanas that since she had stolen his son's future, he now took hers.\nEven as the Horde and Alliance fight against the armies of the demonic Burning Legion and their allies, they also &lt;a href=\"Queensguard\"&gt;clashed&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;each other&lt;/a&gt; for control of the &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Towers\"&gt;Warden Towers&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayerbase reaction.\nDuring } the imbalance between the faction story progression became highly controversial, with the devs admitting to running out of time for the Alliance storyline. In the wake of &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;, this perennial topic has flared up pretty brightly. While the devs did indicate they wanted to give the Alliance a bit more good stuff during some panels, some other incidents during and after BlizzCon (including the news that Theramore, one of the most iconic Alliance cities, will be razed to the ground) has left some doubtful, leading to intense debates and 100+ page forum threads on the subject. The Horde's story has gotten very interesting with Sylvanas' darker path, Garrosh's controversial leadership, and Thrall's place on center stage in Cataclysm. The Alliance, however, has seen very little involvement from its leaders, and some players feel what they have seen has been out of character for their leaders. Malfurion neutral as Ashenvale burns and as Tyrande is attacked.\nLead Quest Designer &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave \"Fargo\" Kosak&lt;/a&gt; posted on this topic on a &lt;a href=\"Dev%20Watercooler\"&gt;Dev Watercooler&lt;/a&gt;. The way Kosak explains it, the devs definitely want to make sure that there is &lt;a href=\"faction%20pride\"&gt;faction pride&lt;/a&gt; for both sides. Cross-faction communication was banned outright, even where it made little or no sense in the lore. Entire realms are dedicated to PvP. Battlegrounds and quest hubs feature prominent Alliance and Horde iconography. And, he argues, while the Alliance may be getting beat up, the Horde has taken its share of lumps too. But in the long run, heroes are not born out of easy times. The Alliance will go through tough times, but it will give heroes the opportunity to arise. The Alliance's time is coming. One thing he did admit to is that Blizzard needs to do a better job of making sure people can interact with their heroes. He acknowledges that the Alliance may not think of Thrall as theirs or part of their story, and he promises that once Cataclysm as over, we will catch up with other characters.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Acquiring these will require at least five, but usually six, or even seven stacks of .\nObjective of.\nThere is a by each faction leader in the six participating cities. The Alliance Gift Collection can be given to Kwee Q. Peddlefeet for a and your choice of 5 , 5 , or 5 .\nVotes.\nCompleting this quest will add a point to the total gift collections for the capital city leader standing next to Kwee Q. Peddlefeet. This counts as one vote for the popularity of that leader. At the end of the Love is in the Air seasonal event, the capital city leader with the most gift collections will have Kwee Q. Peddlefeet stay by them to buff players for another week.\nYou can ask Kwee Q. Peddlefeet about the gift voting standings. He gives the number of turn-ins for each participating city leader and the totals for each faction. \nDisproportionate voting stacked toward one particular leader will give either faction that does so a better chance of winning. \nNotes.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account. \nThis item is primarily useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year. \nThe item can be created from the ingredient items after the event is over. By combining each hierarchical layer of gifts and pledges near its expiration, it should be possible to extend the overall duration to around 28 days for the faction gift collections; so anywhere within that timeframe, a faction gift could be created. Unlike the city gift collections, which may proc a buff after the event (TBD), there is little point to building the faction gift collection unless you have a turn-in point. It is unknown whether Kwee Q. Peddlefeet will accept the quest turn in after the event, but it seems unlikely as the quest turn-in mechanic is thorough in its checking this sort of detail. Additionally, the voting portion of the mechanic would be meaningless, an inconsistency which is most easily resolved by removing the whole quest after the event. In any case, Kwee Q. Peddlefeet is only available after the event in the one city that wins the vote, and only for an additional week. \nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article."}

Their races consisted of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20dwarf\"&gt;Bronzebeard dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAlliance with night elves.\nThe Alliance Remnants were stationed throughout &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Prince Kael'thas and his blood elves were located near the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; and were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, they barely defeated that Undead group. They were overrun, however, and were preparing to leave when a group of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; appeared, led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. With their help, the blood elves managed to avoid the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Silverpine\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt;, and continued their journey to safety. During the way, they fought against many undead groups and stopped at various blood elven towns to repair the &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt; and to bring the elves living there with them. After some battles, they arrived to &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; where they were ambushed by the Scourge.\nThe night elves and Alliance Remnants crossed the only bridge over the &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; defended that bridge but fell into its waters. Kael'thas was going to save her but &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; told him to stop and help her to defeat &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas had to repay the debt to Maiev for previously protecting him and his people and left Tyrande to her fate.\n&lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the base of the night elves and was informed of Tyrande's incident. Maiev told him that she was torn apart, but these were just lies. Kael'thas then came and met the leaders of the night elves and told them about Illidan's location. The Alliance Remnants defended the base from both the Scourge and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt;, while Malfurion and Tyrande attacked Illidan. In the middle of the battle, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; was rescued from the naga and helped in the battle. At last, Illidan was defeated, and when he was going to be executed, Kael'thas revealed that Tyrande may still be alive. Hearing this, Malfurion and Illidan decided to instead join forces to save her and found out about Maiev's lies. After that, the Alliance Remnants went to meet with the rest Alliance.\nBlood elves imprisoned by the Alliance.\nUnfortunately for Kael'Thas, the battle in the Ruins of Dalaran had taken the time that the prince was scheduled to meet up with his commander. Kael'thas and the blood elves arrived with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Garithos\"&gt;Lord Garithos&lt;/a&gt; and tried to apologize, explaining about the night elves, but the commander cut him off, telling the late prince that he was \"not interested in your fanciful excuses.\" Garithos then charged Kael's unit with repairing three &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Observatory\"&gt;observatories&lt;/a&gt;, while continuing to insult the prince. The Alliance Remnants defeated &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and bandits and repaired one observatory but when they arrived at the shore they found out that the undead had destroyed the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; gave Kael'thas and his troops ships for free, after which the Alliance Remnants defeated an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; base and repaired the two remaining observatories. Kael'thas reported his success to Lord Garithos, but Garithos told him that he shouldn't have accepted the alliance with the naga as they were inhuman.\nGarithos left to the front lines and left Kael'thas behind waiting for orders. The next day he sent an emissary to tell Kael'thas that the observatories had detected a large undead army and the Alliance Remnants would have to defeat the undead before they could march on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, he was recalling all infantry, cavalry and support teams back to the front lines, leaving only the elven troops to fight. Once again, Kael'thas was forced to accept help from Lady Vashj and her naga in order to succeed. After their victory Garithos arrived with a great battalion of troops, accused Kael'thas of treachery and betrayal for once again siding with the naga, and imprisoned all the blood elves in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nBy making those actions Garithos desintegrated the Alliance Remnants into two groups:\nIn the RPG.\nThey were part of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Alliance\"&gt;New Alliance&lt;/a&gt;."}

They littered the Zandalari Fleet with explosives at the ships' keel and recovered the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt; which had previously been stolen by the Horde. However, even with all the advantages on their side, Halford made it clear that a frontal assault would see result in a loss. With the help of Mathias Shaw, he set up a meeting with other Alliance commanders to discuss luring the enemy out of their capital.\nInside the maze at &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Genn, Mathias, Jaina, Halford, Telaamon, and the adventurer discussed how the plan was to be handled. With the hopes of destabilizing the relationship between the Zandalari and the Horde, Mathias explained that a distraction at Nazmir would be needed. Using the Abyssal Scepter, the Alliance would create a fog to keep them distracted for as long as possible, while the Alliance fleet would charge from the south. He explained that some would not return alive, something that Telaamon knew and had long accepted while talking to Halford.\nThe invasion.\nThe Alliance decoy force landed on the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Reach\"&gt;Far Reach&lt;/a&gt;. With an army of humans, night elves, worgen, dwarves, and void elves, they assembled into three groups.\nFirstly, Jaina, Shaw, and the adventurer supported the army by taking &lt;a href=\"Zalamar\"&gt;Zalamar&lt;/a&gt; from the blood trolls. They killed them all and planted several Dark Iron mole machines for them to spawn.\nWith the village in their control, Brother Pike, who came with the expedition, set up Abyssal Scepter and created a fog. With this, they moved on to the next part of their plan, to take as much land as possible to make their enemies believe the fleet has landed in Nazmir. Their next target was &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde outpost.\nArriving at Zul'jan Ruins, Jaina gave the adventurer a water elemental to join the main force to successfully take ruins. With all their might, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Alliance.\nThe following target was the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Outpost\"&gt;Fallen Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. From the place, they slaughtered the Zandalari, stole their direhorns to assault the Blood Gate, while also taking out the Gob Squad's machine, the &lt;a href=\"A.M.O.D\"&gt;A.M.O.D&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the Gob Squad to run away. Thanks to these valiant efforts, Fallen Outpost fell too.\nFinally, the final phase to convince the Horde of the attack, taking the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Using their captured direhorns, they assaulted the Blood Gate, leaving a trail of dead trolls behind.\nWith everything in place and the Zandalar falling for the trap, Telaamon marched to his end with pride, with him and Jaina giving a final goodbye.\nThe bait.\nOn The Banshee's Wail, Nathanos received word that the Alliance was attacking Nazmir. He sent a Horde adventurer to discuss an attack with Princess Talanji and King Rastakhan.\nAt the great seal, Rastakhan agreed to a counter attack alongside the Horde. Talanji mobilized the fleet. She sent the adventurer to Captain Rez'okun with orders to mobilize the Zandalari Fleet, to &lt;a href=\"General%20Rakera\"&gt;General Rakera&lt;/a&gt; with orders to send her troops to Nazmir, and to &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt; to send his riders to Nazmir.\nRetaking Nazmir.\nUnder the leadership of Princess Talanji, the Alliance at the Blood Gate had been taken out and Rokhan was rescued from &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Alliance. Telaamon managed to escape in time, leading the Horde inland into Nazmir.\nWith the Blood Gate cleared, General Rakera sent the adventurer to the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Outpost\"&gt;Fallen Outpost&lt;/a&gt; to aid Haxlord Raal. Arriving at the fallen outpost, they found Raal grounded, unable to fly due to the fog. To fix this, they came up with the idea of fixing the &lt;a href=\"A.M.O.D\"&gt;A.M.O.D&lt;/a&gt; and bring the Gob Squad back together. &lt;a href=\"Patch%20%28goblin%29\"&gt;Patch&lt;/a&gt;, the only goblin still around sent the adventurer to find the members of the Gob Squad back together and bring back the A.M.O.D part which were stolen by the Alliance.\nWith the whole team recovered, Talanji calls on the Loa, &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt;, to jump start the A.M.O.D. Having done so, the princess allowed the adventurer to ride on A.M.O.D to lead the charge to retake &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Zul'jan Ruins secured, Talanji marched onto Zalamar, with the idea to push them back to the coast. At Zalamar, the Zanalari kill engaged and killed the Alliance forces, destroyed their mole machines, and destroyed Telaamon's mirrors. While all of this was happening, Rokhan went in search of Telaamon.\nRokhan managed to find &lt;a href=\"Telaamon\"&gt;Telaamon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Midnight\"&gt;Sanctum of Midnight&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Kejabu\"&gt;Witch Doctor Kejabu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jo%27chunga\"&gt;Jo'chunga&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer, Rokhan confronted Telaamon and brought him down.\nUp on the surface, Talanji finds the source of the fog, the Abyssal Scepter. Along with the rest, she rides to its location and destroys it. To her utter shock, she does not find the Alliance fleet and realized that she had been tricked. With haste shed rushed back to the capital, but it was too late.

{"id": "555863", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=555863", "title": "Alliance navy", "text": "The Alliance navy, formerly known as the Lordaeron Fleet, is the collective maritime military force of the various members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. As the naval wing of the Alliance military, these combined navies protect the Alliance's interests throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, and have seen particularly frequent service against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which also fields a formidable naval presence, and the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; crews plaguing the seas.\nMost of the Alliance's material naval power is provided by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, supplemented by the &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; innovations of the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and fitted with crews from all Alliance members. Boasting a collection of varied vessels, including &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s, the navy is capable of meeting many different threats and has been utilized in some of the Alliance's most important operations. Historically, the navy of the Grand Alliance would be the spiritual successor to that of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and often works extremely closely with Alliance land forces during campaigns and in battles to ensure success.\nDeployment and history.\nSecond and Third Wars.\nWhen it was founded right before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance navy was put under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, for he had the most experience dealing with maritime matters. Proudmoore led his ships during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;battle for Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, in which they sank as many &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; ships as they could, sending thousands of orcs to the bottom of the ocean. That wasn't enough to stem the tide however.\nLater during the conflict, Alliance ships stationed near &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt; met up with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s army just below &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and ferried the soldiers to the north, sailing upriver up to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany human ships moored in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were stolen by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; on the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; to leave the continent and travel to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern era.\nThe navy of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has evolved significantly in the time since the Alliance's founding in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Despite mainly &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; operated initially, the navy as it currently stands is operated by members of virtually every Alliance race. The navy is presumably under the overall command of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Naval%20Command\"&gt;Alliance Naval Command&lt;/a&gt; and the High King of the Alliance, currently &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout its existence, the navy has seen deployment across almost every major ocean in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, as well as those of &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, navy personnel have taken part in numerous land operations.\nThe Alliance's naval forces are most often deployed against the ever-present threat of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, though it also deals with &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and any other major risk to the stability of the world or the Alliance itself. In relatively recent times, the navy has incorporated groundbreaking new innovations and technologies, particularly those of &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; design. This has allowed for the development of such assets as the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe navy's main construction yard and hub are located at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind City Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, with many other naval bases and &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;s scattered throughout the various territories in which the Alliance is active. Spiritual successor to that of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the current Alliance navy has distinguished itself in countless campaigns across numerous worlds, including: the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastern Kingdoms.\nKingdom of Stormwind.\nAs one of its strongest members with an established maritime history, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; contributes an immense deal of materials and personnel to the Alliance's naval effort. The &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; is the largest Alliance &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; and naval base on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, playing host to a massive drydock and dockyard capable of constructing and repairing the vessels of the Alliance fleet. In preparation for naval campaigns and invasions, the harbor is frequently used as an assembly point for fleets; many weapons, supplies, and materials can be found stockpiled throughout the port, which is also fortified against enemy attack. &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; notably set off from the harbor shortly after the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; with a massive fleet bound for &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;, while the Alliance fleet that took part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; would also launch from this location.\nMajor sea lanes also connect Stormwind Harbor to other key areas controlled by the Alliance, such as &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; (and thus the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Stormwind Harbor, in particular, has served a pivotal strategic role in combating the navy of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and thus protecting Stormwind and the heart of the Alliance itself.\n&lt;a href=\"Marshtide%20Watch\"&gt;Marshtide Watch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; is kept supplied and reinforced by a small jetty that allows boats from the &lt;a href=\"Forbidding%20Sea\"&gt;Forbidding Sea&lt;/a&gt; to dock. This is likely very important for the continued success against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces based from nearby &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;.\nWetlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; represents one of the Alliance's most northerly naval bases in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20Mehley\"&gt;The \"Lady Mehley\"&lt;/a&gt; provides transport for Alliance forces to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Though a naval connection once existed between Menethil Harbor and &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, this route has been abandoned with the severe damage done to both ports during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nMenethil Harbor served as an important port for the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, providing a vital naval connection to the Alliance base of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Human%20destroyer\"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Northspear\"&gt;Northspear&lt;/a&gt;\" mainly services this route.\nBlasted Lands.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; led a major &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;incursion&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance responded by sending a fleet to the nearby shores in order to halt the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' advance. Led by &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, these marines and sailors landed in the Blasted Lands and quickly engaged the Iron Horde army on the beach while establishing a command post and artillery positions. They eventually began to push inland. At the same time, a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; naval force carried out a similar operation nearby.\nTwilight Highlands.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; launched separate incursions into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, with both factions dispatching fleets to the area. The Alliance fleet, having left &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on the northern coast of the Twilight Highlands after probably having sailed through the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. Mainly consisting of &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, the Alliance fleet possessed no air support during the journey, for which it would suffer when it encountered a Horde airfleet also bound for the highlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, on board the airfleet, ordered the Horde air guard to seize the opportunity and attack the Alliance armada while it was in close formation. Though the Alliance apparently inflicted heavy casualties, the fleet was left seriously damaged following this ambush. The Horde's &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s too would pay for the sudden attack, when they were soon afterwards wiped out by a group of &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, having dispatched all their close air support to deal with the Alliance.\nElsewhere, the Horde's sea fleet was also attacked by Alliance naval forces in open waters en route to the Twilight Highlands, inflicting &lt;a href=\"Remains%20of%20the%20Fleet\"&gt;heavy damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the remnants of the Alliance's fleet finally arrived in &lt;a href=\"Highbank\"&gt;Highbank&lt;/a&gt;, they established a major base and &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; there. More ships were lost at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Breakers\"&gt;Obsidian Breakers&lt;/a&gt; when their crews were enchanted by the &lt;a href=\"Ophelia\"&gt;siren of the Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to run into the rocks. Despite the harsh start to the campaign, the Alliance continued to land its forces on the shores of the Twilight Highlands in preparation for the conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; based from the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde of &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Port\"&gt;Dragonmaw Port&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the initial engagement, no further known naval conflict occurred as part of the Twilight Highlands campaign, though the \"Tidebreaker\" continued to be stationed in Highbank harbor, presumably for defense or supply purposes.\nGilneas.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; was reopened and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; launched an &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the region, a &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; fleet eventually arrived at &lt;a href=\"Keel%20Harbor\"&gt;Keel Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to provide relief to Gilneas's beleaguered citizens (many of whom were now &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;). The night elf ships carried with them &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s and other equipment to help in the fight against the Forsaken. The fleet was ultimately able to escape the ruined kingdom with the Gilnean refugees, returning to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and precipitating the worgen entry into the Alliance. On the way back, the relief fleet encountered a powerful storm that caused great damage and almost resulted in the death of the King of Gilneas &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe famous &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;High Commander Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; was eventually dispatched with a naval force to aid the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; in driving the Forsaken from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding region. The \"&lt;a href=\"X-2%20Pincer\"&gt;X-2 Pincer&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; was stationed near Keel Harbor and was used as the headquarters of High Commander Wyrmbane during the conflict.\nTol Barad.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, an intense conflict erupted between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for control of the island chain of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. Both sides invested the island heavily, with the Alliance dispatching numerous ships to reinforce it. &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Baradin Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;, operated by &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, served as the main Alliance port on the island, and was known to service ships as part of the conflict. Despite both sides' efforts, the battle has remained inconclusive.\nGhostlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; ships carrying the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;Sentinel spies&lt;/a&gt; were dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of establishing a spying operation on the local &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; moon crystals. There they established a base on &lt;a href=\"Shalandis%20Isle\"&gt;Shalandis Isle&lt;/a&gt;, which was capable of hosting docked boats.\nVashj'ir.\nIn response to continued &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attacks on Alliance trade ships in the western oceans shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance committed increasingly more forces to naval engagements of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;' western coast. With the events of the Cataclysm, several new islands had been created in these waters, and fierce fighting broke out over control of the tactically-advantageous land masses. The Alliance felt that if the Horde could gain a naval presence on or around the islands then they could potentially threaten &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance navy would lose many ships during the conflict in this theater, with the few that did return requiring extensive repairs in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. To make up for the shortfall, the navy was forced to commission mercenary ships to help reinforce its forces in the field. The situation became even more dire as numerous Alliance and Horde ships came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Zin%27jatar\"&gt;Zin'jatar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; based in the underwater realm of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. The naga used &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; to stop and sink the vessels while they themselves butchered or drowned the crew.\nOne such mercenary ship carrying &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Taylor\"&gt;Captain Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and a contingent of Alliance forces was attacked, though many of the occupants managed to survive with aid of &lt;a href=\"Erunak%20Stonespeaker\"&gt;Erunak Stonespeaker&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=\"Kelp%27thar%20Forest\"&gt;Kelp'thar Forest&lt;/a&gt; deep below the waves, this force led by Captain Taylor led a series of retaliatory attacks on the naga in the area. Taylor's forces were revealed to be a division of elite Alliance troops\u2014&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Elite%20Aquatic%20and%20Land%20Forces\"&gt;S.E.A.L.Fs&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had been sent not only to deal with the Horde threat but also to investigate the disturbances in the area resulting from the Cataclysm. The campaign against the naga would eventually bring these forces into the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Expanse\"&gt;Shimmering Expanse&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Depths\"&gt;Abyssal Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; rescue fleet was eventually sent to locate the survivors of the earlier shipwrecks led by the \"&lt;a href=\"Voldrin%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Voldrin's Hold&lt;/a&gt;\". The state-of-the-art \"&lt;a href=\"Pincer%20X2\"&gt;Pincer X2&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;, a new innovation of &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, was also dispatched from Stormwind City to help hunt the &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; who destroyed the previous Alliance ships. The \"Pincer X2\", commanded by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Glovaal\"&gt;Captain Glovaal&lt;/a&gt;, was able to temporarily able to drive off the beast from &lt;a href=\"Darkbreak%20Cove\"&gt;Darkbreak Cove&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the Alliance forces on board the \"Pincer X2\" would launch a large attack on the naga forces attempting to defeat &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Breach\"&gt;Abyssal Breach&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt;, the naga were successfully able to triumph over Neptulon, after the \"Pincer X2\" was destroyed.\nTirisfal Glades.\nA fleet of ships departing from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; carried a massive Alliance invasion force to northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet, in response to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, struck at &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; from the north, with a beachhead established near &lt;a href=\"Garren%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Garren's Haunt&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet met with no naval resistance from the Horde. After landing, the invasion force quickly pushed inland with heavy weapons, conquering &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and laying siege to the Undercity.\nKalimdor.\nTeldrassil.\nThe sea route between the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; has traditionally been extremely important in keeping the Alliance properly connected. Alliance ships thus regularly travel between Stormwind and the major night elf port at &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, with the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance and the acquisition of the nearby &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, night elf ships such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;Elune's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;\" frequently make the journey between Rut'theran and &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt;, creating a link to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\". Refugees from the ruined &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; would land at Rut'theran at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, having been rescued by a night elf fleet sent to the Gilnean peninsula.\nAzuremyst Isle.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, an Alliance flotilla commanded by &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Odesyus\"&gt;Admiral Odesyus&lt;/a&gt; was forced to put to shore on the southern shores of &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; due to the actions of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s stowed away in the hold. On the beach his crew landed on, they established &lt;a href=\"Odesyus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Odesyus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, and shortly thereafter were contacted by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; people, recently arrived on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. These draenei would eventually join the Alliance itself, and helped the admiral and his crew recover important items stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Co.&lt;/a&gt; goblins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt; was established in the west of the isle, and quickly started hosting Alliance ships, thereby establishing a connection to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; when the time came to begin the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" transported prominent members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Valaar%27s%20Berth\"&gt;Valaar's Berth&lt;/a&gt; in Azuremyst Isle in preparation for the departure to the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; on board the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\". The ship was captained by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral%20Jes-Tereth\"&gt;Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth&lt;/a&gt; herself.\nFeralas.\nA major &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; base was situated at &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt;, representing one of the Alliance's largest bases in western &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The vessel known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Ferry\"&gt;Feathermoon Ferry&lt;/a&gt;\" commanded by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Idrilae\"&gt;Captain Idrilae&lt;/a&gt; ferried Alliance members between the stronghold and the shore. Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Feathermoon Stronghold was overrun by &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and the port &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;relocated&lt;/a&gt; to the coast.\nDustwallow Marsh.\nThe Alliance &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, with its seafaring traditions, was the largest of the faction's naval bases on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. An outpost for the Alliance in hostile territory, Theramore was well-connected to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; by sea, specifically &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous warships and fleets were stationed in Theramore and nearby regions, usually battling the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in some capacity.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; began preparations to march on Theramore Isle during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, Theramore's ruler &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was warned in advance and requested support from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Alliance. Many of the Alliance's best generals, along with copious reinforcements, hurriedly dispatched from Stormwind on board the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Fleet\"&gt;7th Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Theramore was well-reinforced by the time the Horde's forces arrived, yet Jaina refused to allow the Alliance naval forces to engage the enemy unless they actually entered Alliance waters. Before the battle itself, a ship was dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; with many of the city's children.\nShortly after the battle began, however, Warchief Hellscream revealed his true plan. He had intentionally gathered a large concentration of Alliance commanders and forces, and now ordered the dropping of a powerful &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; on the city. The resulting explosion wiped out virtually everyone and everything on the isle. The destruction of the large fleet present hit the Alliance particularly hard, and in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;bombing of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; the Horde established an imposing naval blockade on all of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong those slain in the mana bombing was &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Aubrey\"&gt;Admiral Aubrey&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent Alliance naval commander and previously master of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Barrens.\nThe navy is extremely important to the continued success of the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces in and around the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, a major &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; outpost in traditionally Horde territory, hosts a large port and is kept well-supplied by ships from Theramore and other areas of the Alliance. The hold's sea route acted as an important lifeline during conflict with the Horde. As of the Cataclysm, the hold was under the command of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Aubrey\"&gt;Admiral Aubrey&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde and Alliance once more came into conflict in the area. A large Horde naval and land force of the &lt;a href=\"Rageroar%20clan\"&gt;Rageroar clan&lt;/a&gt; subsequently laid siege to Northwatch Hold in an attempt to drive the Alliance from the coast. While the Horde land forces breached the main walls, its ships attacked the Alliance garrison of &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s. Before long, the majority of the hold's warships were either sunk or forced to return to Theramore for repairs.\nOnly the \"&lt;a href=\"Blackpool\"&gt;Blackpool&lt;/a&gt;\" remained in action, and Rageroar forces eventually attempted a boarding action on the vessel. With the help of some reinforcements from the hold, the \"Blackpool\"'s crew were successful in repelling the boarders and regaining control of much of the harbor. Following this, the Horde fleet disengaged and instead attempted to land more troops on the mainland, though this too was repelled by Northwatch's defenders.\nAlliance naval forces were also active along the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Coast\"&gt;Merchant Coast&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; up to and after the Cataclysm. &lt;a href=\"Rear%20Admiral%20Hartley\"&gt;Rear Admiral Hartley&lt;/a&gt; led a campaign against the local &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Southsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt; from his flagship the &lt;a href=\"The%20Bellipotent\"&gt;\"Bellipotent\"&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the criminals from &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt; and capturing &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Longshore\"&gt;Baron Longshore&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to this, the Rear Admiral's forces also searched and seized &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; vessels in the nearby neutral port of Ratchet. Horde forces would strike back for this incursion (with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;) by sabotaging the crew's munitions in their camp along the Merchant Coast and mining the \"Bellipotent\", though the destroyer was not sunk.\nWhen the Horde marched on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, they would attack and raze the naval port of Northwatch Hold along the way despite a heroic defense. After Theramore's destruction and the subsequent naval battle near &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance fleet under &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; himself returned to the ruins of Northwatch Hold and routed all Horde forces in the vicinity. Work then began to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; to its former significance.\nDurotar.\n&lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, despite being in the very heart of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-controlled &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, has hosted a series of incursions by Alliance naval forces. &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, once the bastion of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, was eventually retaken by forces from &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Though they were affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, they were not directly aided by any Alliance ships or other forces. This Kul Tiras occupation would eventually be wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and in its wake a marine force from the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt; occupied the fortress. Being deep in enemy territory with no land route to friendly regions, the keep is presumably fully reinforced and supplied by the sea.\nAfter the Cataclysm, Alliance elements in the form of the Northwatch Expedition also established a &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Foothold\"&gt;foothold&lt;/a&gt; in the far south of Durotar. This force was heavily supplied by a &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; escort from &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, though it drew the aggressive attention of Horde elements based from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Horde's mana bombing of Theramore Isle, news of the attack traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; ordered a major &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fleet to be dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; to lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and potentially seize the Horde's capital. A feint intended to convince the Horde that the Alliance attack would come at &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; far to the north to break the recently-established blockade of the continent was organized, while King Varian himself led the real armada destined for Durotar on board the \"&lt;a href=\"Lion%20of%20the%20Waves\"&gt;Lion of the Waves&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe feint appeared to have worked, and the Alliance fleet discovered only a few Horde ships stationed in &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; upon arrival. Soon, however, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; revealed his true plans by summoning magically-enslaved &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; from beneath the waves, which quickly began tearing the Alliance's flotilla apart. Garrosh himself boarded King Varian's flagship and engaged him in combat, though this was interrupted when the \"Lion of the Waves\" was abruptly blown apart. Varian managed to get to another vessel and ordered the Alliance ships to retreat from the battle, but the fleet was entirely cut off by the kraken, and many vessels had already been lost.\nBefore the fleet could be annihilated, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived with an army of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s (which she had intended to us to destroy &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; itself) and drove off or killed Garrosh's sea monsters. The remaining Alliance ships subsequently withdrew from the area, sailing to the ruined &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet quickly defeated and routed all Horde forces in the vicinity and reclaimed the port stronghold. In the wake of the sea battle outside Orgrimmar, Warchief Garrosh was forced to break the continent-wide blockade of Alliance ports on Kalimdor to free forces for the security of Durotar itself.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; began to enter its darkest stage yet, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; would form the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; as civil war erupted throughout &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde itself. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance would dispatch a vast fleet to blockade and seize &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;, assisted by the navies of both the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Though the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; failed to secure a landing point on the beach, the fleet launched its own assault on the shore, and managed to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; shore batteries and defenses.\nSoon after, the flagship &lt;a href=\"Turalyon%27s%20Might%20%28ship%29\"&gt;\"Turalyon's Might\"&lt;/a&gt; landed at Bladefist Bay and dropped off King Varian, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, along with Alliance troops. Together, these forces overcame &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and her forces, securing the beach for the coalition and pushing inland to the gates of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nAn Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; (possibly the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\") was also used during the ensuing &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, providing air support as it hovered above the city.\nSeething Shore.\nAfter the wound in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; was formed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, a major skirmish broke out in the area between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for control of the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; resource. On a small island known as the &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore\"&gt;Seething Shore&lt;/a&gt; off Silithus's coast, the Alliance gunship \"&lt;a href=\"Skyguard\"&gt;Skyguard&lt;/a&gt;\" led efforts to recover Azerite from the area. This force, overseen by &lt;a href=\"Master%20Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Master Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, would come into conflict with the Horde on their own gunship. Champions would parachute from both vessels in order to battle for the Azerite appearing on the shore below.\nHigh Seas.\nWhile the Alliance's navy is often used to support its land forces in continental campaigns, it has been known to frequently engage with Horde across the seas and oceans of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the ship of the former Warchief of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; known as \"&lt;a href=\"Draka%27s%20Fury\"&gt;Draka's Fury&lt;/a&gt;\" was attacked by a contingent of Alliance ships led by the \"&lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Wake\"&gt;Vengeance Wake&lt;/a&gt;\" en route to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. The ambush was deliberate, and carried out by the Alliance navy and with the goal of taking Thrall into custody. During the engagement, the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s ship was sunk and Thrall was indeed taken captive by the Alliance forces. , and was also destroyed by the Alliance ships to ensure there would be no witnesses to the operation. Thrall was eventually liberated from his prison on board the \"Vengeance Wake\" when some of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s who survived the sea battle launched a raid on the Alliance convoy. Thrall subsequently used his &lt;a href=\"Element\"&gt;elemental powers&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the remaining Alliance naval forces present.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer came, the Alliance's \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" was deployed against the dragon and his allies. Having been injured by the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; wielded by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing fled towards the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; to escape, but was pursued by Thrall, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance and Horde on the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;. While the airship was attacked in its pursuit by a force of Deathwing's minions commanded by &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Skyfire\" and its crew were successfully able to repel the invaders and drop forces onto the &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;back of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself over the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nImmediately upon the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;\"Skyseeker\"&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the new continent on the north coast of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The gunship was dispatched back to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve reinforcements, but on the way ran into a Horde naval force. The \"Skyseeker\" defeated the enemy and took many of the Horde members prisoner on board the ship. As it continued its journey back to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, it ran into heavy fog, which eventually caused it to crash into the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of the crash, the Alliance sailors were forced to work together with the Horde prisoners, along with the local &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, to repair the damage done to &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; (the great &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt; on which the isle sits) by the \"Skyseeker\"'s crash, and subsequently return home.\nAt the time of the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, both the Alliance and Horde rushed fleets and reinforcements to the continent as part of each invasion. These fleets regularly &lt;a href=\"Battle%20on%20the%20High%20Seas\"&gt;engaged&lt;/a&gt; one another in the open waters on the way to Pandaria, leading to large-scale naval engagements. At least one Alliance fleet under the command of &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Hodgson\"&gt;Admiral Hodgson&lt;/a&gt; was embroiled in these skirmishes, which involved numerous &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDeepholm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; would assign the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Llane%27s%20Oath\"&gt;Llane's Oath&lt;/a&gt;\" to patrol the skies within the &lt;a href=\"Element\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; realm of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, located through the swirling &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. During this mission, however, the crew was infiltrated by members of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult, and tricked into staging an ambush on the Horde's \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Fury%20Wreckage\"&gt;Storm's Fury&lt;/a&gt;\", assigned to a similar purpose. After destroying the Horde gunship, almost all of the crew of the \"Llane's Oath\" were poisoned by the cult members, the exception being &lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Moody\"&gt;First Mate Moody&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to stop the ship from crashing.\nZandalar.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde strike force would infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to escape by sea with &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. A fleet of eight Alliance ships was sent after the invaders, . Waiting behind a wall of mist, the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt; took the Alliance by surprise, sinking seven of the &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s in an opening salvo. The surviving ship returned to Stormwind with news of the event, while many survivors from the destroyed vessels made it to shore and established &lt;a href=\"Castaway%20Encampment\"&gt;an outpost&lt;/a&gt; in eastern &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. These stranded sailors were reinforced by the Alliance later in the conflict.\nAs the war progressed, the Alliance began coordinating &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;assaults&lt;/a&gt; on Zandalar itself. The &lt;a href=\"7th%20Fleet\"&gt;7th Fleet&lt;/a&gt; would spearhead the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Faction Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, landing an invasion force on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Nazwatha\"&gt;Nazwatha&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; naval and ground forces resisted the assault, the invaders managed to establish a beachhead and inland positions. Alliance agents would use an (S.U.B) to directly attack the Horde fleet stationed nearby, sinking two &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s and a command vessel, along with smaller craft.\nNorthrend.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; began some time after the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; prepared separate expeditions with which to invade the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; on the frigid continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; was two-pronged and led to the assembly of two major fleets that would land on two separate part of Northrend. The campaign in Northrend would also see the first use of the new &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Human%20destroyer\"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; class of &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; in the Alliance navy.\nOne invasion force sailed to the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and established &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; in its south. The fleet would continue to ship troops and supplies to the keep throughout the conflict in Northrend to fuel the campaign. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Kraken\"&gt;\"Kraken\"&lt;/a&gt; was one such destroyer that regularly made the journey between Valiance Keep and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Stormbreaker\"&gt;\"Stormbreaker\"&lt;/a&gt; was one of the ships docked in the &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; that had been secretly infested with members of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; hoping to reach the continent. &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Cantlebree\"&gt;Admiral Cantlebree&lt;/a&gt;, commanding Alliance naval forces in the region, feared that many more Alliance ships across the continent may have been similarly compromised.\nMeanwhile, another arm of the Valiance Expedition landed at &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; and established a &lt;a href=\"port\"&gt;port&lt;/a&gt; and fortress there. Like Valiance Keep, this settlement was kept supplied by sea, with the \"&lt;a href=\"Northspear\"&gt;Northspear&lt;/a&gt;\" creating a connection back to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. Valgarde itself was under the command of &lt;a href=\"Vice%20Admiral%20Keller\"&gt;Vice Admiral Keller&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"North%20Fleet\"&gt;North Fleet&lt;/a&gt; began to arrive on the eastern coast of the Howling Fjord. There, however, they met and engaged with a large &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; force based from &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Before long, most of the easternmost section of this fleet had been sunk by the Forsaken, while the survivors established a small camp at the &lt;a href=\"Derelict%20Strand\"&gt;Derelict Strand&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, these surviving crew members were able to hold out against the Horde forces, and even managed to board some of their ships, though they were eventually overwhelmed. A Horde shipment from &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; carrying a new form of &lt;a href=\"plague\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; was also intercepted and sunk by Alliance ships before it could reach Vengeance Landing.\nAnother detachment of the North Fleet eventually arrived to reinforce that attacked by the Forsaken. The &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; at Vengeance Landing employed a new type of plague against the approaching flotilla; though it forced the convoy to retreat, the only negative effects proved to be nausea and stomach pains.\nAlliance and Horde forces waged a constant battle over access to the port of &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Bay\"&gt;Venture Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. At least one Alliance &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Human%20destroyer\"&gt;icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; destroyer was involved in the conflict, commanded by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Brightwater\"&gt;Captain Brightwater&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Northrend campaign&lt;/a&gt; developed, the Alliance, Horde, and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; began to push into the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s main stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Alliance deployed the \"&lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; to act as a mobile base in the sky. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"High%20Captain%20Justin%20Bartlett\"&gt;High Captain Justin Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Skybreaker\"'s entry into the conflict represented one of the known uses of the Alliance gunship in battle. The \"Skybreaker\" would play a pivotal role for Alliance interests in the region, and often engaged with the Horde gunship \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" in firefights over Icecrown. The Alliance gunship would also go on to rescue Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, and even took part in the final assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where it distinguished itself under the command of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance gunships were also used in the campaign to secure the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; off Northrend's coast, where they frequently served to bombard the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Keep\"&gt;Horde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Human%20destroyer\"&gt;icebreakers&lt;/a&gt; would also take part in naval assaults on the &lt;a href=\"Strand%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Strand of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to wrest the ancient &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; citadel.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; reached &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;its climax&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" was stationed at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the fight against Deathwing and his monstrous allies. After providing fire support for much of the battle, it eventually acted as transport for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance and Horde as they pursued the Destroyer over the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt; towards the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nPandaria.\nShortly after the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;fall of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the royal flagship known as the &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Vanguard\"&gt;\"Vanguard\"&lt;/a&gt; carrying the Prince of Stormwind &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; on a diplomatic mission was attacked by part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s southern fleet in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. The ship would eventually run aground on an uncharted landmass that would soon be identified as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of Anduin's disappearance and the discovery of Pandaria, the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Fleet\"&gt;7th Fleet&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched to the continent, though it would take weeks to arrive. In the meantime, and sent immediately on board the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; to secure Pandaria and locate the prince.\nThe \"Skyfire\", under the command of &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, quickly arrived in Pandaria's &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; and was immediately engaged by a Horde fleet based around the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27ar%20Point\"&gt;Garrosh'ar Point&lt;/a&gt;. Unleashing its &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s and artillery upon the Horde force, the \"Skyfire\" eventually routed the entire army and managed to seize Garrosh'ar point.\nAn Alliance fleet, having arrived on the northern coast of the Jade Forest, managed to engage the Horde gunship \"&lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Hellscream's Fist&lt;/a&gt;\" as it too arrived on the coast near &lt;a href=\"Honeydew%20Village\"&gt;Honeydew Village&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance ships dealt serious damage to the gunship, which soon afterward took additional fire from Alliance forces based at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Hold\"&gt;Thunder Hold&lt;/a&gt;; it would eventually crash.\nLater on in the Pandaria campaign, the \"Skyfire\" would spearhead the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Zan%27vess\"&gt;Assault on Zan'vess&lt;/a&gt; against the corrupted &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;.\nOperation: Shieldwall.\nTwo months after the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance &lt;a href=\"7th%20Fleet\"&gt;7th Fleet&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the continent's southern coast in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, bringing with it a massive invasion force. Making landfall with the army, the expedition led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; (known as ) established a large naval base known as &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; in the east of the region. The 7th Fleet present, consisting of numerous &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\", immediately engaged with the Horde invasion force based from &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt; some distance down the coast. In the ensuing struggle, the Alliance's naval forces would bottle the Horde's into their harbor at Domination Point, though they suffered some casualties due to mines in the water. The \"Skyfire\" would act as a forward command post in the offensive to break the Horde base.\nNaval bombardment from the Alliance's fleet caused considerable casualties among the vanguard forces of the Horde, while some of the survivors from sunken Alliance ships also established small positions on the isles close to Domination Point. Back at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, Horde ships were largely kept in check by &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s and coastal batteries protecting the approach by sea.\nDuring the battle in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance navy outside Domination Point launched at least one major attempt to seize the Horde base that nearly succeeded, though it was eventually repelled. Similarly, Horde forces managed to infiltrate and threaten Lion's Landing, in doing so sabotaging and sinking several of the Alliance battleships moored there.\nIsle of Thunder.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; was launched to secure the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces were involved in the subsequent assault. Though regular Alliance soldiers did not directly take part, the ships used to reach and further secure the area belonged to the Alliance navy. Agents of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; would plant tactical &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s stationed near &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; during the conflict, though these were disarmed by members of the Alliance before they could detonate.\nAlternate Draenor.\nThe naval forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; played a practically non-existent role in the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; for much of the conflict, with the fighting taking place on &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;a distant, alternate version of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. When eventually seized control of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and pulled its forces back to &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance's commanders decided to construct a large &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in , with which to launch a less-costly assault on Tanaan.\nWith the aid of the shipwright &lt;a href=\"Solog%20Roark\"&gt;Solog Roark&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance was able to erect &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Shipyard\"&gt;a formidable shipyard&lt;/a&gt;, which was soon capable of producing almost every type of vessel in the Alliance navy. For the campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and Iron Horde, which spanned the all the oceans of Draenor, numerous &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, and even re-purposed Iron Horde &lt;a href=\"dreadnaught\"&gt;dreadnaught&lt;/a&gt;s to be used as aircraft carriers. In the ensuing campaign, dozens of missions, sea battles, and operations were carried out by the Lunarfall fleet across Draenor, extending Alliance control throughout the world. \nVarious new schematics were acquired and used to improve the designs of the fleet, which was ultimately under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; of the Lunarfall Garrison. With the eventual success of the campaign in Draenor, construction and maintenance of the Alliance's fleet on the world likely ceased.\nBroken Isles.\nBroken Shore.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; commenced, the majority of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s factions mobilized to strike against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic threat based from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance navy assembled in great numbers in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; for the attack, eventually setting sail for the Broken Shore and rendezvousing with a similar Horde fleet. Together, the combined armada began the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, which mainly occurred in two waves.\nThe first wave of the attack, led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, consisted of the bulk of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Fleet\"&gt;Stormwind Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, with the \"&lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Oath\"&gt;Lion's Oath&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; acting as the command ship for the Alliance's forces. This first attack force would suffer heavy casualties upon arrival, with the majority of the fleet destroyed, including at least two gunships. The second wave, spearheaded by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance alongside champions of the Horde, managed to successfully land on the Broken Shore on ships of the &lt;a href=\"third%20fleet\"&gt;third fleet&lt;/a&gt; and secure a beachhead against the Legion.\nThe second wave of Alliance and Horde was ultimately destroyed or beaten back too; many of the surviving Alliance only narrowly managed to escape aboard a gunship, while King Varian himself was killed. In the aftermath, the Battle for the Broken Shore proved to be a disastrous defeat for the Alliance, Horde, and others involved, with a sizable amount of the Alliance navy having been lost in the assault.\nStormheim.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance and Horde fleets began to converge independently on the region of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, ostensibly to locate the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, though conflict between the two sides quickly erupted. The \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\", having spotted the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Fleet\"&gt;Windrunner Fleet&lt;/a&gt; near the coast of Stormheim upon their arrival, immediately engaged the enemy despite being separated from the main Alliance fleet. , and a battle soon broke out between the forces of both sides.\nAs &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; troops systematically boarded the vessels of the Horde fleet, working their way to the royal flagship. There, however, they discovered that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had already departed, while at the same time the \"Skyfire\" had itself been boarded by Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the best efforts of the crew, Forsaken saboteurs managed to seriously damage the \"Skyfire\", which subsequently in western Stormheim. The Windrunner Fleet too was left practically wiped out by the battle.\nIn the wake of the opening conflict, Alliance naval forces continued to remain active in the area. Much of the crew survived the \"Skyfire\"'s crash and established the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20Triage%20Camp\"&gt;Skyfire Triage Camp&lt;/a&gt; near the wreckage. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; continued his offensive against Sylvanas's forces throughout Stormheim, and received naval support from at least one ship when he launched &lt;a href=\"Greymane%27s%20Offensive\"&gt;an attack&lt;/a&gt; on the Forsaken base at &lt;a href=\"Dreadwake%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Dreadwake's Landing&lt;/a&gt;.\nKul Tiras.\nThe beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and the fear that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would gain the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, prompted the Alliance to bolster its own naval forces. To this end, Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was sent to her home of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to enlist the nation's legendary fleet in the impending war. The &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; remained missing for some time, however, as Jaina's allies worked to bring Kul Tiras formally into the Alliance.\nThe fleet's return occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;Siege of Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, when Jaina used her own ties to the ships to call them back to Kul Tiras, just in time to prevent the city from falling to &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of this victory, Jaina was named Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras, and the nation's power was officially joined to that of the Alliance.\nRanks.\nSome of the known ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; navy, in order of most to least senior, are:\nRanks from across the Alliance's military forces have been known to cross over, or outright overlap, such as &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt;'s progression from a naval Admiral to an army General, or &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Tremblade\"&gt;Tremblade&lt;/a&gt;'s holding both the army rank of Grand Marshal as well as the naval rank of Captain. Note that the above table lists the characters in their highest known rank.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Naval%20Command\"&gt;Alliance Naval Command&lt;/a&gt; likely exercises supreme authority over all naval forces, at least under the authority of the Alliance leaders themselves."}

This coalition formed as a response to the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFollowing the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, its survivors fled to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing the threat the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s posed, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Regent Lord Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt;, was able to convince the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;leaders of the other human kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to unify against the orcs as the Alliance. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; and high elves also soon joined the Alliance, as well as the gnomes of Gnomeregan and the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; dwarves later in the war. The Alliance \u2014 under the leadership of Sir Anduin Lothar as its Supreme Allied Commander \u2014 ultimately defeated the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the battle of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Although Anduin Lothar was slain by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, his death inspired &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to push the Alliance to victory. Turalyon's forces succeeded in destroying the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the mystical gateway that connected the orcs to their homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Cut off from its reinforcements and fractured by infighting, the Horde finally buckled in upon itself and fell before the might of the Alliance, thus ending the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe scattered orc clans were quickly rounded up and placed within guarded internment camps under the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Internment%20Act\"&gt;Alliance Internment Act&lt;/a&gt;. Though it seemed that the Horde had been defeated for good, some remained highly skeptical that peace would last. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, now an &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; of some renown, convinced the Alliance &lt;a href=\"High%20Command\"&gt;high command&lt;/a&gt; to build the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; that would watch over the ruins of the Dark Portal and ensure that there would be no further invasions from Draenor.\nAfter the death of Lothar, the Alliance of Lordaeron was led by King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. He accepted ambassadors or the monarchs from all member nations and races to his capital. Rarely did the monarchs of the major realms come together. Generally, they spoke through couriers and diplomats, with the occasional state visit thrown in as well. One of the inner council of the Kirin Tor had ever been present at such events (with the exception of one meeting Dalaran was not invited, led by Lord &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, though spied upon by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe war left the Alliance in a dire financial situation. All kingdoms contributed, even &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, as its treasuries were added to the Alliance's after its occupation. The costs of reconstructing &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, of building up Nethergarde, and of staffing the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt; system proved an immense strain of their coffers.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s surgical command, the remnant orcs from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; eventually reassembled into the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, reopened the Dark Portal, raided several Alliance settlements, and rounded up several Azeroth artifacts that they needed before fleeing back to the safety of Draenor.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, convinced that the orcs were preparing a new invasion of Azeroth, assembled his most trusted lieutenants. He ordered General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and the archmage, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, to lead an &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;through the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to the orcish threat once and for all. Those recruited into the Expedition included veteran heroes of the Alliance such as &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance did its best to keep sending its Draenic expedition supplies and reinforcements, but in an ironic twist, while the Sons of Lothar were keeping their own side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; firmly under control, the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian side of the Dark Portal switched sides several times during the late stages of the invasion. The Alliance Expedition, however, never returned because Turalyon and Khadgar agreed to make the ultimate sacrifice by destroying the Dark Portal from their side on Draenor. Though it would cost their lives, and the lives of their companions, they knew that it was the only way to ensure Azeroth's survival.\nSeveral nations left the Alliance in response to decisions made after the Second War, including King Terenas's institution of a tax to fund the orcish internment camps and fund the rebuilding of Stormwind. Furthermore, there have been &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;heated debates&lt;/a&gt; on what to do with the vacant territories of the treasonous &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; wanting to annex portions of it to their kingdom while others wanted to hand the kingdom whole to an Alterac noble promising increased influence to their kingdoms.\nDisagreements over what to do with the lethargic orcs (mostly pertaining to internment camp costs) created tension between some member states of the Alliance of Lordaeron. In particular, Quel'Thalas, led by &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, became an increasingly cold ally, which ultimately led the high elven king to rescind his loyalty to the Alliance completely, and declaring his nation independent once more. Anasterian's secession, and the &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s, sparked the nations of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; to follow suit, and the Alliance of Lordaeron lost roughly half of its members in rapid succession.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; remained loyal to Terenas and the Alliance of Lordaeron. Thus, Kul Tiran fleets patrolled the trade lanes hunting pirates and marauders on the high seas. Several Alliance ships reported that they had escaped a band of pirates whose leader carried &lt;a href=\"Fate\"&gt;glowing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;blades&lt;/a&gt; oozing black smoke, and soon it became clear that those ships were the lucky ones. A newly empowered crew of pirates was preying on Alliance vessels, and when the raiders captured a ship, they left no survivors. Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led the search for the rogues, and after weeks of hunting, his small fleet cornered their ship a few miles off the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;' shores. The pirate crew seemed to be possessed, barely &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, but after a coordinated &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; barrage, Proudmoore sent the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellwether\"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;\", to the bottom of the ocean. The admiral sailed away, believing he had killed them all.\nYears later, an orc &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; led an orcish insurrection against the orcish internment camps. Some Alliance leaders feared the young &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; and his smaller volatile &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; may pose as dire a threat as the Old Horde did. At the same time, unbeknownst to the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; began forming the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; in Alliance lands and have been spreading the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s investigated the infected regions in the hope of finding a way to stop the plague. Despite their efforts, the plague continued to spread and threatened to tear the Alliance apart. As the ranks of the undead swept across Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt;' only son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, took up the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The Scourge was a difficult foe to beat, for the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; ranks swelled with every soldier that fell defending the land. Arthas began employing extreme measures to fight the undead, and his obsession with defeating the Scourge led to him losing his humanity.\nEventually, the Alliance was ravaged by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Terenas led the Alliance \u2014 since the end of the Second War \u2014 until his murder almost 20 years later at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the collapse of Lordaeron during the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas attacked Quel'Thalas shortly after, ransacking the elven homeland and nearly scouring the high elves from Azeroth. The survivors of this massacre proclaimed themselves &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in honor of their peoples' fall, and a group of them joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to reclaim Lordaeron from the undead. The blood elves abandoned the Alliance resistance due to racism on behalf of its commander and left Azeroth to escape to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Grand Marshal Garithos was killed in the following &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;civil war of the Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance resistance fell apart soon after his death.\nMemories of past allegiances and idealism ultimately inspired the new &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; of the present day led by the &lt;a href=\"Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; dynasty.\nOrganization.\nThe Seven Kingdoms, heart of the Alliance.\nWhen the refugees from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; bringing their tales of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the humans saw the common sense in forming an Alliance of their countries, and with their neighbor races.\nIt was not as simple as that, however. When the refugees arrived on the shores of Lordaeron fleeing the horrible Horde, King Terenas of Lordaeron called delegates from the seven nations of humanity together to meet to discuss the threat. &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron called the other human kings together to discuss the Horde and Stormwind. King Terenas took the refugees at their word about the danger in the south and agreed to join forces. Backed by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, he moved that the humans unite to save the Stormwind people and remove the Horde from the land. The other five leaders were harder to convince. Kul Tiras, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; were agreeable, while &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; were hesitant.\nAs they were meeting, the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; faced the Horde as it rampaged through their lands, and knew they needed aid if we were to protect their homeland. The Horde also caught the attention of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the races approached the humans to discuss the Horde and to eventually join the Alliance.\nMost of the human countries, after much quarreling, finally agreed to unite for the betterment of the future. They called themselves the Alliance and put their armies under the control of &lt;a href=\"Lothar\"&gt;Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, who had faced the Horde. They included all seven of the human nations, some more grudgingly than others.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Stormwind, the shattered southern human nation, brought its resolute and angry &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance. Now under the rule of the Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, these people once made up the mightiest of the human kingdoms. They mourned their beloved King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane Wrynn I&lt;/a&gt; who died when &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Horde, and they settled near &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, determined to take back their homeland.\n&lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Terenas II of Lordaeron proved to be Stormwind's staunchest ally, calling a conclave of all human kingdoms to meet and discuss the fall of the kingdom of Stormwind. Its armies were the heart and backbone of the Alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLordaeron\u2019s opposite was the kingdom of Stromgarde; its leader, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, led his kingdom with a strict, martial philosophy. While Lordaeron brought the priests, Stromgarde brought the warriors. This kingdom borders &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and served as the first area of defense from land-based attacks for the humans and sent half of its standing armies to the main Alliance army. Stromgarde left the Alliance after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, upset with certain political decisions.\n&lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Admiralty of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore led the island nation of Kul Tiras which is a naval and merchant country, and thus both rich and powerful. Proudmoore was an ally of Anduin Lothar, so he was Stormwind's second strongest-patron. Daelin Proudmoore, also the father of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, would later go on to invade the newly formed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, souring relations between the Alliance and Horde and meeting his death.\n&lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; ruled Gilneas, the human nation on the southwest of Lordaeron. Personally, he was a selfish old fool who only aided the Alliance when it benefited him. He joined them in the Second War but offered only token support. His coast is well fortified to this day, and a strong wall separates his peninsula from the rest of the continent. No one has seen the lands of Gilneas \u2014 or the people of Gilneas \u2014 since the wall was erected.\n&lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Magocracy of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDalaran was a nation populated by, and run by, magi. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; ran the country as a conclave, their committee leading the magi in an intellectual as well as political fashion. &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; was the true ruler of the Kirin Tor, and his wise, fatherly countenance became the sect's public face. They were once a powerful nation, strong allies of the Alliance, trading considerable knowledge for the protection of the other nations. Dalaran\u2019s archmagi were invaluable in the Second War. Later, in the Third War, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Dalaran. Currently, a magical wall encircles the area, where the ruins once were, while the rebuilt city itself went floating to Northrend.\n&lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the most notorious human noble of the Second War, was in charge of Alterac at the beginning of hostilities. Perenolde was cowardly and because of his weak will, he betrayed the Alliance, sending ships to strike at their vulnerabilities. Captured and ousted, now Lord &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden's son, leads the Syndicate, a bandit group that includes Alterac's fallen nobles who seek to reclaim their kingdom. They also have holdings in the ruins of Stromgarde and &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. In their desperation, it appears they have formed an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt;, an arm of the notorious &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nNon-human nations.\n&lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuel'Thalas, the kingdom of the high elves, is located on the northern tip of the continent of Lordaeron, northeast of Stratholme. At the time of the Horde's approaching invasion of Lordaeron, King Terenas sent emissaries to High King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Terenas mentioned that Lord Lothar was the last descendant of King Thoradin of Arathor. Millennia earlier, during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the elves had made a pact to aid Thoradin and his descendants, the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;. Anasterian, seeking an opportunity to fulfill the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt;'s debt to Thoradin, grudgingly sent a small force to the Alliance armies stationed in Hillsbrad. The party was led by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, a captain in the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Ranger%20Corps\"&gt;Silvermoon Ranger Corps&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Horde invaded Quel'Thalas and began burning the edges of &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria returned to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; to warn of the oncoming Horde and when Anasterian and the Convocation refused to acknowledge the threat, Alleria threw the head of a forest troll at Anasterian's feet, saying that she and her sister &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; had slain the troll near a river not far from Silvermoon. This provoked a reaction from the high king, who had fought against the trolls during the great war millennia earlier, and he ordered the full mobilization of his army to combat the Horde onslaught.\nAfter the Second War, tensions began to arise between the high elven nation and its human allies - humanity came to distance itself from Quel'Thalas; the elven kingdom, in turn, proving to be an uneasy ally. The tension came to a head when High King Anasterian Sunstrider seceded - the catalyst that led to both &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; following suit; a turn of events that changed the face of the Alliance and weakened it considerably.\nFollowing the nation's destruction after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving high elves cast off the name of their sundered brethren and proclaimed themselves the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;,\" in honor of their sacrifice. The sin'dorei would come to reclaim much of their ancestral homeland, and its &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;new leadership&lt;/a&gt; would come to ally with the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Dwarven%20Spy\"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; attempts at reforming amiable relations with the remaining Alliance member states.\n&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated to the north of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Hinterlands are home to the Wildhammer clan, renowned for their use of &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. Led at that time by High Thane &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer clan came under attack by what ultimately proved to be a diversionary tactic by orcish Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer. The Warchief deduced that if he sent a force to attack the Hinterlands, the Alliance would respond, allowing him to take the remainder of his forces into Quel'Thalas with the aid of troll Zul'jin and the Amani. Realizing their plans, Lothar dispatched Turalyon and Khadgar, along with half the Alliance forces, to travel north to Quel'Thalas and come to the aid of the elves, while he aided Kurdran in clearing out the remaining Horde forces in the Hinterlands.\nKurdran and his Wildhammers later came to the aid of Daelin Proudmoore's forces in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the Admiral's ships to focus on the Horde ships while the gryphon riders battled the dragon riders of the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe kingdom of Ironforge (aka kingdom of Khaz Modan) is the dwarven kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in the continent of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. It includes the lands of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; in the foothills of Ironforge Mountain. On their way to Lordaeron, the Horde conquered Khaz Modan and laid siege to the city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; itself but were unable to penetrate its defenses.\nThe capture of Khaz Modan allowed the Horde to obtain the mineral resources required to build a fleet of vessels to sail across the Great Sea into the Hillsbrad Foothills in southern Lordaeron. With their defeat at Capital City, Orgrim Doomhammer ordered a general retreat into Khaz Modan; &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the Bleeding Hollow, informed Doomhammer that if left unchecked \u2014 if his clan retreated to Azeroth with the remainder of the Horde \u2014 the dwarves would attack or, worse, link up with the Alliance armies that were most likely pursuing them.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; has been the capital city and home of the gnomish race for generations It is located within the dwarven region of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves gave the gnomes a place to build themselves a city, in the dwarven owned mountains of Dun Morogh, not too far from Ironforge itself thus the gnomes and dwarves built Gnomeregan. The gnomes were not founding members of the Alliance and were only represented by the dwarves and also considered part of the dwarven forces. Even though they were not leading members, they became major contributors to the war effort. Gnomes brought technical innovations to the battlefront. As members of the dwarven side of the Alliance, gnomes served the Alliance well during the Second War, providing valuable technology such as &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s to aid their cause, but, oddly, during the Third War gnomes did not lend their aid to the Alliance, barricading themselves in their city. This event greatly shocked the Alliance, but it was later revealed that the gnomes had their reasons. An ancient vile race known as the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s had dug their way into the city within depths of the earth, and devastated the gnome population after lengthy battle, finally driving the survivors to seek refuge within the dwarven capital of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther major groups and entities within the Alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Church of the Holy Light, or Church of Light, was a strong supporter of Alliance's effort. During the First War, the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; bravely supported the armies of the Kingdom of Stormwind with clerics who healed wounds and channeled devastating powers of Holy Light against their foes. With the defeat of Stormwind in the First War, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; and his surviving brethren fled their base of operation at &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; with the kingdom's other survivors to the shores of Lordaeron. There, Archbishop Alonsus Faol was one of the key figures in forming of the Alliance. Faol and his brethren continued to offer hope and teachings and power of the Light to anyone in need, but realizing that it would take more than people armed with power of the Light alone, Alonsus, along with his young apprentice &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, created an order of holy knights, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, known as the Knight of the Silver Hand.\n&lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the onset of the Second War, when the Alliance formed and began mustering its forces, several abbots openly wept as they realized that their pacifist priests would need to learn the arts of war; but Archbishop Alonsus Faol saw an opportunity to unite the sword and the chalice to create a new breed of holy knights: Paladins who were mighty with the hammer as well as the holy magic of the divine. He founded the Knights of the Silver Hand and began training paladins immediately. Uther was his first and greatest paladin.\nTol Barad.\n&lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; was a lesser human kingdom. It was the location of an island citadel controlled by Stromgarde during the war.\nDuring the middle of the Second War, the Alliance was approached by a man who offered his support to their cause - Daval Prestor, who claimed to be the ruler of \"a small kingdom in the north\". He managed to join the Alliance and became a potential candidate to succeed as the ruler of Alterac stating he was from there.\nHowever, as it would later be revealed, Daval Prestor was in fact the great &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in disguise, who sought to\nmanipulate the Alliance for his own deeds. It is not known if there really was a \"kingdom\" that he ruled.\nMeetings.\n\"Tides of Darkness\" and \"Day of the Dragon\" show some of the important meetings during the Second War. Included in these meetings were usually the human monarchs, the kirin tor, and the church of light, as well as a few other important individuals. The above image details one of these early meetings of the leaders and representatives of the Alliance of Lordaeron. At several of the meetings (though not all of them) were the monarchs and leaders of the seven human kingdoms and representatives from the dwarven and elven nations. The initial meetings included the monarchs of the nations of Lordaeron, as well as important leaders and individuals from other organizations, and cities. The large man with the axe is &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, and the pair in front of him are &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; is the man in the tricorn hat. Seated next to him is a female ambassador from Quel'Thalas (speculation would point to &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria or&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;). On her right, the quiet-cultured looking man is &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. The mage with his back to us may be the Dalaran leader &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; who was also at the meetings (however it is more likely Khadgar because Antonidas is described as being bald). Next to him is a large bearish man, with the heavy beard, on whose tunic can be observed to bear the letter \"G,\" this is &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarf is an emissary from Khaz Modan, who also represented the gnomes of Gnomeregan. &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; was also at the meetings as well, representing the Church of Light.\nLeadership.\n \n - \n - \n - "}

By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt; had risen to the rank of &lt;a href=\"%3AGrand%20Marshal\"&gt;:Grand Marshal&lt;/a&gt;, promoted not necessarily due to his own abilities, but by his father's reputation and title. He was the highest-ranking survivor of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s military after the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s rampage across Lordaeron, and he recruited what forces he could muster from both volunteers and conscripted civilians. Cut off from the chain of command, Garithos gave his human army the mission that he assumed the Alliance should have always had: the preservation of humanity above all else. Ignorant of Garithos' policies, officials from neighboring non-human states such as &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; sent him aid, recognizing him as potentially the last remnant of Lordaeron's government, and certainly the strongest warlord in the area. Lord Garithos marshaled the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and managed to retake &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to survive, the resistance and particularly the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; hid caches of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; and artifacts such as magical small buildings all over western &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood elves.\nGarithos and his men were joined by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his healthiest warriors voluntarily, although they were met with suspicions by the prejudiced human Garithos. Garithos assigned the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; increasingly difficult missions. He stationed them throughout &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and would have perished if not for the help of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;. They returned to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; but were scolded by Garithos for their tardiness and ordered them to repair three &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Observatory\"&gt;observatories&lt;/a&gt;. After the repairs, Lord Garithos went to the front lines and left Kael'thas to await orders. The next day an &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; sent by Garithos ordered the withdrawal of the human and dwarven troops from Kael'thas' command and sent them to the front lines. Then &lt;a href=\"Dalvengyr\"&gt;Dalvengyr&lt;/a&gt; and an undead army launched an attack on Kael'thas' bases. When the blood elves were going to be defeated, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;her naga&lt;/a&gt; appeared and helped Kael'thas fend off the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The combined armies attacked the undead and managed to kill &lt;a href=\"Dalvengyr\"&gt;Dalvengyr&lt;/a&gt;, but later Garithos arrived and saw the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. He condemned the blood elves for consorting with naga as an act of treason and imprisoned the blood elves; planning to execute them later.\nDivided.\nThe Alliance resistance was, so, divided into two groups: the human and dwarves loyal to Garithos and &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Kael'thas' forces&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; who were imprisoned.\nImprisoned and sentenced to death, the blood elves were rescued by &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas fought his way throughout the &lt;a href=\"dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Garithos%27%20Enforcers\"&gt;Garithos' Enforcers&lt;/a&gt; and his former friend &lt;a href=\"Jailor%20Kassan\"&gt;Jailor Kassan&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves planned to reopen the portal opened by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; that brought &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and redirect it to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, where they would then meet Illidan. However, they needed to keep &lt;a href=\"Garithos%27%20Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Garithos' Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt; at bay while his men crossed the portal. Kael'thas, Vashj, and some &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf%20Engineer\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt; planned a defense and managed to hold off Garithos until everyone made it through the portal.\nMind-controlled.\nSometime after the blood elves escaped, and Arthas left to defend the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Garithos and his forces were launching offensives into the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and soon after they were bewitched and mind-controlled by &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;. Along with Detheroc's &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; the Alliance resistance fought the forces of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, but were eventually freed from Detheroc's enslavement. Sylvanas then proposed an alliance with Garithos, to which he was offended by such an offer as Sylvanas had been part of the undead army that drove the humans out of Lordaeron in the first place. However, running out of military options, he reluctantly agreed to her terms: Garithos' army will aid her in her assault on &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for control of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Garithos assembled his forces and met with Sylvanas outside of her forward base, despite the fact that his clerk, &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;, and six other people advised him not to side with the undead.\nBetrayed.\nThe elves had left the Alliance resistance and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; were seemingly annihilated, with just humans and Bronzebeard dwarves left; yet the Alliance resistance persisted and went to fight for the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas, Varimathras, and Garithos planned to attack the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. They knew that &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; could only be defeated through attrition, so Sylvanas decided that they would assault his army from two fronts. Garithos' men would attack from the rear, while &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Sylvanas' forces&lt;/a&gt; would attack from the front. During the battle, Garithos' was informed that his &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarven reinforcements&lt;/a&gt; were lost. Infuriated, he went out to search for them. When he found them, he insulted them for their incompetence and commanded them to help him in the battle. With both armies attacking from two fronts, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar%27s%20Forces\"&gt;Balnazzar's Forces&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Loyalists\"&gt;Dreadlord Loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were all defeated.\nBalnazzar was \"killed\" by his brother &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Garithos ordered Sylvanas and her undead \"wretched animals\" to leave \"his\" city. Sylvanas, however, turned on Garithos and ordered Varimathras to kill him, which the dreadlord gladly did. The resistance is never seen again after the battle.\nCommand structure.\n &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; - Grand Marshal.\nIn the RPG.\nIt is known as the 'New Alliance' in the non-canon '.\nBalnazzar was unprepared for the alliance between the Forsaken and Lord Garithos' forces. After dealing with the dreadlord, Lady Sylvanas then turned on Garithos and slew him and his army to the man.\nSpeculation.\nAfter Garithos' death, the remaining resistance members may have been killed by Sylvanas' forces as well. This may be supported by the wording of \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" which states that the undead creatures betrayed Garithos and his warriors, probably implying that the Forsaken went after Garithos' men as well. They could have also been killed by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the Plaguelands. Alternatively, they could have escaped and joined the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; or the human pockets in Silverpine and Hillsbrad or the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "127747", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127747", "title": "Alliance technology", "text": "Many &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races have embraced technology. The two most fervent in their pursuit have origins that lead back to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s themselves. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, who are descended from robotic creatures called &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, display remarkable intelligence, strong engineering skills, and a zest for using those skills to improve the quality of life wherever they see fit. The &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, descendants of an early stone-built race known as &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, tend to focus their technological prowess on the manufacturing of weapons and armor. Perhaps the most technologically advanced of the Alliance are the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, who use highly advanced, &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;-based technology, enhanced by magic, to cross dimensions. Although not all of the Alliance races are obsessed with technology, all reap its benefits in one way or another.\nIn the RPG.\nTechnologically speaking, the Alliance is strong, with gnomish and dwarven inventions. Heavily armored &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s with massive guns often help take well-defended structures, or even serve to simply destroy an enemy's morale. The appearance of three or four armored vehicles can often break an enemy's morale without ever firing a shot. However, they are well armed in case they do need to fire.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; views &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; as an extension of a new way of thinking. Humans view technology as a powerful tool, yet not as mature or respectable as the power of magic. To them, the craft is best left to the gnomes and dwarves who invent new weapons, devices, and vehicles of war that the humans can benefit from while relying on the old ways of their own culture. Dwarves and gnomes are the true masters of steam and brass; for them, forge and artifice has always been a way of life, and technology presents new challenges that magic never has. The ability to craft magnificent weapons of destruction appeals to the dwarven sense of war, and firearms have become a respected aspect of their culture. Dwarven riflemen are feared, and their steam tank crews are also given tremendous respect for their skill in guiding their magnificent weapons of war. Gnomes, on the other hand, are more concerned with the practical applications of technology, using it to craft all manner of sights, scopes, helmets, constructs, and a variety of devices with odd uses, from targeting dummies to clockwork chickens. For a gnome, no idea is too silly or insane to explore through the craft of technology. The night elves view almost all technology with disdain, seeing it as another creation of artifice, another affront to the nature of the world, a violation that will one day lead to the same ruin that the high elves once spread with their love of the arcane. Yet it is clear to all of the Alliance races that the battlefields are changing thanks to technology. Firearms are a tremendous equalizer, and a trained sniper can be as deadly to a knight as a dragon's breath. The machines of war provide protection and weapons that level the field even against the mightiest of monsters. That the Alliance is aware of this bodes well for their future.\nWhat is technology? In simplest terms, it is science applied to practical use. Thus, by this definition, a simple can opener is a technological device. A more accurate description is that technology is the system by which an entire society provides for the wants and needs of its population. Thus, the dwarves of Ironforge are said to be more technologically advanced than the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, who are themselves far more advanced than, say, &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTechnology tends to improve as the demand for it increases. A society might go decades or even centuries without a major advancement before some bright inventor comes up with something that alters the fundamental way things are done. For example, wagon wheels help move heavy loads from place to place, while wheels of stone grind meal into flour. Put notches in a wheel, connect them together, and you have gears that can drive even more complicated devices.\nAll too frequently, war is the primary driver of technological advancements. The &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded this trend, developing gunpowder and firearms as a way to achieve an edge against their foes in combat. &lt;a href=\"Flying%20machine\"&gt;Flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s, originally just curiosities or at best-scouting tools, are now being outfitted with flak cannons and bombs. Who knows where these advancements will lead?\nAlthough there are always individual exceptions, the various races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; tend to view technology in different ways.\nIronforge dwarves.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are perfectly comfortable with technology, rapidly accepting and absorbing new inventions into their society. As dwellers in a tight-knit, underground city complex, they exchange new ideas easily and freely. Rarely do dwarves keep inventions to themselves \u2014 unlike &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, they aren't terribly concerned with the accumulation of wealth and power. They prefer to use technology to improve their lives, as well as the lives of their fellow citizens. Nowhere is this better seen in the creation of new devices to defend their population from threats, both internal and external. The dwarves don't intend to have what happened in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; happen to them. \nIronforge dwarves are a practical people, and they look at technology as a way to improve the world around them. Nowhere is this better seen than the way they use technology to advance their fighting prowess. From &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt; to long-range rifles, dwarves employ science for the art of war. Thus, most of their inventions are armor, weapons or war machines. Dwarven inventions include gunpowder, firearms, siege works, war golems and other weapons of war.\nHigh and night elves.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; disdain technology, primarily because they consider it an inherently destructive art. The &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;'s near-complete annihilation of sections of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in particular) with lumber-cutting machines stands as mute testimony to this belief. Still, a few elves dabble in the art, generally focusing on problem-solving devices instead of weaponry. Like the Horde, night elves deal little with technology, though the occasional gunman may be found among night elf ranks. Few elves employ firearms over good, strong bows. Technology is nearly alien to the night elves, as they do not trust it, even when used by allies.\nElven inventions include the self-heating cooking pot, softlight hanging lamp and aquadynamic fish attractor.\nHigh elven technology, like their &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, usually employ technology that combines magic with machinery. Like the blood elves, high elves create &lt;a href=\"arcane%20golem\"&gt;arcane golem&lt;/a&gt;s held together through magic more than machinery and employ them for military and security purposes.\nGnomes.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s are innovative &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s and are responsible for a vast variety of inventions, including more than a few that are commonly attributed to dwarves. Although a diminutive people, gnomes think big, often producing designs far too complex to ever be realized.\nTo gnomes, technology is a way of life. Even gnomes who take on other trades often tinker in their spare time. Because of their innate curiosity, they produce a wide variety of devices that are interesting or amusing but otherwise useless or impractical. While others might shake their heads at such folly, the gnomes value all invention, no matter how unimportant it might seem.\nUnlike the dwarves, gnomes think of technological items individually instead of socially. Where a dwarf might envision a force field generator as a way to protect his people from invasion, a gnome would look at the device as a way to keep him dry in bad weather. However, since their evacuation from &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, many gnomes focus their efforts on producing devices that will help them recover their homeland.\nGnomes are in many ways consummate organizers: gnomes can spend as much time (or more) organizing and planning a project as they do actually working on it. If the design fails, they try to learn why and fix it if they can. If they are met with success, they as often as not continue to tinker with and improve the design, often for years afterward. Thus, many gnomish designs feature a high degree of complexity and a low chance of failure, the exceptions being those that dabble with chaos energy \u2014 but even then, they take steps to ensure the worst that could happen is a brief, non-fatal failure. Among the well-known gnomish devices are the world enlarger, net-o-matic projector and harm prevention belt.\nHumans.\nWhile many &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s have become adept at working with new technologies, the vast majority of humankind views engineering as little more than a curiosity. Most continue to believe that polished steel armor and a strong, well-crafted sword are better than any complicated technological device could ever be. Furthermore, magic is so ingrained in the human psyche that the thought of science ever surpassing the mystic arts is laughable. Still, this attitude is slowly changing, for rifle troops and grenadiers appear in human military forces, albeit as irregulars. Human attitude to technology greatly varies, some have no use for it while others have been great engineers. Also, a few arcanists apply technology to their own experiments, producing simple combinations of magical and technological power. Where this trend may lead is yet unknown. \nThose inventions the humans have produced tend to be simple and straightforward, without the complexity of a gnomish device or the dangerous instability of a goblin creation. Some examples are spellpower goggles, the voice amplification modulator and the parachute cloak.\nWhile not as sophisticated as, say, a goblin &lt;a href=\"airship\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt;, humans employ sailing ships at least as advanced as those of any other race without a second thought. Most recently though, humans have begun manufacturing and utilizing airships known as &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s. These flying fortresses are the result of collaborations between gnomish, dwarven, and human technologies and serves as mobile remote bases for the Alliance."}

All current allied races are variants of a previously playable race, with the exception of vulpera, which are only goblins in build.\nRecruitment.\nAllied races can be unlocked after a player has reached level 40 on at least one character on their account. The player must then head to their faction's embassy\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players and the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players\u2014and complete the quests &lt;a href=\"The%20Call%20for%20Allies\"&gt;The Call for Allies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Choice%20of%20Allies\"&gt;A Choice of Allies&lt;/a&gt;, which will unlock individual quest chains to recruit each allied race.

Unlocking each allied race was originally a significantly more involved process, requiring reputation with a &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; associated with that race as well as the completion of an associated quest achievement. For example, in order to unlock the &lt;a href=\"A%20Feast%20for%20Our%20Kin\"&gt;A Feast for Our Kin&lt;/a&gt; quest chain to unlock &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, players first needed to earn reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt; and complete &lt;a href=\"Ain%27t%20No%20Mountain%20High%20Enough\"&gt;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Draenor orcs&lt;/a&gt; were first announced by &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; on January 30, 2018.

{"id": "13198", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13198", "title": "Area of Effect", "text": "Area of Effect, or AoE, are spells which affect more than one target within a pre-determined radius set by the game's mechanics. These effects range from &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt; spells to &lt;a href=\"DD\"&gt;DD&lt;/a&gt; spells and cover all points in between. Traditionally (as far as &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;s go), the anchor target (location at which the caster is aiming the spell), and those closest to that target, are affected the most by the AoE effect, with diminishing returns as the spell radiates outward. In World of Warcraft, most area spells are GTAoE or PBAoE, and all targets in the area suffer the full effect.\nTypes of AoE.\nThere exist a various amount of AoE spells in the game and they can all be put in the following categories:\nPoint blank.\nSome AoE effects are cast or used without having to target someone or something; the caster is the anchor for the spell. The effect/damage radiates outward from the caster up to a given range, affecting all targets, or the first given number of targets the expanding 'ring' impacts. These types of spells are referred to as \"PBAoE\", which stands for \"Point Blank Area of Effect\". \nCaster classes that are weak physically tend to have powerful PBAoE spells (if granted by their class). These sorts of spells require them to be right next to multiple hostile targets, so the spells are designed to be worth the danger.\nMelee- and tank-type classes are usually designed to take damage from multiple targets, and as such their PBAoE-type abilities tend to be very weak. \nThe perhaps most versatile version in WoW is the mage spell &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Explosion&lt;/a&gt;. A mage can run into the middle of a group of otherwise distracted mobs (perhaps by a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; holding their &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;) and start blasting away (or just start blasting without a tank, while a healer frantically keeps him alive). A few PBAoEs from a higher-level casters can normally take an entire crowd of weak enemies out.\nSome examples:\nPBAoE can also stand for Personal burst area of effect, indicating the effect radius bursts outward from the user.\nGround targeted.\nWith \"Ground Targeted Area of Effect\" (\"GTAoE\") spells, the player places a circle on the ground that will be the area of the spell effect. He carefully places this around his targets and clicks to start casting/&lt;a href=\"channeling\"&gt;channeling&lt;/a&gt;. All enemies that are in that area \u2013 or \"remain\" in that area for channeled or &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;damage-over-time&lt;/a&gt; GTAoEs \u2013 suffer the damage. Some examples: &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flamestrike\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freeze\"&gt;Freeze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hurricane\"&gt;Hurricane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Earthquake\"&gt;Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. Another exception is the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Nova\"&gt;Fire Nova&lt;/a&gt;, in which no area is selected; rather the enemies around any target with the shaman's Flame Shock active on them will be damaged instantly.\nArea damage cap.\nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%202.2.0\"&gt;patch 2.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, most area effect damage effects have an '&lt;a href=\"area%20damage%20cap\"&gt;area damage cap&lt;/a&gt;' which limits the potency of the spell if used against a large number of targets simultaneously. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the current area damage cap is 20 targets. This means AoE spells will deal the listed damage to each target up to and including 20 targets, reaching their maximum total damage output when striking 20 targets. Against more than 20 targets, the spell will deal the amount of damage it would deal against 20 targets, split evenly among all targets hit. For example, if an AoE hits each target for 10,000 damage, it would deal 10,000 per target against up to 20 targets. Against 25 targets, however, it would deal only 8,000 damage per target, as the spell would cap at 200,000 damage done (20 x 10,000). For more than 20 targets, the damage done will be equal to (DamagePerTarget x 20/NumberOfTargets). \nThis cap ignores critical strikes. In other words, the damage cap is calculated based on the non-critical damage per target, the spells is capped before critical strikes are taken into account, and critical strikes from the AoE can boost the damage past the AoE cap. Most AoE spells that deal damage from a debuff placed on the target (example: &lt;a href=\"Shadowflame%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;Shadowflame (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt;), rather than direct damage or a debuff from a ground-effect damage over time AoE, will not have an AoE damage cap.\nHeals.\n&lt;a href=\"Healing%20Rain\"&gt;Healing Rain&lt;/a&gt; and are AoE healing spell that affects everyone in its area, and their effect per player is reduced when they heals more than 6 players. Other healing spells such as &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Stream%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Stream Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; have a maximum number of targets they will affect."}

The price to earn his own freedom was to take one hundred orcish lives while fighting in the arena. Having won every battle against his opponents, Kargath marched out of Highmaul, only to discover the promise of freedom to be a lie. Kargath was thrown in a dungeon beneath the arena, and desperately severed his hand, which was bound by shackles, in frustration and rage. The other orc slaves, seeing his resolve, followed in his footsteps and did the same. They followed Kargath in his uprising against the ogres and helped him slay the emperor. Kargath showed the severed head of the emperor to his followers, and they raised their severed hands, armed with blades, cheering at him. This moment marked the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nResources became scarce on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Time\"&gt;Dying Time&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; left without enemies to inflict bloodshed on, the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; started raiding one another for resources, with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; barely able to maintain peace by ordering them to submit their finest warriors for controlled, one-on-one or small party fights in public display. The winners would receive food from the losing clan, and a supply of pure water as well as honor and fame. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was one of the regular victors in these arena fights, and the champion brought many resources back to the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nRatings.\nSeveral forms of rating exist for rated arenas. Arenas initiated as &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s do not affect any of your ratings, and are played against the selected opponents regardless of ratings.\nMatchmaking rating.\nMatchmaking Rating (MMR) is a secondary rating that is used to match groups of players against others at about the same skill level. Each player's MMR increases or decreases with each victory or loss, adjusted by the MMR of the opposing team, and can only be seen at the end of each fight. Match selections are determined based on the average MMR of the individual members of the team, i.e. if you have 1600 MMR, you will almost always fight against other teams with around 1600 MMR. \nPersonal rating.\nEach character also has its own personal rating(s). A separate personal rating exists for each type of arena (2v2 and 3v3) as well as for &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Personal ratings are only affected by your own accomplishments, and are adjusted according to your wins and losses against other teams.\nIf you have a personal rating of 2000 or more you will start being able to receive the elite equipment of the current season.\nGameplay.\nRestrictions.\nArena combat comes with a number of restrictions, intended to improve balance and fairness in matches. Some items and abilities are therefore not usable in arena. Many of these restrictions also apply to &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Restricted spells and items include:\nCross-team communication is prevented in arena and rated battlegrounds, regardless of faction.\nPre-match.\nUpon zoning into the arena, players start in a staging area. Health, mana, and energy are all restored, all buffs and conjured items are removed and pets are dismissed (debuffs will remain, and pets can be re-summoned once you zone in). Players are also given the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Preparation\"&gt;Arena Preparation&lt;/a&gt; buff, which removes the resource cost of all abilities.\nThe opposing team's target frames are displayed in the user interface, allowing players to inspect the class and &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; of their opponents. Players can also reset their &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s during the preparation stage at no cost, allowing them to customise their abilities in consideration of the opposition. Any changes made to a player's talents during this stage are reverted once the player leaves the arena.\nAfter 60 seconds of preparation, the match commences. All buffs with fewer than 30 seconds remaining are removed and rage/runic power is reset to 0.\nThe fight.\nPlayers battle it out until all the members of one team are defeated or choose to leave, or until 25 minutes have elapsed. If neither team has won after 25 minutes, the match will end in a draw.\nOnce a player dies, they can choose to enter spectator mode and observe the remainder of the match as a ghost.\nDampening.\n&lt;a href=\"Dampening\"&gt;Dampening&lt;/a&gt; is a stacking debuff that occurs in Arena matches that run too long, designed to prevent matches from ending in a draw. It reduces healing received and absorption effects by 1% per stack.\nShadow Sight orbs.\nLocated around each arena are a number of Shadow Sight orbs. Walking into one of these objects will grant the player the 15-second Shadow Sight buff, significantly increasing their &lt;a href=\"stealth%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"invisibility%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; detection, but also increasing their damage taken by 5% and preventing them from entering stealth. These orbs are provided in order to facilitate combat with opponents who may prefer to remain stealthed. The orbs are consumed on use, but regularly regenerate.\nPost-match.\nOnce all the players on one team have either died or left, a statistics window is shown similar to the ones in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. The window also shows any rating adjustments as a result of the match.\nThe statistics window also displays your MMR. Note that this is the only point at which it is possible to view your MMR, as this information is not accessible through any other means.\nArena teams.\nIn the past, players wishing to compete in arena combat were required to create or join an &lt;a href=\"arena%20team\"&gt;arena team&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt; formal arena teams were removed, along with team rating, and any player in a party of the appropriate size may queue for arena matches through the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20interface\"&gt;PvP interface&lt;/a&gt;. The term 'team' is still used to refer to a participating group of players.\nRewards.\nAt the end of each &lt;a href=\"arena%20season\"&gt;arena season&lt;/a&gt;, players that rank among the highest ratings within the 3v3 and 5v5 brackets are awarded &lt;a href=\"title\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt;s marking their accomplishments. Players who have been in at least 20% of a top arena team's matches will receive a title according to their standing. Gladiator titles also award players with Master Riding and a Custom Gladiator mount. With &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, arena ladders and rewards are no longer battlegroup-specific, but instead are sorted by region. See &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards%23Titles\"&gt;PvP title rewards&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nSkirmishes.\nSkirmishes, also known as Arena Skirmishes, are a casual version of arena combat, featuring 2v2 and 3v3 matches. Skirmishes are available to characters from level 15, with brackets every 10 levels.\nSkirmishes do not affect ratings, and are intended to be a good way to try out new team members, specs or comps, as well as providing a chance to engage in arena play on a more casual basis. Skirmishes are also intended to allow players who are less experienced in PvP or who lack the teammates for regular arena to discover and experiment with arena play for the first time. \nPlayers can queue for skirmishes in groups or solo, for either 2v2 or 3v3 matches. If the player's group does not fill the chosen bracket size, they will be matched with other queuing players to complete the team, similar to when queuing for a &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;. Each player's &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"class%20role\"&gt;class role&lt;/a&gt; will also be taken into account, and the system will attempt to create effective pairings, such as pairing a &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;. Characters with experience gains &lt;a href=\"Experience%20point%23Disabling%20XP%20gain\"&gt;turned off&lt;/a&gt; will be queued in their own pool, similar to with battlegrounds. Skirmishes use a hidden matchmaking rating to determine pairings, but are more focused on speed than other forms of PvP, and will find matches more quickly than regular arena matches. \nRewards.\nWhile primarily casual matches, skirmishes are not without their rewards. Winning a skirmish will grant the winning players honor, and at max level will also grant a Strongbox which may contain gold, more honor, a piece of Honor PvP gear, or rarely even a piece of Conquest PvP gear. Below max level, skirmishes will grant XP in place of Strongboxes.\nAt max level, Strongboxes are intended to be the main reward from completing skirmishes.\nBrackets and level scaling.\nSkirmishes take place in mostly 10-level brackets, starting at level 15. Max level characters will only be matched against other max level characters.\nBelow max level, players will have their effective level raised to the maximum level allowed in that bracket. Players' base stats and spells are scaled accordingly, and are treated as the same level when determining hits, misses, and critical effect chance. Note that although players' stats and abilities are scaled, lower-level players will still lack new abilities and talents not gained until higher levels, and may still therefore find themselves at some degree of disadvantage. Heirloom items are normalized to the maximum level of the bracket. Normal gear does not scale.\nBonus Event.\nDuring the Arena Skirmish &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Event\"&gt;Bonus Event&lt;/a&gt;, players earn 50% more honor when competing in arena skirmishes.\nHistory.\nSkirmishes were first introduced along with the arena system itself at the start of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\". However, by the time of \"\" the feature was seeing very little use by players and the feature was removed, replaced by &lt;a href=\"War%20Game\"&gt;War Game&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith plans for the \"Warlords of Draenor\" expansion, the developers felt a growing demand for a form of \"low-pressure\" arena play, leading them to consider reintroducing the feature. Another motivation was the observed higher player participation in gameplay such as battlegrounds where solo-queuing is possible. The reintroduction of skirmishes may also have partly come about due to the cancellation of the planned &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Gladiator\"&gt;Trial of the Gladiator&lt;/a&gt; PvP feature.\nSkirmishes were reintroduced in the \"Warlords of Draenor\" systems patch, &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nArena Tournament.\nEvery year an Arena Tournament is held on a special event realm where players of all battlegroups compete against each other for cash and prizes."}

{"id": "64130", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=64130", "title": "Arena Points", "text": "Arena Points are a currency earned by participating in &lt;a href=\"Arena%20PvP%20System\"&gt;Arena PvP System&lt;/a&gt; competitions with an Arena team. They are used to buy &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Rewards\"&gt;Arena Rewards&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarning arena points.\nWhile you can be on one team of each type, at the end of each week you'll only gain points from the team that earned the most points that week.\nHowever, note that given equal rating, 5v5 teams earn more points per week than 3v3 (88%), which earn more than 2v2 (76%).\nTo clarify with an example:\nResults at the end of the week:\nSo, you'd gain 344 points that week.\nNote: in the example we provided above the 1500 refers to the team's rating. The number of points an active player gets from a team is derived from the rating value plotted on a logistic curve.\n\"The transformation from your Team Rating to Arena Points starts off as a linear function, but once you go beyond a certain rating threshold, the function becomes logarithmic. This means that you will see a significant payoff increase once your Team Rating goes beyond a certain point, but the high-end spectrum of the ratings will eventually notice a decrease in how much bang they get for their buck.\" You can stockpile a maximum of 10,000 Arena Points.\nAlso, one of the points we were trying to illustrate above is that active players on that 5v5 team will gain 344 points each. This is the case regardless of whether there are 10 total active players on that team (the max possible), or merely 5 active players (the practical min).\nBlizzard doesn't want to \"split\" points among active players, as that would encourage you to not have alternates on the team, and they don't want to pressure you to minmax the system by always having the min number of players for a team.\nBear in mind that the arena point return for your team's rating isn't linear.\nThat being said, Blizzard is deliberately trying to encourage the most competitive players to participate in the 5v5 battles, as they feel considerably more comfortable with the potential class balance in this environment. 2v2 has far more potential for certain class combinations to be heavily favored, and as such Blizzard is being conservative about how strongly they reward the smaller format sizes.\nYour team only needs to fight 10 battles per week to be eligible for points. You can fight more if you so choose. However, due to the way the rating system works (and the way points are derived from rating), teams with high ratings are (in theory) increasingly likely to play only the minimum required number of battles. \nFormulae.\nOn 26 September 2007, the formulae used to calculate Arena Points were changed, as outlined on the official site about WoW arenas. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowarmory.com/arena-calculator.xml\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nPenalties:\nAs of Season 6 and later, the arena system was changed so that new teams start with a rating of 0 rather than 1500. Consequently, the formula was changed so that all teams below 1500 rating will earn points as if they were a 1500 rated team. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D15864860497%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nArena point reset in Wrath of the Lich King.\nOn November 19th, &lt;a href=\"Wryxian\"&gt;Wryxian&lt;/a&gt; (of the official EU forums) announced that arena points for players will be reset at level 71 and they will be removed from level 70 arena teams, \"Players who level past 70 will have their Arena points reset to 0 and be removed from all Arena teams in the level-70 bracket.\""}

This time they\u2019ve set up their pit-fighting operation in Pandaria's snow-swept Kun-Lai Summit, at the Temple of the White Tiger:\"\n\"Ah, I can still remember running fights out of a muddy hole in the ground back in Nagrand. We've come a long way, eh, Wodin? I tell you, there's nothing more these Tiger monks like than a good scrap. So much so that they've paid good coin for me to set up shop here and draw the strongest fighters from all around! So, how about it? You and a couple friends up for a few rounds in the Arena of Annihilation...? Big money, big prizes!\"\nStage guide.\nAs in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt; and similar old arena quests, the arena consists of a series of battles against increasingly powerful champions. There are five rounds in total, each started by ringing the gong. As always, the battles are overseen by &lt;a href=\"Gurgthock\"&gt;Gurgthock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wodin%20the%20Troll-Servant\"&gt;Wodin the Troll-Servant&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 1: Scar-Shell.\n&lt;a href=\"Scar-shell\"&gt;Scar-shell&lt;/a&gt; is the first challenge. He has a piercing bite which reduces the targets armor by 50%. Once in a while, he spins around the room at great speeds, dealing damage to anyone in his path, but he is extra-vulnerable after he stops spinning.\nStage 2: Jol'Grum.\n&lt;a href=\"Jol%27Grum\"&gt;Jol'Grum&lt;/a&gt; is the second challenge. He has two notable abilities:\nAdditionally, Jol'grum has a special energy bar that fills when he moves. If it reaches 100 he will get the buff Angry which increases his movement- and attackspeed for several seconds.\nStage 3: Little Liuyang.\n&lt;a href=\"Little%20Liuyang\"&gt;Little Liuyang&lt;/a&gt; is the third challenge. He chain casts a Fireball which can be interrupted. Roughly every 15-20 seconds he casts Flameline which creates a line of fire that deals damage to everyone who stands in it. \nHis special ability is called Flame Wall. He will deal 35,000 damage to anyone near him and summons three flame walls and three &lt;a href=\"Flamecoaxing%20Spirit\"&gt;Flamecoaxing Spirits&lt;/a&gt;. The spirits and flame walls will start moving against the clock, defeating a spirit will remove one of the flame walls. Additionally, as long as at least one spirit is alive, Little Liuyang will reflect 50% of the damage he takes back to the attacker. He will still chain casts fireballs during this.\nStage 4: Chagan Firehoof.\n&lt;a href=\"Chagan%20Firehoof\"&gt;Chagan Firehoof&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth challenge. He charges into battle alongside his yak steed, &lt;a href=\"Batu\"&gt;Batu&lt;/a&gt;. He has two abilities, the first is called Hammertime which is a PBAoE effect. The second ability is called Trailblaze. Trailblaze will summon three lines of fire in front of him and one behind him. These deal damage every second to anyone who stands in them.\nFinal Stage: Defeat the Final Challenger!\nIn the final stage you have to defeat the final challenger. This is one out of three randomly choosen enemies. \nMaki Waterblade.\nThe battle against &lt;a href=\"Maki%20Waterblade\"&gt;Maki Waterblade&lt;/a&gt; consists of two phases. During the first he will cast Wild Fixation every so often, fixating on a random player. He attacks this player with Crashing Slash which deals 150% frost damage.\nAfter some time, phase 2 will start. He will move to the middle of the room and uses a whirlwind attack. Additionally, water will flow in the ring from all sides, pushing you towards the middle. You have to run towards the water so it won't push you into Maki's attack.\nSatay Byu.\nThe battle against &lt;a href=\"Satay%20Byu\"&gt;Satay Byu&lt;/a&gt; consists of only one phase. Each of his attacks stacks a slowing poison debuff on his target, lowering the movement speed and eventually rooting it. He uses a Throw to deal damage to far away targets and also has a skill called Speed of the Jinja, which let's him attack rapidly for 50% weapon damage per hit.\nCloudbender Kobo.\nThe battle against &lt;a href=\"Cloudbender%20Kobo\"&gt;Cloudbender Kobo&lt;/a&gt; consits of two phases. During the first he summons Tornados which are moving void zones. He also has a Cyclone Kick where he deals AoE damage to anyone nearby. He can also jump a random target with Flying Serpent Kick.\nAfter some time Cloudbender Kobo will start flying around on a cloud, shooting lightning at the arena floor which leaves behind voidzones. He will fly one round around the arena before phase 1 will start again.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "247507", "revid": "42038977", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=247507", "title": "Arena team", "text": "Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, players wishing to compete in &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; combat were required to create or join an arena team. Teams could either be 2v2, 3v3 or 5v5 and could not comprise more than double the amount of players required for one fight (i.e. a 2v2 team could have no more than four people in it). Players could only join one team of each type. Each team had its own name, and its own crest creating using a built-in design tool.\nPatch 5.4.0 removed arena teams, allowing any players in a party of the appropriate size to queue for arena matches without formally creating a team. Team rating consequently ceased to exist, along with team names and crests. \nFor more information, see &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the arena.\nTo create an arena team, go to your Player vs. Player tab, default hotkey (H), click the Arena Teams tab and select the appropriate team that you wish to create. After selecting a name and tabard you can create the team and invite other players into it.\nTo join an arena battle, invite the number of players required to a &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; and click \"join battle\" from the conquest tab. The party must consist of either 2, 3 or 5 players (2 for a 2v2 team and so on), and all the players in the party have to be members of the same arena team. Once the \"join battle\" button is click, the team members will be placed in the arena queue.\nRatings.\nTeam rating.\nEach team has a team rating that increases or decreases when you win or lose an arena match. This rating reflects how well your team is doing in the arenas; the higher your rating, the better, and determines your placement in the region (i.e. US or EU) and &lt;a href=\"battlegroup\"&gt;battlegroup&lt;/a&gt; ladders. The rating does not make any difference in which enemy team you will be fighting, and neither does it make a difference in the amount of rating you or your opponent lose/win. That's all based on the matchmaking rating.\nWhen you create a new team, the team rating is set to 0.\nMatchmaking rating.\nMatchmaking Rating (MMR) is a secondary team rating that is used to team players up against others at about the same skill level. It changes every time you play an &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; battle and can only be seen at the end of the fight. MMR increases and decreases just like the actual team rating, i.e. if you have 1600 MMR, you will almost always fight against other teams with around 1600 MMR.\nA new arena team starts at 1500 MMR, and 0 rating. This means that you might actually end up fighting against a team with a rating of 1500 points higher than yours, but with the same MMR. If you win the match, your rating will go up with an amount fixed towards the opponent\u2019s MMR, and not based on their actual rating. \nThe amount by which your team rating changes depends on your team's matchmaking rating compared to the other team's mathmaking rating \u2013 if you win against a higher rated team, your team rating will improve more than if you steamrolled a weaker team. Similarly, losing against a weaker team will hurt your rating more than losing against superior enemies.\nPersonal rating.\nEach character also has its own personal rating(s). A separate personal rating exists for each type of arena team (2v2, 3v3 and 5v5) as well as for &lt;a href=\"rated%20battleground\"&gt;rated battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Personal ratings are only affected by your own accomplishments (others can battle, using one of your arena teams and changing its rating, while not affecting your personal rating). \nPersonal rating is used to increase the maximum amount of &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;Conquest Points&lt;/a&gt; you may obtain the following week, and to let you buy even more powerful &lt;a href=\"PvP%20rewards\"&gt;PvP rewards&lt;/a&gt;. The cap (for arenas) starts at 1350, but as soon as your personal rating exceeds 1500, the cap will gradually increase. This cap can be calculated if you go to the bottom of your character's armory profile and press \"More PvP information\", then click the \"Conquest Point Calculator\" in the top right.\nIf you have a 3v3 or 5v5 personal rating of 2200 or more you will start being able to buy the elite equipment of the current season."}

After the conflict ended, Aretain returned to his home in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; with a small group of loyal soldiers. These men and women were unwilling to put aside their hatred of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and over two years others who felt the same had joined them. Continuing Horde presence in Alterac \u2014 in bases such as &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 embittered these people even more. \nAretain soon lead a small band of bigots and cutthroats. They moved from place to place, establishing camps where Aretain felt they could fight the Horde most effectively. They saw all Horde members as evil creatures \u2014 including &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who observe the truce between the Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Since he didn't have the numbers to mount an assault, Aretain vowed to cripple the orcs in the Alterac region and drive them from his homeland \"by any means necessary\". \"Any means\" included the systematic slaughter of the few &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s that lived in the Alterac Mountains (which he believed orcs and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s were training to use as mounts) and poisoning the wells near every Horde settlement, no matter how small (which allowed poison to seep into the Alliance water supplies). Clearly, Aretain no longer walked in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. He was a &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; chief, and his actions damaged relations between the Alliance and the Horde."}

One group will stand on his left and the other will stand on his right, all players in each group will need to stack on the tank so as to mitigate his Meteor Slash.\nThe Meteor Slash applies a debuff to the first tank. The second tank immediately taunts to prevent further damage to the first tank. The first tank should retaunt Argaloth just as his debuff disappears, which will be two or three seconds after Argaloth Meteor Slashes the second tank; this means that for those two to three seconds the second tank will be taking increased damage. Repeat this pattern until 66% at which point Argaloth will cast Fel Firestorm.

As a world-wide organization maintaining a status of neutrality, the Argent Crusade is not a political body, nor do their members ever wish to become one. Their cause is to fight swiftly and mercilessly against any element of evil that surfaces in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, they call both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; both as allies in the cause of stamping out evil, and therefore recruits from all races without distinction.\nFounded by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade was a major contributor to the successful &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;campaign in Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where they temporarily allied with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; and topple the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, they worked to restore the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of the Argent Crusade led by Tirion Fordring were decimated on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Under the lead of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded the late Tirion, the surviving troops of the Crusade allied alongside all the paladin orders of Azeroth to reform the Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade managed to reform its ranks and faced the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;resurgence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, assisting the Alliance and the Horde against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Since the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the crusaders hold their positions in Northrend to prevent the undead from threatening the rest of the world.\nHistory.\nThe Argent Crusade was formed shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 leader of the reformed Silver Hand \u2014 who reclaimed, and evidently purified the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; during a confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. He assumed a leadership position over the Argent Dawn and united the two factions in order to take the fight against the Lich King to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Argent Crusade became an organization where all people of Azeroth could come together to fight the Scourge, but the highlord took care to ensure they would never fall to blind fanaticism like the Scarlet Crusade, that they would remember always who they were fighting for and not just what they were fighting against.\nAs the newly formed Argent Crusade set out to annihilate the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell remained the Crusade's operations chief in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. He began the fortification of Light's Hope Chapel, then undertook to take over the old watchtowers of the region and to restore them.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nNorthrend invasion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; began, the Argent Crusade launched the invasion of Northrend alongside the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, only the Argent Crusade and the Knights of the Ebon Blade had remained fully dedicated to the war against the Scourge. The two neutral factions had rallied their forces and readied themselves to unleash a new offensive against the Lich King and his servants across the continent.\nHowling Fjord.\nThe Argent Crusade began its invasion from &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;, where Tirion Fordring managed to set foot on the continent under the disguise of a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20of%20the%20Crusade\"&gt;Cleric of the Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and where he retrieved &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irulon%20Trueblade\"&gt;Lord Irulon Trueblade&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Ares%20the%20Oathbound\"&gt;Ares the Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed his life to protect and transport the legendary weapon, while Tirion was avoiding the Lich King's agents sent to intercept him. Despite Trueblade's request, the Highlord revealed his identity and declared loud and clear that the Argent Crusade has arrived, and that they would advance until they defeated Arthas.\nDragonblight.\nThe Argent Crusade was present in Dragonblight where they had two outposts: &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Dawn's Reach&lt;/a&gt; which is directly south of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Trust\"&gt;Light's Trust&lt;/a&gt; just outside &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27kalar\"&gt;Jintha'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, from where they fought the Scourge by freeing the damned souls at the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shore\"&gt;Forgotten Shore&lt;/a&gt;, and by shattering the undead defenses at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; broke a tenuous trust that had only just begun to form between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly ended the war against the Lich King before it had truly been joined. It was then the Argent Crusade and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; that took over the push for the Lich King's head, and kept both factions from forgetting entirely who the true enemy was.\nZul'Drak.\nWhile the main focus of the Argent Crusade was Icecrown, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; was a natural place for them to fight the Scourge, who had made the area into a sort of base of operations. From there conducted their own operations and some in cooperation with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Working in tandem, the paladins and death knights entrenched themselves in the region. This, in turn, brought &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Drakuru\"&gt;Overlord Drakuru&lt;/a&gt;, who conquered the remaining &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; to deliver them to the Scourge after being empowered by the Lich King, into direct conflict with the recently-arrived Argent Crusade.\nIn the first tier of Zul'Drak, the Argent Crusade had two outposts, &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Light's Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Forward%20Camp\"&gt;Crusader Forward Camp&lt;/a&gt;, from which they directly fought the hordes of undead trolls.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Korfax\"&gt;Crusade Commander Korfax&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade choose the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Stand\"&gt;Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt; as their main base in the region, and used it as a defensive position to keep the Scourge from taking the second tier of Zul'Drak. This effort failed, but the crusade had not given up. They then worked with agents of both the Horde and Alliance to disrupt Drakuru's plans, which included using the plague to transform the ice troll inhabitants of Zul'Drak into undead minions of the Lich King. They also collect and do some research on a &lt;a href=\"Saronite\"&gt;dark cursed metal&lt;/a&gt; used by the Lich King for his army.\nAt some point, when the Scourge invaded Zul'Drak, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; didn't go quietly and brought down the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kolramas\"&gt;Kolramas&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately for them and the detachment of the Argent Crusade that was nearby, the crash didn't kill all the &lt;a href=\"Hath%27ar\"&gt;Hath'ar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s inside. Under &lt;a href=\"Malas%20the%20Corrupter\"&gt;Malas the Corrupter&lt;/a&gt;, undead nerubians began to emerge from the necropolis and started raising up any dead they could get their nasty claws on, including fallen Argent crusaders which they &lt;a href=\"Scourged%20Argent%20Footman\"&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; against them.\nUltimately, Drakuru's death at the hands of the Lich King for his failure marked the end of the Scourge power in Zul'Drak, leading the Argent Crusade continued to push further into Northrend.\nIcecrown.\nWith the majority of preliminary threats behind them, the Argent Crusade found themselves faced with the daunting prospect of invading &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge's base of operations. Having mustered a large army to fight the Scourge, the Argent Crusade, led personally by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, advanced into the region from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Vanguard\"&gt;Argent Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; was their first forward base when they breached Icecrown. Located in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Valley of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;, the crusaders proceeded to create a breach in the cliffs, giving them a path into Scourgeholme, which the highlord hoped to conquer and remake into an Argent Crusade fortress.\nThe encampment immediately came under heavy attack by waves of undead of every sort assaulting its battlements from the Scourge stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Scourgeholme\"&gt;Scourgeholme&lt;/a&gt;. The Argent Crusaders fought back with zeal, using melee weapons and cannons to repel each undead attack, aided also by some members of the Alliance and Horde. Withstanding even hosts of frost wyrms, the Argent Crusade succeeded in throwing the Lich King's minions back from the valley. Not pausing, the breach was reopened and the Argent Crusade began working to establish a foothold on the far side. To achieve this, however, the Crusade's leaders deemed it necessary to pacify Scourgeholme. Under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the lords of Scourgeholme were slain and the garrison became unable to resist any further action by the invaders.\nPressing their advantage, the Argent Crusade next assaulted the nearby height, mockingly known as &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Crusaders' Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, and held the position against repeated Scourge counterattacks. Having sanctified the once-blighted ground, the Argent Crusade began construction of a new fortification, &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Keep\"&gt;Justice Keep&lt;/a&gt;, atop the Pinnacle. The base would mark the Crusade's establishment inside Icecrown, and stand in direct defiance to the Lich King and the Scourge.\nAt some point, forces of the Argent Crusade arrived for the assault of one of the region's first obstacles: . There, they discovered that the Alliance, the Horde and the Scourge forces had mutually annihilated each other during the battle. The crusaders were only able to recover a portion of the wounded and dead, while the Scourge remained in control of the Death Gate.\nDuring the most intense phase of the battle in Icecrown, the Argent Crusade received information about the existence of the heart of Arthas Menethil. With it, Tirion Fordring decided there could be a chance to make Arthas human again, redeeming him and ending the threat of the Lich King simultaneously. He planned to seize the frozen organ in an ambush as it was being transported from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. However, before the trap could be sprung, the Lich King himself appeared and immediately seeing through the paladins' trick and claiming that, unlike &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, they would not be fighting on holy ground and Tirion would lose. To the surprise of the Lich King, Tirion proceeded to strike the organ with the Ashbringer, giving up all hope of bringing redemption to Arthas, critically injuring the Lich King and triggering an explosion that knocked Tirion unconscious. As the Argent champions moved to defend Tirion from the surrounding cultists, Darion Mograine and a force of Ebon Knights arrived, holding back the tide of Scourge forces and allowing those gathered to escape through a portal.\nThe Argent Tournament.\nAfter progressing through the territories of Icecrown, where Tirion Fordring handpicked every member in the Argent Crusade in order to avoid infiltration by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, this was presumably to prevent a repeat of the &lt;a href=\"Inigo%20Montoy\"&gt;Inigo Montoy&lt;/a&gt; incident which resulted in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; returning to Northrend and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; regaining corporeal form, the Argent Crusade, recognizing that the time was fast approaching when they would be forced to finally deal with the Lich King, began to make preparations for the inevitable assault on the Scourge's greatest fortress: &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter weeks of observing the Scourge and its movements, they realized that an ultimate assault would lead them to defeat, the Lich King being ready for such an assault which would inflict great damage on him, but which would be fulfilled by bringing his enemies back to his ranks.\nTo this end, the Crusade announced the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, an event that would, among other things, attempt to create some semblance of order between the ever disparate Horde and Alliance, but also to train this large army in preparation for an assault on the Lich King's bastion, and more importantly, to determine the very best fighters present who would then be used to create a small strike force that would lead the charge into the Citadel. The reasoning behind using a small force to spearhead their assault lay in the fact that any great loss of life that they might suffer would only serve to reinforce the Scourge, and subsequently might leave the rest of the world open to attack.\nThough criticized by members of both factions, the tournament went ahead in the far northeast of Icecrown and achieved a good start, with both factions in full attendance (the Alliance championed by the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde by the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the Knights of the Ebon Blade. Both &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; also made appearances and agreed to observe some of the tournament's trials in the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Peacekeeper\"&gt;Argent Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt;s maintained a constant vigil throughout the grounds, policing the tournament to ensure there was no conflict between the Horde and Alliance.\nSoon, however, the tournament drew the attention of the Lich King, who sent forces to disrupt it in a number of ways, with assaults and kidnappings from the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, the infiltration of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament, and attacks from &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, partly in an attempt to free &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20Twins\"&gt;some of their kind&lt;/a&gt; which the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s had captured, though they were unable to inflict any lasting damage. As part of the tournament's program of training its aspirants, potential champions were sent to rescue as many of the captured as possible, before they could be used in the Cult's dark rituals. Similarly, aspirants were also dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt; in front of the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in order to begin preliminary attacks on the Citadel's defenses. This involved launching forays against the &lt;a href=\"Boneguard\"&gt;Boneguard&lt;/a&gt;, an army of undead guarding the approaches to their master's fortress.\nCrusader's Coliseum.\nTowards the end, the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; was held, the culmination of the entire Argent Tournament. Just as the event concluded, and Highlord Tirion announced the long-awaited attack on Icecrown Citadel, the Lich King himself appeared in the coliseum. Despite being outnumbered, he seemed unconcerned and reminded those gathered that the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nerubian empire&lt;/a&gt; extended far across and beneath the entire continent, then proceeded to shatter the very floor of the arena, dropping the Crusade's champions deep into a series of underground tunnels to confront a resurrected &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the ambush, Anub'arak was vanquished, marking the conclusion of the Argent Tournament, and the beginning of the assault on Icecrown Citadel.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nAs armies began to prepare for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade and the Knights of the Ebon Blade launched preliminary attacks on its defenses. In the lead up to the final battle, the Argent Crusade forged a new alliance with the Knights of the Ebon Blade, one which would lead the assault on the Icecrown Citadel's defenses, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; was born; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUY3oZH6Piz4\"&gt;united, they gathered in the mighty fortress's shadow to begin the assault&lt;/a&gt;. Having swept aside opposition and seized the Citadel's entrance, the Argent Crusade were the ones who breached its gates; they sacrificed much, and without question, to see the Lich King fall. The Ashen Verdict then secured a foothold just inside the entrance, from which they would push deeper into the complex.\nAnd while all the fortress's defenses either defeated or engaged, and the way to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; open, the time to strike at the head of the Scourge itself had finally come. The champions, led by Tirion Fordring, now ascended the Citadel further to reach the very top, where the Frozen Throne and Lich King awaited. Upon reaching the location, Tirion ordered the attack on Arthas following a declaration that he would pay for the many thousands he had slain. Before Tirion could enter the battle, however, the Lich King cast a powerful spell on him, freezing and incapacitating him in a block of ice.\nThough outnumbered, the Lord of the Scourge ferociously fought the champions until he called upon all of the fury contained within Frostmourne for a powerful spell which effectively finished off all of them. Standing above the corpses of his foes, the Lich King, exultant, began to cast a spell to raise from the dead those he had slain. As he did so, he revealed that he had both foreseen and intended for all to happen as it did, that each challenge the champions had encountered since arriving on Northrend had been specifically placed by him in order to test them, and that now Tirion had delivered those who he now knew to be the most powerful in the world into his very hands. He would now raise these champions as lords of the Scourge, and they would usher in a new age of Scourge dominion on Azeroth.\nWith a prayer to the light asking for the power to escape from his bonds, Tirion, without warning, shattered his icy prison and leapt at the Lich King as he was in the midst of his spell. Glowing with light, and with one swing of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion managed to destroy Frostmourne with the Ashbringer. Immediately, the souls of the many thousands slain by the blade escaped, swirling around Arthas, raising him into the air, and incapacitating him. Terenas's spirit, also released, used his remaining power to quickly resurrect Tirion's slain champions. Together with the Highlord and Arthas's father, they struck at the now-vulnerable Lich King, marking the end of the war against the Scourge, and the birth of the new Lich King &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, crowned by Tirion Fordring to seal the fate of the Scourge on Azeroth.\nThe victorious champions of the Crusade returned to Dalaran, where a golden statue named &lt;a href=\"Dedication%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Dedication of Honor&lt;/a&gt; was built in honor of the heroes who died during the Scourgewar. At the very top of this monument stood a statue of Tirion, with four soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; circling beneath him, with the Ashbringer raised, and standing over a shattered Frostmourne.\nCataclysm.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade has strengthened its presence in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, claiming not only outposts formerly held by the now-defunct Argent Dawn such as &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, but also the town of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; from the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and the four towers that span through the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;; around which the plague has receded.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, a subsection of the former &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;'s ranks, now the Argent Crusade, also began their own campaign against the remaining &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with an assault force of one hundred men; which ended with the capture of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; from the undead, but also with the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, now under the control of the Argent Crusade, after the death of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Brotherhood and the Crusade are still allied with one another, the Argent Crusade is concerned with the Brotherhood's recklessness, and their dislike to the Crusade's rigid code of ethics.\nThe Argent Crusade also joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to help heal the Plaguelands from its blighted state, and has resumed the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;'s original mandate: to fight swiftly and mercilessly against any element of evil that surfaces in Azeroth as a non-governmental organization. They also watched &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;'s movements during this time.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Iron%20Horde\"&gt;war against the Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, several members of the Crusade came to . &lt;a href=\"Soulare%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;Soulare of Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; supported the factions' &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s, while &lt;a href=\"Gidwin%20Goldbraids\"&gt;Gidwin Goldbraids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talren%20Highbeacon\"&gt;Talren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Highbeacon\"&gt;Argus Highbeacon&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Tarenar%20Sunstrike\"&gt;Tarenar Sunstrike&lt;/a&gt; accompanied &lt;a href=\"Fiona\"&gt;Fiona&lt;/a&gt;'s caravan into . There, the group fought against the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and was aided by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Leonid%20Barthalomew%20the%20Revered\"&gt;Leonid Barthalomew the Revered&lt;/a&gt; also visited the garrisons, seeking more insight into his undead condition from in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began, the Argent Crusade were the first to launch an assault force against the Legion to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was a disaster, with armies of demons pouring from the tomb, the Argent Crusade was decimated and many prisoners were taken, including the Highlord. When the Horde and Alliance fleets arrived, held Tirion Fordring above a pool of lava as a trap to lure in Azeroth's forces, before summoning the giant &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt; who spews a storm of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; at Tirion, destroying his &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; and gravely wounding him. Gul'dan then dropped him into the lava as a final way to erode the Alliance and Horde's morale.\nThe Argent Crusade was later involved in the recovery of the artifact &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the Champion of the Light at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. They were also involved directly in the recovery of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Ashbringer (artifact)&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, as the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Tirion Fordring survived and was held captive by the Legion and tortured by &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20Zerus\"&gt;Jailer Zerus&lt;/a&gt;. He was later freed, but the torture he received was too much for him, and the Crusaders attended the death of their Highlord. After choosing a new Ashbringer successor at the head of the crusade, he passed away, and his body was then buried amongst the ancient heroes of the Light in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, where a memorial service was held in his honor.\nFollowing the ceremony, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; told the hero paladin that they could assume the mantle of Highlord of the Argent Crusade. However, the decision was made to reform the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; instead alongside the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, the survivors of the Crusade, and the Silver Hand members located at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, all united under the command of the new Highlord. Lord Maxwell Tyrosus assumed the post of leader of the Argent Crusade, and right-hand man for the Highlord.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Assault on Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who came to retrieve Tirion's body and make him the last member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Argent sentries fought alongside the Silver Hand forces to repel the undead invaders. While they were defeated, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself intervened and burned the surrounded death knights, forcing them to flee and granting victory to the paladins.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the status of the Argent Crusade with the Knights of the Silver Hand is unknown as the Order is once more affiliated to the Alliance, but the Argent Crusade is still active and neutral as &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Wilkers\"&gt;Sean Wilkers&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; from one of the two factions worked on clearing out of the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Service%20Entrance\"&gt;Stratholme Service Entrance&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; activity increased in the ruined city.\nForsaken Argent Mages are also present in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s new portal room conjuring a portal to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly enough, they are wearing the old &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Tabard of the Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentions in his reports that the Argent Crusade is still active in the Plaguelands. At Hearthglen, &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; has become a training ground for new recruits, and the place where artifacts recovered by the Argent Crusade are stored under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Myner\"&gt;Lieutenant Myner&lt;/a&gt;, among them the &lt;a href=\"Barovian%20Family%20Sword\"&gt;Barovian Family Sword&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barovian%20Ritual%20Hood\"&gt;Barovian Ritual Hood&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade forces are scattered all over the region where corruption is slowly starting to fade away, they continue to maintain and protect the towers which serve as true oases for those who pass through these devastated lands. They also continue to control parts of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crusade's reports also mention that &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; was still in operation as a school of necromancy, and is under investigation. They also reported that some of the Barovs are still there and &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt; has many puppets to play with. This includes &lt;a href=\"Jandice%20Barov\"&gt;Jandice Barov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rattlegore\"&gt;Rattlegore&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, the uncontrolled Scourge began to rampage across Azeroth. The Argent Crusade sent emissaries and troops to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, in order to protect both capitals and their surrounding regions from undead invasions and attacks of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn one of their patrols, the Argent Crusade saw &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; sitting on his &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;front porch&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, not even trying to hide. They alerted the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, before fighting alongside the champions of Azeroth against the Blightcaller, and witness his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt; came under concentrated attack by the Scourge and became the Crusade's main base of operations in fighting the undead back. As the attack was as sudden as it was unexpected, many valiants laid wounded, while the civilians participated in defending the area as best as they could. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Justicar%20Mariel%20Trueheart\"&gt;Justicar Mariel Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; requested the support of the Crusade's forces in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, they managed to repel the undead and save the lives of many injured.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in their exploration report that the Argent Crusade maintained its settlements across &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the Scourge. While many forces have been drawn down in Northrend, the Argent Crusade presence remains strong as there are still so many Scourge.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, the crusaders continued to use &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Light's Breach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Stand\"&gt;Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the latter hosting quite the population of crusaders, as positions to repel the undead who threw themselves against their fortifications.\nWhile the Argent Crusade maintained a presence in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, they have mostly drawn down the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Vanguard\"&gt;Argent Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; in favor of the stronger and more permanent fortifications of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, but still used it as a way station into Icecrown for their soldiers. After the Jailer's defeat, the tournament grounds have been remade into a place for the Argent Crusade and any who would fight the Scourge to train, and they still get the occasional incursion of the Scourge.\nBases throughout Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;\nReputation.\nDescription.\n\"Led by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade combines the reformed &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in one final push against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nQuests.\nDaily quests.\nAlso six quests at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; once you reach a high enough rank.\nNote: that these quests will give &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; reputation instead for &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nReputation can also be gained by purchasing &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Tabard of the Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Crusader%20Aliocha%20Segard\"&gt;Veteran Crusader Aliocha Segard&lt;/a&gt; in the Argent Vanguard. This tabard, while worn in level 80 dungeons, awards 2 to 30 reputation per mob depending on its difficulty and 300 reputation per boss to your standing with the Argent Crusade.\nSince \"\", Argent Crusade reputation is also provided by most quests in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSpeculation.\nThe Argent Crusade and its predecessor the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, both have an unusually high number of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; holy men and women in their ranks compared to any other faction, including the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. They come as &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Cleric\"&gt;Clerics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Priest\"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Healer\"&gt;Healers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Initiate\"&gt;Initiates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Lightbringers&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it is possible that these faithful of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; are members of the Lordaeron branch of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; who were initially freed with the other undead and decided to band apart because of the tendency of the Forsaken to instead be &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Crusade took over the now-defunct Argent Dawn's outposts in the Plaguelands, effectively swallowing it.\nHistory.\nAshbringer.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; became more zealous and fanatic. However, there were those who believed that their comrades had fallen from their once-noble purpose (most notably &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;), and left to form their own order \u2014 the Argent Dawn. Those that did not break away from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;'s command formally named themselves the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; later arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; and aided the Argent Dawn against a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attack led by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was repelled when Darion sacrificed himself using the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Scourge collected the bodies of Darion and some others of the Argent Dawn.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt; was the first leader of the Dawn. He led his soldiers to fight against the Scourge. Their &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s raised the Dawn's fallen soldiers and created twisted golems to slay more soldiers. After Raymond's demise, Tyrosus succeeded him.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWhile they shared the same goals as the Crusade, the Argent Dawn opened its ranks to not only other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races besides &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, but also members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and even some of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. They cautioned discretion and introspection, and put a lot of emphasis on researching the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and how to combat them. The Argent Dawn's cause is simple - fight swiftly and mercilessly against any element of evil that surfaces in Azeroth. They insist they are not a political body, nor do they ever wish to become one.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20the%20Sanguine\"&gt;Siege of the Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; was an attack on &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; by a large army of undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kirkessen%20the%20Zealous\"&gt;Kirkessen the Zealous&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, the attack was quickly repelled and Kirkessen suffered an incurable wound from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; that made Kirkessen unable to serve the Scourge in corporeal form. Recently, Argent Dawn learned that the necromancers of the Scourge were creating their own &lt;a href=\"plagued%20dragon\"&gt;plagued dragon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith time, the Argent Dawn grew diversified. A sub-faction of the Argent Dawn, the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, worked to keep relations between the Argent Dawn and Scarlet Crusade from growing violent. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Commander Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; has been leading the coalition's efforts to assault &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their influence, the Argent Dawn did not have the manpower of the Scarlet Crusade, and could not stand alone against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the Argent Dawn and the Scarlet Crusade formed an uneasy alliance in order to focus their combined strength against &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s forces in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Pureheart\"&gt;Argent Officer Pureheart&lt;/a&gt; recruited adventurers to slay the Scourge in the Plaguelands, while &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt; tasked adventurers with raiding &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their tenuous alliance, Zverenhoff condemned the Scarlet Crusade as &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemers&lt;/a&gt; and directed adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Galford\"&gt;Archivist Galford&lt;/a&gt; and burn down his archives in order to take away the Scarlet Crusade's most valued documents and punish them for their &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;heretical&lt;/a&gt; zealotry. Adventurers eventually confronted &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and during their battle with him, uncovered that he was really the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; in disguise. Adventurers sent the &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Balnazzar\"&gt;Head of Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; to Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff as proof of Balnazzar's evil masquerade. Zverenhoff was shocked that the Crusade was manipulated by such an evil force and pondered what the ramifications of Balnazzar's corruption will have on the Scarlet Crusade should the truth come out. Zverenhoff later ordered adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Kel'thuzad's appointed ruler over Stratholme. The champions who accomplished such a task were rewarded by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; himself and were given access to &lt;a href=\"The%20Argent%20Hold\"&gt;the Argent Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Argent Dawn had &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20embassy\"&gt;an embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Argent%20Dawn%20%28Stormwind%29\"&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. They were investigating &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Kelris\"&gt;Twilight Lord Kelris&lt;/a&gt;, but he eluded them, and sometimes they thought him dead or missing. They also knew that whenever evil made its presence known in Kalimdor, Kelris had played a role.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, a company of paladins came to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to offer their help and assistance to the Alliance's night elven allies in their quest to purge the lands and protect the forests from the forces of the demons and undead. Among them were &lt;a href=\"Delgren%20the%20Purifier\"&gt;Delgren the Purifier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feero%20Ironhand\"&gt;Feero Ironhand&lt;/a&gt;, present at &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt; in order to fulfill their mission to annihilate the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt;, a \"strand\" of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; active at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Althalaxx\"&gt;Tower of Althalaxx&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, which they accomplished with the help of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nReopening of the Dark Portal.\nMembers of the Argent Dawn attacked demons when the Dark Portal was &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;reopened&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Proudwell\"&gt;Agent Proudwell&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the Horde and Alliance fought against the waves of demons led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Protector\"&gt;Tabard of the Protector&lt;/a&gt; could be received upon completion of this task.\nLegends.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maddox\"&gt;Maddox&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the help of the Argent Dawn and hundreds of mercenaries with &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;'s help. They were to attack &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and liberate it from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. When Maddox and his group arrived to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;, they found only a hundred of warriors and the Dawn's soldiers &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Pureheart\"&gt;Pureheart&lt;/a&gt; could afford. However, the &lt;a href=\"Retaking%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;Retaking of Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; was a disaster, the army was bested by the Scourge.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; moved to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Plaguelands, they managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Prisoner\"&gt;several members&lt;/a&gt; and transported them to &lt;a href=\"Acherus\"&gt;Acherus&lt;/a&gt;. More were imprisoned at the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20the%20Crimson%20Flame\"&gt;Chapel of the Crimson Flame&lt;/a&gt; where they were all executed. From the Enclave, the Scourge proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; the Argent Dawn at the Light's Hope once again. This time, they were saved by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, corruption loomed within the ranks of the Brotherhood: when adventurers recovered &lt;a href=\"The%20Phylactery%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;The Phylactery of Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; from Naxxramas, they turned it in to &lt;a href=\"Father%20Inigo%20Montoy\"&gt;Father Inigo Montoy&lt;/a&gt; - a member of the Brotherhood - at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, who then promised to deliver it to the Argent Dawn in order to ensure the final death of the Lich Lord. As it later turned out, the phylactery never reached its destination. Inigo Montoy's true agenda only became clear later during the Northrend campaign, when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fought back the Scourge assault on &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; by Tirion, the Argent Dawn ceased to exist as a separate organization. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, most, if not all, members joined the Crusade, with individuals wearing the Argent Dawn tabard continued to appear. \nIn &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Delgren the Purifier and Feero Ironhand died while defending &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt; against a Horde's attack. Subsequently, their equipment were recovered and sent to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20embassy\"&gt;Argent Dawn embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nPlayers must first complete the &lt;a href=\"Fiona%27s%20Caravan\"&gt;Fiona's Caravan&lt;/a&gt; quests in the Eastern Plaguelands up through and including . This will grant enough reputation to get exactly 0/21000 Revered reputation with the Argent Dawn, or none if they are already Revered (from performing Argent Dawn quests before the release of Cataclysm). After this point, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt; can be summoned in the crypt behind Light's Hope Chapel. Argent Dawn reputation is obtainable by performing the two repeatable quests &lt;a href=\"Aberrations%20of%20Bone\"&gt;Aberrations of Bone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Annals of the Silver Hand (quest)&lt;/a&gt; he provides. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.1.5\"&gt;patch 10.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to obtain and turn in Scourgestones for reputation.\nArgent Dawn Exalted reputation is a requisite for the achievement and title &lt;a href=\"The%20Argent%20Champion\"&gt;The Argent Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld reputation.\nPrior to patch 4.0.3a, you could gain reputation from a large number of methods, including repeatable quests and instances. Many of these methods involved the use of an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed players to obtain Scourgestones from any level 40+ undead Scourge enemies in Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor.\nWhile Scourgestones are still obtainable by players who have the Argent Dawn Commission equipped, they can no longer be turned in for reputation, and in fact no longer have any use at all. All of the other old repeatable quests have also been removed, and defeating enemies in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; no longer grants Argent Dawn reputation either.\nRewards.\nThe shoulder enchantments are only sold to players who performed certain quests before Cataclysm. The quest &lt;a href=\"Mantles%20of%20the%20Dawn\"&gt;Mantles of the Dawn&lt;/a&gt; must be completed to purchase the single-resistance enchantments, and &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Mantle%20of%20the%20Dawn%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Chromatic Mantle of the Dawn&lt;/a&gt; must be done for the multi-resist enchantment. Both quests are now unobtainable, but players who performed them before they were removed can still buy the shoulder enchantments.\nIn the RPG.\nOrganization.\nThe Argent Dawn is a &lt;a href=\"lawful%20good\"&gt;lawful good&lt;/a&gt; organization and is divided into branches based on location, each of which has its own ranking and structure. Non-members are not permitted to know the ranking of members of the organization, since that would make obvious targets of leadership figures, and the leader is not known to the public. This has sometimes resulted in the Argent Dawn being called a secret society. However, it seems their ranking structure is surprisingly simple; specific regions have a \"Commander\", who directly leads day-to-day activities, a council of officers, a group of elite &lt;a href=\"templar\"&gt;templar&lt;/a&gt;s, and then the body of membership. Templars have no real authority over standard members, but they are highly respected. Branches include the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Argent Dawn has no official headquarters, but small branches exist in several major cities \u2014 including Stormwind and Darnassus. The majority of their members in the Plaguelands work out of the Light's Hope Chapel on the far east side of the Eastern Plaguelands, but a good number of them inhabit a camp at Chillwind Camp on the border of the Western Plaguelands and the Alterac Mountains as well. The templars at Chillwind have plenty of work to do. The courageous templars and knights have to contend with ogres to the south and an undead infested graveyard right on their borders.\nThrough its actions, the Argent Dawn has created several powerful enemies, notably the Burning Legion, the Scourge, and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Despite common interests (and an alliance at Light's Hope Chapel), there is also a great deal of mistrust, and even open ire, between the Argent Dawn and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 particularly because the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; views all non-members as potentially evil.\nMilitary tactics.\nIn the Plaguelands and other parts of the world that the Alliance and Horde alike have abandoned, the Argent Dawn stands as a last shining bastion of hope against the Scourge, the Burning Legion and other threats. Contrary to what one might expect, the Argent Dawn rarely defends any given location; rather it remains mobile, attempting to strike where it is least expected. This is clearly a strong contrast to the more straightforward &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe knights and freedom fighters of the Argent Dawn rely on hit and run tactics, using their magic and knowledge of the terrain to compensate for the disadvantage of their small numbers. Each group is assigned an officer, who chooses when to engage enemies in combat or avoid them; if there is any major risk to the group, the officer avoids the conflict unless there is an impending threat that must be stopped. The Argent Dawn is unwilling to risk even a single member if it can be avoided, for every sword lost could be another to join the Scourge. The Argent Dawn is not a group of cowards; far from it. They willingly risk their lives each day.\nIf an Argent Dawn force is attacked while guarding a specific person or location, the members form a defensive circle around the target and attempt to repulse their enemies with ranged attacks. If any attackers make it to melee range, paladins and templar move to eliminate the target, then return to their positions in the circle if possible. If the Argent Dawn has multiple locations to defend, it prioritizes and potentially abandons one location completely, depending on the situation; if there are living people to defend in both locations, the Argent Dawn sends just enough people to the less important locations to evacuate anyone who may need help.\nBefore entering combat, Argent Dawn units prepare with as many beneficial spells as possible. Priests cast spell resistance, holy word shield, and bear's endurance on everyone they can to increase their chances of survival. Paladins and Argent Dawn templar enhance their weapons with holy sword if they can cast it; and if not, they focus on other spells to increase their damage-dealing abilities, such as bull's strength.\nOnce in combat, each spellcaster powerful enough to incapacitate a target with hooks of binding or another spell uses it to thin the enemy group's numbers. After that point, the group focuses its firepower on enemy spell casters (if applicable), moving from what appears to be the strongest target to the weakest. One priest maintains a healing rain if the group fights undead. When fighting intelligent enemies, Argent Dawn groups focus on enemy leadership first, expending their powerful abilities (holy strikes and high-level spells) to destroy that target swiftly, then retreat if necessary.\nMembership.\nThe Argent Dawn admits members of any race and profession, so long as they are dedicated to the opposition of evil in the world. The organization draws members from both Alliance and the Horde, but not equally. Though independent they favor the Alliance. The focus on the Holy Light makes the organization more appealing to the Alliance, especially to people with a background with the Church or Silver hand. Magi also support and sometimes join the Argent Dawn, since they have similar goals. The Horde has a healthy relationship with the Argent Dawn as well, but it does not actually serve as a sponsor for the faction's activities. Rather, the Horde (mainly the Forsaken) reinforces the Argent Dawn's troops, and works with them only when it seems beneficial (which is often the case).\nThey screen their members carefully, however, so this seemingly open-ended recruitment policy can be misleading. Most potential members are required to use minor magic items to gather \u201cscourgestones\u201d from defeated undead creatures to prove the combat ability of the applicant. Others have to fight demons in order to prove themselves. Members are also expected to uphold the virtues of the Light, even if they are not followers of Light themselves. They can be strict about what their members do or say, especially in public. \nMembers of the Argent Dawn often have differing strategies in furthering the group's aims: some make alliances against the undead; others fight directly; some study new forms of magic or alchemy to combat demons and undead with greater effectiveness. The Argent Dawn is noted for unusual ways of utilizing the Holy Light for new spells, but this draws ire from the most traditional members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nYounger members of the Church and the Knights of the Silver Hand find the youthful Argent Dawn appealing, since the organization seems to be less burdened by older (and perhaps outdated) traditions. The Argent Dawn as a whole seems unusually youthful, some leaders appear much younger than they should be.\nApart from the Knights, Argent Dawn membership also numbers some former (and current) members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Since their home city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; was hit by the Scourge, many of the Kirin Tor wish to strike back. Both groups also find common ground in their interest in magical research.\nPresence in Azeroth.\nOne could find the Argent Dawn in many places across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They were primarily centered in the northern parts of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, addressing the specific threats of the Scourge and the Burning Legion, respectively. In the Eastern Kingdoms was their foremost stronghold: Light's Hope Chapel in the Eastern Plaguelands. Their influence in the southern part of the Western Plaguelands was also significant, as they attempted to rout the undead from near Uther's Tomb, Caer Darrow, and Andorhal. They also maintained a less active but more stable headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe Argent Dawn and its successor, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, both have an unusually high number of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; holy men and women in their ranks compared to any other faction, including the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. They come as &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Cleric\"&gt;Clerics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Priest\"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Healer\"&gt;Healers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Initiate\"&gt;Initiates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Lightbringers&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it is possible that these faithful of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; are members of the Lordaeron branch of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; who were initially freed with the other undead and decided to band apart because of the tendency of the Forsaken to instead be &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Remember when he returns he needs 4 hours of rest before he can go shopping again. \nAlthough this is summonable on other &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;s, only the character with which you have purchased the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Pony%20Bridle\"&gt;Argent Pony Bridle&lt;/a&gt; is able to use the vendor, mailbox and bank services.\nThe design for the squire, including an overstuffed backpack and a banner, may be an homage to the squires in the popular movie \"\".\nPet Journal.\n\"Many of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s youth joined the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; as squires, hoping to one day serve the Holy Light in battle.\""}

The central area of the Argent Stand functions as an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; and provides &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, it was initially chosen by the Argent Crusade as a defensive position to keep the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; from taking the second tier of Zul'Drak. However, that effort failed, but the crusade hasn't given up.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that this heavily fortified area still hosts quite the population of crusaders fighting the Scourge. They described it as a safe enough place, where they were able to sleep, though surrounded by the sounds of battle as the undead threw themselves against the fortifications."}
