Inherited by &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Yoon\"&gt;Farmer Yoon&lt;/a&gt;, helping him out will give the player access to his farm and a place to grow their own cooking ingredients via &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nFarmer Yoon provides all the quests in Sunsong Ranch, and they're all related to the farming mechanic introduced in \"Mists of Pandaria\".\nStarting the first quest chain, players are generally at rep with &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;The Tillers&lt;/a&gt;. By the last quest in the intro chain, they should finish at standing.\nAfter Harvesting, the first four plots of soil are made available.\nHonored.\nOnce hitting Honored, Farmer Yoon will offer:\nThe short quest chain opens up the next four plots of soil, bringing the total up to eight.\nRevered.\nOnce hitting Revered, Farmer Yoon will offer:\nThe short quest chain opens up the next four pots of soil, bringing the total up to twelve.\nJust before Exalted, Farmer Yoon will offer\nCompletion of this chain will result in reputation.\nExalted.\nOnce hitting Exalted (and completion of ), Farmer Yoon will offer:\nOn completion of the above quest, Thunder will appear on your farm with &lt;a href=\"Haohan%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Haohan Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt;, and will charge and hit the boulder for 15 minutes. A 15 minute buff will appear, after which point, Thunder will leave the main portion of the farm, and it will be upgraded to a 4x4 plot.\n2 additional quests open while waiting on the farm expansion\nOnce you are exalted \"and\" have unlocked all 16 plots, &lt;a href=\"Nana%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Nana Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt; will offer &lt;a href=\"Inherit%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Inherit the Earth&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to take ownership of the &lt;a href=\"ranch\"&gt;ranch&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlanting.\nPurchase seeds or seed bags from &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Greenfield\"&gt;Merchant Greenfield&lt;/a&gt; in Halfhill Market, or they can be randomly found while harvesting crops.\nWhen planting, it is possible to occasionally have a seed instantly grow and be ready to harvest. These are called Bursting crops.\nHandling problems.\nOnce planted, crops can be in one of eight states that need to be handled before they can grow unattended. When you ask Farmer Yoon, he will provide the following advice.\nNotes.\n1Stubborn weeds start out weak (with 0 stacks) and immediately start to strengthen their grip, up to 10 stacks. Therefore, it's best to jump on them immediately and start pulling. In this way, a weed can be removed with 1-2 tugs.\nHarvesting.\nThere are four possible results when harvesting: Ripe, Seed of the Day, Plump and Bursting. \nSo if the seed of the day is White Turnips you well get five plus two for everything harvested. This means that if you have a plump white turnip you will actually get eight plus the extra two resulting in ten from just one crop.\nAcquiring the Ranch.\nOnce a character has reached exalted status with the Tillers, and unlocked all 16 plots, &lt;a href=\"Nana%20Mudclaw\"&gt;Nana Mudclaw&lt;/a&gt; will offer the quest &lt;a href=\"Inherit%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Inherit the Earth&lt;/a&gt;. With this quest, Farmer Yoon will join the Tillers Council and gift the ranch to the player. This results in the following changes to the ranch:\nWork orders.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"Inherit%20the%20Earth\"&gt;Inherit the Earth&lt;/a&gt; and taking ownership of the ranch, a post appears in Farmer Yoon's former spot. It offers work order quests which allow you earn reputation with certain \"Mists of Pandaria\" factions by growing and delivering vegetables. You must have unlocked a faction before work orders will be offered for it. \nEach quest requires you to plant and harvest 8 seeds of a particular vegetable. Once that quest is completed you will be given a follow-up quest to deliver 40 of that vegetable to a wagon that is waiting near Halfhill Market. You can accept all of the quests at once, but since 8 plots are needed for each one, you can only effectively perform two at a time.\nEach work order has two parts. Part I requires planting 8 seeds. Part II requires harvesting crops 8 times and delivering 40 vegetables to the &lt;a href=\"Empty%20Crate\"&gt;Empty Crate&lt;/a&gt; immediately southwest of the plots on the farm, where it's picked up by an NPC. Part II rewards 400 base reputation (before bonuses), 236,000 experience, a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Charm%20of%20Good%20Fortune\"&gt;Lesser Charm of Good Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, and .\nYou will not receive credit for harvesting crops for Part II until you have finished Part I.\nTrivia.\nEarlier iterations of Sunsong Ranch had crop outcomes affected by varying weather conditions and seasons, but this was cut in order to reduce complexity."}

The start of the event also coincided with the release of a related questline to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The event ended with the release of \"Legion\" on August 30. \nThe event saw invasions in six separate locations, split between &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The invasions began in the more remote zones, such as &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, and drastically ramped up from there each week. The first week had two zones under invasion every four hours. The second week had three invasions every two hours. The final week culminated with a constant Legion invasion across every invasion zone. \nThe invasions themselves featured the arrival of Legion forces, with each invasion split into three stages. To defeat the invasion players were required to battle ground troops, destroy Legion structures and defeat a number of elite commanders, fighting back the Legion's advances, while &lt;a href=\"legion%20ship\"&gt;legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s rained felfire from above. Players were aided in populated areas by the local NPCs, who were neutral for both factions for the duration of each invasion.\nThe invasions scaled from level 10 to 100, so that even those who were leveling in the area were able to participate. For sub-max-level characters the invasions also offered substantial experience rewards, allowing for highly accelerated leveling.\nWhile all eyes were focused on the invasions, &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Whispers\"&gt;dark whispers&lt;/a&gt; were heard in the Alliance and Horde capitals, tempting heroes to join the Legion. The willing were transformed into mighty &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s, raid boss-level demons with powerful abilities.\nAreas of conflict.\nAreas currently under an invasion can be found marked with a on the &lt;a href=\"world%20map\"&gt;world map&lt;/a&gt;.\nDun Morogh.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Faraleth\"&gt;Harbinger Faraleth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Commander%20Il%27tholzul\"&gt;Dread Commander Il'tholzul&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion launched an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; region. \n&lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; defended &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; took the skies against the &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer%20Helmholt\"&gt;Mountaineer Helmholt&lt;/a&gt; defended &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Pine%20Refuge\"&gt;Misty Pine Refuge&lt;/a&gt; against an &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;Annihilan&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmanes&lt;/a&gt; were enslaved by the Burning Legion under a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; and used as tools for their army. &lt;a href=\"Amberstill%20Ranch\"&gt;Amberstill Ranch&lt;/a&gt; also fell under the Legion's command and the dwarves there were enslaved as well. The battle at the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20Front\"&gt;Frostmane Front&lt;/a&gt; was ended as the Legion took over. The &lt;a href=\"Tundrid%20Hills\"&gt;Tundrid Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grizzled%20Den\"&gt;Grizzled Den&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; area had been taken by the Legion. The Legion blocked the road leading to &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, cutting off communication between the areas. The &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt; was taken by the Legion and the last defenders were led by &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer%20Falmor\"&gt;Mountaineer Falmor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Bolar%20Quarry\"&gt;Gol'Bolar Quarry&lt;/a&gt; was also attacked by the Legion.\nAmong the defenders of the mountains were a high number of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh%20Mountaineer\"&gt;Dun Morogh Mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Guard%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Ironforge Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Gryphon%20Rider\"&gt;Ironforge Gryphon Rider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;Wildhammer Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt; as well as a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Dwarf%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Demolitionist%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;demolitionists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Rifleman%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Shadowcaster%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;shadowcasters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Skulker\"&gt;skulkers&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s operated by &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Engineer%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Engineer%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;gnomish engineers&lt;/a&gt; were fielded by the defenders, such as &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Engine%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;siege engines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mechano-Tank%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;mechano-tanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;s, which had a special corps of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pilot\"&gt;Battle Pilot&lt;/a&gt;s. Several &lt;a href=\"Covert%20Operative\"&gt;Covert Operative&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; also participated in defending &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Special\"&gt;Thunder Special&lt;/a&gt; beer was freely available to raise the morale of the defenders. A randomized Alliance military camp could also spawn in the region.\nAzshara.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Commander%20Maz%27golar\"&gt;Fel Commander Maz'golar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flamebringer%20Az%27rothel\"&gt;Flamebringer Az'rothel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vel%27thrak%20the%20Punisher\"&gt;Vel'thrak the Punisher&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the mission was to charge into &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; defended the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Rear%20Gate\"&gt;Orgrimmar Rear Gate&lt;/a&gt;, making sure that no demon passed through. At &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining Alliance forces defended the area under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Jarrodenus\"&gt;Commander Jarrodenus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valormok\"&gt;Valormok&lt;/a&gt; was defended by its residents. The Legion's advance took the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Strand\"&gt;Shattered Strand&lt;/a&gt;, killing all the local &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mountainfoot%20Strip%20Mine\"&gt;Mountainfoot Strip Mine&lt;/a&gt; was also conquered by the Legion, as the local inhabitants of orcs and night elves were enslaved by a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the defenders of the Orgrimmar rear gate were &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Grunt\"&gt;Orgrimmar Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Soldier\"&gt;Bilgewater Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ag%27tor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Ag'tor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; and Gallywix. Several &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineer%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;goblin engineers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Wind%20Rider\"&gt;Orgrimmar Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt;s had been deployed as well. On the Alliance side, Talrendis Point was defended by the &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Ancient\"&gt;Talrendis Ancient&lt;/a&gt; and the garrison of the outpost.\nNorthern Barrens.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Commander%20Vorgroth\"&gt;Fel Commander Vorgroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arch%20Magus%20Velysra\"&gt;Arch Magus Velysra&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion launched an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Their main goal was to take the hearth of the Barrens, the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;. The Crossroads was defended by &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nNear the Crossroads, the mighty beast &lt;a href=\"Echeyakee\"&gt;Echeyakee&lt;/a&gt; was subdued by a &lt;a href=\"Dreadstalker%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;dreadstalker&lt;/a&gt;, but was saved and bandaged, thus joining the fight alongside adventurers. A big part of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; was held by the Legion, whilst the Horde attempted to fight them back. All the old &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; structures (the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20elemental%20camp\"&gt;Kor'kron elemental camp&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20lumber%20yard\"&gt;Kor'kron lumber yard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20refinery\"&gt;Kor'kron refinery&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20meat%20camp\"&gt;Kor'kron meat camp&lt;/a&gt;, which was used as a field prison) had been taken by the Legion. Parts of the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Pools\"&gt;Forgotten Pools&lt;/a&gt; were taken by the Legion as well, and the local &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s had been killed off. &lt;a href=\"Thorn%20Hill\"&gt;Thorn Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grol%27dom%20Farm\"&gt;Grol'dom Farm&lt;/a&gt; were in turmoil with the Legion invading these areas as well. &lt;a href=\"Darsok%20Swiftdagger\"&gt;Darsok&lt;/a&gt;'s outpost fell to the Legion. &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;Mercs&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; defended the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fen\"&gt;Sludge Fen&lt;/a&gt; against the demons. The goblins of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; defended the town under &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, which was riding his own custom &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Legion outside the city had &lt;a href=\"mind%20control\"&gt;mind control&lt;/a&gt;led several goblins to their will. &lt;a href=\"Far%20Watch%20Post\"&gt;Far Watch Post&lt;/a&gt; also fell to the Legion as &lt;a href=\"Kargal%20Battlescar\"&gt;Kargal Battlescar&lt;/a&gt; defended the bridge to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the Horde defenders were many &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Guard\"&gt;Horde Guard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Wind%20Rider\"&gt;Orgrimmar Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt;s, supported by the &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s of the various local outposts. A randomized Horde military camp could also spawn in the region. The &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fen\"&gt;Sludge Fen&lt;/a&gt; was defended by &lt;a href=\"Oilrig%20Bomber\"&gt;Oilrig Bomber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Oilrig%20Sniper\"&gt;Oilrig Sniper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Rig%20Engineer\"&gt;Oil Rig Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTanaris.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Mal%27serus\"&gt;Mal'serus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arch%20Magus%20Velysra\"&gt;Arch Magus Velysra&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. Their main goal was to take the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. Gadgetzan was defended by &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt;, which was riding his own custom &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Valley\"&gt;Thistleshrub Valley&lt;/a&gt; had been taken by the Legion and they now controlled the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eastmoon%20Ruins\"&gt;Eastmoon Ruins&lt;/a&gt; was in conflict as the demons were trying to claim it from &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Sandsorrow%20Watch\"&gt;Sandsorrow Watch&lt;/a&gt; had fallen to the Legion. Goblins, Horde and Alliance fought against the Legion at &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Sands\"&gt;Abyssal Sands&lt;/a&gt; and all of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Pillar\"&gt;Broken Pillar&lt;/a&gt; had been taken over by the demons. The &lt;a href=\"Bootlegger%20Outpost\"&gt;Bootlegger Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunemaul%20Compound\"&gt;Dunemaul Compound&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Burning Legion. Some other goblin enclaves resisted against the Legion, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dunemaul%20Recruitment%20Camp\"&gt;Dunemaul Recruitment Camp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%22Flight%22%20Technician%20Wumble\"&gt;Wumble&lt;/a&gt;'s one. \nThe area was less well-defended than the other regions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, being further away from &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; capitals. Still, Gadgetzan could count on its &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan%20Bruiser\"&gt;bruisers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Bomber\"&gt;bombers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sky%20Bomber\"&gt;balloons&lt;/a&gt; as well as the staff of its arena, including &lt;a href=\"Katrina%20Turner\"&gt;Katrina Turner&lt;/a&gt; and quartermasters such as &lt;a href=\"Argex%20Irongut\"&gt;Argex Irongut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blazzek%20the%20Biter\"&gt;Blazzek the Biter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Tayger\"&gt;Tiny Tayger&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; sealed off the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;Illidari demon hunters&lt;/a&gt; held the area, and the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; was defended by &lt;a href=\"Maximillian%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Maximillian of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; and, surprisingly, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Guardian\"&gt;Stone Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. Initially found south of &lt;a href=\"Sandsorrow%20Watch\"&gt;Sandsorrow Watch&lt;/a&gt;, even a &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Robot%20OOX-71/TN\"&gt;stranded mechanical chicken&lt;/a&gt; could be found fighting against the invaders. A randomized Horde, Alliance or Goblin military camp could also spawn in the region.\nWestfall.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Commander%20Urgoz\"&gt;Fel Commander Urgoz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arch%20Magus%20Zyrel\"&gt;Arch Magus Zyrel&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. Their main goal was to take the hearth of Westfall, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinel Hill was defended by &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the plains of Westfall, war raged between the demons and the transient people of the area. Being simple farmlands, the demons took much of the land with ease. The &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Acre\"&gt;Dead Acre&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dust%20Plains\"&gt;Dust Plains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendel%27s%20Pond\"&gt;Stendel's Pond&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Molsen%20Farm\"&gt;Molsen Farm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jansen%20Stead\"&gt;Jansen Stead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Furlbrow%27s%20Pumpkin%20Patch\"&gt;Furlbrow's Pumpkin Patch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jangolode%20Mine\"&gt;Jangolode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexston%20Farmstead\"&gt;Alexston Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demont%27s%20Place\"&gt;Demont's Place&lt;/a&gt; had been taken by the Burning Legion. &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt; was also attacked, with &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Saldean\"&gt;Farmer Saldean&lt;/a&gt; and his wife managing to hide in their house. The residents of &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; were obliterated. The demons also refurbished some of the local machineries, with the &lt;a href=\"Reconstructed%20Fel%20Reaper%205000\"&gt;Reconstructed Fel Reaper 5000&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Harvester%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;Soul Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; now under their grasp.\nA contingent from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; was sent to defend the area. Among it were &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;Stormwind Guards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Knight\"&gt;Stormwind Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Gryphon%20Rider\"&gt;Stormwind Gryphon Rider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Mage\"&gt;Stormwind Mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Engine%20%28Legion%20Invasion%29\"&gt;siege engines&lt;/a&gt;. The guards at the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20Hills\"&gt;Dagger Hills&lt;/a&gt; camp were &lt;a href=\"mind%20control\"&gt;mind control&lt;/a&gt;led by a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinel Hill was defended by a militia of &lt;a href=\"Uprooted%20Farmhand\"&gt;Uprooted Farmhand&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Displaced%20Worker\"&gt;Displaced Worker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill%20Marksman\"&gt;Sentinel Hill Marksmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHillsbrad Foothills.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Rotbringer%20Velthux\"&gt;Rotbringer Velthux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flameweaver%20Verathix\"&gt;Flameweaver Verathix&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion launched an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Their main goal was to take the largest &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; town here, &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. Tarren Mill was defended by &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jorek%20Ironside\"&gt;Jorek Ironside&lt;/a&gt; guarded the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Village&lt;/a&gt; successfully. &lt;a href=\"Corrahn%27s%20Dagger\"&gt;Corrahn's Dagger&lt;/a&gt; was under attack and being defended by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Iceheart\"&gt;Captain Iceheart&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Headland\"&gt;Headland&lt;/a&gt; was being fought over by &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Rufus\"&gt;Instructor Rufus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drill%20Sergeant%20Magnus\"&gt;Drill Sergeant Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Crudbeard\"&gt;Captain Crudbeard&lt;/a&gt; against the Legion. &lt;a href=\"Gavin%27s%20Naze\"&gt;Gavin's Naze&lt;/a&gt; was also under siege while &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Knight\"&gt;Stormwind Knight&lt;/a&gt;s defended the siege weapons there. &lt;a href=\"Darrow%20Hill\"&gt;Darrow Hill&lt;/a&gt; was taken by the Legion. The &lt;a href=\"Nethander%20Stead\"&gt;Nethander Stead&lt;/a&gt; was attacked and all the &lt;a href=\"Mudsnout%20tribe\"&gt;Mudsnout&lt;/a&gt; gnolls were killed by the Legion. The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were also attacked by the Legion, which seemed interested into researching the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; there, and the guards of the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt; were enslaved by a nathrezim.\nAmong the Horde defenders were &lt;a href=\"Dreadguard\"&gt;Dreadguard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Deathguard%20Elite\"&gt;Deathguard Elite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Bat-Rider\"&gt;Forsaken Bat-Rider&lt;/a&gt;s as was as a contingent from &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Undercity%20Guardian\"&gt;Undercity Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aleric%20Hawkins\"&gt;Aleric Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;. On the Alliance side, the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; had deployed &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Battle-Priest\"&gt;Stormpike Battle-Priest&lt;/a&gt;s to support their troops. A randomized Alliance military camp could also spawn in the region.\nRandomized military camps.\nSeveral of the attacked regions had areas dedicated to spawning randomized military camps. Each military camp was defended by a small contingent of guards and had several &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s that could be taken away by adventurers.\nIllidari Camps.\nAfter being freed from the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; set up camps around the world. The camps were defended by &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Enforcer\"&gt;Illidari Enforcer&lt;/a&gt;s. A reluctant vendor in the form of a &lt;a href=\"Captive%20Wyrmtongue\"&gt;Captive Wyrmtongue&lt;/a&gt; plus an &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Darkdealer\"&gt;Illidari Darkdealer&lt;/a&gt; could also be found there. The main leader of each camp was &lt;a href=\"Falara%20Nightsong\"&gt;Falara Nightsong&lt;/a&gt;. These camps could be found in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the capital cities of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nNPC Vendors.\n&lt;a href=\"Captive%20Wyrmtongue\"&gt;Captive Wyrmtongue&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nStages.\nLegion invasions play out in scenarios. Much like &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt;s and open-world quest scenarios, as players enter an invasion zone, they will automatically join a scenario in progress. There can be multiple concurrent invasions taking place in a zone - players will always join a scenario that's in Stage 1, however.\nStage 1.\nDefend &lt;Town&gt;.\nThe main objective in stage one is to defend the main town of the local area. A &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; will appear over it and a big portal will open. A meter will appear and the phase will end when it reaches 100%. \nStage 2.\nDefeat the Demon Commander.\nAfter you defend the town, three or four demons will appear (two or three Lieutenants and one Commander). They are marked with the . After defeating the Lieutenants the Commander will spawn. Defeating the Commander will give you a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Legion%20Chest\"&gt;Small Legion Chest&lt;/a&gt;. \nStage 3.\nRepel the Legion forces.\nAfter the commander dies, the Burning Legion appears throughout the area (marked with ). &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Structures\"&gt;Structures&lt;/a&gt; are teleported all over the zone (marked with ), and &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s will start patrolling between these bases. A meter will appear and the phase will end when it reaches 100%.\nFinal Stage.\nDefeat the Demon Lord.\nAfter Stage 3, the final boss will appear at the main town (marked with ). Defeating it will give you a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Legion%20Chest\"&gt;Large Legion Chest&lt;/a&gt; and end the invasion.\nCurrency.\n&lt;a href=\"Nethershard\"&gt;Nethershard&lt;/a&gt; is the currency given for completing an invasion event, the Legion Chests, and by killing the stronger demons.\nThey can be used to buy several things from the &lt;a href=\"Captive%20Wyrmtongue\"&gt;Captive Wyrmtongue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Darkdealer\"&gt;Illidari Darkdealer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRewards.\nNamed demons.\nAll named demons (and those marked with a green skull on the zone map and minimap) will drop .\nArmor and weapons.\nAll armor and weapon types can be found inside the chests. The chests will only contain loot equippable by the character that opens the chest, including the &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20of%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;Glaive of the Fallen&lt;/a&gt; which can otherwise be bought on &lt;a href=\"Nethershard\"&gt;Nethershard&lt;/a&gt; vendors instead.\n&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Fel%20Spreader\"&gt;Pocket Fel Spreader&lt;/a&gt;.\nClasses that have a way to sense demons, or using &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Detect%20Demon\"&gt;Elixir of Detect Demon&lt;/a&gt; sometimes have another option towards the &lt;a href=\"Doomsayer%20%28Legion%29\"&gt;Doomsayer&lt;/a&gt;. When saying the line \"There's something not quite right about you...\" the doomsayer is revealed to be a &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Infiltrator\"&gt;Dread Infiltrator&lt;/a&gt;. Once they are killed, they have a chance to drop a &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Fel%20Spreader\"&gt;Pocket Fel Spreader&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecrets.\nOn or before &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Battle for Broken Shore (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, players can interact with four secret NPCs to acquire some unique items. These NPCs are limited to their faction, and those of the opposite faction cannot interact with them.\nDark Whispers.\nA complement to the invasions taking place in the various zones, the Dark Whispers event took place within Stormwind and Orgrimmar, tempting the heroes of Azeroth to turn against their allies and join the Burning Legion. \nDuring the event players in the two cities had a very small chance of hearing a whisper asking them to convert to the Legion's line of thinking. If the player accepted, they would get a new action bar with some interesting abilities, and gain 9 stacks of the Frail Mind debuff. The process then had two phases: in the first the player used their abilities to wreak havoc in the city, causing them to slowly remove their stacks of Frail Mind. Once all Frail Mind stacks were gone, the player was able to transform into a Dreadlord for 1 minute, gaining raid boss-level abilities. Transforming into a Dreadlord or using certain abilities during the first phase would mark the player an ally of the Legion, making them hostile to friendly characters and allowing them to attack and kill NPCs and other players.\nTransforming into a Dreadlord provided the following abilities:\nAuction Houses were a popular location for transforming into a Dreadlord due to the large number of players normally gathered there, many AFK, providing easy targets. Absent players could be killed in 2-3 globals using the Dreadlord's abilities.\nDoomsayers.\n&lt;a href=\"Doomsayer%20%28Legion%29\"&gt;Doomsayers&lt;/a&gt; have started to appear in major cities.

Such torment is beyond the comprehension of the mortal mind. Destroyed ships can release the remnants of said souls, which are then lost in endless pain and wail in agony.\nEach ship requires multiple power cores, which are standard hyper-injection fel matter anti-matter devices, charged with the energy of fel geysers.\nThey are used to transport and deploy troops directly on the field, as well as acting like gateways for the Legion to summon their armies. They are thus present on both the worlds they invade as well as their own worlds where the demons reside, serving as bases of operations. They were deployed in great numbers during the various stages of the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion invasions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;assault on Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir primary port-of-call is &lt;a href=\"Terminus\"&gt;Terminus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Antoran%20Wastes\"&gt;Antoran Wastes&lt;/a&gt;.

Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;leader of the Illidari&lt;/a&gt; used the power of their warglaives to tear a rift in reality and open a permanent gateway, powered by captured demons' souls, from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to the \"Fel Hammer\". From the other side of the portal, the gateway is being kept open by &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20Dementia\"&gt;Priestesses of Dementia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Lightbreaker\" could only be accessed through a portal locked to those without the key, divided in two halves which were given to the powerful lieutenants of the demon &lt;a href=\"Azoran\"&gt;Azoran&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the operations in &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Viz%27aduum%20the%20Watcher\"&gt;Viz'aduum the Watcher&lt;/a&gt; tried to utilize two of them in &lt;a href=\"Netherspace\"&gt;Netherspace&lt;/a&gt; to secure Karazhan and tether the tower to every single Legion world in existence, which would've allowed the infinite armies of the Legion to pour into Azeroth. A massive number of them could be seen in the distance.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;'s ship crashed on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the souls used in its creation were released and wander the area in ceaseless agony and pain.\nThe top of a Legion ship's spire is a cannon, a weapon demonstrated by the \"Fel Hammer\".\nWhen traveling or generally on the move, Legion ships will be horizontal, and their commanders will sometimes stand on top of the ship itself as the upper hull is apparently designed to be a platform and walkway in that position. When being used as a command center, however, the ship will be maneuvered vertically until its bow is pointing straight up, like a tower. In this position, the decks become accessible to players and the ship is more like a building. It's possible some sort of artificial gravity system is used in the ship, otherwise the \"&lt;a href=\"Dreadex\"&gt;Dreadex&lt;/a&gt;\" would have to reorganize its substantial amount of cargo every time it flew somewhere.\nSpeculation.\nTheir prows somewhat resemble melted and warped versions of the titan architecture of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at possible titan influence in their design."}

Acting as a counterbalance to &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;, it is an unavoidable force that breeds despair in &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; hearts and pushes everything towards a state of entropic decay and eventual oblivion. While the living use the word \"death\" to refer only to the termination of one's mortal existence, \"Death\", from a cosmic perspective, is an eternal force of magic that permeates the spirit realm and beyond\u2014one that offers new beginnings instead of only an end. The &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; are the realm of existence for Death and its denizens, existing on the edge of reality and separated from the physical universe by a barrier known as the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt;. In the physical realm, Death manifests in the form of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic magic&lt;/a&gt;, and serves as the main source of magic used to practice necromancy; the dark art of raising and controlling the dead.\nThe &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; are the main manifestation of Death in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt;, they are former mortals who died and were brought back through the practice of necromancy or curses, their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s now trapped between life and death. In the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, they are all soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, the armies that serve as the first line of defense in the realm of Death.\nOrigins and characteristics.\nThe cosmic force of Death was conceived by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the other forces &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;five other governing forces&lt;/a&gt; of reality. These enigmatic &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;godlike&lt;/a&gt; beings, who shaped the cosmos and the fabric of all realities, created the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; as the realm of Death. Within it, they created &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; to be a workshop where they and their servants\u2014the &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt;\u2014made everything in the Shadowlands and the realms beyond. It was within the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; that they created beings like the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; of the Pantheon of Death, the rulers of the Shadowlands. The &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt;s believe that the First Ones made the endless cycle of &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; and Death the central part of their creation.\n&lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; and Death are not related, as Death is about eternity and not linear time, while time is a construct of &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; and structure. To a soul in the Shadowlands, circumstances are more chaotic, it can therefore feel like eons have passed since their arrival whereas only a few months or years have elapsed in the world of the living, much like a dream.\nWhen a living being dies, their &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; lingers in the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; before being shepherded by &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; into the Shadowlands. There, spirits face the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, who judges their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; and places them in one of the &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;realms&lt;/a&gt; of the Shadowlands, where they will spend their afterlife. When a &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; expires, an echo of it remains behind. The most powerful mortals leave the most resonant echoes. On some occasions, a living being may go to a different place than the Shadowlands. For example, the spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s are bound to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, where they go following a period of hibernation in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; upon their death. &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es return to their &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt;, and less fortunate souls may be raised into a necromancer's service. &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s killed outside their planes simply reform over time in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Most brave &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; are brought to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, while the spirits of dishonorable vrykul spend eternity in &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, where they are turned into &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; to serve &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s, when killed in mortal planes, are sent back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to reform. Some souls appear to travel to a Light-based afterlife after dying, such as &lt;a href=\"Uuna\"&gt;Uuna&lt;/a&gt;'s parents, while the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; are also able to bring mortal souls to the Light like &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; did with &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt; in order to save him from undeath.\nIf a being of Death is killed on the mortal plane, their essence returns to the Shadowlands to be reformed, similar to how &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s reform in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. However, if such a being\u2014either the soul of a former mortal or a member of an endemic Shadowlands race\u2014is destroyed in the Shadowlands, they die permanently. Their energy then disperses and joins the greater whole of the magic of Death. This is the case both for souls of former mortals and for endemic Shadowlands races. If a \"workforce\" creature like a &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; dies, another member of the same race will eventually manifest to take the place of the one that was killed. Should a soul fall in the Shadowlands, while not even a necromancer of the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; could bring them back, necromancy could animate their fallen body as a mindless servant.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Purpose\"&gt;Purpose&lt;/a&gt; is the guiding principle of the Shadowlands, it is the belief that the realm of the dead follows a pattern laid out by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in her infinite wisdom. According to &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Tahl\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Tahl&lt;/a&gt;, the Purpose keeps the realms of Death in balance, and all beings in the endless cycle serve it\u2014even those who do so unknowingly or unwillingly.\nNecromantic magic.\nIn the Shadowlands, &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; is the birthplace of necromantic magic, where necromancy was developed by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. He is responsible for the creation of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rune%20magic\"&gt;rune magic&lt;/a&gt;, who devised this unique language of intricate symbols, each individually representing a specific word tied to the very foundations of Maldraxxus, from simple commands, to necromantic energy manipulation. In order to imprison his brother, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus also invented an even more potent death runic language: &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;. Behaving in a matter similar to a language, it alters the victim's thoughts so powerfully that it interferes with their sense of self. Its sole purpose was to be the utter suppression of another.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the undead are imperfectly attached to their bodies; the necromantic magic that sustains them is a buffer that prevents their souls from properly joining with their bodies. This is why undead feel only faint sensations of pain or discomfort from most physical stimuli, and why the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; is so painful to their existence.\nIn the Shadowlands, &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; is the source that is drawn upon when using death magic, and is comparable to the &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. The most common practitioners of necromancy are known as &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and others include &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"necrolord%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShadowlands.\nThe Shadowlands are the realm of Death, an infinite &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of deceased mortals go to be reborn, serve, find peace, do battle, or endure endless torment. The Shadowlands exist on the edge of reality, separated from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt; by a barrier known as the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt;, and consist of an infinite number of diverse afterlives sustained by the flow of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from the recently dead. Anima is the essence of mortal &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s that enter the Shadowlands, the product of all of the soul's experiences and actions in life. It infuses the Shadowlands and acts as the lifeblood of the afterlife, making trees grow and rivers flow, flowing through creatures, and connecting all the realms of the Shadowlands together. The five main realms are &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, though countless others exist.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Covenants\"&gt;Covenants&lt;/a&gt; are four ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"Organization\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt; who rule over the different realms of the spirit world. They have existed since the Shadowlands were shaped long ago and bear sacred duties to help maintain the afterlife's ecosystem. Each of them is affiliated to a realm ruled by one of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring the protection of the cycle of life and death.\nBeings of death are ancient and powerful, and it is dangerous to meddle in their realm. When &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; peered into the Shadowlands, he saw some of its inhabitants: souls in torment, the husks of the dead, ghostly wraiths with no face, and others with no form, all made of death itself. Many beings in the Shadowlands are souls of deceased mortals, some of which have been transformed to serve a new purpose, such as the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;. Other creatures\u2014such as &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"faerie\"&gt;faerie&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014are endemic to the Shadowlands and are naturally born from the magic of Death to serve the different realms and help facilitate the process of the afterlife. Here are some examples of races that can be encountered in the realm of the dead:\nZereth Mortis.\nZereth Mortis is the forbidden &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, tucked away in the fabric of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; itself. It was crafted by the First Ones to act as their workshop and is intended to create afterlives, a process carried out by the enormous &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt; floating at the center of the realm. A race of mechanical caretakers called the &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; were left behind by the First Ones to facilitate this process. The realm's most notable feature is the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, which contains knowledge that could rewrite reality.\nFunerary practices.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt;, each race has its own funeral rites according to their culture and beliefs, whether by burials, cremations, mummifications, or other processes. Even after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, death is still an uncertainty to most citizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, as they didn't come to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and not everyone came back from the realm of the dead."}

It can be accessed directly by going through the cave in the &lt;a href=\"Noxious%20Glade\"&gt;Noxious Glade&lt;/a&gt;. Ebon Hold can be access the by taking the teleporter located in the northern part of the breach, directly east from the tunnel to the &lt;a href=\"Noxious%20Glade\"&gt;Noxious Glade&lt;/a&gt;. A ramp on each side of the plateau leads down into the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20the%20Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Ruins of the Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. Death's Breach changes throughout the Phases of the Scarlet Enclave.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBelow is the changes of Death's Breach during the many Phases of the Scarlet Enclave (The death knight starting area.).\nPhase One.\nDuring Phase one of the Death's Breach is the staging area for the beginning of the Scourge's final assault on the Scarlet Crusade. The area has multiple Death Knight initiates around the area, as well as other undead. One can observe Initiates going through similar \"quests\" as the player's death knight, from landing at Death's Breach, to attacking the Scarlet Crusade. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt; can be found leading the Undead in the area, upon finishing the quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarlet%20Harvest\"&gt;The Scarlet Harvest&lt;/a&gt; he along with the other commanders at Death's Breach begin to give quests which involve the assault on &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhase Two.\nDuring the Second Phase of the Scarlet Enclave Death's Breach has become the main base of the Scourge on the ground. The Town of Havenshire having been taken over and destroyed. The former Death Knight Initiates (now &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; proper) wait anxiously for the order to join the battle as Prince Valanar gives a speech upon a newly added stage. Death's Breach plays less of a role now as the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Remembrance\"&gt;Crypt of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt; has taken its place as the forward base for the attack on New Avalon, The Scarlet Crusade's base of operations in the Scarlet Enclave.\nPhase Three.\nAs of Phase Three of the Scarlet Enclave the Death's Breach has been mostly deserted, most of the Scourge's forces having moved to the battle front for the last attacks. Death's Breach now houses one of the last quests in the Scarlet Enclave, and the highest leaders of the Scourge during this attack are present, Including the Lich King. The Stage has been removed, replaced with a small staircase leading up to a platform where the Lich King stands, taunting the Scarlet Crusade. The final evolution of the Death Knight Initiates, Death Knight Champions, are found at the ramps of Death's Breach, fighting back the attacking crusaders.\nAfter the Scarlet Enclave.\nUpon finishing the Final Quests and leaving the instanced Scarlet Enclave, one will find that like Havenshire and New Avalon, Death's Breach has been abandoned. The Tents remain, the Lich King's platform does not however. Transport to and from Acherus has been removed in favor of the Death Knight's &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;. This also keeps others out of Acherus through normal means. Death Knights can also use the flight path to get into the Ebon Hold, should they not want to use or cannot use Death Gate."}

The region is guarded by the demonic agents of the Burning Legion, including &lt;a href=\"beholder\"&gt;beholder&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; Houndmaster responsible for bringing the reinforcements through the gateway.

They are allied with the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfen tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nPreachers of Agamaggan and the Death's Head are known as speakers and prophets. Some notable elite members include &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Jargba\"&gt;Death Speaker Jargba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aggem%20Thorncurse\"&gt;Aggem Thorncurse&lt;/a&gt;. The current crone &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; is said to be officially leading it. According to &lt;a href=\"Shagtusk\"&gt;Shagtusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chugara%20Razorflank\"&gt;Chugara Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; surrendered Razorfen Downs to the Death's Head.\nThe Heads also house a giant boar, &lt;a href=\"Agathelos%20the%20Raging\"&gt;Agathelos the Raging&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Amnennar's initial defeat, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Death Speaker Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt; took control of the cult.\nIn the RPG.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;:\nSpeculation.\nOrigin of the Name.\nThe name Death's Head was likely chosen after Agamaggan\u2019s death and his children\u2019s pledge to his legacy. The traditional capital city, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;, is housed through an entrance resembling a giant boar head. It is likely that when the Downs were under quilboar control, the cult was established here and named as tribute to the fallen boar god.\nCreation.\nThere appears to be some discrepancy on how exactly the Death's Head was formed. \nSeveral quests (some removed in \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\") suggest that the quilboar willingly allied themselves with the Scourge. The quest &lt;a href=\"An%20Unholy%20Alliance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;An Unholy Alliance (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; clearly describes how peacefully and politely this allegiance came to be, with the Scourge's ambassador asking (by letter) Charlga Razorflank for aid:\nThe book &lt;a href=\"Compendium%20of%20Fallen%20Heroes\"&gt;Compendium of Fallen Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, which was implemented in the game much later, gives however a completely different explanation:\nAlthough the versions differ heavily it is not impossible that both are the case. A possible explanation may be that Amnennar carried out the massacre in Razorfen Downs without Charlga even knowing. The Scourge, already heavily established once Amnennar finished his army, might then have planned to expand their territory through negotiating with the still living quilboars. This scenario seems to match: \nAlternatively, it is possible that the Scourge simply first approached the quilboar amically, in order to later turn on them and raise them all as undead minions."}

Renthar, however, angrily declines his assistance -- and reveals that Lor'themar had banished the quel'dorei of the lodge from Quel'Thalas, as he could not afford to lead a people divided. In addition, Hawkspear speaks of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; agents who ransacked the lodge and killed several rangers, in the name of the Banshee Queen's champion, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "768439", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=768439", "title": "Death (gameplay)", "text": "Death is the state a &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; is in when their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; reaches zero (or less). When a player dies, they are unable to take further actions until they release their spirit or are &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ed. Dead players leave a &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; at the location where they died.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nUpon dying, the player is presented with two options: &lt;a href=\"Release%20Spirit\"&gt;Release Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Recap%20Screen\"&gt;Recap&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Death%20Recap%20Screen\"&gt;Death Recap Screen&lt;/a&gt; provides a short list of the most recent sources of damage, allowing the player to review their cause of death. Repeated deaths within a short time will cause a \"resurrection timer\" to appear, which temporarily grays out the Release Spirit button (likely to prevent &lt;a href=\"zerg\"&gt;zerg&lt;/a&gt;ing). After 6 minutes the player's spirit will automatically be released.\nWhen the player's spirit is released, they will turn into a spirit form (a &lt;a href=\"Ghost%23After%20death%20in%20World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; or, in the case of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20Spirit\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;), which &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;s at the nearest &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. A player in ghost form appears as a blueish-gray, transparent version of their normal model (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; zones, where all players instead appear as featureless humanoid souls). As a ghost, you will only have 1 point of health. Death will automatically remove all &lt;a href=\"Buffs\"&gt;Buffs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Debuff\"&gt;Debuff&lt;/a&gt;s from the character, except for the \"ghost\" debuff, which is applied, and certain &lt;a href=\"Flask\"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; effects that persist through death.\nA character will stay dead until they are &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ed. This can be achieved through returning to their corpse as a spirit; by the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;spirit healer&lt;/a&gt; at a graveyard; by a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; character near the corpse; or by using an item such as .\nWhile you are dead, there are some interesting graphical effects. The sky looks like a whirlpool, and everything you see gets a little more grey. This is called the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; and is lore-wise one of the many \"&lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;s\" in the \"Warcraft\"-universe.\nIf you die in an inaccessible area, such as falling off &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; or far past the &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; limit in the ocean, your ghost may not be able to get close enough to your corpse to rejoin it. In this case, you will have to resurrect at a graveyard (when falling off of Outland, the corpse of the player \"usually\" is placed at a reachable area on the edge somewhere. It may, however, place the corpse in an unpleasant location).\nIf you die in an &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; and release your spirit, you will be &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;teleport&lt;/a&gt;ed to the nearest &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. From there, you must run back to the instance and reenter it to be able to recover your corpse. Upon re-entering, you will instantly be revived without having to fetch your corpse, no matter where you died in the instance. Naturally, you will also be returned to the place where players begin the instance - this makes it impossible to &lt;a href=\"corpse%20running\"&gt;corpse run&lt;/a&gt; past mobs in instances. Some instances have portals at the start which can teleport players to locations within the instance to save time. Something else to note is that when you are dead, you can pass through any gates, barriers, and instance doors (if any).\nThe term \"corpse running\", aka \"ghost running\", originally described an exploit to travel to certain areas while dead (thus being immune to damage) but now refers to the distance a player would have to cross from the graveyard to their corpse. This may even have an effect on how willing players are to reattempt entering dangerous areas. For example, dying in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;-instances previously sent the player to the graveyard at &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Point\"&gt;Thorium Point&lt;/a&gt;, which is located on nearly the other side of the zone. As a result, many players were hesitant to play in that location with inexperienced players because it could cause repeated deaths and the time-consuming run back. Later, (possibly in ) the location was placed at &lt;a href=\"Forgewright%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Forgewright's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; which made the distance much shorter.\nDurability as a ghost.\nWhen your ghost is killed, you suffer another 10% &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; loss on equipped items. For example, if you are killed in combat and you get your ghost killed trying to rejoin your corpse (now having died twice), then give up and use the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;spirit healer&lt;/a&gt;, you would suffer a 3x10+25 = 55% durability loss on all equipped items and 25% on inventory items.\nUpon dying in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, all of your equipped items immediately take a 10% &lt;a href=\"durability\"&gt;durability&lt;/a&gt; reduction (this applies only to items equipped when you died, not to items in your inventory). You have a few minutes in which to be &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ed by a player, or you may release yourself to the nearest graveyard as a spirit. While in spirit form, you can run back to your corpse and rejoin it for no additional penalty by selecting the \"Resurrect Now\" button when you come within range; you come back to life with half health and half mana. Run speed is increased to 125% of normal while you are a spirit (&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; have a special racial ability called &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20Spirit\"&gt;Wisp Spirit&lt;/a&gt; that gives them even more speed) and you are able to walk on water.\nYour ghost can breathe underwater in lakes, rivers, coastal waters, and even lava, but if you swim into the deep ocean your ghost can still, ironically, die of &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. Dying while already being dead will return you to the graveyard.\nExceptions to the rules on durability loss.\nIf you are killed by another player in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat, you do not take the initial 10% durability hit. However, you will still take a 25% hit and suffer from resurrection sickness if you are resurrected by a spirit healer. Also, during the Second Scourge Invasion event, there was a glitch, when you stayed long enough as a zombie, you would NOT take durability damage.\nIf you are killed by &lt;a href=\"suicide\"&gt;self-inflicted death&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 such as a Warlock's &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;, using a life-draining item like a &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Rune\"&gt;Demonic Rune&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 then you will not suffer any durability damage to your armor or items unless you are resurrected by a spirit healer.\nSpirit healers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;spirit healer&lt;/a&gt;s present in each graveyard can bring you back to life immediately, saving you a trip to your corpse. However, doing this will cause all of your equipable items to take an \"additional\" 25% durability hit; this applies both to equipped items, and to items in your inventory. In addition, you will suffer from &lt;a href=\"Resurrection%20Sickness\"&gt;Resurrection Sickness&lt;/a&gt;. This sickness decreases all of your &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; and damage dealt by 75%, and has a duration that varies depending on your level:\nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, players that have the resurrection sickness-debuff will be worth no &lt;a href=\"honor\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt; when killed by a player of the opposite faction.\nIn some zones, spirit healers are replaced by other NPCs who offer the same functionality, such as &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Naaru\"&gt;Prime Naaru&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Obelisk\"&gt;Spirit Obelisk&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests accessed while dead.\nThere are a few quests that can only be accessed while the player is dead. Those quests start by talking to an NPC (non-player character) who is only visible and accessible while in ghost/wisp form. On a side note, if one levels due to turning in one such quest, they shall regain all their life and mana but will not resurrect (which is a bit weird)."}

Assembled from the corpses of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; slain in the last battles of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, these abominations were then instilled with the ethereal essence of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. Further empowered with magical energies culled from the slain &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, the Death Knights wield an arsenal of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; and elemental spells that mete out all but certain death to the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells.\nBy enveloping their truncheons with the dark essence of Hel, the Death Knights are able to deplete vital energies from those they lash out against. Their ability to discharge this energy over short distances makes this a menacing attack. Although the effects of this spell are abhorrent to the living, the Touch of Darkness is a but a lesser enchantment within the arsenal of these vile horsemen.\nDeath Coil is a particularly potent variation of the Touch of Darkness spell. By channeling the necromantic powers of the underworld through his ghoulish form, the Death Knight creates a field of dark energy that drains the life-force from any who come in contact with it. This life-force is then consumed - thereby replenishing the strength of one so enchanted, be he friend or foe. The icy embrace of death can be beneficial...for those who know how to control it.\nBy magically increasing the speed at which a body generates vital energy, the caster may bestow great speed to any being. All actions taken by one so enchanted are swifter than a common adversary - an advantage that is evident on the battlefield. The effects of Haste can persist for but a short time.\nThis ancient &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromantic&lt;/a&gt; spell transforms a portion of the recipient's life force into an unearthly, phantasmal suit of armor. This spectral armor then absorbs the damage from any attack directed at its wearer for a limited amount of time. As the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; that link this armor to its host cease, so will the invulnerability that it grants.\nThe aphotic, swirling clouds conjured by the Death Knights can cause anything within their path to rot and decompose. The vapor created by Decay can consume anything - flesh, bone, wood or even the strongest metal. Heavily laden with base substances, these clouds descend and quickly diffuse, leaving only suffering in their wake.\nThis focusing of the winds of the underworld causes any caught within to be cast about with great force and violence. Bones are easily shattered and mainsails are quickly snapped within the torrents of these fierce winds. The howl of these winds allow no commands to be issued to those trapped within the Whirlwind, rendering those unfortunates helpless until the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; fade.\nThis dark &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magik&lt;/a&gt; is the final legacy of the Orc &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who were destroyed shortly after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The Death Knight can animate corpses of the newly dead and then command these monstrosities to attack their enemies. This terrifying spell is the paramount power of the Death Knight as it serves to augment the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces with vast armies of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;the Undead&lt;/a&gt;."}

Though the Paladins were immune to disease of any kind, they were persecuted by the general populace who believed that they had been infected by the foul &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. A small band of Paladins, embittered by society's cruelty, traveled north to find the plague's source. These renegade Paladins succumbed to bitter hatred over the course of their grueling quest. When they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;icy fortress&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; they had become dark and brooding. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty. The weary, vengeful warriors accepted his dark pact, and although they retained their humanity, their twisted souls were bound to his evil will for all time.

The Death Knight is typically the second Hero built by Undead players, though they're generally the first if playing alone. They are absolutely required for any Undead player because of their massive support capabilities. \nThey're often jokingly referred to as the Healing Knight, because all of their spells tend to heal them in some way.\nDeath Coil is the Undead's version of Holy Light, meaning that a player can either use it to heal a wounded Undead unit, or use it against a living opponent. Death Coil is excellent at taking down fleeing enemies, especially at level 3 where it can both heal and damage a lot. This is generally one of the more invested skills due to its dual role as healing and unit killing, especially when an enemy tries to focus on one of your units early/mid-game.\nDeath Pact allows the Death Knight to restore their health in return for killing an Undead unit. At level 3, it heals 300% of the target's health; it generally has no purpose in a short match, but in longer matches, a player could simply use it on a skeleton or reanimated minion to restore most if not all of his health.\nUnholy Aura is an extremely useful aura, especially in team matches. This aura provides increased movement and health regeneration to all friendly units, which stacks with the bonus from Endurance Aura. Try to invest in this skill first, since the support it provides is extremely valuable.\nAnimate Dead allows them to bring back the six most powerful corpses on the field under his control. Though temporary, the Death Knight's minions are invulnerable. However, they will not have any mana, cannot cast any spells and do not have any abilities that they would originally have.\nSpells and abilities.\nDeath oil.\nThe Death Knight's Death Coil ability is a great healer for Undead units and even for the Neutral Heroes &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Death Coil can also be used to heal friendly Undead heroes. It also allows the player to deal with harder creep camps with a smaller army.\nDeath Coil is also good against early rushes where the enemy targets your units. Death Coil can heal &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and other \"living\" members of the Scourge, and is helpful to heal &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Acolytes&lt;/a&gt; that are under attack.\nDeath Coil is especially useful to finish off running enemy units that are near death.\nUse Death Coil with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;'s Frost Nova to make a powerful living unit killer - though not as effective as the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;'s Storm Bolt and &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s Holy Light combo, it does deal a significant amount of damage regardless. Skilled micro players can also add the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;'s Carrion Swarm or &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Lord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Crypt Lord&lt;/a&gt;'s Impale if they somehow survive the first two spells.\nUnlike Holy Light, Death Coil is a projectile-based spell and not instant. This means it's possible for the targeted unit to escape or be killed before the coil actually does what it was intending to do.\nDath Pact.\nDeath Pact can be cast on invulnerable undead units, like those raised by Animate Dead. Use it only on weak Undead units, such as skeletons. For this reason investment into this skill means Necromancers should be brought along, as it is a waste to use it on other units with higher levels as overhealing is not factored into the Death Knight's health pool (e.g a Frost Wyrm has 1,300 health, and level 3 Death Pact coverts it into 3,900 health). An untouched skeleton would heal the Death Knight for roughly half of his health if he doesn't have health boosting items, and won't harm your army's strength.\nnholy Aura (Passive).\nUnholy Aura also causes hitpoint regeneration for mechanical units, and allows Undead units to heal outside of blighted ground, fountains, wards and other items. This effect takes priority over the Legion Doom Horn item. It also allows the Death Knight and his allies to chase down fleeing units.\nAnimate ead (Ultimate).\nThe Death Knight automatically selects the six most powerful corpses in the nearby vicinity and raises them to fight for them. Reanimated units can never be dispellable, but lack mana and lack any spells and abilities they originally had, if any. It is important to try avoid reanimating spellcasters (though powerful creeps are the lone exception) to make the most use of this spell. The units can be targeted by Death Pact and the Lich's Dark Ritual.\nManual description.\nDeath knights were once heroic, virtuous defenders of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. However, they were corrupted by the subtle machinations of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and lured to his dark standard. These former heroes were given untold power and the promise of immortality in exchange for their loyalties. Although they retained their humanity, their twisted souls were bound to the Lich King's will for all time. Bestowed with black, &lt;a href=\"vampiric%20runeblade\"&gt;vampiric runeblade&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger\"&gt;shadowy steeds&lt;/a&gt;, death knights now serve as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s mightiest generals."}

But though he possesses strength and skill, he lacks the spark that all great leaders have to lead men into battle. So when Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; calls to arms brave men to sail to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and battle the scourge army, Thassarian sees his chance to prove to others\u2014and himself\u2014that he has what it takes to lead. After bidding farewell to his mother &lt;a href=\"Vivian\"&gt;Vivian&lt;/a&gt; and his sister &lt;a href=\"Leryssa\"&gt;Leryssa&lt;/a&gt;, Thassarian joins Arthas\u2019 army as they set sail to Northrend.\nArthas mysteriously disappears once they arrive, but after the scourge army descends upon Thassarian and his comrades, Arthas returns to defeat the scourge army with a powerful new weapon\u2014&lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas kills &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; and runs away again. &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Captain Falric&lt;/a&gt; goes to find him, but when he doesn\u2019t return either, Thassarian himself ventures out into the Northrend wastes to find them. He discovers a cave, inside which he finds Falric, now transformed into a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, and kills Thassarian. Thassarian is then resurrected as a death knight himself, which is a powerful, emotionless pawn of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian helps Arthas and his death knight/scourge army to attack Lordaeron, and following Arthas\u2019 command, kills his own mother Vivian.\nAll seems lost until the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light\u2019s Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, when the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Killoren\"&gt;Thassarian\u2019s father&lt;/a&gt; (as well as the fathers of the other death knights) appear before them, breaking the hold the Lich King has on their minds. Now liberated from the will of the Lich King, Thassarian wages his personal war against the Lich King as revenge for what he has taken from him. But it is hard to re-assimilate into society, as no one trusts him now that he is a death knight.\nA man named &lt;a href=\"Counselor%20Talbot\"&gt;Counselor Talbot&lt;/a&gt; finally gives Thassarian the chance to lead, and gives him a mission to lead a small group of men to attack the Lich King. Thassarian is eager (or as eager as an emotionless deadman can be) to take the mission and prove himself a leader, but it is revealed later that the mission was a set up and destined to fail, and Thassarian decides to continue his quest to destroy the Lich King anyway. At &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt;, he is shocked to discover that Counselor Talbot is really &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the Lich King. He also sees his sister Leryssa has been taken captive, and after a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Rites\"&gt;fierce fight with Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, is able to defeat him and rescue her. He vows to return to her one day\u2026but that first he must finish his mission and one day face and defeat the Lich King."}

The duke explained that the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; will ally with &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and will act as his arm. In return, the Lich King offered them to assist in obtaining powerful artifacts: the &lt;a href=\"%3AMaw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;:Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%3AApocalypse\"&gt;:Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;.\nObtaining the artifacts.\nTo obtain the Maw of the Damned, the adventurer arrived to the &lt;a href=\"Darkstone%20Isle\"&gt;Darkstone Isle&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to assist a previous Ebon Blade group led by &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Dhakar\"&gt;Margrave Dhakar&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Gorelix%20the%20Fleshripper\"&gt;Gorelix the Fleshripper&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful demon responsible for the annihilation of several worlds. Taking a portal, the adventurer arrived on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; and found &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sliver\"&gt;Baron Sliver&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they fought their way through the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; and briefly spotted Margrave Dhakar. Then they found and rescued &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Ravensorrow\"&gt;Minerva Ravensorrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagnar%20Stonebrow\"&gt;Dagnar Stonebrow&lt;/a&gt;. They continued to Gorelix's citadel where they witnessed the demon kill Dhakar. The group eventually managed to kill Gorelix, and the adventurer took the Maw Of the Damned. Then they returned back to Azeroth.\nTo obtain the Blades of the Fallen Prince, the adventurer traveled to the Icecrown Citadel where they fought against wandering &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s of previously-trapped souls from Frostmourne: &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun Flamebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halahk\"&gt;Halahk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad\"&gt;Gavinrad&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer found the remains of the Frostmourne, which were reforged into the Blades of the Fallen Prince. However, the blades contained malevolent souls, so the death knight entered it and witnessed echoes of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating the spirits and the echo of Arthas, the adventurer claimed the Blades.\nTo obtain Apocalypse, the adventurer found the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. After convincing him of their intentions (either through reason or force), the two fought side by side against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Ariden's Camp&lt;/a&gt; to find clues about the artifacts that the Dark Riders had stolen, and the adventurer then proceeded to an area near &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; where he raised &lt;a href=\"Laith%20Sha%27ol\"&gt;Laith Sha'ol&lt;/a&gt; who revealed that the stolen artifacts are in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20Catacombs\"&gt;Karazhan Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the catacombs, the two defeated the spirits there, overcame obstacles, and eventually faced off &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Dark Riders. The adventurer then took Apocalypse and parted ways with Revil who admitted that the Dark Riders were defeated, but they might return, and that working with the death knight proved him as a valuable ally.\nDeathlord of the Ebon Blade.\nWith the powerful artifact in hand, the adventurer appeared in the Frozen Throne and agreed on their alliance with Lich King Bolvar.\nThe adventurer then returned to hovering above the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. There, Highlord &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; named them the Deathlord of the Ebon Blade, with the Knights of the Ebon Blade bowing to him.\nThe Deathlord worked on empowering their artifact weapon with &lt;a href=\"Corvus\"&gt;Corvus&lt;/a&gt;, improving Acherus with &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Zubashi\"&gt;Archivist Zubashi&lt;/a&gt;, as well as dealing with the Legion on the Broken Isles and recruiting new troops and champions with &lt;a href=\"Siouxsie%20the%20Banshee\"&gt;Siouxsie the Banshee&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Four Horsemen.\nThe Lich King ordered the Deathlord to raise new Four Horsemen to serve the Ebon Blade and fight against the Legion. The first target was to be the fallen &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and the Deathlord traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and raised Nazgrim as the first horseman.\nThe Lich King ordered for the next horseman to be the legendary &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; king, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. Thassarian and Nazgrim thus traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, now under the control of &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and his undead citizens. The death knights entered into negotiations with the prince who wanted to fully control the city. The Deathlord went to the mage district of Stromgarde and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Ojin%27ba\"&gt;Ojin'ba&lt;/a&gt;. When the deed was done, however, Galen betrayed them. The death knights overwhelmed Stromgarde guards and eventually killed Galen. With the prince dead and &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed, the way to Thoras' crypt was open, and the Deathlord resurrected the king as the second horseman.\nUpon returning to Acherus, Thassarian asked the Deathlord for a personal favor. He explained that a fellow death knight &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; is being held in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had ignored any attempts on negotiations for his freedom. As such, Thassarian now wanted to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; city and rescue Koltira. Forcing their way through the &lt;a href=\"Sewers\"&gt;Sewers&lt;/a&gt; and into the Apothecarium, they killed &lt;a href=\"Gurgoth\"&gt;Gurgoth&lt;/a&gt; and freed Koltira.\nThe next horseman who the Lich King chose was High Inquisitor &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; from the Scarlet Monastery. So the Deathlord, Thassarian, Nazgrim, and Thoras invaded the monastery, killed several crusaders and raised &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Goodchilde\"&gt;High Commander Goodchilde&lt;/a&gt; guarded the cathedral, and the Ebon Blade killed him as well. With the final obstacle removed, the Deathlord raised Sally as the third horseman.\nSteeds of the Damned.\nAs the Deathlord was gaining new troops and champions, Siouxsie also ordered for &lt;a href=\"Salanar%20the%20Horseman\"&gt;Salanar the Horseman&lt;/a&gt; to return from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to Acherus. Salanar was to work on obtaining dread steeds for the new Four Horsemen.\nSalanar asked for the first set of necessary components for conjuring the steeds, the saddle of &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger%27s%20Reins\"&gt;Deathcharger&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, a shadow reins from &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rider%20Ghrave\"&gt;Dark Rider Ghrave&lt;/a&gt; in the Shadowlands, the saddle of the &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the saddle from &lt;a href=\"Midnight\"&gt;Midnight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, and the saddle used by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Later, he requested the &lt;a href=\"%3ABraid%20of%20the%20Underking\"&gt;:Braid of the Underking&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Neltharion's Lair&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"%3ANightmare%20Lash\"&gt;:Nightmare Lash&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final components for the steeds were found in the Shadowlands: Essence of Shadow from &lt;a href=\"Soulbinder%20Nyami\"&gt;Soulbinder Nyami&lt;/a&gt;, Essence of Fear from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt;, Essence of Hatred from &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Essence of Undeath from &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt;, and Essence of Darkness from &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe majority of the items were collected, but Salanar needed one last item - the &lt;a href=\"%3AMaul%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;:Maul of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nChampions of the Deathlord.\nThe Horsemen as well as Thassarian and Koltira served the Deathlord as his champions, embarking on various missions across the battlefields on the Broken Isles. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thorval\"&gt;Lord Thorval&lt;/a&gt; now worked on a new soldier for the Deathlord and required ingredients from the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;. After obtaining them, he created a unique &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Rottgut\"&gt;Rottgut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"%3AFrozen%20Soul%20Pendant\"&gt;:Frozen Soul Pendant&lt;/a&gt; and was now in the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Amal%27thazad\"&gt;Amal'thazad&lt;/a&gt; demanded to retrieve it. As a show of gratitude, the lich offered his services to the battlefield.\nThe Fourth Horseman.\nThe time for the final horseman to raise has come, and the Lich King deemed the recently-deceased &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; to be the fourth horseman, acting as their leader. To that end, the Darion and the horsemen were sent to invade the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. After creating chaos, on the chapel grounds, the horsemen strangulated Maxwell Tyrosus, and the Deathlord entered the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, defeating soldiers stationed there. The &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Highlord%20Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tomb of Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; was defended by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; who was defeated.\nThe remaining horsemen and Darion then joined the Deathlord as they were about to raise Tirion. As the Deathlord started to cast the resurrection spell, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; filled the room, choking the death knights. Not wanting to Ebon Blade to fall, Darion summoned a death gate for the Deathlord and the horsemen to escape. From his last power, he pulled the Deathlord into the portal, and back on Acherus succumbed to his wounds. The Lich King suddenly ordered Darion to be raised again, this time as the fourth horseman. After he was raised, he gladly accepted the position as the leader of the Four Horsemen. By infusing the gathered resources and the claimed souls with the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Forge\"&gt;Soul Forge&lt;/a&gt;, the Deathlord then increased their artifact's power."}

He spawned after the accursed spirits summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Divination%20Scryer\"&gt;Divination Scryer&lt;/a&gt; were defeated.\nBiography.\nOnce a celebrated &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, the man who would come to be known as Darkreaver was seduced by the call of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and became an insidious death knight. His corruption spread to his steed, who was transformed into an undead horse. Darkreaver was sent to the Scholomance. In the dungeon below the Great Ossuary, he attempted to bend the spirit realm to his whim, summoning and corrupting spirits to do his bidding.\n&lt;a href=\"Sagorne%20Creststrider\"&gt;Sagorne Creststrider&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, discovered this deviation in the sacred spirit realm. He was searching for a courageous shaman to venture into Scholomance and face Darkreaver.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, a paladin in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, wished to redeem &lt;a href=\"Darkreaver%27s%20Fallen%20Charger\"&gt;Darkreaver's Fallen Charger&lt;/a&gt;, and put it to use with a truly devoted paladin. He, like Creststrider, was looking for a volunteer to battle Darkreaver.\nStrategy.\nBecause the Divination Scryer was only given to shamans and paladins, the party had to have at least one player of that class who had taken the appropriate quest. This player could then start the battle by using the scryer, which summoned spirits that had to be defeated by the party. The battle went on for approximately 15\u201320 minutes before Darkreaver himself appeared, astride his horse. Once he was killed, the paladin could claim the &lt;a href=\"Charger%27s%20Lost%20Soul\"&gt;Charger's Lost Soul&lt;/a&gt; and redeem it, gaining the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt; as his or her own mount. The shaman, meanwhile, was able to loot &lt;a href=\"Darkreaver%27s%20Head\"&gt;Darkreaver's Head&lt;/a&gt; to take back to Creststrider in Orgrimmar. Creststrider rewarded the shaman with a &lt;a href=\"Skyfury%20Helm\"&gt;Skyfury Helm&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was similar in scope to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; events.\nThe event dealt with the immediate repercussions of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; shattering the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; masterless and out of control, and kidnapping leaders of the Alliance and Horde.\nQuests.\nNew quests in the quest chain unlock weekly and fill in some more information between the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20cinematic\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; (Sylvanas shattering the Helm of Domination) and the beginning of the Shadowlands quests itself (in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20intro%20experience\"&gt;Shadowlands intro experience&lt;/a&gt;). As players complete the final quest in week two, they will be awarded the feat of strength &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Death Rising (achievement)&lt;/a&gt;. Two sets of daily quests are also unlocked as part of the campaign.\nCinematics.\nTwo pre-rendered cinematics play out during the quest chain: \"Dark Abduction\" during &lt;a href=\"Cause%20for%20Distraction\"&gt;Cause for Distraction&lt;/a&gt; and \"For Teldrassil\" during &lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Champion\"&gt;The Banshee's Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew world boss.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; has returned as a &lt;a href=\"world%20boss\"&gt;world boss&lt;/a&gt;, reprising his role from \"Classic\" (for the Alliance, at least). Players will get &lt;a href=\"The%20Banshee%27s%20Champion\"&gt;a breadcrumb to him&lt;/a&gt; at the same time that they are directed to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; during the quest chain, but the world quest &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller (quest)&lt;/a&gt; is available immediately.\nThe world quest awards item level 115 weapons, equivalent to heroic &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; gear, and is available once a week. See &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Equipment%20Cache%20%28Death%20Rising%29\"&gt;Sentinel Equipment Cache (Death Rising)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Deathguard%20Equipment%20Cache%20%28Death%20Rising%29\"&gt;Deathguard Equipment Cache (Death Rising)&lt;/a&gt;.\nDon't try to fight from the roof or inside the house, however...\nZombie invasion.\nMuch like the invasions in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge is running wild in many zones, infecting players, creatures, and NPCs alike.\nEntering Stormwind or Orgrimmar flags the player for PvP regardless of their Warmode status, and running out the timer will only refresh the duration.\nAs the invasion starts, &lt;a href=\"Plagued%20Roach\"&gt;Plagued Roach&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Plagued%20Vermin\"&gt;Plagued Vermin&lt;/a&gt; appear in cities, towns, and quest hubs. Attacking them will \"immediately\" turn the player into an Infectious Zombie. NPC Infectious Zombies also spawn, whose attacks stand a good chance of infecting their targets.\nAdditionally, a &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirsty%20Ghoul\"&gt;Bloodthirsty Ghoul&lt;/a&gt; will spawn on occasion in Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Kill it, loot the &lt;a href=\"Partially%20Digested%20Cloth\"&gt;Partially Digested Cloth&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Partially%20Digested%20Leather\"&gt;Partially Digested Leather&lt;/a&gt;, then turn in &lt;a href=\"A%20Hunger%20for%20Flesh\"&gt;A Hunger for Flesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf players find themselves infected, they have a small amount of time to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; with player skills or find an &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Healer%20%28Death%20Rising%29\"&gt;Argent Healer&lt;/a&gt;, else they will turn into an &lt;a href=\"Infectious%20Zombie\"&gt;Infectious Zombie&lt;/a&gt;. Dying will also cause the player to respawn as a zombie.\nAs is tradition, zombies are hostile to all units except other zombies, can speak with each other cross-faction, and have access to the following abilities:\nIcecrown.\nIcecrown is in a new phase with new mechanics for players who have picked up &lt;a href=\"A%20Message%20from%20Icecrown\"&gt;A Message from Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. If players have not gotten to that point, they will not see any rares or be able to complete any quests in the zone. Max-level players will not be able to take part in normal Argent Tournament activities or Icecrown questing for the duration of the event.\nChilling Winds and Bonfires.\nOccasionally, the Chilling Winds blow:\nThe winds debuff all players in the zone for 20 minutes:\nTo counteract this, find Bonfires in the zone and sit by them for a little while to gain a stacking buff:\nAt five stacks, damage is increased by 25% and Frost damage taken is reduced by 90%, all but negating the Chilling Winds.\nRares.\nAt regular intervals, &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Soulbearer\"&gt;Mawsworn Soulbearer&lt;/a&gt;s summon an undead boss from \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\". These bosses (marked with ) will drop 20-50x &lt;a href=\"Pitch%20Black%20Scourgestone\"&gt;Pitch Black Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;, have a &lt;a href=\"%23Boss%20drops\"&gt;slim chance at item level 110 loot&lt;/a&gt; in an echo of their original drops, and an even rarer chance at an &lt;a href=\"Accursed%20Keepsake\"&gt;Accursed Keepsake&lt;/a&gt;. \nPlayers must have at least picked up &lt;a href=\"A%20Message%20from%20Icecrown\"&gt;A Message from Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to enter the correct phase of Icecrown. Players will not be able to see rares without getting to that point.\nBosses originally spawned every twenty minutes (at :00, :20, and :40) during the first week of the event, but starting November 16 this increased to every ten minutes. Their arrival is announced with a zone-wide emote:\nBetween the initial \"Winged figures\" emote and the boss becoming attackable, players have two minutes to reach the boss's location, shown with a purple skull on the zone map. The boss will yell on aggro, at 50%, and when it dies.\nBosses can be killed for loot each time they're up (every 3 hours and 20 minutes). There is no daily lockout.\nRewards.\nArgent Commendations.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Commendation\"&gt;Argent Commendation&lt;/a&gt; or three is awarded from one-time and daily quests in Icecrown. Commendations can be used to purchase a toy, a pet, and a set of &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; 100 armor (with a new transmog). To purchase everything on one character, 170 commendations are required.\nPlayers can farm commendations by killing mobs or rares for &lt;a href=\"Darkened%20Scourgestone\"&gt;Darkened Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pitch%20Black%20Scourgestone\"&gt;Pitch Black Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt; and turning them in, 25 at a time, for 1 or 3 commendations, respectively.\nVendors are located at:\nBoss drops.\nIcecrown &lt;a href=\"%23Rares\"&gt;respawned bosses&lt;/a&gt; drop 20-50x &lt;a href=\"Pitch%20Black%20Scourgestone\"&gt;Pitch Black Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt; and usually a piece of item level 110 gear, and have a very small chance to drop an &lt;a href=\"Accursed%20Keepsake\"&gt;Accursed Keepsake&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, selected bosses (like Bronjahm or Skadi) can drop their special items, such as a 34-slot bag or mount in addition to their normal loot. There is no daily lockout, and players can loot the rares each time they respawn (every three hours 20 minutes).\nIn addition, they, and the regular mobs within Icecrown, have a slight chance to drop the &lt;a href=\"Battered%20Hilt\"&gt;Battered Hilt&lt;/a&gt;. \nLeader gossip.\nAt the capitals, various faction leaders all have special gossip text:\nAlliance.\nTaelia has a gossip option:\nAs does Mathias Shaw:\nHorde.\nValeera has a gossip option:"}

The vapor created by Decay can consume anything - flesh, bone, wood or even the strongest metal. Heavily laden with base substances, these clouds descend and quickly diffuse, leaving only suffering in their wake.\nThe swirling negative energies known as the Death And Decay spell are favored by the liches for their power to decompose, rot and destroy everything within them.

Living creatures age rapidly, as skin sags and flesh sloughs off bones. Structures wither and collapse, suffering the effects of decades within a few seconds. All living creatures and non-natural structures in the area take damage from the negative energy. Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures them a like amount of damage.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn-game, the spell is used by the mobs:\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled ', &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; used the Decay spell he learned from a &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the game to destroy the thorny vines blocking access to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.

The dark energies warped one of the chamber's native &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, melding it to the surrounding crystalline walls. Known as Tortos, this amalgamation of flesh and stone has since feasted on the cave's rich mineral deposits and grown to a colossal size.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Along with asking why we fight, and learning that our true enemy is war itself, a major theme of the Mists of Pandaria has been killing turtles. This raid encounter elevates that motif to all-new heights, presenting players with the chance to fight a huge turtle, and small turtles, and also the ability to kick one of the small turtles into the big turtle. What more could you ask for?\" \n\"Fun fact: We originally wanted to make a fire turtle boss in the southeastern section of Firelands in Patch 4.2, but opted not to at the time; we\u2019ve been looking for an opportunity to do a turtle fight ever since.\"\nStrategy.\nTortos is a one-phase encounter that usually requires two tanks: one for Tortos and one for the Vampiric Cave Bats. All raid members should watch out for the blue circles that signal Rockfall. Tortos will periodically use Quake Stomp which will take away 65% of the raid's maximum HP. This damage is mitigated by defensive cooldowns. \nThe primary mechanic for the encounter are the Whirl Turtles that spawn periodically. When the turtles die, they retreat into their shell and can be kicked, applying a debuff to the boss and any adds, including other Whirl Turtles, it hits. Tortos has a relatively large hitbox, so it is advisable to hit as many bats and turtles as possible when kicking a shell at Tortos. However, at least one shell must be saved in order to interrupt the casting of Tortos' Furious Stone Breath attack which does severe damage to the raid once he reaches 100% Fury. Also keep in mind the stalagmites on the side of the room may interrupt line of sight for kicking the shells into Tortos, so be mindful of where you kill the turtles. One helpful tactic is to kill a turtle in the center of the room, if possible, and save it for the next Call of Tortos since the three incoming Whirl Turtles will arrive in a straight line, easily hit by a kicked shell. This will apply the debuff to all three turtles and make them initially much easier to kill. \nVampiric Cave Bats will spawn at the ceiling and fly down to attack the raid. The second tank must pick up these bats quickly and position them in front of the boss so they can easily be hit by kicked shells. They should be hit with any shells the raid has to spare and AOE'd down. The bats may recover health over time due to Drain the Weak, so all dps must be focused on the adds or they will take much longer to kill than necessary. \nThe dps increase from the Whirl Turtles' Shell Concussion is vital to keeping the number of adds low and damage on the boss high. Overall, Tortos can be seen as one of the easier fights in the Throne of Thunder, since the raid mostly just has to master the positioning and use of the dead Whirl Turtles to win. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It is principally used with &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Totem\"&gt;Windfury Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grace%20of%20Air%20Totem\"&gt;Grace of Air Totem&lt;/a&gt;, although conceivably it could be used to with &lt;a href=\"Flametongue%20Totem\"&gt;Flametongue Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;Totem of Wrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe idea behind totem twisting was that, since Windfury Totem periodically applies a 9 second weapon buff, another totem can be dropped within the 9 second intervals.\nFor example:\nTotem twisting is most trustworthy to an enhancement shaman since the elemental and restoration ones have a casting time and will not be able to time the twisting properly. Even so, the enhancement shaman will notice a definite loss in DPS since the act of dropping totems resets the swing timer thus making you hit less.\nThere was a general dispute as to whether or not Totem Twisting actually increased or decreased a raid's DPS. The general rule of thumb was that Totem Twisting was an overall raid DPS increase only when the raid consisted of a 'large number' of rogues, fury warriors, and/or hunters.\nAlthough totem twisting was not considered an exploit, it is not considered \"creative use of game mechanics\". Blizzard had indicated that they will be fixing totem twisting, and since have with the 3.0 patch. (See: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366685040&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1)"}

Before and during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, almost all druids were &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. (Most are still night elves, though many &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and a few other races now take up the path.)

Since the war, night elves (and other druids) realized that diversity might be a better option. Now, druids no longer organize themselves by totem, but instead incorporate many different animals and animalistic aspects into their repertoire. Some call themselves &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Druids of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; to represent their breadth, but as this approach is now standard, mostly they\u2019re called just druids.\nSome druids, however, still follow totemic creatures. Some are old night elves who don\u2019t see the point of expanding their views, while others are new recruits who wish to specialize.( These variants also represent druids from earlier ages, such as the Third War or the War of the Ancients.) The &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;, now infamous for a catastrophe in the Wailing Caverns, is the largest druidic group that retains a totem, but the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; also exist.\nMisc.

They are the distant cousins of the dread &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. They serve &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; as laborers, researchers, businessmen, and debt collectors, particularly in constructing and selling &lt;a href=\"infernals\"&gt;infernals&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have leering, demonic visages with deeply sunken eyes and smooth skin. Great, hooked wings extend from their backs, marked with elaborate symbols fashioned from acts of self-mutilation, including ornate stitching and a series of intricate cuts. They are a dark-skinned humanoid that would stand at least twice as tall as a normal man, were its form not unnaturally hunched over. Four abnormally large arms connect to bulbous shoulders, each clutching a glistening, black blade. A tothrezim's claws drip with a fel poison that eats at the very sanity of a creature. The tothrezim are mystically linked to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and can draw power directly from it. The tothrezims\u2019 link to the Twisting Nether also allows them to focus its energy into constructs, giving sculpted rock a chaotic life born of the Nether.\nThe tothrezim share a common ancestry with the cruel nathrezim, but while the nathrezim serve Sargeras as lieutenants in his armies, the tothrezim serve as his laborers and craftsmen. They slave away with mining picks and in magical laboratories with a nearly single-minded common goal of filling the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s demand for &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s. The tothrezim were never expansionistic or military-minded, but they share a unique bond with the Twisting Nether and an unmatched greed for gold and magic items. The bond enables them to infuse fiery constructs with fel power, and they have used their ability to establish themselves as a dominant force in Sargeras dire plan. \nA gray ore known as fel stone litters the physical spaces of the Nether. It functions as a conduit for the Nether\u2019s entropic energies. The tothrezim mine the ore and shape it to create shells that channel the energy. The results are fiery infernals. The tothrezim craft them for the Burning Legion, but their greed drives them to sell their constructs to whoever will pay the price they demand. The tothrezim are organized, businesslike and undiscerning. They\u2019ll offer a contract for infernal summoning to anyone who is capable of paying.\nThe tothrezim accept any form of payment. They take gold, gems, jewels and especially magic items. Clients are billed every few weeks and payment is expected immediately. One of the tothrezim's collectors teleports or plane shifts to the client's location. Those who dodge their obligations or attempt to hide from scrying attempts, through nondetection or similar magic, are dealt with harshly. The tothrezim have four specialized collection teams usually consisting of: one tracker who serves as &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt;; one divine caster; two arcane casters, one of whom serves as group leader; and three &lt;a href=\"adamantine%20stalker\"&gt;adamantine stalker&lt;/a&gt;s. For particularly dangerous debt collections, the tothrezim maintain one group comprised of the individuals below and five adamantine stalkers."}

He is accompanied by his pet, &lt;a href=\"Windcaller%20Claw\"&gt;Claw&lt;/a&gt;, who is part of the quest &lt;a href=\"Lost%20in%20Action\"&gt;Lost in Action&lt;/a&gt; which can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Jhang\"&gt;Watcher Jhang&lt;/a&gt; in front of the entrance to the dungeon. However his location in the dungeon brings into question why he is here surrounded by beasts instead of with his fellow Murkblood. This may suggest that he is in exile and hiding in the untamed parts of the Underbog.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"To be one of the Broken is to be an outcast. This truth weighs heavy on Swamplord Musel'ek. Although he is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20tribe\"&gt;Murkblood Broken&lt;/a&gt;, he prefers to roam the caverns beneath &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; alone. During one of these recent wanderings, he used his mastery over beasts to enthrall &lt;a href=\"Windcaller%20Claw\"&gt;Windcaller Claw&lt;/a&gt;, a druid who had been exploring the area in the form of a ferocious bear. Musel'ek has forced Claw to act as a loyal companion who will not judge him for the twisted being he has become.\"\nStrategies.\nClear the &lt;a href=\"Underbog%20Lord\"&gt;Underbog Lord&lt;/a&gt; that patrols near Musel'ek before engaging the boss. He can crit for in excess of 9.5k on mail armour. He will aggro when you attack the boss, and you will wipe unless spectacularly geared.\nThis fight is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Illyanna%20Ravenoak\"&gt;Illyanna Ravenoak&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and can be completed with a single tank. The tank first attacks Claw for a few seconds to build up threat before switching to Musel'ek. Once the tank has built up enough threat, the rest of the party can attack and down him quite quickly. Musel'ek will occasionally freeze the whole group and take some distance so he can shoot. It is important for the tank to get back into the hunter's melee range immediately. Once the hunter is dead the group can focus on Claw, who will turn friendly at 20% health and expose himself as &lt;a href=\"Windcaller%20Claw\"&gt;Windcaller Claw&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the bear can be burned to 20% first, removing it from the fight, and then the boss engaged. The primary concern appears to be healing interruption and proper double-tanking.\nMultiple Tank Strategy.\nIt is possible to use an off tank to tank the bear around the corner. This has the advantage that the main tank will not be affected by the bear's armor-reducing ability.\nAlternatively, have the main tank on Claw and the off tank of Musel'ek. Neither of them melees very hard, and the most important thing in the fight is to keep someone in melee range of Musel'ek. Your group's MT will be in a better position (more armor and health) to handle the armor debuff that Claw applies. Kiting is not necessary: have the MT charge Claw where he stands and the OT engage Musel'ek, moving him a short distance away from the MT. Then have the OT move to Musel'ek immediately after the frost trap wears off. Have all DPS on Musel'ek until he is down.\nKiting Strategy - obsolete.\nYou can simply have a Rogue, frost Mage, or Hunter kite the bear all the way back to the beginning of the water where you jumped down, while the rest of the party downs the main boss. By the time you get Claw down to the beginning of this section, simply Vanish, Ice Block, or Feign Death; and Claw will return to the party for his demise. This gives the party time to heal up and bandage. This tactic works in Heroic too, but beware, the person kiting may not be able to loot the boss afterward.\n[NOTE: When Musel'ek calls him, Claw runs back; this strategy does NOT appear to be valid any longer. THoL]\nHugging Strategy.\nYou can also hug both to keep all party members and both Swamplord and Claw within an 8-yard circle. This avoids Claw's charge and prevents the Swamplord from using his ranged attacks. You will be frozen for a second or two. Simply repeat the process by moving into an 8-yard circle. Since Musel'ek does about 700 melee damage compared to 500 from Claw, it's probably better to kill him first.\n[NOTE: I am NOT certain this method still works in Heroic mode. THoL]\nAdditional Information.\nIt has been confirmed in a normal instance that Claw can be put to sleep with a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hibernate\"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt; spell. This has been confirmed NOT to work for &lt;a href=\"Heroic\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt;, as Claw is now immune. \nHeroic Difficulty.\nThis fight does not appear to change much on Heroic, although Claw's \"Echoing Roar\" reduces armor by 82% now. Again, clear the Bog Lord first.\nWith a decently-geared tank, both targets can be kept under control, provided the tank quickly regains aggro after Claw's charge. Claw doesn't hit particularly hard on tanks, so he really just needs to be kept from running amok among the rest of the group, especially on the healer.\nThe easiest strategy on Heroic mode is for the tank to occupy Claw to stop him from knocking group members out of range of Musel'ek and the healer. Musel'ek himself stays in ranged combat for the majority of the fight (only occasionally seems to 'throw' group members who get too close), so ranged DPS can burn him down relatively fast without the tank needing to touch him. You can see his freezing traps coming as he places them, so if you're running low on health use a potion or healthstone, as he has a free hit on you while frozen. Healers have to be on their toes as his targets seem pretty random, and he uses attacks such as Multi-shot to hit more than one target. Once Musel'ek is down, burn Claw down to 20% and he returns to his Druid form and the fight is over. Musel'ek is definitely one of the easiest bosses in heroic dungeons providing Claw doesn't get loose from the tank."}

A swarm of tiny creatures consists of about three hundred non-flying creatures or one thousand flying creatures. A swarm of diminutive creatures consists of roughly fifteen hundred non-flying creatures or five thousand flying creatures. A swarm of fine creatures consists of perhaps ten thousand creatures flying or not. Swarms of non-flying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a ten foot square area, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; spell Carrion Swarm created a swarm of bats.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nThe spell &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Swarm\"&gt;Carrion Swarm&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;a href=\"Shadow\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; damage.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/search%3Fq%3D%2BCarrion%2BSwarm\"&gt;Carrion Swarm&lt;/a&gt; is a common NPC ability.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; group into swarms named after the &lt;a href=\"Kypari\"&gt;Kypari&lt;/a&gt; trees."}

{"id": "87722", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=87722", "title": "Trading channel", "text": "= Tips for trading =\nMany new players get quite a surprise the first time they enter a capital city, when they see all of the colorful item names that pop up when clicked in the chat window. For the newbie, it can be more than confusing to figure out what's in-demand, what's cheap, and how to make money.\nThis guide isn't written completely &lt;a href=\"NPOV\"&gt;NPOV&lt;/a&gt;, because it contains a lot of firsthand experience on how &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt; economy is used and misused. Most newcomers to this market can literally be harassed by other players, get ripped off, or even made the laughingstock of the trade channel.\nI will call buying/selling in the Trade channel \"the direct market\" because it is different from &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; in that you can interact with others.\nThe basics in trading.\nWhen you first come into this world, you will notice that people are trying to sell all kinds of &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s in the Trade channel. Mostly it's users offering their services, such as enchanting, leather-working, blacksmithing, etc., but you will notice a lot of &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt; item named too. The item names are clickable, so you can see the details on that specific item such as level requirements, stats, the &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, etc. \nIf you are new to &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt;, or just new to using the direct market, often you will find it difficult to evaluate a specific item's worth, and in many ways this is perhaps the beauty about it, as some would say. The reason is to make you buy quickly without a second thought, instead of having plenty of time to look up an item on the web. Another reason is if you have difficulties in selling a item on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; and are tired of losing deposits every time, the trade channel is a good way to sell your items if you are in short supply of cash.\nThe trade channel can be a seller's as well as a buyer's market, depending solely on whether you know what price each item can be sold for!\n\"Tip: start looking for the prices on Cloth (, , , , and ) and if you have &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;herbalism&lt;/a&gt; - look up what they get sold for, ex: , or \". Keep track of things you know from ordinary drops or gathering skills, items you are familiar with.\nFirst things first.\nThere are 3 kinds of direct marketing in trade channel.\nExamples\nThere are many ways to mark your items on the trading channel and none of them are wrong - the question is how many &lt;a href=\"whisper\"&gt;whisper&lt;/a&gt;s can you handle? Most people will &lt;a href=\"whisper\"&gt;whisper&lt;/a&gt; you the &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;r the item is, except if its &lt;a href=\"trade%20items\"&gt;trade items&lt;/a&gt; and especially if you sell at a very low price and are announcing it.\nWord of advice is try not to use words like \"free\" or \"cheap\" or any other words that indicate \"salesmanship\", just \"WTS\" plus the link to the item. Cheap is relative so often you will attract Plzz'er, Goldfish and Sharks (see below) with too much salesmanship. It can though be a good idea to write if a given item has an enchant on it, not everyone notices if it does.\nHow to behave.\nYou are going to meet a lot of people in the Trade channel and have some odd and funny conversations, but you might also encounter mean or annoying people. These are words of advice for both sellers and buyers.\nWhen you are dealing in the Trade channel, be fair and helpful with any questions that buyers might ask you. Try not to brag about other sales or deals you've made; there is no reason to /flex your salesmanship, because it will only backfire and make people jealous.\nIt's a good idea to do a bit of research to get to know which items are used for which &lt;a href=\"professions\"&gt;professions&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es: Especially if you sell those items, so you can advise others on if it's an item they actually can use, or at least point them in the right direction. For example, if you are trying to sell a 2H weapon to a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 55, and he isn't going to use it for his alt, tell him he might have a difficult time keeping aggro and that he should go with &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;. You lose a potential customer if he's reasonable, but at least he knows whom to ask for items in the future and you will gain respect. If the customer wants it anyway, sell it, because it's not up to you to tell others how to play their &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf you sell an item and 5 minutes later that person's trying to sell it for a higher price than you sold it for, don't be angry and start harassing the person; it's part of the game. Be glad you got the money you wanted. There's always a chance that person won't be able to sell it for a profit anyway.\nTrader personalities list.\nThis list is a stereotype of personalities you may encounter. It can help you understand more easily each type of person's intentions before you really get to know them. Many of these personalities come out in the light when you are selling &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s\nThe Plzz'er \nThe Goldfish \nThe Shark \nThe Monkey Scratcher \nOnly got 1G \nThe Monkey \nThe Kid \nThe Thief \nGrand Theft Auto\nThe F16 Pilot\nThe Gamemaster\nYourself \n= How to price =\nThis is the difficult part of trading, unless you use outside sources. If you're still a newbie, and you haven't spent years memorizing your server's economy, you can always download an appropriate price &lt;a href=\"addon\"&gt;addon&lt;/a&gt; (such as Auctioneer) or visit fansites that help you outline prices. Remember, every server has its own economy.\nIf you don't want to trust outside sources, here are some tips on learning how to price:\nWhen you are come this far, you will soon figure out that there are a lot of money too be made on auction hall, same goes for trading channel. The only problem is that often it is not white trading items that are sold in trading channel, but rather &lt;a href=\"Rare\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Epic\"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and \"enchanter spammers\".\nThe \"right\" price.\nPlayers often don't know the value of their sellable &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, resulting in these items being either over- or under-priced. Indeed, a good deal of skill and knowledge is required in identifying unreasonable prices. \nIn the real world prices are controlled by different economic factors, including the value of a country's currency, wages and the buying power of the consumer. The WoW economy, however, is very similar to economies in the real world, particularly in that prices are determined by Supply and Demand. If an item is common, it is easier to find and therefore not likely to fetch a high price. If it is rare and in high demand, it is likely to fetch a higher price than a common item. This law of supply and demand is common to all economies, whether specific to MMORPGs or real-world. One difference, however, between WoW economics and real-world economics is that in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;WoW&lt;/a&gt; there is only one currency and therefore the factor of foreign exchange is irrelevant in WoW economics. Some factors that are perhaps unique to WoW are:\nWith regard to the first point, if Server A has more Paladins and Warriors than Server B, and both servers have the same overall population, then the price of Plate Armour on Server A will likely be higher than on Server B. This is because Plate Armour will drop just as often on each server, but on Server A more players will want those items. That is to say more players will be vying for a limited supply of Plate Armor, forcing the price on Plate Armor upwards. \nThere has been much speculation on how server population affects item prices, with such theories often yielding the equation:\nSome argue that if the population is low then &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s are dropped as &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;r less often than on a fully populated server. Some argue that this makes items much more expensive, because high-quality items are dropped more rarely. On the other hand, if the server is sparsely populated then fewer players will be in demand for those few rare items, resulting in lower prices. \nTheoretically the server population should make little or no difference to the real value of any item. If the server population is high, then demand will be higher and prices will rise. In this case, however, rare items will drop more often, creating a greater supply to satisfy the increased demand. In the end the two forces should balance out and server population should be irrelevant in determining the price of rare items. \nOne thing thats is definitely true of low-population servers is that prices tend to fluctuate rapidly giving way to lots of trading. On highly populated server prices tend to be more stable, at least in theory, because players will notice underpriced items more quickly and resell them for a higher price, forcing the overall price of the item back up to \"normal\" levels.\nAnother factor that is interesting but very difficult to quantify is the effect of so-called \"chinese farmers\". Some say they have a enormous effect on the economy, while others claim the effect is minimal. This can be hard to monitor and there is really no way to figure out. \nYet another factor to account for is the age of the realm, on a newer realm prices tend to be fairer where and items are involved. While on older realms the prices for (low level) and items are usual very high because of the large number of &lt;a href=\"twink\"&gt;twink&lt;/a&gt;s on the realm.\nDisclaimer: This theory and can vary from server to server and may not be accurate\nFiguring out the right price.\nWhen you are looking for good deals, you have to not only know about the prices on many &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s beforehand, but have to make proper estimations on buyout. \nFinding \"the right price\" these rules should be applied for sell price:\nIf you are about to buy something and you aren't sure about the price, don't buy it no matter how much you crave it until you're sure it's a good price. Be careful about an item's worth."}

Trag was one of the first tauren to explore Lordaeron, where he befriended a human noble.\nBiography.\nThe Barony.\nTrag Highmountain chanced upon a small human &lt;a href=\"Barony%20Mordis\"&gt;barony&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The barony was controlled by the kind and gentle Baron &lt;a href=\"Valimar%20Mordis\"&gt;Valimar Mordis&lt;/a&gt;. The two soon became friends and Trag decided to stay. When the Scourge later came and slaughtered his friend and everybody else, Trag hid away... but not before killing some &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShadows of Ice.\nSometime later, a now undead Baron Valimar, running from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, returned to his ruined fortress as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and encountered Trag there, and together they worked to destroy the Scourge. They were after a particular Scourge leader, &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt;, who wielded the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Orb of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which could revive &lt;a href=\"ancient%20behemoth\"&gt;ancient behemoth&lt;/a&gt;s or even &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s. The Baron wished to use it to raise a large army of undead but kept some of his plans secret from Highmountain.\nA young &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;\"human\"&lt;/a&gt; woman, &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, arrived in the vicinity of the castle. She was \"rescued\" by Trag and the Baron. The Baron's intended to sacrifice the innocent Anveena \u2013 who held powerful magic within her \u2014 in order to utilize the Orb's power; this did not sit well with Trag. He soon awakened himself to the fact that the Baron he once knew was dead and gone, and that what stood in the Baron's place was no better than the Scourge. He tried to rescue Anveena but was defeated by Valimar.\nTrag awoke and confronted the Baron again as he raised his undead monstrosities. Trag closed his huge fist around the Orb in the Baron's hand, shattering it, and causing the &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; that the Baron had summoned to come crashing down onto the castle, killing them both.\nFallen.\nThough killed by the fallen remains of the frost wyrm, Trag was raised in undeath by the Orb of Ner'Zhul's final magical act. Haunted by visions of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and hearing the call of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Trag sought out the Highmountain tribe &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sulamm\"&gt;Sulamm&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes of reversing the curse and returning to life. Sulamm told him that it is not possible and claimed that he can remain with the Highmountains.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Henge%20of%20the%20Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Henge of the Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;, Sulamm placed Trag in a trance state, promising to end his suffering; in truth, Sulamm had informed the tribe of Trag's fate, and led by &lt;a href=\"Ornamm\"&gt;Ornamm&lt;/a&gt;, his kinsmen now attempted to burn him alive in a flaming pit. Within his mind, Trag began to stir. Trag felt something is wrong and awoke through what he assumed was the same power that returned him to life, he defeated his kin but didn't kill anyone, took the weapon of Ornamm, and left the shaman Sulamm in a trace state instead of killing him saying that he wouldn't kill a person that could not defend. He even ignored the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers of killing his tribesmen.\nFear.\nFleeing towards Northrend, Trag avoided his kin and tried to slip past the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The corruption caused Trag to suffer from fits of violent thought, and he felt he would eventually succumb to the power of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Trag encountered &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who became aware of his presence through his shamanic magic. Thrall offered to help, but Trag lost control of himself and the two battled. Even after calming down, Trag warned him to run before Trag lost control of himself again. However, Thrall outright refused to fight him, nor abandon him to fight against the voice of the Lich King alone. Thrall then told of how he had once feared becoming the animal &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; thought him to be, of falling into bloodlust to escape that fear; but the truth is, bloodlust would have only hidden his fear, leaving it to eat away at him forever. By bringing peace into his soul (possibly by facing his fear and accepting that his past is part of who he is), Thrall conquered his fear, survived, and found his redemption. If Thrall could do it, if &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; could do it, so too could Trag if he would allow Thrall to help him. Trag denied that Thrall could do anything for him and warned him away once more. Thrall again refused, and when told that he would be struck down in accepting such a fate, he asked that Trag look him in the eyes \"as you do so I know my executioner\".\nTrag prepared to kill Thrall, only to see in his eyes that he truly does understand Trag's fear, a calm understanding that allowed Thrall to beat his own fear, and from which Trag now draws enough strength to deny the Lich King's demands to kill him. Thrall offered him shelter and safety with the orcs, which Trag turned down; he knew even better than Arthas that his fear would have turned him into a monster, but can't fully trust himself around others just yet. He decided to continue to Northrend and ensure for himself that he will never become one of the Scourge, even if that means self-destruction. Thrall told him that a Horde fleet of ships on the nearby shores of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; would be sailing north soon, and offered a small &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; mark should he need to contact orcs. Trag turned down the mark but thanked Thrall for the offer; he was kind to someone who might have killed him. Thrall admitted with a smile that he wouldn't have just stood there if Trag had tried, but had judged the tauren correctly. Thrall said he would ask the spirits to watch over Trag and to his surprise bid him farewell by name, even though Trag had not mentioned it.\nTrag stowed away on one of the ships and reached Northrend. Even though he was almost sure that he would fail, more so that he would die, Trag was determined to meet his fate...without fear.\nFiend.\nTrag came to Northrend with only one purpose - to reach Icecrown and the Lich King. In the Borean Tundra Trag met the traveling taunka; &lt;a href=\"Akiak\"&gt;Akiak&lt;/a&gt; when he was about to fall to a hole made by a Jormungar. Akiak took him to his village; &lt;a href=\"Taunka%27le\"&gt;Taunka'le&lt;/a&gt;. Trag was surprised by this action and by the taunka's hospitality, but he did not stay long. Having heard of the magic bones of the great dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; he, joined by Akiak whose mate, &lt;a href=\"Buniq\"&gt;Buniq&lt;/a&gt;, should be there, set out to find a piece for himself. They found the corpse of Buniq and a bone fragment belonging to the great &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. Trag recognized its potential against the Lich King and brought it back to Taunka'le. When nearing the village, Trag and Akiak discovered that it was under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Anub%27ar\"&gt;Anub'ar&lt;/a&gt;. Trag successfully battled of the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; invasion, by jumping down the sinkhole from whence they had come and slaughtered their leader. Wandering through the nerubian-made caverns Trag finally reached daylight: at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFate.\nTrag made his way into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and confronted the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, but hesitated when he sensed that they shared some inner link. The Lich King explained that dark magic which reanimated Trag came from the Orb of Ner'zhul, and said, \"part of what I am comes from what was the spirit of its creator\". Trag cursed Ner'zhul's name, but the Lich King said, \"Ner'zhul is no more. He is consumed. There is only Arthas now... Arthas, whom you shall serve for all eternity.\" When Trag resisted, Arthas used his magic to dominate him. Trag was equipped as a death knight and ordered to slay a group of &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; he had assisted earlier in his journey as well as taunka's villages. With great difficulty, Trag managed to fight the Lich King's control. Turning on his new master, Trag struck Arthas's breastplate with his axe. Though the armor magically repaired itself, the Lich King was outraged by the tauren's audacity. As Trag was preparing to hit the Lich King with Galakrond's fragment, the Lich King blasted Trag out of the citadel and sent him flying through the air. Though Trag's body was broken by the fall, the essence of the orb soon reconstructed him, and he no longer heard the Lich King's voice in his mind. &lt;a href=\"Akiak\"&gt;Akiak&lt;/a&gt; and his taunka defended him against Anub'ar and invited him to live with them. Trag agreed and swore to protect his new family and home.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nTrag Highmountain made his first appearance in the game with &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20the%20Crusade\"&gt;Call of the Crusade&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; where he was seen walking and speaking to &lt;a href=\"Akiak\"&gt;Akiak&lt;/a&gt;. He appears as a tauren death knight in &lt;a href=\"Tier%208\"&gt;Tier 8&lt;/a&gt; battlegear and is part of &lt;a href=\"Taunka\"&gt;The Taunka&lt;/a&gt;. He claimed that when the time is right, he will join the assault of Icecrown Citadel.\nTrag kept his word and joined the assault on Icecrown Citadel. However, this epic battle was fought on many fronts. While the heroes assaulted the citadel directly, Trag and a handful of death knights took the fight to Arthas on another battleground. These warriors were victorious, but rumors tell of how this fearless tauren took an arrow to the knee.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Trag, as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, was found within , speaking with &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Ravensorrow\"&gt;Minerva Ravensorrow&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Heart of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;."}

The easiest way to find most trainers is to talk to a &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; city.\nYou can alternatively train by typing \"/train\" at any given time.\nTraining mobs.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;, it is often possible to &lt;a href=\"grief\"&gt;grief&lt;/a&gt; another player or party by &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;ing a number of nearby &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s that would ordinarily not be close enough to see the target party, then running toward the party so that the mobs chase you into them and attack them. If done at an inopportune moment, such as when the other player or party is currently fighting a close fight, this can turn their victory into a defeat and possibly a party &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;, making \"training\" a way for a single player to use the environment to defeat an entire party of the opposite faction \u2013 or even of the same faction.\nThe developers of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" seem to have realized that this is undesirable \u2013 even on a &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; server, the fact that one player could successfully and repeatedly grief an entire party of other players, even players of the same faction, could have a strong negative impact on a lot of people's gaming experiences. The WoW developers aren't against grieving behavior when there's a PvP remedy (if you can get together a group of allies to trounce the offending party or simply kill all the mobs quickly, the problem is solved), but when the griever is impossible to attack (is not set PvP, or is of the same faction as his targets), there is no such PvP remedy. There are, therefore, countermeasures against mob training in WoW:\nIt is therefore difficult to train mobs on anybody in WoW; they will only attack the target party if someone in the target party (although this does include &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s) hits the mob as it goes by, and then only if the would-be mob trainer dies rather than getting away. If the mob trainer escapes, even if the mob has somebody else on its aggro list, the mob(s) will just leash back to their spawn points, ignoring the target party, and reset.\nTraining mobs on somebody has been made very difficult in WoW, although it is still not totally impossible. If done in such a way that there is no PvP remedy to the situation, it is a reportable offense.\nOne of the most famous examples of training occurred when a Horde guild successfully pulled &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;."}

Thrall even considered it an old friend for its presence in his cell.\nTypes.\nIn Warlords of Draenor, a healing dummy was added to Ashran. This is a friendly NPC that can be targeted with helpful spells that quickly reduces its HP to 1 over time. In Legion, a tanking dummy was added to the relevant classes' Order Halls, which will attack players in combat that stand nearby it. These dummies for other roles have generally continued to appear in subsequent expansions, such as the Shadowlands Covenant Sanctums.\nLocations.\nAdditionally, in Pandaria, dummies were added at the faction Shrines in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, outside on the terrace areas. In Draenor, dummies were added in the faction towns on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, as well as at a player's Level 3 &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; near the portal to &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, and certain large Garrison plots like the Mage Tower/Spirit Lodge. A healing dummy was included in the set of Ashran dummies, which would also be added to future sets of training dummies in the world. In Legion, dummies were added at the &lt;a href=\"Order%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt;s. In Battle for Azeroth, they were available at the Zul'Dazar Royal Armory and near to the Boralus Tradewinds Market. In Shadowlands, dummies are available at the &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Sanctum\"&gt;Covenant Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn \"Cataclysm\".\nMany training dummies were installed around all starting towns. They help players learn their new abilities, and often are an objective of one of the first few quests new players will receive. These Dummies have low health and despawn once \"killed,\" reappearing in a second or two.\nPlayers below level 60 (Alliance) can use:\nwhich is a level 1 training dummy with a health of 1, but which doesn't decrease when damaged.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
