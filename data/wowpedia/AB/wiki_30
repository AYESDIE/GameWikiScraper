The proud, defiant armies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; stand resolute in their final, fleeting moments. All that remains is the shrill, clarion call to battle and the fulfillment of our destiny. The tides of darkness are now at hand!\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Utok%20Scratcher\"&gt;Utok Scratcher&lt;/a&gt; and his commander were among the forces sent to destroy &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Utok's unit chose to again rely on &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to sack most of the capital. The most suitable site for the roosts was on the island where their troops had already made a successful landing. Though they already had a base started, the encampment soon fell to a constant stream of raiders. So new construction began near the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; on the island. This was far enough inland that only &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s could harass the base, and those were taken care of by numerous &lt;a href=\"guard%20tower\"&gt;guard tower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAll the structures necessary to develop &lt;a href=\"dragon%20roost\"&gt;dragon roost&lt;/a&gt;s were built first. Four roosts were launching the terrible beasts into the air. Once they had eight of them flying, their first targets were the numerous enemy troops stationed near the center of the island. For some odd reason the Alliance forces never organized a land attack. Next came their navy, which never stood a chance as it was destroyed by so many firebreathers flying together. Though the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; managed to bring down a few, they were replaced quickly. The assault continued with the removal of their &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;s. A protective circle of guard towers made the attacks on the center of the capital prohibitively expensive, but little was left to hinder an amphibious landing.\nWhile the dragons incinerated towers and cleared a wide section of the coastline for landing, the rest of the Horde forces constructed a shipyard and accompanying structures to produce two &lt;a href=\"Transport%20ship\"&gt;transports&lt;/a&gt;. These made a standard assault on the mainland with four catapults, seven ogres and a single &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt; to raise a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons then concentrated on mobile units, while the catapults methodically removed stationary targets near shore and later focused on the guard towers so the reptiles could focus on the interior. Utok was sure it would be an easy victory, and that it was the Horde's destiny to devour the world.\nHorde victory (ending).\nOrcs and forest trolls entered the Capital City. They killed every human they found and proceeded to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity%23The%20Throne%20Room\"&gt;Throne Room&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate King Terenas, then red dragons burned down the &lt;a href=\"castle\"&gt;castle&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Arthas wasted no time in fortifying his position to the southwest of the city. Sylvanas then set up her own base across the river from Arthas' right flank and began leading strikes against the Undead. \nAs the battle began outside the Undead base, word reached Arthas that Sylvanas was sending runners (by foot for some reason) to alert Silvermoon of the attack and summon reinforcements. Arthas however, had anticipated this and positioned Gargoyles along the roadways. The flying beasts quickly and easily slew every runner sent, keeping Silvermoon in the dark and ensuring that Sylvanas would receive no reinforcements. \nAfter beating back several assaults by Sylvanas, Arthas advanced his forces to the bridge between his and Sylvanas' camps where fierce fighting ensued. After a brief yet bloody stalemate, the Scourge gained the upper hand. As the attacks began to wind down, Arthas and his forces charged into Sylvanas' camp, slaughtering all in their way. Sylvanas' warriors fought bravely to the last man, but were inevitably overwhelmed. As her base crumbled around her, Sylvanas was personally approached by Arthas. Before she could load her bow, the Death Knight cut her down. In sadistic retribution for resisting him so fiercely, Arthas transformed Sylvanas into a banshee, binding her to the Lich King's will. \nWith the Ranger Corps destroyed, nothing stood between the Scourge and Silvermoon. Arthas and his forces regrouped, reinforced and marched on the city's gates. As the Undead approached, &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk%20rider\"&gt;dragonhawk rider&lt;/a&gt;s plummeted down upon the Scourge and rained missiles upon them, inflicting heavy casualties. Yet even these elite warriors fell victim to Arthas' &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Fiend\"&gt;Crypt Fiend&lt;/a&gt;s who ensnared them in webbing and forced them to the ground where they were easily destroyed by Scourge warriors. Entering the city itself, the Undead encountered fanatic last-ditch resistance from the elves. Yet despite their fury, they could not hold back the dead, who rolled over them like a wave of carnage. Even the powerful arcane constructs built to protect the Sunwell could not hold out for long against the horrid wave of Undead. As the final defenders were wiped out, Arthas placed Kel'thuzad's remains in the Sunwell, resurrecting him as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; and fouling the well. Quel'Thalas had ceased to exist as a nation.\nBriefly...\nA few lucky elves managed to evade their undead pursuers and escape into the wilds. These hardy survivors would eventually band together under Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and become the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nDuring \"Reforged\", the entire map has been revamped and several changes have been made.

Only the troublesome &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; defenders of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; remain to be dealt with before sending the Horde on its next sojourn. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Human fleet&lt;/a&gt; has captured a group of our &lt;a href=\"Transport%20ship\"&gt;Transports&lt;/a&gt; just south of Stromgarde. Recapture these vessels and then lay waste to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;their capital&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Utok%20Scratcher\"&gt;Utok Scratcher&lt;/a&gt;'s unit first called in the &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; from the west, gathering them together before concentrating on the two approaching enemy &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt;. With all four intact, they sailed into the harbor and quickly boarded the transports, reclaiming them. The inland troops then marched north, leaving the workers behind, and fought a path to the waiting transports while the destroyers lingered near shore for &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; support. With all units safely aboard, the flotilla sailed north and landed on the east side of a large island, killing the defenders there and bringing down a tower that guarded a &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;. The destroyers continued north and west around the tip of the island, heading for an enemy &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt; to destroy it. Enemy destroyers attempted to stop them, but their tight formation eliminated them one at a time with combined fire. The platform was removed and a destroyer sat directly on the oil to prevent construction of a new one. The Stromic naval power was crippled, leaving the Horde force plenty of time to build up safely on the island.\nWhile they were removing the wall around the mine entirely to make room for the workers, a &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; went up as close as possible to it. Then they began cutting &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; on the south side of the western forest. &lt;a href=\"Pig%20farm\"&gt;Pig farm&lt;/a&gt;s were next for the training of more slaves, and a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Troll%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; was constructed near the forest with all available workers helping. With a growing force of laborers, soon they also had a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; in operation. To fortify their base, farms were constructed on the north side, with &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s behind them to fend off occasional raids. Next, they fortified the hall with &lt;a href=\"Stronghold\"&gt;stone and iron&lt;/a&gt;, then built a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; on the east shore near some &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;. Preparations for their invasion continued with an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt;; then a &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; allowed construction of more ships. With all necessary structures in place, they spent extra time and gold to upgrade their weapons and armor for soldier and ship alike and gathered their forces to make the assault.\nA flotilla of four destroyers and two transports sailed out, carrying seven ogres, four catapults, and a &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;. The destroyers cleared the way for a landing on the west side of the enemy; the worker set up a makeshift barracks on the enemy soil while the army stood guard. When the attack commenced, the catapults removed defensive structures from a distance; the troops were constantly ordered to stay near them. Slowly they leveled the city from west to east, replacing fallen ogres as necessary. Their shipyards fell last to the catapult, as well as their ships anchored in the harbor. Had they not placed a barracks on the island, it would have been much harder to ferry replacements in. The invasion was deemed a major success. Fear and honor were heaped on the name of Utok's commander. Utok believed the tide of war was slowly turning in the Horde's favor.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

After his death, Varedis was revived by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and convinced to join the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nVaredis was one of five warriors sent to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; to be trained as demon hunters - the first time that &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were allowed to do so. Illidan put the blood elves through excruciating trials that would have defeated most fully trained demon hunters. Three of the blood elves died during the training, and a &lt;a href=\"Leotheras%20the%20Blind\"&gt;fourth&lt;/a&gt; was driven to insanity. Varedis was the only one to succeed. Varedis turned out to be something of a prodigy; not only had he succeeded in his training, but he was displaying better command of his powers than many veteran demon hunters. Illidan saw the great potential in him and assigned three master demon hunters to train him further. Within a year, Varedis had surpassed them.\nVaredis's most fateful mission was a solo task. Illidan had heard reports that the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; were active on Outland. Varedis was dispatched to scout for and steal any information he could find. Varedis snuck into a cave complex inhabited by Shadow Council acolytes without being noticed, and there he found the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Fel%20Names\"&gt;Book of Fel Names&lt;/a&gt;. Inside was priceless information about the nature of demons, their weaknesses, and their habits. The tome contained within it tremendous power and it was impossible to remove due to Shadow Council enchantments. So Varedis absorbed as much of the book's essence as he could and left as quickly as he came. The Shadow Council had no idea he had ever been there. Illidan praised him for his achievement, and Varedis's pride swelled. The Illidari demon hunters whispered that Varedis actually infiltrated the Council and stole the book which is apparently not true. Varedis enjoyed his heightened power for years, becoming a stinging thorn in the Burning Legions' side. He could sense the movement of demons before he saw it happen and knew what they were thinking before they acted. But Varedis had not stolen the book's power, only become linked to it.\nAt one point, a felguard that the young demon hunters trained on broke free in the corridors of Karabor and Varedis put the demon down. Among his known students were &lt;a href=\"Vandel\"&gt;Vandel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ravael\"&gt;Ravael&lt;/a&gt;. Varedis accompanied his master and the new demon hunters on a mission in &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Alliance and Horde came to Outland they stole the Book of Fel Names with the aid of the former Illidari &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis the Sufferer&lt;/a&gt;, and this would prove to be Varedis's undoing. During the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Varedis was one of many Illidari who stood in the heroes' way. But to his surprise, his foes destroyed the Book of Fel Names page by page, and Varedis was stunned to realize the book's destruction weakened him. His borrowed power quickly faded and he was slain. His fellow demon hunter &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; mourns his passing, and holds Altruis responsible for his death.\nJoining the Burning Legion.\nAfter Varedis was killed, his demonic soul entered the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; where he was found by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Kil'jaeden heaped endless torment upon Varedis, who resisted for a time, but it was not pain that broke his spirit. The Deceiver played upon his shock from the battle at the Black Temple. Champions had been prepared to face Varedis and known to use the Book of Fel Names, so who had told them of that power? Varedis knew it would not have been the Burning Legion or the Shadow Council, as they would have preferred the book to remain intact. Kil'jaeden convinced Varedis that it could only have been the Illidari, who knew of his power and betrayed him.\nWith the help of other &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden conducted a dangerous, agonizing ritual, infusing a small part of his soul into Varedis's spirit. When the ritual was complete, Varedis was not a demon hunter but a demon, loyal to the Burning Legion and hungry for vengeance. Varedis found that his weapons, now the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, had also been changed. The ritual had imbued them with another slice of Kil'jaeden's astonishing power.\nIn the years after Varedis's conversion, he became a terror to all who might oppose the Burning Legion. Worlds, cities, and innocents fell before him. He usually worked quietly and secretly, for the Legion did not want Azeroth to know his true potential. But he was allowed some satisfaction from time to time: hunting the Illidari who had escaped imprisonment by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; after Illidan's death. They had fled to the far corners of Azeroth and Outland, and Varedis had been dispatched to hunt them down one by one. It was a task he relished, for in his mind they had betrayed him.\nLegion.\nVaredis is one of the many demons summoned by in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to attack the forces of Azeroth in the climactic, disastrous battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaredis confronts the Illidari at &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and is defeated in combat, but &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; commands him to return to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; before he is killed. The &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; are taken from him by a demon hunter &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. After the demon hunters re-recruit &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, images of Varedis and &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; appear on the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" and they invite the demon hunters to join the Legion, though Varedis hopes they will refuse so he can kill them and get his glaives back.\nThe Illidari discover that Caria and Varedis are on the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; and invade it with the \"Fel Hammer\".

Spending all (or half) of ones DKP on a single item can be very expensive. Since all items basically cost the same, people may be reluctant to spend their points on marginal upgrades, if a larger upgrade is within reach."}

{"id": "730683", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=730683", "title": "Varian's compass", "text": "Varian's compass is a compass that was gifted to &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, by his son, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The exterior is made of brass and inlaid with intricate filigree, with a lid featuring a lion's head. Set into the lid is a miniature portrait of Anduin as a child. The compass holds deep personal meaning to Anduin.\nHistory.\nAnduin had the compass crafted for Varian's birthday a few months before the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarian brought the compass with him aboard the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Oath\"&gt;Lion's Oath&lt;/a&gt;\" during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. When the gunship crashed into the sea at the start of the battle, the compass fell out of the king's satchel and sank into the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Depths\"&gt;Forlorn Depths&lt;/a&gt;, where it remained while Varian fought in the battle and was ultimately killed by .\nWhen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s returned to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; hero found the battered compass at the bottom of the sea. Its glass face had been shattered, its needle bent, and its paint waterlogged, but the portrait was still recognizable as Anduin. The adventurer brought the trinket back to Anduin in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He realized that he hadn't had time to mourn Varian and thanked the hero for returning the compass, saying that it served as a reminder of how much he missed his father. The event sent Anduin into a deep melancholy which only ended when the adventurer accompanied him on a journey to help him accept the duties of a king. Anduin subsequently kept the compass in his private quarters in Stormwind Keep, alongside the box holding &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;his mother&lt;/a&gt;'s engagement and wedding rings.\nAnduin carried the compass with him into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where he was &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Dominated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and forced to serve him. Prior to the Jailer's attack on the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin secretly used the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to enchant the compass, imbuing it with a memory of a conversation between him and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in which he expressed a final message to his friends: that he hoped they would remember him the way he'd been, not what Sylvanas and the Jailer had made him become. After the Jailer destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in the Crucible, he opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and commanded Anduin to follow him. Anduin managed to resist the Jailer's control just enough to drop the compass on the ground before he disappeared through the gateway, allowing &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to pick it up. She and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; brought the item back to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;, where she, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; magically examined it and unlocked the memory. This caused them to realize that some part of Anduin was still free of the Jailer's Domination and that there was still hope of saving him."}

During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; when Varian was a young boy, his father &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; was murdered and Stormwind was sacked by the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. His guardian and regent &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; gathered the survivors and sailed to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was formed. The Alliance defeated the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and Stormwind was reclaimed, though at the cost of Lothar's life. Varian was crowned King of Stormwind and stood by &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron as the Alliance began to fracture, but soon faced many internal problems. He was to blame for failing to reach a settlement between the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt; who rebuilt Stormwind and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, which led to a riot in which his wife &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin&lt;/a&gt; was killed. While on a diplomatic mission to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Varian was abducted by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the Stonemasons, and went missing.\nHe had managed to escape from the Defias but was suffering from memory loss and soon after enslaved by the Horde and became a gladiator in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt;, teamed with &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;. The trio won the Crimson Ring tournament in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, for which Varian was given the &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt; moniker \"Lo'Gosh\" \u2014 meaning \"Ghost Wolf\". After escaping his slavers, Varian discovered he was the missing King of Stormwind and his advisor Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; broodmother &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; in disguise, who had manipulated the Defias and Nobles dispute, was behind Varian's kidnapping and created a duplicate of him using dark magic. With the help of his comrades, he was able to recover his true identity and finally defeat Onyxia.\nUnder his daring leadership, the humans of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; led the Alliance to victory against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of Highlord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and Alliance forces at the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, Varian declared &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and sought to bolster their strategic holdings against their perennial enemy. Known for his tenacity and fierce will, King Varian Wrynn was committed to protecting the Alliance's interests and raising his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; to follow in his place. With the world plunged into chaos by the great &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he earned the respect of the night elves, dwarves, and other Alliance races and took up military leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as High King, vowing to forge a new destiny for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The war with the Horde was finally brought to an end following the victory in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeading the Alliance armies against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Varian fell in battle at the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificing himself to allow the Alliance forces to escape. Before staying behind to fight, Varian entrusted &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; with a letter to his son Anduin, advising him that one must be willing to fight in order to preserve peace. In the aftermath of the battle, he was succeeded by Anduin as King of Stormwind and High King of the Alliance.\nVarian served as one of the main protagonists in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise. \nBiography.\nThe First War.\nVarian Wrynn was born to King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; by Queen &lt;a href=\"Taria%20Wrynn\"&gt;Taria Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; ten years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and as a youth lived a joyful and prosperous life as prince of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. He would train in horse riding and learning how to fight. But all that changed when the orcs appeared from beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to destroy his homeland, thus ushering in the First War between his beloved Kingdom of Azeroth and the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, the Champion of Stormwind, rallied his countrymen and armies and gutted out a desperate attempt to hold the Horde at bay and to keep them away from King Llane, Prince Varian, and Stormwind. While Lothar enjoyed some small success in holding back the Horde, his efforts were dashed when &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, who had become an ally to Stormwind, betrayed King Llane under orders from the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; in the year 3. Varian could only watch helplessly as his father was murdered and the Horde overran his kingdom, burning its homes and slaughtering all who stood in their way. The death of his father affected Varian greatly; Garona's actions forever tainted the prince's perception of the orcs, and he would view them as a deceitful and murderous people. His later closest friend &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; recalled him looking weary and ragged when he first saw him and said that he'd \"lost absolutely everything but his life.\"\nExodus to Lordaeron.\nAnduin Lothar, convinced that Stormwind could not be retaken, gathered Varian, Queen Taria, and all who remained in the city and led an escape from their homeland. While they narrowly &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;escaped&lt;/a&gt; by boat into the sea, the Queen and many others were lost in the fighting to reach the harbor. They headed North while Lothar gathered his thoughts aboard his ship. Consulting with Varian and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, they determined that in order to preserve humanity from annihilation by the Horde they would need to warn King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, of the danger that loomed on the horizon.\nAfter landing at the port of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar gathered Prince Varian along with Khadgar and several knights and marched towards Lordaeron. Upon arriving, young Varian was greeted by King Terenas, who treated him as an equal king despite Varian's young age. King Terenas quickly offered him his pledge to stand by him until his homeland was retaken and invited him to stay with him for as long as he was willing. Although at first Varian was slightly shy being in a Kingdom he had never seen before, he quickly overcame his timidity and Varian found King Terenas' son Arthas Menethil, who was just a few years younger than he, as a great new friend and the two quickly formed a close friendship. Shortly after the people of Stormwind reached Lordaeron, King Terenas \u2014 at Lothar's urging \u2014 gathered all the leaders of the other human kingdoms together at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the leaders at the council grew divided as &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; threatened to abandon the council out of fear of losing their regional power to unity, the venerated priest &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; brought Varian to his side and called upon the kings to cease quarreling over meaningless issues. If they did not, he announced, then every kingdom would be destroyed and every city would be burned as Stormwind had been, and their children would be orphaned like Varian if they even survived at all. Turalyon argued that if humanity failed to unite they would be remembered as a people that could've saved &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; but were too proud to put aside political ambitions, yet if humanity did form an alliance they could change history and become the guardians of Azeroth. These words saw the Council of Seven Nations erupt into applause, even from Greymane and Perenolde, and resulted in a unanimous vote to form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the command of Anduin Lothar, its supreme commander, this alliance was finally able to put an end to the Horde reign during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. However, the victory came at a great price as Anduin Lothar was killed shortly before the war ended and would not live to see the retaking of his Kingdom of Stormwind.\nFriendship with Arthas.\nAfter taking up shelter in Lordaeron, Varian quickly became friends with Arthas Menethil who was anxious to meet another young prince. Though most of the time he kept his composure, Varian once broke into tears as Arthas tried to console him about the assassination of his father. He was later recalled by Arthas as his \"best friend\" for much of their childhood and adult lives, and Varian frequently sparred with the less-athletic Arthas in an attempt to toughen him and make him a better &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;. They built up a friendly rivalry. Many years later, Varian attended Arthas' ascension to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and sparred with him. Though not outwardly spiteful, Arthas frequently lamented that he was not as physically strong as Varian. During the later murder of King Terenas, Arthas recalled words that Varian once said about how King Llane was \"stabbed right through the heart\" moments before he plunged &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; through his own father's heart. After Arthas' falling in with the Scourge and rise to become the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Varian began to see him as the ultimate traitor to the Alliance.\nRise as king.\nWith Stormwind retaken and slowly being rebuilt, thanks to the help of King Terenas who had urged the Alliance to help fund the rebuilding of Stormwind, Varian was officially crowned King of Stormwind by the age of eighteen. King Terenas himself was well-pleased with how Varian had grown into a clever and noble king, feeling a father's pride as he had grown attached to Varian over the years, considering Varian almost his second son. Varian was provided with experienced ministers and advisors by High General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to help secure his place as king. Turalyon also oversaw the repatriation of the citizens of Stormwind. The &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons\"&gt;Stonemasons&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, came to lend their help in rebuilding Stormwind and hoped to forge a new future for themselves, with aspirations that riches would soon follow their work's completion. Varian was present at &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; along with the other Alliance kings when Khadgar proposed rallying the Alliance army that would undertake the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his reign as king, Varian left &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; under the stewardship of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; and rode to the many corners of his kingdom to protect his people from raiding orc parties, meet with spies who were searching for the assassin &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, and direct the restoration of his kingdom. After many months Stormwind was finished, reborn as a kingdom of majesty and architectural brilliance eclipsing even its once-pristine condition before the First War. It was during this time of renewed tranquility in Year 15 that Varian married a young, beautiful woman named &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian\"&gt;Tiffin Ellerian&lt;/a&gt; and conceived a son, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, named for Lothar.\nHowever, the Alliance soon began fracturing, and the elven kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, along with the human kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; seceded. Despite this, King Varian vowed he would stand by King Terenas and the Alliance as they had stood by him in his time of need. It was also during this time that the Stonemasons who had rebuilt Stormwind demanded to be paid for their service to King Varian and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;. However, the corrupt House of Nobles, under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, refused to adequately pay the guild for its work. King Varian was unable to negotiate a resolution that appeased both parties. It is suspected that Lady Katrana had ensorcelled half the House of Nobles and half the Stonemasons and because of this, both sides refused to begrudge their positions: with the House of Nobles only offering meager compensation while the Stonemasons continued to demand extravagant sums. However, even Varian does not doubt that some Stormwind nobles were just irredeemably corrupt.\n notes that the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. The massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy and stripped &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and his Stonemasons of their promised rewards. Edwin VanCleef and the Stonemasons set to rioting in the streets of Stormwind, demanding just compensation. The riot was dangerous and chaotic and in the confusion Varian's young queen was accidentally killed when a large rock hit her upside the head. Varian vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, fleeing the city, hid in the rural areas of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. VanCleef fled Stormwind with the Stonemasons, while Varian mourned Tiffin's death. He subsequently fell into a great depression that was ensorcelled to span a decade; all throughout the duration of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. During which, Lady Katrana took advantage of his ensorcelled state to politically outmaneuver him but over time, he fought off the magical effects and regained his consciousness and will. Varian soon reasserted his control over the Stormwind government and vowed to create a new and better world for himself, his son, and the people of Stormwind. At one point, Varian did battle with an assassin who had snuck into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; and nearly stabbed Anduin.\nBefore the Third War, he was using the 's elite, &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt;, to spy on the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Varian bestowed him the title of baron, but Reigol continued to serve him in missions. At the start of the Third War, Varian wondered whether Reigol would finally retire, but the rogue returned to Lordaeron to investigate the plague of undeath.\nAbduction.\nAfter the dust had settled from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Varian journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; regarding &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; relations. En route, he was abducted by the &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; who had been told of his diplomatic trip through a spy rumored to live within the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; itself. Rumors circulated that he was taken to &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; and was held captive there.\nWhile trapped on Alcaz Island Varian would eventually be tied to the ground as cloaked figures began dark magic causing him unbearable pain as he desperately tried to break himself free. In a blinding flash of light he would awaken to find himself laying next to an exact duplicate. &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; unmasked herself intending to kill the strong-willed Varian but is stopped by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; and her naga. The cloaked figures and Onyxia turn into dragonkin and battle the naga while the strong-willed Varian breaks himself free and begins to fight. He tried to free the other Varian and implores him to find a weapon but discovered his other is too unnerved to properly wield a weapon.\nThe other Varian is knocked off a cliff, falls into the ocean and is captured by the naga. Varian is left alone to fight and tricks Onyxia into believing she had killed him. Pleased, Onyxia left before more naga appeared. Morgala attempted to capture Varian but he fled to another side of the island and jumped into the ocean, knowing he wouldn't be followed as that part of the ocean contained many rocky shoals. His escape failed, however, as the strong tide overpowered him and he was swept away to the shores of Durotar.\nAfter King Varian Wrynn went missing under suspicious circumstances while en route to a diplomatic summit to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind was believed to be going through a state of disarray. Young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; was given the crown so that order could be preserved within the kingdom of Stormwind, at the behest of the royal councilor, &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; acted as a kind of Regent of Stormwind or the Supreme Commander of Stormwind's forces on behalf of King Anduin, with Lady Prestor advising Bolvar on the proper use of Stormwind's resources.\nGladiator.\nHalf-drowned and suffering from memory loss, he was found washed up on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; by a caravan of orcs led by the gladiator trainer &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;. After successfully fighting off an enormous crocolisk using only a stick, he was captured and enslaved as a gladiator by the impressed shaman. Unaware of the human's true identity, Earthfury humorously nicknamed his new slave \"Croc-Bait\" and threw him into a cage with his other two gladiator slaves: &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;. That night, in order to help him remember his past, Broll placed Varian in a trance, wherein he saw a vision of himself as a child in a &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;burning city&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter arriving in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Rehgar started training his team. Rehgar taught the three gladiators new ways to kill as well as strategy in single and team combat. While in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; - the Crimson Ring's secret training grounds - Varian refused to engage in combat for the amusement of the orcs. Though the orcs in the training grounds labeled him a troublemaker, Rehgar permitted his disobedience and allowed him to watch on as his partners trained. It was only when Valeera was drawn into a fight with &lt;a href=\"Sparkeye\"&gt;Sparkeye&lt;/a&gt;'s gladiator team, did Varian pick up a sword to defend his team mates. Though Varian's team emerged victorious from the battle, they were left injured and exhausted from their fight. Rehgar offered no respite as he permitted &lt;a href=\"Hyku%20Steeledge\"&gt;Hyku Steeledge&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of their weakened state and attack them. With both his team mates defenseless, Varian engaged Hyku Steeledge in single combat and slew him. From that battle, Varian learned to always expect the unexpected in the Crimson Ring and following the rules of combat, inherited Hyku's twin orc blades.\nRehgar later led the trio to the secret armory of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Legends\"&gt;Hall of Legends&lt;/a&gt;, where after seeing a familiar-looking lion-headed plate belt, Varian received another flashback: a &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;bald, bearded man&lt;/a&gt; stands on the deck of a boat in a storm, wearing the belt and called Varian \"lad\".\nEventually, the three traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; in Feralas where the gladiatorial contests took place. After many bloody battles, they emerged the victors of the Crimson Ring tournament. Impressed by Varian's skill at arms, the crowd gave him the &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt; moniker \"Lo'Gosh\" \u2014 which means \"Ghost Wolf\".\nAfter the tournament, Rehgar took Lo'Gosh and Broll to the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; city &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, where they were both permitted to undergo a cleansing ritual in the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt; that would reveal more about the gladiators' pasts and guide them to their futures. In the waters of the pools, Lo'Gosh saw another vision: a fair-haired female who was ostensibly his wife holding an infant boy, telling him that his people and his son need him. Unfortunately, his vision was interrupted by a cave elemental that had been haunting the pools of vision, a foe which he subsequently defeated. Nevertheless, having learned more of his past, he planned to escape from Rehgar at the next possible opportunity.\nIn thanks for defeating the cave elemental, Broll and Lo'Gosh were invited to the tent of &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, elder druid of the tauren. He told Varian the legend of the original &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a massive, white wolf-beast renowned for its ferocity in battle, already 10,000 years old when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;first invaded&lt;/a&gt; Azeroth. According to the arch druid, the wolf's legend extended through Azeroth to trolls, goblins and dwarves who all had their own version of the story. In each tale, Lo'Gosh's unyielding will and sheer ferocity enabled him to push through the boundaries of the afterlife to aid his people. Hamuul then gave Lo'Gosh a feather, which Broll immediately recognized as belonging to a &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf used it to call &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt; from Ashenvale, and immediately made a bid for freedom with Lo'Gosh.\nBroll and Lo'Gosh later went on more heroic exploits: they've helped the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; defeat the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; and recovered the missing &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, they journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, where after they've relinquished the Idol of Remulos to Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, they were summoned to dinner by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande, who after hearing of the two friends' feats and current predicament, sent the two to Theramore. There she hoped Jaina Proudmoore would be able to help restore Lo'Gosh's memories.\nUpon arriving in Theramore, Jaina vowed to Lo'Gosh that she would unravel the mystery surrounding him, and called upon her chamberlain, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, to help. Breaching the dark aura surrounding Lo'Gosh's memories, visions revealed a fire and a voyage, the birth of his son, the death of his wife, and new darkness. Despite an invisible wall preventing Jaina and Aegwynn from further delving into his memories, they were able to confirm that he had been traveling to Theramore and that he was, in fact, Varian Wrynn, the lost King of Stormwind.\nClearly having been the victim of a dark magic attack, Jaina prepared one of her own ships to carry Lo'Gosh to Stormwind in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, where she hoped that he could learn the identity of his enemies. Now knowing that his wife is dead, Lo'Gosh was eager to return to Stormwind and reunite with his son, though Aegwynn advised him that circumspection was necessary, as Anduin could be endangered by any hasty actions. On the docks, Broll and Lo'Gosh reunited with Valeera and prepared to set out for Stormwind.\nRevelations.\nWhile Lo'Gosh, Broll, and Valeera were traveling on the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavecutter\"&gt;Wavecutter&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2014 Jaina Proudmoore's private vessel \u2014 Lo'Gosh contemplated the revelations Jaina had told him. Despite being revealed as one of the rulers of the Alliance, he became unsure if he truly wanted to resume being \"Varian Wrynn\" \u2014 if he had a choice, he would remain as \"Lo'Gosh\", a simple &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;. Doubts began to fill Lo'Gosh's head as they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the voyage, their vessel was attacked by &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt;. The fight between Lo'Gosh and the &lt;a href=\"naga%20siren\"&gt;siren&lt;/a&gt; was brutal and during the bout a flash of lightning from the naga's blade left his notable crossed facial scars. Lo'Gosh also had another glimpse into his lost memory \u2014 remembering the Defias abducting him on his diplomatic mission to Theramore, the naga attacking him on Alcaz Island for ransom, the funeral for his beloved wife Tiffin, and the day he was crowned King of Stormwind. Almost all of Lo'Gosh's memory had been returned, except some vital parts of his abduction. Varian then declared himself to be the King of Stormwind and that no one will keep him from his people before cutting Morgala in half.\nMeanwhile in Stormwind, jubilant throngs of Stormwind's subjects turned out for a massive ceremony to welcome home their king. However, the Varian that returned was arrogant, frivolous, and markedly interested in Katrana Prestor. The people of Stormwind had only been informed that the Defias had ransomed the king, but in truth, he was somehow imprisoned and ransomed back by some naga. In either case, his freedom was bought and paid for by a special tax. Upon his return, however, Varian seemed concerned only with spending more of his people's money, leaving affairs of state by the wayside. Anduin Wrynn was distressed by his father's change.\nAround the same time, Lo'Gosh appeared at Menethil Harbor with Broll and Valeera. The group had a chance encounter with a &lt;a href=\"Tapoke%20%22Slim%22%20Jahn\"&gt;drunkard&lt;/a&gt; in Menethil Harbor, who ran after realizing that Varian was still alive. Lo'Gosh and his companions gave chase with the intent of interrogating the man. The man ran to a bar filled with Defias members, who attempted to take out Varian again, resulting in a chaotic bar brawl. During the fight, Lo'Gosh met &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;: an emissary from &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and brother of &lt;a href=\"Hjalmar%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Hjalmar&lt;/a&gt;, whom Varian had trained under.\nThough the drunk escaped, Lo'Gosh found a dying Defias mage to question. Though the mage did not reveal who wanted Varian dead, the mage did say that their employer had paid in Stormwind gold. In his final moments, the mage taunted Lo'Gosh by claiming that his son would be murdered. The three gladiators and Thargas then continued on their way to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;; a perilous journey beset by dangerous &lt;a href=\"Vendellin%20Soulfire\"&gt;assassins&lt;/a&gt; and violent encounters with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Lo'Gosh and his entourage went on the become instrumental in the reclaiming of the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; Bridges which were being occupied by Dark Iron forces, although at the cost of Hjalmar's life. As fate would have it, their heroics at Thandol Span would lead them to encounter King Magni Bronzebeard, the dwarven king of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Lo'Gosh departed from Menethil Harbor, King Magni Bronzebeard was on a visit in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and was discussing war plans against the orcs and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; with King \"Varian\" and Bolvar Fordragon. However, Varian Wrynn was counseled by Lady Katrana Prestor to not send troops to help the dwarves fight against the Dark Irons. King Magni left disappointed in Varian's subservience to Lady Prestor's wishes and his dishonorable demeanor. While going to the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; to prepare his dwarven forces for the retaking of Thandol Span, Magni was met by the young Prince Anduin Wrynn who told the dwarven king that he too suspected something was amiss about his \"father\".\nSome time later, Anduin was practicing his archery with his \"father\" and he inquired Varian how he was kidnapped by the Defias. Anduin further questioned him how he later came into the hands of the naga for ransom, to which his father told him his past was a blank and he could not recall any events before his rescue. For his improvement in his archery, Varian granted Anduin one reward. Anduin requested that the details of Varian's disappearance be further investigated.\nUpon arriving at Ironforge, Lo'Gosh was informed by King Magni that much of what had transpired was no coincidence and that someone was secretly orchestrating the events, knowing of King Varian's significant importance to the Alliance. Magni had previously enlisted the aid of Highlord &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of young Anduin, who suspected the Varian in Stormwind to be an impostor. Varian, having studied sword fighting with Windsor for years, held a deep respect for him as a friend and ally. A disturbingly short time after Marshal Windsor began his investigation, he had come to the conclusion that the impostor Varian may not only be an impostor, but a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Lo'Gosh and Magni continued to converse they were secretly being followed by a &lt;a href=\"Kalaran\"&gt;bearded man&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera sensed arcane energy being manipulated and witnessed the man creating a dagger with the intent to kill Lo'Gosh. Valeera quickly subdued the man, but he transformed into a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; and fled.\nOutside Stormwind, Anduin, Varian, Bolvar, and Lady Prestor were riding horseback through the countryside with Anduin trying to implore his father to listen to Stormwind's problems, but before he could elaborate, his horse was purposely roused by an unknown assailant causing Anduin to lose control and tumble over a ledge. Varian swiftly caught Anduin, and upon making physical contact, his mind is enveloped with visions of the Defias carrying him while knocked out, strapped to the ground and covered in a rune-circle with robed figures casting dark magic, being chased on Alcaz Island by naga, and finally jumping over a cliff reaching for branches just beyond his reach.\nAnduin, embracing his father, lost any doubts about him being an imposter. Varian started to tell Bolvar, Anduin, and Lady Prestor about his visions until Lady Prestor touched him and remarked how astonished she was by his nobility. Bolvar surmised that Varian becomes befuddled when around her and loses his honor and respect for others. Bolvar becomes more anxious about discovering the secrets of Varian's abduction and sudden return; knowing this would lead to trouble.\nVia magic, Bolvar informed King Magni that Windsor's report indicated he was close to discovering the dragon's identity but was captured by Dark Iron dwarves in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. Lo'Gosh and his allies mounted and rode to Blackrock Depths and rescued Windsor, who revealed to Lo'Gosh what he had discovered regarding his investigation.\nReturn as King.\nMarching through the gates of Stormwind, Lo'Gosh and his friends were halted by &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; under the direct jurisdiction of Katrana Prestor, who ordered their immediate arrest and execution as traitors. Windsor succeeded in convincing Marcus of his loyalty to Stormwind as they had previously served together under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;.\nKatrana Prestor hastily gathered soldiers only to have the false-Varian tell her that she was disobeying the chain of command and was not in charge of Stormwind. Entering Stormwind Keep, Lo'Gosh declared Katrana's masquerade was over and called her by her true name: &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;.\nRevealing her dragon form and transforming multiple guards into &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, Lo'Gosh and his allies began battle in the great hall of Stormwind Keep. The arrival of Highlord Bolvar Fordragon along with Anduin greatly aided them in securing the keep but Reginald Windsor was killed moments later by Onyxia.\nLo'Gosh engaged his doppelganger, claiming he threatened the stability of his kingdom and nearly cost the Alliance Thandol Span, only to have his doppelganger retort he was starting to repress her spells and regain control of his actions. Anduin, surprised by seeing two Varians, urged them to stop fighting each other and face the true threat, the brood mother Onyxia. The great dragon snatched Anduin and teleported them to her lair; daring Varian to follow suit. Regrouping with their friends, Lo'Gosh and Varian were left to grieve the loss of their son. Lo'Gosh announced to their friends and allies that the final battle would end in &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelinquishing command of Stormwind to Bolvar, his old friend begins to sense that despite two Varians commanding Stormwind, they both carried polar opposite personalities. Lo'Gosh was incredibly anxious to find his son while showing incredible will in commanding his troops, while the other Varian was calm, passive and charming ever since ridding himself of Onyxia's influence.\nAfter journeying across the sea and dispatching some of Onyxia's &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt; assassins, Varian's forces finally arrived at Theramore. They all met up with Jaina Proudmoore and she told them she had discovered what dark magic was used on the two Varians from an old tome. Jaina came up with the theory that Onyxia greatly gained influence over Varian after his wife's death but periodically lost control as Varian's attachment to Anduin grew. Thus she attempted to reassert her control by using a spell that would not kill Varian but would remove and destroy his conscience, will, and responsibility.\nJaina cast enchantments around the two Varians that enabled them to recall the last part of their abduction \u2014 they were split into two people by a botched spell from &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. Under the guise of Katrana Prestor, Onyxia botched a spell on &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; that divided Varian into two different Varians. But before Onyxia's ritual could be completed, she was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt;, who attacked her. Moments later, the naga kidnapped both Varians, though the one that would be later known as Lo'Gosh jumped into the sea and escaped, the second being ransomed. The two Varians came to the startling conclusion they are both the same person and at the same time only half of what they should be. Jaina explained that although Onyxia's spell split them in half, they were both able to fight past the spell and regain who they truly were, even though they both lived as separate beings. One Varian became Lo'Gosh, the gladiator champion of the Crimson Ring and fought to regain his memories and birthright. The other Varian was ransomed and returned to Stormwind and was further ensorcelled by Onyxia. While bereft of will, he would break free once again. After a moment, Jaina unveiled two ancient elven swords: &lt;a href=\"Shalla%27tor\"&gt;Shalla'tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ellemayne\"&gt;Ellemayne&lt;/a&gt;; and presented them to the two kings. After receiving their new weapons, both Varians decreed retribution would finally be brought to Onyxia.\nCorruption ends.\nLeading a mounted charge, both Varians cut bloody swathes into Onyxia's &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; ranks. Jaina disabled the impeding magical barriers while Varian and his allies used steel and magic to slay Onyxia's brood. Eventually, they encountered the brood mother herself, with Anduin imprisoned under her iron grip. Onyxia held Anduin hostage, threatening to kill him if Varian didn't surrender Stormwind over to her. Anduin urged his father not to give in to her threats and Lo'Gosh agreed to fight and die with Anduin if need be. Lo'Gosh threw a knife at the dragon's claw to loosen her hold over Anduin. Anduin fell at a great height but was caught and saved by &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken his raven form to catch him mid-air. With Anduin's safety secured, the Stormwind army continued the battle.\nLeading an assault against Onyxia, both Varians engaged her in battle. Weapons and magic clashed with her numerous dragonkin with both sides determined to win. Onyxia cast a fear spell on Broll and tail swiped Jaina, removing them from the battle after growing agitated by their constant spellcasting.\nBecoming desperate to end the fight, Onyxia began casting the spell she was going to use on Alcaz Island to kill Lo'Gosh, but Lo'Gosh's double responded by stepping in front of the blast, saying he should die because Lo'Gosh was the embodiment of the true Varian.\nNot willing to sacrifice his double, Lo'Gosh leapt alongside his other self hoping to save him. The magic spell became disrupted by having the two Varians in the spell, and after a moment of silence Varian emerged, his two halves fused back together.\nOnyxia desperately tries to incinerate him, but Varian swiftly reached Onyxia's head and impaled her with his newly-fused elven sword, &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt;. With Onyxia dead, Varian reunited with his son and friends, telling them their long and noble deeds will be rewarded and Stormwind has been reborn with a new hope for the future. King Varian then decapitated Onyxia and sent her head to be hung from the ramparts of Stormwind while &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; summoned roots from the ground to seal her lair's entrance and to kill her unhatched progeny.\nTheramore peace summit.\nWhile returning to Theramore, Varian was asked by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the orc Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; so that they may discuss plans to ease tensions between the Horde and Alliance. Varian however, was still wary of orcs for their role in Stormwind's destruction during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and didn't trust them to be true allies; yet Jaina assured him that Thrall was someone she trusted with her life. Though he was content with just Stormwind and the Horde no longer being in a state of open war and reluctant to enforce such a peace, he was convinced by Anduin and Valeera to attend citing that a human-orc alliance may benefit Stormwind's prosperity.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Varian and Thrall had a peaceful discussion with an eye toward mutual gain. They first talked of their pasts and then discussed resource problems; like the Horde's war against the night elves for lumber. Varian offered to provide Thrall's people with lumber and in exchange, the Warchief offered copper and exotic hides in return. Varian had to end the summit early as &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were reported to be under simultaneous distress by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall and Varian were about to depart amicably but upon exiting Theramore, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; invaded the city. The Alliance races of the Twilight cultists attacked the Horde representatives while the Horde races of the Twilight cultists attacked the Alliance representatives. After catching a glimpse of &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, Varian thought that Thrall had sent her to assassinate him as the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; had done in the past with &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; After a time battling, the Twilight's Hammer's casualties began to rise. Varian was about to strike a mortal blow to Garona when &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; entered to protect his mother. Varian tossed Med'an aside and was captured by a retreating &lt;a href=\"Stasia\"&gt;Stasia&lt;/a&gt; who left Garona to die at the hands of their targets. Garrosh accused the Alliance of orchestrating the attack while Varian accused the Horde; specifically &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;. Though Varian was suspicious of the Horde's involvement with the attack, he decided to investigate and reveal the true motives and conspirators of the attack by interrogating Garona himself. Yet Garona was ensorcelled with magic that made her believe that she had planned the assassination out of her own volition. All that Varian managed to get from her was that her mission was not only to assassinate him but his son, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, as well. Varian enraged, was on the verge of dispatching Garona once again only to be stopped by Jaina this time, who had claimed Garona as Theramore's prisoner.\nBefore Varian left Theramore to prepare his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, he was convinced by &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; to let her remain in Theramore and work with the ensorcelled Garona to reveal Garona's masters and deal with the threats to Varian and Anduin's safety. Varian declared he will no longer attend any more peace summits and that after the threat of the Scourge has been dealt with, he will return to Theramore to claim Garona for execution.\nReturn to Stormwind.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke, he sent his Scourge into all corners of Azeroth. To defeat the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and necropolises, members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Shattrath and created an artifact of the Naaru's Light. Adventurers of the Alliance delivered it to Varian for defense.\nSoon after regaining his throne, &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Stormwind was attacked by the undead legions of the Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Varian, alongside his friend &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, was successful in repelling the undead forces after a long battle in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Founding the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to contend with the Horde and lead the Alliance in destroying the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Varian sent Bolvar to oversee the creation of a &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Hold\"&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, right in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nDeath Knight.\nAfter being directly approached by &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"To%20King%20Varian%20Wrynn%20of%20the%20Alliance\"&gt;personal request&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian permits &lt;a href=\"death%20knights\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance to aid in the fight against the Lich King.\nBattle for the Undercity.\nAfter receiving word of Bolvar's death, Varian was overwhelmed with anger and sorrow, having considered Bolvar a brother for ruling his kingdom and raising his son during his absence. He sent Jaina Proudmoore to Orgrimmar to discover the reason for the Horde's betrayal. He deemed this as an act of treachery and demanded retribution for his friend's death. Jaina returned and informed Varian that &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; had betrayed them all and the Horde no longer controlled &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarian and Jaina gathered the Alliance army and attacked Undercity, hoping to reclaim it as Lordaeron for the Alliance and bring &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt; to justice. When entering Undercity, Varian becomes disgusted by the condition of the once-great city, which he knew since childhood. Tracking Putress to the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt;, Varian and Jaina defeated him. But to Varian's horror, they also discovered dozens of mutilated and defiled human corpses, on which the Apothecary Society experimented on to create the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that, although the Alliance and Horde agreed to a small truce over the years, the Forsaken had been secretly creating a means to kill them all.\nVarian confronts Thrall and declares that peace can never be achieved. When a fight breaks out between the Alliance and Horde, Jaina stops Thrall and Varian from killing each other and teleports Varian, herself, and the Alliance army back to Stormwind, hoping to stop further bloodshed and chaos. After losing his friend Bolvar Fordragon, and defeating Grand Apothecary Putress, Varian appears to declare war against the Horde during the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;The Battle For The Undercity&lt;/a&gt; after the attack on Thrall and his forces in the Undercity.\nSecrets of Ulduar.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; learns that &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; has escaped its ancient prison in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and Jaina Proudmoore request aid from King Varian, and so he asks for them to meet in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. While Rhonin is speaking with King Varian, Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; arrive at the citadel and disregard Jaina's warnings to not enter the tower.\nBefore Rhonin is able to explain Varian turns and sees Thrall and Garrosh demanding to know what they are doing there. Garrosh insults Varian and draws his weapons, and Varian does the same before Garrosh charges at him, knocking Jaina out of the way in the process. After Rhonin breaks the fight up, he calls upon the Horde and Alliance to work together against the Old God. Varian points out that more men died from the Horde's treachery at the Wrathgate than from the Scourge, and refuses to ally with them. Telling Thrall and Garrosh \"may this &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;death god&lt;/a&gt; take you all,\" he promptly teleported out with his men.\nCrusaders' Coliseum.\nKing Varian, accompanied by Jaina Proudmoore, attends tournaments at the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by various champions and representatives of the Alliance.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nVarian, again accompanied by Jaina, appears in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; during the Alliance outro following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; attempts to block &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; from claiming the body of his son, but Varian intervenes on the High Overlord's behalf, voicing his respect and honor for fellow warriors, and allows him to pass.\nSome time after the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwing%20Halls\"&gt;Frostwing Halls&lt;/a&gt;, Varian can also be found in the entry hall of &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. He provides the &lt;a href=\"Strength%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;Strength of Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; buff for Alliance raiding parties. If you speak to him and tell him he is not needed, you will need to reset the instance (provided you are not already saved to it) in order to gain the buff again.\nStormrage.\nSometime after the defeat of the Lich King, Stormwind was being attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; corruption. Varian was able to escape its corruption using an anti-dreaming potion. Yet to his horror, he was unable to save his son Anduin, who was one of many consumed by the Emerald Nightmare mist. At some point, he was visited by his old friend &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;, and the orc &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;. When he saw Thura he wanted to attack her, but he was calmed by the night elves who vouched for her. Varian had to stay in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; so he sent &lt;a href=\"Major%20Mattingly\"&gt;Major Mattingly&lt;/a&gt; to escort the group through Stormwind City.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; gathered a diverse army of survivors to assault the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and do battle with the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Lord\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; and his army of corrupted nightmare creatures, he tasked Varian to lead the army in the upcoming battle. Still embittered and distrustful of the Horde, he adamantly refused to lead an army with Horde members with in its ranks and preferred that the Emerald Nightmare take the Horde. He later reconsidered and agreed to lead the army when he was convinced by Malfurion to put his hatred aside for Anduin's sake. Though Horde members were wary to be under Varian's command, through the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde races were able to put aside their differences and follow Varian's orders. Varian Wrynn led the diverse dreamform army in the Emerald Dream and against impossible odds, the army was able to keep the Emerald Nightmare's army preoccupied while Thura and Malfurion defeated the Nightmare Lord on both the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; planes. Even as the battle grew dire, those who knew the legend of Lo'Gosh grew more confident under his leadership when they saw flashes of a wolf's countenance appear in Varian's dream form. After the threat of the Emerald Nightmare had been defeated, the world began to rebuild. King Varian was one of the Alliance guests who attended the wedding ceremony between Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind. Having heard of Lucan's role in the war, he promoted him to the position of chief cartographer.\nElemental Unrest.\nKing Varian took part in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; about the recent earthquakes with the other major political heads of the Alliance.\nHe also learned about the infiltration of the Twilight Hammer cult within Stormwind society and vowed to destroy it.\nLater on during the final event Varian also assisted in the defense of Stormwind during the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;elemental invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the city, he primarily operated out of the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20District\"&gt;Trade District&lt;/a&gt;. He also assisted Alliance heroes in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kai%27ju%20Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Kai'ju Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nWhile attending a memorial service for those who died from the Lich King war at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the service was interrupted by two night elf Sentinels who reported a savage and brutal attack on one of the night elf convoys and the thievery of their goods. Though the Alliance and Horde agreed to a peace treaty after the Lich King war, the brutality of the attack left everyone on edge and was considered in violation of their peace treaty agreement. Varian automatically suspects Thrall to have ordered the attack but Jaina Proudmoore comes to his defense and vouches that most likely these attacks were not authorized by him, nor should he be held responsible for them, as she claims that Varian also can't control all of his people as evidence of the Defias. Angry with Jaina for recalling the Defias to him, Varian's Lo'Gosh personality emerged, and he becomes intimidatingly aggressive as he accuses her of being a poor judge of character, as evidence of her misjudging Arthas, as well as a \u201cmewling pacifist\u201d who puts peace first, no matter the cost.\nAnduin overhears their argument and interrupts them. He leaves disgusted with his father's attitude towards Jaina and pacifism, a philosophy that he also believes in. Varian later apologized to Jaina for their spat and informed her that he would not take any violent actions against Thrall without proof. It seems that Varian knows, or at least heard some rumors, about the fate of Bolvar Fordragon atop the Icecrown. He sent an emissary to question Thrall on the attack. He stipulated to Thrall that he publicly denounce the attack, make a reaffirmation of the Horde's commitment towards the peace treaty, send all offenders of any attack to the Alliance, and publicly reprimand the savagery in which the attack was committed. Thrall was only willing to reaffirm the Horde's willingness to continue the peace treaty and denounce the breaking of the treaty, but his unwillingness to reprimand the savagery in which the attack was carried out, the thievery of the night elves' goods, or apologize for the murders, has weakened his popularity with Alliance leaders.\nVarian thought it best to send Anduin away to Theramore, where he can be under the guardianship of Jaina Proudmoore, and later Ironforge, where he can learn to improve his martial training and hopefully understand the need for his caution with the Horde. Varian figures that it would be best for him and Anduin to spend some time apart while he figures out how to deal with the aggressive outbursts evoked by his Lo'Gosh personality. Later he, his son, Jaina and many others were present during the funeral of Magni Bronzebeard.\nWhen Varian heard that &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; took over Ironforge with her &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; guards in the wake of King Magni Bronzebeard's petrification, Varian was outraged. Moira was holding everyone in the city hostage, including his son for a time. Varian and eighteen operatives embarked on a mission to liberate Ironforge and assassinate Moira Thaurissan. When Varian was about to execute Moira, Anduin, who had rushed back to Ironforge, convinced Varian that it would be better to guide Moira to be a better leader rather than to just execute her. Despite Moira being a tyrant who held the city hostage, she was still the legitimate heir to the throne, and killing her would only put the succession of Ironforge into question, thus leading to more chaos and conflict. Where as if she lived; through her and her son, all dwarven clans can unite. Varian slowly agreed but was also conflicted as Moira had caused so much chaos and had already threatened the safety of his son. Varian agreed to spare Moira's life but stipulated that if Moira was to be a leader and unite the dwarves, then she'd have to earn her crown by earning her people's respect. In order to take into account the opinions of all dwarves, Varian called for the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Both father and son hugged and reconciled while the populace of Ironforge applauded King Varian's decision.\nWolfheart.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; was boasting about &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;' victories against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the banquet welcoming the Alliance dignitaries, Varian Wrynn arrived and mocked Gilneas. Varian insulted Gilneas by implying that they were pathetic cowards and weaklings. Despite the insults to him and his people, Genn held his anger in check and tried to persuade the king of Stormwind that Gilneas had changed and that they were now ready to be staunch supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Varian Wrynn however, was still bitter over Gilneas' abandonment of the Alliance during their hour of need during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Varian denounced Gilneas as an ally and absolved himself of any association with the desperate nation.\nDuring the summit to decide if Gilneas would be readmitted into the Alliance, Varian Wrynn declared that the Alliance had no need for such fair-weather friends and would never consent to allowing such \"mongrels\" into the Alliance. This left the summit in an uproar and effectively ruined any chance Gilneas had of joining the Alliance.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; tried to persuade Varian to reconsider his position, his pleas fell on deaf ears. Varian cynically declared Malfurion's summit a failure, just like so many other things that transpired in his life. Varian reveals that the turmoil his kingdom suffered under &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s influence, the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20of%20Lordaeron%20%28History%20of%20Warcraft%29\"&gt;Lordaeron's fall&lt;/a&gt; all weigh heavily on him. Even now, he struggles with being thrust into the position of humanity's de facto leader. Before departing, Malfurion advises Varian to forgive himself for his faults and not to judge Genn with the same high standards that he places upon himself, as he will never be able to compete nor be given the chance to redeem himself. After the summit, Varian planned to leave Darnassus as soon as possible and return to Stormwind. Yet Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, having overheard his father and Malfurion's argument, decided that he would not be returning with him and would be traveling with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; on his journey. Varian, desperate not to lose his son, adamantly urged him to stay in Stormwind. With his father refusing to listen to him, Anduin turned to leave which drove Varian into a panic. Driven by rage and determination, he grabbed Anduin's arm and inadvertently hurt him. Varian desperately pleaded with his son not to leave, promising never to hurt him again, but Anduin was set on his path.\nVarian sulked in Anduin's quarters, trying to drink away his sorrows. Malfurion invited him to go hunting in order to lift his spirits but this was a ploy to bring Varian and Genn together. Having lured Varian into the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;'s hunting grounds, an argument was sparked between Varian and Genn about who was the better hunter. Malfurion proposed a hunting challenge to settle the matter. Relishing a chance to humiliate the Gilnean king in front of his subjects, he took up the challenge and attempted to kill every one of Genn's prey in order to put him to shame. While chasing a boar, however, they inadvertently agitated a giant bear. With one of Genn's subjects in danger, the Gilnean king and the king of Stormwind worked together to kill the giant bear, with Varian landing a killing blow to the bear's neck with his hunting knife. Genn and his worgen honored Varian for his kill, though he didn't stay around to accept it as he snuck off to reflect in the woods.\nAfter much reflection, Varian sought Genn out again just as he was about to depart from Darnassus. Varian asked him for his help in how to better control his rage. Genn led him to the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; where he showed him a night elf ritual that allowed the worgen to control their bestial fury. Though he did warn him that not all survived the trials the ritual entailed and some had to be put down since they lost themselves to their worgen nature. Varian then drank the waters from the Wells of Tranquility, Balance, and Fury; all at once.\nTaught by Genn to recall the most relevant moments in his life and the choices that led to it, Varian first recalled his childhood. In the Trial of Tranquility, Varian remembered how peaceful and happy he was growing up with his family. Yet that all ended when the orcs came, invaded his home and assassinated his &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;. Though his childhood was taken from him by war and violence, he realized that the good memories remained with him and the trauma could not erase what he had lived prior.\nIn the Trial of Balance, Varian recalled his youth as a young king. Despite having a fa\u00e7ade of an intelligent, diplomatic, and upbeat ruler to his friends like Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and his foster father King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, Varian could not keep hidden the occasional bouts of despair and depression. Only his betrothed, &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin&lt;/a&gt;, with her vibrant personality, was able to bring balance to his dark brooding self. By bringing laughter and joy into his life, Tiffin helped Varian grow into the king that the people loved. Varian vowed to honor her memory by moving on from her death and learning to forgive, learning from his mistakes, and using them all as examples of how to confront all his issues as a man, father, and monarch.\nIn the Trial of Fury, Varian recalled Anduin and how he was the most precious thing in his life. He often feared for Anduin's safety but knew that fear would only make him helpless to those things that threatened his son and his kingdom. Thinking of those threats put Varian in a rage, but as his anger grew, he recalled how his rage hurt Anduin and drove him away. Varian turned on his rage and sought to control it. Varian promised himself that he would no longer be dominated by his rage, and would channel it only in battle; as a devastating force against those who sought to harm those that he loves. Varian heard &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; howling in approval and he awakened, with Genn and the worgen watching in awe as the aura of Goldrinn enveloped him. Without a shadow of a doubt, Varian was indeed Goldrinn's champion. Varian told Genn to gather his worgen, as he was determined to do battle with his enemy, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving gathered the worgen and his forces, Varian mobilized his forces through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and reinforced the Alliance forces battling there with Garrosh Hellscream's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Following Varian's example, the worgen swarmed the massive &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; and targeted their weak spots to bring the giant beasts down. With the spirit of Goldrinn fueling him with renewed vigor, Varian led the charge against the Horde, killing magnataur, &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, and Horde races that stood in his way. Goldrinn's image formed from the dust and mist left behind in Varian's wake and many Alliance forces took to yelling the names Goldrinn and Varian as their battle cry. Varian drew the Alliance races to him as he led an indomitable charge in his pursuit of Garrosh Hellscream. The two leaders clashed on several occasions, killing any that interfered with their duel. Yet while Garrosh tired, Varian was still full of stamina, allowing him to press on with his attack. Varian subsequently was able to wound and disarm Garrosh of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, but before the fight could be concluded, a dying magnataur separated the two combatants. Though Garrosh wanted to settle the matter, the battle had turned unfavorable for the Horde and on the insistence of his Kor'kron guards Garrosh reluctantly had to retreat. Varian allowed him to leave, citing that a good hunter knows when to let his prey run.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Varian was honored as the hero of the battle for Ashenvale and Goldrinn's favored champion. Varian later called for a second Alliance summit, this time being a proponent for the induction of Gilneas and the worgen into the Alliance. Having apologized to the Alliance dignitaries for letting his faults divide the Alliance, Varian later spoke of more recent and pressing issues. Varian spoke of how many threats have arisen to challenge the Alliance and disrupt the peace that they worked so hard to attain. The Horde has threatened the Alliance and now more than ever, it needs to band together and match their enemies' fury and energy in order to survive in this new &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; created. With the worgen at their side, Varian assures his allies that the Alliance will prevail and will do so with honor.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, Varian Wrynn had a nightmare in which he recalled the events of him witnessing his father's assassination. He could only watch on in horror, as &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, with a tear-streaked smirk, plunged a dagger in his father's chest. Varian went to his father's side, holding him in his arms. The dying King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt;'s parting words to the young Varian was \u201cThis is how it always ends\u2026 with Wrynn kings.\" After which, maggots erupted from the dead king's maw\u2014thousands upon thousands of writhing worms obliterating Llane's ashen face. This horrifying scene caused the king to scream out in terror, awakening him from his nightmare and finding himself in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, with General &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; rushing to check on his safety. After assuring Marcus that everything was ok and being disappointed with the news that Anduin hadn't returned home yet, Varian met with &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baros%20Alexston\"&gt;Baros Alexston&lt;/a&gt;, who were discussing plans on repairing &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, which was still recovering from the attack by the Black Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Much to Varian's annoyance, Baros noted that the extensive repairs to the city wouldn't be cheap.\nAs Varian examined the wreckage left behind in &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, he came across a dagger-shaped obsidian splinter protruding from a damaged wall. It was a piece of the dragon's elementium armor. Varian seethed in anger as he held the shrapnel and sticking the splinter in his belt, declared that Stormwind would rebuild and stand firm, as they always have. Whatever the cost, they would make that black beast pay for his assault. In a discussion with &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; about the turmoil plaguing the world following the Cataclysm, Varian remembered that he must give a speech during the Honor Ceremony later that day. Varian knew that Stormwind was looking to him for direction in such trying times, but felt unsure on what to say that would salve the deep wounds the world had suffered. General Marcus then informed him that the nobles awaited his presence in the &lt;a href=\"throne%20room\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Varian arrived, he was enraged to find that the nobles had been grumbling about the costs of the Alliance wars involving the kingdom, to which Varian harshly berated them for their petty complaints. Varian stated that he had led Stormwind to many victories, wars that have protected humanity and kept their enemies at bay. Varian declared that if his ferocity makes him a monster, then he is the monster that Stormwind needs. As Varian ended his diatribe, he looked around and caught the familiar face of Anduin staring back at him from the rear of the throne room. His son had arrived sometime during the king's rant. By the horrified look on the young prince's face, it was clear that nothing had changed since they last had parted on such bad terms in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes were filled with both fear and bewilderment and he later fled the throne room, after which Varian's heart sank. Varian dismissed the nobles, causing the stunned audience to slowly file out, filled with fear both of the future and of the leader of mankind. As Varian touched &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin&lt;/a&gt;'s locket, he reflected on how no one will ever understand the burdens he must endure to be a leader, and the things he must become.\nVarian was left with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and Benedictus, who tried to console and counsel him about his relationship with his son. Varian revealed his concerns that Anduin may not have the strength to lead the kingdom, especially in such perilous times. Both Jaina and Benedictus assured him that Anduin has a different strength to give to the world, and as a healer, he is attuned with the Light. Benedictus noted that the times have changed, and it is clear that they must change with them. The age when hearts like Lothar's were the only way to survive may be drawing to a close. The world seems to yearn for someone new. Benedictus offered both Varian and the prince a Remembrance Day gift, which he offered to give to him at a special location. Before departing, Benedictus assured Varian that he believed that Anduin would have the mettle and the makings of a good king, as all Wrynn kings have.\nVarian later arrived at the meeting place that Benedictus told him, Tiffin's grave at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Cemetery\"&gt;Stormwind City Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. As he gazed at Tiffin's grave, he questioned if Tiffin could still love the man he had become. Later to his surprise, he was met not only with Archbishop Benedictus, but his son Anduin as well. His excitement was soon extinguished though when he saw the shock in his son's face, which revealed that he had not expected to see him. Varian asked Benedictus if the surprise family reunion was his gift, to which Benedictus said that he also had another gift to give. Benedictus then drew a glittering silver key and placed it on Varian's palm. It was the key to Tiffin's locket, which had been lost many years ago. Benedictus felt now was a good time to remind the two of more pleasant and fond memories. Varian was deeply moved by this gesture and thanked Benedictus for being a good man and friend, after which Benedictus departed to give the two royals privacy for their reunion.\nHaving been reminded of their love for Tiffin and of family, the bad blood between father and son soon faded away. Anduin inquired from his father if the world was dying. Varian responded to his inquiry that he didn't have any deep philosophy on the matter, only that he believed that the world is based on cycles, and that death, kingdoms, and kings come and go, but truth, honor, and duty last forever. To which Anduin added that love also lasts forever, and in his opinion, outlasts everything. Suddenly Varian knew what he must do. He offered Tiffin's key and her silver locket to Anduin and placed it around his neck. For years, Varian had kept the locket to remind him of his responsibilities as king. To remember that actions have consequences, and a leader must live with his choices, both good and bad because so many are counting on him. He now bestowed it to his son with the hope that in the future, he too would make peace with the past. Varian apologized to his son for being so blind in not recognizing the man Anduin had become. Anduin began to tear up, confessing that he wished he could be the strong king Varian was but Varian assured Anduin that he has more courage and strength than he does. While Varian may stand rigid and inflexible against the storm, Anduin can feel the wind \u2014 and bend with it and make it his own \u2014 and thus become unbreakable. This type of strength was the type his mother possessed and will surely make him the greatest of Wrynn kings.\nThroughout all this, they had taken notice of hidden assassins preparing to ambush them. Varian and Anduin prepared themselves for the assault by keeping their backs against the west wall, thus preventing the assassins from surrounding them. The king and prince soon defended themselves against the assassins who were warded by dark magic. Both father and son fought in sync, with Varian using &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; to defend his son from the assassins while Anduin used his bow and arrows to shoot at them from a distance. Varian, however, knew that they were only being kept busy while the dark sorcerer of the assassins was summoning something insidious to kill them. Anduin then placed on Varian, and with the power of divine magic protecting him, Varian &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Leap\"&gt;Heroic Leap&lt;/a&gt;ed at his enemies. Varian began dispatching enemies left and right, with Anduin covering his father's unprotected flank with a hail of arrows. The crowns of Stormwind moved as one, slashing with blade and stinging with an arrow as they cut through the line of defenders toward the ever-more-desperate sorcerer. King and prince were a perfect team, with Varian dealing unending brute force and Anduin unleashing a fusillade of biting razorheads where it would do the most damage.\nThe dark sorcerer quickly realized his opportunity for success was growing short, and he redoubled his efforts, sending more purple energy snaking into the glowing field. As he did, something large and fearsome began to take shape within the portal's spinning haze. Though Varian and Anduin dispatched the assassins and managed to kill the sorcerer, it was too late, a massive &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; emerged wielding mammoth twin axes. Things began to look bleak as nothing seemed to faze the warded drakonid. The drakonid managed to wound an already tired Varian and knock him out with a tail whip. Then he concentrated on Anduin, who after attempting to run to his unconscious father, barely managed to survive a savage blow to him by using his bow to deflect the impact. Though his bow shattered and he was knocked down, Anduin continued to dodge the drakonid's attacks. Soon Anduin was cornered and the drakonid brought down a mortal strike meant to kill. Anduin however was surprised to find Varian, deflecting the drakonid's axe with his sword and disarming it with its impact. Varian however had to disarm himself of Shalamayne in the process, which left him defenseless from the drakonid's second attack from his second axe. Varian was hit with the second attack right in his chest, and when he fell, he looked deep into his son's eyes to let him know that everything was all right. Varian could only think of his father's last words to him as he died, \u201cThis is how it always ends with Wrynn kings\u2026\u201d\nVarian urged Anduin to run and prepared himself for the death blow. Yet Anduin ran in front of his father and placed a to protect the two of them from the creature's attack. A golden nova of holy energy forced the monster to retreat as the prince advanced. As the drakonid charged, Anduin stood firm, surrounded by an aura of Holy Light. He opened his palms to the sky and spoke the words to &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;dispel magic&lt;/a&gt;. With each word, the earth resonated with energy, shaking the gravestones and sending a ripple across the surface of the lake. A flash of fire exploded from the sky and hit the drakonid as he rushed in. The inferno blinded the beast, and he stumbled toward the serene silhouette of Anduin, the hideous creature screaming in both pain and rage. As the drakonid fell, his armor quickly faded to a dull gray, no longer protected by dark magics.\nAt the last possible moment, Varian, who had pulled Deathwing's splinter of armor from his belt, lunged forward with everything he had left in his body and ran it through the drakonid's armor and chest. Soon Jaina and Marcus Jonathan arrived on the scene, followed by a host of guards. As Varian lay dying, he told Anduin that he loved him, that he was proud of him, and to not mourn him as this had always been his fate. Though Marcus Jonathan and Jaina wanted to take Anduin to a more secure location, Anduin refused to leave his father. Praying to the Light, he infused his father's body with an influx of divine energy and saved his life.\nLater, much to everyone's surprise, Varian arrived at the Remembrance Day Ceremony. Limping onto the stage, disheveled and covered in blood, came King Varian and Prince Anduin, barely holding each other up in their fatigue. As the realization of their dire state spread, a concerned murmur arose, but Varian raised his hand in a gesture of reassurance, and the crowd grew silent. It suddenly dawned on Varian that he had never found time to prepare his Remembrance Day speech. The king paused for just a moment, trying to smile through the pain, and then realized with utmost clarity that he now knew exactly what to say. He tells the people of Stormwind that though he has his faults, as their king, he has and always will have their best interests in mind. Even after Deathwing's attack, Stormwind will always remain vigilant and stand defiantly against their enemies. They will always rebuild from tragedy, and continue to learn from adversity. Stormwind will continue to grow from every direction, forging a brighter future. Each day they are alive is a great day, for each generation finds its own way to become the greatest generation that has ever lived and become the heroes of tomorrow. Varian states that though in the past they relied on strength and steel to forge their destiny, it is not the only way. In order to restore the world, a time will come when leaders need to be healers instead of warriors, those who mend instead of those who break. Only then can they truly cure their deep ills and achieve a lasting peace. Varian watched with pride as his words stirred the hearts of his people. The populace cheered for King Varian and this new direction for Stormwind.\nVarian no longer felt alone in his struggle to protect the world. He had the blood of his fathers in his veins, and in turn, Anduin had it in his. Varian felt the warmth and comfort of his ancestors across the great divide. It gave him the strength to be king, and someday it would give Anduin the power to fulfill his own destiny. As Varian basked in the warmth of his people, he felt truly at home for the first time in years. He found himself relishing his great fortune to be a father, his incredible honor to be the king of Stormwind; and not for the first time, nor the last, King Varian Wrynn felt very proud to be human.\nCataclysm.\n\"The king of Stormwind, recently returned to claim his rightful place, has little love for the Horde. His reasons are many: when Varian was a young boy, he saw his father murdered by the half-orc Garona; the orcs' warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, slew the valorous Anduin Lothar, who had delivered Varian safely to Lordaeron after the fall of Stormwind; Varian was later enslaved by the orcish gladiator trainer Rehgar Earthfury; and at the Wrath Gate, many brave Alliance soldiers died at the hands of the Forsaken's Royal Apothecary Society. Varian, who had always been wary of the orcs, discovered that the Royal Apothecary Society had been developing the new plague for years. The events that transpired during the battle for the Undercity convinced the human king that the Horde has been left unchecked for too long: the time has come to make things right.\"\nVarian Wrynn is involved at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20storyline\"&gt;Westfall storyline&lt;/a&gt;, where you must speak with him about the return of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and the king's response of reinforcing the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\nKing Varian Wrynn has also ordered &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Commander Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt; to assemble an army and purge the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, with the intention of reclaiming the town for the Alliance. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance managed to destroy the Scourge presence but the Horde, aided by their new &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; allies, drove the Alliance out and claimed Andorhal for themselves, though Alliance troops slew the Val'kyr leader &lt;a href=\"Aradne\"&gt;Aradne&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Varian enlisted an Alliance champion to mentor his son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. After introducing the two, Varian reveals that he has been amassing a war fleet to assault the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; but several setbacks have delayed its launch. In order to resolve the constant delays, Varian has tasked the Alliance champion to oversee the operation personally while Prince Anduin observes. Varian, wishing for his son to gain some life experience but fearful for his safety, instructs the player to escort him throughout his apprenticeship; this escort later turns into unraveling a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; plot where a &lt;a href=\"Major%20Samuelson\"&gt;trusted Stormwind guard&lt;/a&gt; attempts to assassinate Varian but &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; thwarts his plans.\nFinally, Varian sends you to the Twilight Highlands to assist the Alliance via &lt;a href=\"Fargo%20Flintlocke\"&gt;Fargo Flintlocke&lt;/a&gt;'s plane.\nTraveler.\nAt some point after the Cataclysm and the battle in the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; came to Stormwind to report the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; plot and the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt; threat to King Varian. They told him about the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; as well but decided to tell him that the blade was broken beyond repair in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt;. Greydon remained here as an advisor to the king.\nA month later, the king wrote a letter and sent a messenger to Greydon's son &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, thanking him for his role in the struggle and sending him a fine dagger as a replacement for the Diamond Blade.\nThe Stormwind treasury also rewarded &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; with diamonds for his part in the events.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; learned about the Horde's plan to attack &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and conquer the whole of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, she contacted King Varian to request reinforcements. Varian, having been briefed about the severity of the situation, ensured her that he will redirect the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s naval fleet to Theramore as well as assign some of his finest generals to her in order to beat the Horde back.\nUnfortunately, the battle for Theramore ended in defeat as Garrosh deployed a mana bomb to decimate the city. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; set aside a day of mourning in honor of the fallen. Varian was surprised and relieved to find that Jaina had survived the battle. Jaina, however, has been changed by the experience. Though she survived, the mana bomb's blast has radiated her with arcane energy and has thus heightened her rage. She frantically requested that Varian and her immediately rally the Alliance fleets and annihilate the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, who would no doubt have congregated there to celebrate their victory over Theramore. Varian however, tried to calm her down and informed her that the Horde has set up an effective blockade of Kalimdor; preventing them from regrouping with their night elf allies. Varian cautioned her that their retaliation must be done intelligently; after they've developed a sound strategy, rebuilt the fleet, broken the blockade and then regain &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Doing anything other than that would be too reckless and costly. Jaina offered to use the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; to decimate the Horde while they're still celebrating but both Varian and Anduin were against using such a tactic to fight the war. Jaina was too impatient to work with the Alliance to fight the war and left to fight the Horde using her own methods.\nVarian and his allies since then have been working hard to rebuild the fleet, with every race of the Alliance synergizing their military to provide an effective counter-attack. King Varian and other Alliance representatives have congregated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Room\"&gt;War Room&lt;/a&gt; to develop an effective strategy to fight the Horde. Though the other representatives offered their input in how to break the blockade, Varian proposed that they not focus on the blockade yet. Instead, they would make the Horde believe that they'd sent their fleet to liberate &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; through a false trail, forcing Garrosh to order the bulk of his navy there. While the bulk of the Horde fleet is distracted, the Alliance will sail for Orgrimmar itself, besieging the city and assassinating &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps even with the aid of those with in Orgrimmar who are discontent with Garrosh's leadership. Though it was a bold plan, the other Alliance representatives agreed that occupying the Horde's capital would put the Horde in disarray. Despite protests from the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, Varian resolved to lead the attack himself.\nBefore departing, Varian and Anduin gave an inspirational speech to remind the Alliance what they were fighting for. They will fight the Horde for justice, not genocide, and would never stoop to the monstrous tactics that the Horde has committed. They will embody the ideals of the Alliance and will gain victory on their terms. Anduin blessed the marines and his father, who were going off to fight the Horde. Varian left Anduin in charge of Stormwind while he and the Alliance fleet set sail for Orgrimmar.\nThe Alliance feint worked as the Alliance fleet was met with only a few Horde warships at &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Garrosh Hellscream unleashed another secret weapon: subjugated &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; enthralled by magic, emerged and destroyed several Alliance vessels. Garrosh Hellscream himself boarded Varian's flagship and the two dueled for a third time. Again their fight was interrupted as they were hurled away from each other as The &lt;a href=\"Lion%20of%20the%20Waves\"&gt;Lion of the Waves&lt;/a&gt; was blown apart and sinking. Varian managed to survive the blast and managed to swim on to some ship wreckage. Many of the Alliance ships have fallen to the kraken but he managed to float by one still intact. He ordered the Alliance fleet to retreat while he and those who were still stranded in the water swam to shore. Unfortunately, several more kraken came to impede their escape. With the fleet trapped, what remained of the Alliance fleet was in danger of being completely annihilated. With no hope of the Alliance fleet surviving, Varian resolved to die a glorious death; taking as many of the enemy as he could with him. Just then, Jaina Proudmoore used an army of water elementals summoned with the Focusing Iris to slay the kraken. Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; rescued Varian and the fleet sailed to Northwatch Hold, where the meager Horde resistance there was annihilated. With Northwatch reclaimed, Varian predicted that Garrosh would be forced to end his blockade of the other Alliance ports to further secure Durotar. Varian ordered an Alliance ship to accompany Lady Proudmoore to Theramore and give those killed there a proper burial. Meanwhile, Varian returned to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. All Alliance nations have been churning out weapons and rebuilding the fleet for the coming world war. Varian watched the construction of the new fleet from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and then returned to his keep to plan the war.\nMists of Pandaria.\nA few months before the discovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin gave Varian &lt;a href=\"Varian%27s%20compass\"&gt;a brass compass&lt;/a&gt; for his birthday.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Joining%20the%20Alliance\"&gt;Joining the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Varian greets the pandaren who decide to follow the Alliance, lecturing them on what he expects of members of the Alliance and the fact that the Horde, even those pandaren who joined them, are their enemies.\nVarian sent an adventurer and a few elite SI:7 agents to accompany the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; in their mission to rescue the \"White Pawn\" (who in fact is a stranded and missing &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; on Pandaria).\nVarian was also involved in a quest chain known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Trials%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Trials of the High King&lt;/a&gt;\", similar to the , to allow Alliance players to learn more about him.\nLandfall.\nAfter two months since the parting of the mists, King Varian's fleet finally arrived in Pandaria. Varian and his guards land first and rendezvous with the Alliance hero and the Alliance vanguard. After being briefed of their status, King Varian accompanies the hero in rescuing &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Troteman\"&gt;Marshal Troteman&lt;/a&gt; and his scouts from a Horde war party. After securing the territory for which &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; was constructed upon from the belligerent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; presence, Varian met with &lt;a href=\"Hilda%20Hornswaggle\"&gt;Hilda Hornswaggle&lt;/a&gt;: representative of the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;. Varian and the player also rescue her and her survey team from a Horde war party. Varian negotiates a deal with Hilda: the Explorer's League supplied Lion's Landing with a stone quarry in exchange for protection of their dig sites. After agreeing to his terms, King Varian then mused that leadership is about banding people together. With the territory and resources secured, the player signals the full might of the Alliance fleet to arrive and Lion's Landing is then established. After preparations for their home base was completed, Varian reunites with his son, Anduin. Though Anduin had his doubts about what the war could do to Pandaria, Varian assures Anduin that he is fighting the Horde not out of hatred but for a love of what's right. Varian asks Anduin to trust him to do the right thing and to also lend him his support. Both Varian and Anduin resolved to work together to protect &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. When news reached them that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and night elf &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; have been pursuing a Horde party holed up in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin advises Varian to not let the temple turn into a war zone as it is still recovering from a &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; infestation. Sensing that Garrosh was trying to lure the Alliance from the beach, Varian planned on defusing the situation with a handful of champions.\nVarian's first trial as High King occurs in the &lt;a href=\"A%20Little%20Patience\"&gt;A Little Patience&lt;/a&gt; scenario. By displaying patience, Varian was able to lure out the Horde army from the Temple of the Red Crane and decimate them with the Alliance's hidden traps. The victory resulted in the annihilation of the Horde army and its commander with minimal to no casualties for the Alliance. This victory impressed Tyrande Whisperwind who then pledges the night elves' support to Varian's command.\nVarian is later seen in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;, where the Alliance dignitaries and allies discuss the pros and cons of using Sha power. Anduin reports to Varian that it was the Sha energy that was causing their troops to act so violently. Though Varian is confident that the Alliance could defeat any foe, Anduin advises Varian to not underestimate the Sha as it feeds on one's inner most weaknesses: twisting and manipulating their thoughts. Just then, an &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Echo of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; manifests and Jaina Proudmoore restrains it in an ice block. Many of the dignitaries are shocked or horrified by its dark power. While others sees merit in the Sha and want to study or weaponize the Sha's energy. Varian asks for Anduin's opinion on the matter and he states that while it may be possible to harness the Sha's power as a weapon, they risk destroying their own people in the process. A price that he is not willing to pay. Varian concurs with his son's assessment and destroys the Sha and thereby forbidding its use.\nThough King Varian had no intention of interfering with &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s neutrality, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran still claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort. King Varian sent Prince Anduin and an Alliance champion to negotiate the withdrawal of blood elves from Dalaran. Later on, King Varian heard of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;'s discontent with the Horde. Varian secretly reached out to the Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas and opened discussions to bring the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; back into the Alliance. After &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; discovered that &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; steal the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; by using Dalaran portals to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina mobilized the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance forces, and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to purge the Horde from Dalaran. After the purge, Jaina reported to Varian that Dalaran was free of Horde interference and pledges the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to the Alliance. Varian however, was disappointed that Jaina had not conferred with him before she acted as her attack on the Sunreavers would consequently drive the sin'dorei back to the Horde. Before Jaina left to mobilize the Kirin Tor, Varian stressed to her that the Alliance must act as one. With no chance of support from Horde defectors, King Varian planned on defeating Garrosh with only a united Alliance.\nLater on, Varian discovers that Anduin and an Alliance champion went out on their own to stop Garrosh from using the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Though Anduin succeeded in stopping Garrosh and destroying the Divine Bell, it came at a great cost: Garrosh had shattered the bell, which crumpled onto Anduin and badly injured him. Varian regretted not having sent Anduin to Stormwind immediately and ordered for &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; to be sent to him at once. Varian then mournfully tended to his son while Jaina Proudmoore, who is furious at this assault, swears to Varian that the Kirin Tor will make Garrosh pay. After Jaina teleports out, Varian makes an affirmation that he will be the one to end Garrosh for this. With the Horde crumbling beneath Garrosh's leadership, Varian declares that the Alliance will deliver the final blow.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;Blood in the Snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne day, King Varian's discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;dwarven capital&lt;/a&gt; by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. Surely, the king thought, if he helped them with their &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; problem, they would give him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But what the King did not realize is that the dwarves did not trust one another. When Varian sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; declined to offer aid in Ironforge's defense for they feared that if they left to fight the Frostmane trolls, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; would take advantage of their absence to defeat the remaining clan and take over Ironforge. Frustrated, Varian argued that if no one would help, Ironforge would fall under siege. Only &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons would prove their loyalty to the Council, Ironforge, and the Alliance in the defense of Ironforge. And so Moira and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.\nWhen they arrived at &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that the trolls were using an unnatural storm to prevent the dwarven forces from advancing on them. Once the king's champions stopped the magical storm protecting Shimmer Ridge, Moira led her personal guard against the enemy troll village, at Varian's request. After rescuing the surviving mountaineers and slaying the elemental that the trolls were satiating with blood sacrifices to elicit the unnatural storm, the king's champions regrouped with Moira's &lt;a href=\"Forgeguard\"&gt;Forgeguard&lt;/a&gt; and together their forces slew the Zandalari leader and captured the Frostmane village. In the aftermath of the battle, Varian commended Moira and the Dark Irons on their victory, even stating that the Bronzebeards and Wildhammers would regret not having been there to share in her glory. Moira however, humbly stated that her intention was to protect and impress, not to shame; in response to which Varian acknowledged that she had accomplished just that. Both returned to Ironforge to announce her victory to the Council. On their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nEscalation.\nBefore committing regular forces to the assault on &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, King Varian sent agents &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sully%20McLeary\"&gt;Sully McLeary&lt;/a&gt; to scout out a naval landing site near Orgrimmar, learn the enemy's weaknesses, and give Alliance landing forces any advantage they can find. After discovering a Horde civil war, an Alliance champion was sent as an envoy and established a coalition with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. With a little deft political maneuvering, the Alliance champion was able to secure a potential Alliance beach landing and ensure that trolls and orcs would kill one another up and down Durotar. After the civil war became escalated, King Wrynn sent the Alliance champion a letter commending the player for his/her efforts and even though he doesn't trust &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, he agrees with the player's decision on the field. King Varian states that he is preparing the Alliance fleet for the upcoming naval assault on Durotar.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nVarian, along with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; made landfall at the &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;After a heavy fight to wrest control of the exterior of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, in which the rebels and Alliance forces turn out victorious, Varian sends his champions to meet up with Vol'jin's rebels and Tyrande Whisperwind's Sentinels, who are laid siege to the city's front gates. A large battle at the front gates and in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt; ensued that might tie the fate of both factions into one. When the war moves to &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, Varian assists Alliance agents in the battle against Kor'kron orcs.\nAfter the Alliance/Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s defeated Garrosh and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh was knocked to the ground and incapacitated. Thrall, leaning over Garrosh's body, told him of how disappointed he was in him, and prepared to deliver him a final blow, but was stopped by Varian, who declares that Garrosh's punishment is not for him alone to decide. Thrall is reluctant to allow the Alliance to decide Garrosh's fate. &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Garrosh instead be taken to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to stand trial for his heinous crimes against the peoples of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, to which Varian and Thrall agreed. Garrosh was then taken by Taran Zhu out of the room.\nAs the Horde gather together to discuss their next move, Jaina Proudmoore urges Varian to use this opportunity to conquer Orgrimmar and dismantle the Horde. Varian and his guardsmen march to the Horde congregation and demands that he speaks to the new Warchief who is revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Horde has committed heinous crimes, because some of them fought against Garrosh's tyranny, Varian offered to end the war. As Varian walks away, he threatens Vol'jin that should his Horde fail to uphold honor like Garrosh did, the Alliance will return to end them.\nWar Crimes.\nSome time after Garrosh's capture, Varian and the rest of Alliance leadership received an invitation from &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt;'s emissaries to participate in the hearing of former Warchief's fate in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. On the way there, Ranger General &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; wasn't pleased of the outcome with stopping &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from killing &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Varian promised &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; to mete out justice after the trial was finished, then she might get her wish. After hearing about Garrosh's trial, the accuser was the king himself, but &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; vetoed. Varian then chose &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; as the accuser shortly afterward. The Alliance leadership later met in &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; during dinner. When the first day of the trial started, Varian compared the present to the spectators from arenas in which he used to fight. When the trial started, he had to stop &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; from exploding in rage. When the introduction ended, he took Anduin out of the room and started thinking if stopping Thrall in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; was the right idea. Varian prepared his son for Tyrande's questions as he was a witness. After a break, Varian learned that Garrosh wanted to speak with Anduin. Varian, though angered, let his son decide. Anduin agreed and Varian wanted to go with him but the prince refused. He then continued to watch the trial.\nOn the sixth day of the trial, Varian was furious when he learned that Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; had worked together in the past. He asked Jaina whether Baine knew of Garrosh's mana bomb on which she responded he didn't know. When the day ended and they arrived to &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt;, the two leaders began arguing about the revelation of the day. After they were done, he received a letter that he is going to be Baine's witness. During the next day, he watched the vision of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;'s obliteration. On the eighth day he was called as a witness with the vision, when he infiltrated Ironforge and wanted to execute Moira, being shown. The King closed his statement by telling that Garrosh was intelligent and he cared for the orcish race. Varian believed Garrosh may change. When Tyrande was asking, she wanted to point out that there were drastic differences between the two leaders and suggested to &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; not to take Varian's first statement into account - which the judge declined. During the last day of the trial, he heard out the closing speeches. After that, &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; came to say goodbye to him, though the dragon was then stopped from leaving. The King then watched Garrosh and his last speech and noticed that &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; is absent. He took his son to the arena's entrance and met with Go'el. At that moment, chaos erupted.\nGarrosh escaped and the temple was attacked by dragon-riders. Varian ran outside and together with the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, Horde and Alliance he fought against the attackers composed of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; on the backs of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragon\"&gt;infinite dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and a group of pirates. Although an arrow hit him he continued to fight and faced a tauren pirate who almost killed him. The pirate was killed by a &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; belonging to a human &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. Right after that, Varian's wound was healed by a night elf priestess. Afterwards, he noticed &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and knocked her off of the dragon. She bit him and was about to cut him with her axe but she was stopped when a fireball hit her. Jaina was preparing for a second fireball but couldn't follow through as Jaina was shot by &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt;. Varian noticed that and immediately rushed to take her to safety. Soon after the fight stopped and the remaining attackers retreated. Varian brought Jaina inside where many began healing her. Varian, feeling that it was over, wanted to take Anduin out, but at that moment, &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; took off and healed everyone, Jaina included. Chromie then explained the situation of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Varian and the rest heard out the trial's sentence that not only Garrosh was judged but all of them.\nLords of War.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; beginning its march, Varian examined the situation by planning alone on the &lt;a href=\"War%20Room\"&gt;War Room&lt;/a&gt;'s map table display of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; late one night. Varian was not certain he could defeat what was essentially the same threat that killed his father and razed his city. He was interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, who urged him to sign the declaration of war and told him about the prime timeline histories of several of the Iron Horde's warlords - &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s father, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. Varian became curious as to why Maraad was so eager for him to sign the declaration of war, stating that he seemed too bloodthirsty for a paladin. Maraad ended his story with his own experience with the Old Horde, and how he desires redemption from his past failures by preventing the Iron Horde from committing the same atrocities he had to endure. With his confidence restored, the King gave the order to sound the call to arms, stating that Azeroth needs heroes now more than ever.\nThe Iron Tide.\nWhen the Iron Horde began its invasion, King Wrynn also sent the champions of the Alliance to help the forces in the Blasted Lands and to stop the orc threat. And later learns from &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and Maraad about the situation.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nBefore the Alliance left for the Dark Portal, the king recommended Maraad to put the adventurer in charge of operations on Draenor.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; appeared at &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, a message was sent to Varian to inform him of the Black Prince's presence on Draenor.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; reaches its third stage, Varian promotes the commander to General of the Alliance's forces on Draenor.\nAfter took over the Iron Horde, Varian arrived in &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; to plan the invasion of Tanaan. He suggested to build a shipyard and sent the commander to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; flew to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to warn Varian.\nBroken Shore.\nVarian led the Alliance's assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing the possibility that he might not return from this battle against the Burning Legion, en route Varian wrote a letter to his son, in which he acknowledged his support of Anduin's desire for peace, and the positive influence Anduin has had on his father's grasp of tolerance, patience, and faith. Lastly, Varian advises his son that to preserve the peace he desires, Anduin must be willing to fight. He took with him &lt;a href=\"Varian%27s%20compass\"&gt;the compass&lt;/a&gt; Anduin had gifted him years prior to the battle. Fast approaching the Broken Shore, Varian exchanged a brief nod with Horde leader &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; atop her own &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a swarm of flying &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s became visible, Varian ordered his forces to engage. The demons attacked Varian's gunship, causing critical damage. Forced overboard with a looming &lt;a href=\"abyssal\"&gt;abyssal&lt;/a&gt; preparing to attack, Varian was helped by Sylvanas, who leapt onto the Alliance gunship and fought with Varian to overcome the demon. Varian's gunship had collided with the Horde gunship and sustained heavy damage to its engines. The faltering gunship crashed into the sea, with Varian and numerous soldiers sinking deeper into the sea along with it and the compass disappearing in the depths. Yet Varian survived the impact of the crash, removed his pauldrons, and resolved to fight. Varian swam himself out of the water, split &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; back into &lt;a href=\"Shalla%27tor%20and%20Ellemayne\"&gt;two blades&lt;/a&gt;, and began a vicious assault on the gathered demons on the shore. Throwing himself into the battle alongside Sylvanas, Varian cried, \"For Azeroth!\"\nAlong with Genn and Jaina, adventurers find Varian at the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20City\"&gt;Black City&lt;/a&gt;. With their forces combined, they begin their assault, killing many demons and closing their portals. Along the way, they find Argent prisoners who had previously assaulted the city but fell as felfire started to rain upon them. Varian decides to search for &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and finds him held captive by Gul'dan. The Alliance forces rush to save him, but Tirion tells them its a trap. The giant eredar &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt; attacks the combined armies of the Horde and Alliance as Tirion burns alive before falling into the fel lava. The armies defeat the giant and chase after Gul'dan. The Horde splits off to secure the ridge overlooking the approach to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and cover the Alliance's flank, while the Alliance corner Gul'dan. Varian promises him a quick death, but the warlock is soon reinforced by a massive amount of powerful demons.\nAfter a long battle, Varian orders an Alliance gunship to advance and instructs Genn Greymane to tell Sylvanas to have her forces clear the skies. Unbeknownst to the Alliance, the Horde is overwhelmed and forced to retreat, leaving the Alliance vulnerable. Varian watches in shock and disappointment as he witnesses the Horde forces quit the field. Genn Greymane is livid at what he sees as a betrayal on Sylvanas' part, while Varian is forced to order a retreat via gunship. As it takes off, however, Gul'dan summons an immense Fel Reaver through the portal, which grabs onto the side of the gunship, causing it to tip and send some Alliance soldiers plummeting to their deaths. Varian, dangling from a rope ladder on the side with Genn reaching down from the deck to pull him up, can only see two options: have Genn pull him up and hope the gunship will escape but risk it being pulled down and destroyed and killing everyone on board, or let go and destroy the Reaver so the gunship can escape but leaving himself behind to certain death.\nReaching up, he passes the letter for Anduin into Genn's open hand and asks him to deliver it to his son. Varian then let go and uses the momentum of his fall to impale the head of the Reaver with Shalamayne. As he momentarily watches to ensure that the gunship flies away to safety, Varian is left to make a final stand against powerful demons, killing several as he's increasingly wounded, before being impaled from behind by two felguard. Gul'dan gloats to the dying king that he will be remembered \"as the king who sacrificed his life for nothing.\" Varian defiantly looks at the warlock in the eyes and says \"For the Alliance.\" Gul'dan then painfully floods Varian's body with overwhelming fel magic, causing the wounded King to scream in agony as his body explodes. Even as far away from the gunship, Genn can see the explosion, crying out into the sky in anger and grief.\nLegacy.\nHis memorial funeral was held in Stormwind Keep, with every leader of the Alliance and countless mourning citizens attending. The Alliance leaders discuss their future and Anduin is crowned King of Stormwind. Varian's empty casket is entombed at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, built within the former crater that was the &lt;a href=\"Park\"&gt;Park&lt;/a&gt;; his tomb overlooks Stormwind Harbor, a monument to not only his sacrifice but to all Alliance forces who died at the Broken Shore.\nThe site of his death is now known as &lt;a href=\"Wrynnfall\"&gt;Wrynnfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; formed, Anduin traveled to the spot where his father died. Just moments before, Genn and Velen reached the site to show the prophet that it was here where Varian fell in battle. Anduin responded that he hadn't seen the horrors that both Genn and Velen have gone through when battling the Legion. Genn told Anduin that he really didn't need to see this, but the boy continued to the entrance of the Tomb. Upon reaching his father's remains, he began to feel the same reaction: when his father got stabbed and fell to the ground. Anduin cleared the dust and found a &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; blade left behind. He never surrendered, Anduin thought and began to doubt that he could be the king he was. Genn then approaches the young Wrynn and told him that his father's actions were indeed heroic. They were his challenge to the Alliance, and to teach people to never let fear prevail even at their darkest hour. Genn gives Anduin the sword and a vision of Varian appears. Trying to collect his words, Anduin eventually asked what he should do now. The vision of his father reminded him to act as a king.\nShadowlands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin fell under the control of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic, with Shalamayne being transformed into the &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, as Anduin struggled to regain control from the Jailer, he suddenly saw Varian appear by his side to remind him that Shalamayne had not been forged by darkness, but by valor. &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; appeared at Anduin's other side to add that the sword had been forged by honor as well. Varian continued that both of their legacies along with that of Shalamayne were with Anduin. With their help, Anduin was able to split Kingsmourne back into Shalla'tor and Ellemayne and free himself. It is not stated whether these appearances of Varian and Varok were their actual souls or only part of Anduin's imagination, or perhaps memories held by Shalamayne.\nTactics.\nKing Varian was perhaps the hardest city leader to defeat for Horde players. The relocation of Stormwind Keep and the change of Stormwind's geography made getting to Varian undetected nearly impossible. Additionally, Varian's elite guard were spread all the way along the path to the king, ranging as far as the steps of the keep itself. A fast kill was vital as Stormwind is highly populated during most hours and Alliance players were very likely to come to the aid of their King.\nIn addition Genn Greymane accompanied Varian, further complicating the battle. Genn didn't attack for the first two to three seconds after aggro as he changed into worgen form. Genn would be tanked separately from Varian and kept away from the rest of the raid due to his Intimidating Roar. For his other abilities refer to Genn's &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;main article&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarian retained his previous abilities of Heroic Leap and Whirlwind as well as continuously spawning guards. In total King Varian and Genn Greymane had the largest total health of all the racial leaders (around 785 million), however the biggest threat in this fight was definitely the Alliance playerbase, success could rely almost entirely on how many respond to the raids attack.\nHowever players would keep in mind that only Varian's death was required for the &lt;a href=\"Storming%20Stormwind\"&gt;Storming Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nOriginal appearance.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"patch%201.9.0\"&gt;patch 1.9.0&lt;/a&gt;, players could witness the king in his captivity in the sewer dungeons of Alcaz Island just north of Theramore, though he was not involved in any quests at the time. With &lt;a href=\"patch%201.10\"&gt;patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, Varian was replaced with an elite level 62 &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Tidelord%20Rrurgaz\"&gt;Tidelord Rrurgaz&lt;/a&gt; and a sewer full of elite naga, and Alcaz Island became home to &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Weavil\"&gt;Doctor Weavil&lt;/a&gt;, a major part of the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world%20event\"&gt;world event&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe comic series suggests that this Varian was the \"twin\" which did not manage to escape, but was instead captured by the naga and later ransomed back to Stormwind into the hands of Lady Katrana Prestor.\nPersonality.\nKing Varian is a ruler with a fierce love for his people and his son, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;. He would willingly give his life to save his people. He is driven by ancient principles few understood today\u2014a code of conduct that demanded something more of its leaders. He believes in the principles of truth, honor, justice, and duty. Though the events of his life have left him severely distrusting of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he has shown a willingness to attempt peace. Before he was kidnapped by the &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt;, he was en route to a peace summit with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, manipulations of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; made the conference with Thrall a disaster and reinforced his little love for the Horde. His reasons for his hatred are many: when Varian was a young boy, he saw his father murdered by the half-orc &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;; the orcs' warchief, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, slew the valorous &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, who had delivered Varian safely to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after the fall of Stormwind; Varian was later enslaved by the orcish gladiator trainer &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;; and at the Wrath Gate, many brave Alliance soldiers died at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;. Varian, who had always been wary of the orcs, discovered that the Royal Apothecary Society had been developing the &lt;a href=\"new%20plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt; for years. The events that transpired during the battle for the Undercity convinced the human king that the Horde has been left unchecked for too long and sought to dismantle it entirely; an attitude that grew worse throughout most of the Scourge war. However, after witnessing the fate of &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and sympathizing with the father's plight of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, his attitude began to soften; bidding his men to stand down and allow Varok to retrieve his son's corpse, an action that moved &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; to tears. Throughout the course of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Varian slowly grew more tolerant and diplomatic, taking many lessons from his son. He also reconciled his fury at tragedies he's endured with his hot-blooded behavior, enabling him to become more level headed in administering the justice he desired. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; he did not use the Cataclysm to gain military advantage and focused on the more pressing threat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; Campaign, Varian has become far more composed and confident; proving his new attitude by rejecting the notion of utilizing the Sha as a weapon, leading a careful, controlled, and strategic operation to free the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; from Horde control, earning the respect of his allies, and ultimately declaring the war to be over with Garrosh's arrest, willing to give the Horde a second chance under their new Warchief.\nWhen his consciousness was split by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, so too was his personality. One side retained all of Varian's knowledge, manners, and etiquette; while the other, Lo'Gosh, retained his skill in battle and is known to wage war with a relish equal to his enemies.\nThough the two halves were eventually reunited, they did so imperfectly. At times, Lo'Gosh is more dominant, and he is not one to shy away from conflict if he believes it is necessary.\nIn combat, Varian is renowned for his brutal strength, speed, and lightning reflexes. &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; has compared fighting him to that of fighting two men at once. With the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit, he has even been shown to never tire in combat and have his senses heightened. Those that have seen him in combat describe his fighting style like that of a wolf. Varian can quickly take notice of an enemy's vulnerability and take advantage of it. He has also been shown to lure his foes into a sense of complacency and see them undone by the trap or ambush he has set up.\nQuotes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThis latest affront by the Lich King must be dealt with. Stormwind is doing what we can, but it will require the effort of everyone to overcome.

Rest assured that the Alliance will not sit on its haunches. Preparations are already underway... for war.\nDefeating the Lich King and his armies will be a long and challenging ordeal.

Just as these &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;statues&lt;/a&gt; still stand watch, so shall Stormwind, now and forever! We are gathered here on &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt; to honor those heroes who have shown us the way, by the light of their lives and the glory of their deeds. &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;! Once again, we face a new and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;great threat&lt;/a&gt;. Even now, we bear the fresh scars of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;evil forces&lt;/a&gt; bent upon our destruction. But humanity is not so easily cowed! We stand in the breach and we hold the line! We will never be slaves to fear! On this day we must remember not only the good but also the bad, for it is through adversity and failure that we become our best! I myself have been\u2026 an absent king, chasing our &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; to the very heart of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;underworld&lt;/a&gt;. I hold your safety as my highest responsibility, your good livelihood my first and only calling. For the truth is it is not the people who serve their king; it is the king who serves his people! I have not always been the best leader\u2026 or father\u2026 or husband. A wise man once said, \u201cWe each must grow in every direction, every day.\u201d Well, I still have some growth left in my bones. And behind me, I see a city rising from disaster, with fresh hope and gleaming new spires! Yes, today we honor the past, but only with our eyes firmly fixed on a brighter future! One that we will forge together, for ourselves, for our children, and for our children's children! Each generation is destined to achieve its great promise. To be sure, each will face a unique set of tests and adversities, and some will be certain that the end is near. But there is no truth to the tavern-told lie that the 'good old days' are forever behind us. No! Each day we are alive is a great day! And each generation finds its own way to become the greatest generation that has ever lived! In the past, we have relied on strength and steel to forge our way. We protect what we can, destroy what we must. But that is not the only way. If we are to ever restore this world, then there must come a time when the leaders of Azeroth are no longer the warriors, but instead the healers! Those who mend instead of those who break. Only then can we truly cure our deep ills and achieve lasting peace. Look above you! The heroes of old stand tall, and we honor and remember them well this day. But now look next to you! By your side, in this crowd, stand all the heroes of tomorrow! You\u2026 and you\u2026 and you. Each of you will play a part; each will make a difference; and in time, some will be honored on this day for deeds far greater than any we could possibly imagine! So, people of Stormwind!

Eventually, Ner'zhul, his sanity cracking, would agree to serve Kil'jaeden. Kil'jaeden passed the orc's spirit through death and revived as a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;spectral entity&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlords bound his disembodied spirit to a specifically crafted set of armor and a mighty &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. These items were locked in a diamond-hard block of ice to imprison Ner'zhul. The Lich King and the dreadlords who had tortured him were then sent to Azeroth in order to weaken any resistance that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would face during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. While the Lich King gathered his strength, Varimathras and his fellow dreadlords would serve as jailors and executors meant to hasten the Lich King's task by any means necessary. To this end, they would construct the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Though seemingly broken by the dreadlords, Ner'zhul sought vengeance and was able to play on the dreadlord's fears of Kil'jaeden in order trick them into allowing him to hurl Frostmourne out of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third War.\nIt was the dreadlords &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; who first spread the taint and corruption of the Legion across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; respectively, and after their deaths by the hands of the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, it was Varimathras and his two brothers, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, who were put in charge of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; forces in Lordaeron while Archimonde took his forces across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to siphon energy from the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral months passed after &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s departure and subsequent death during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, yet the three dreadlords were unaware of the events and continued their vigil over Lordaeron, maintaining their occupation of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. No sooner had they begun to suspect the possibility of their plans going awry when King &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; burst into the city bounds, announcing the defeat of the Legion and the death of Archimonde. He had come to reclaim the throne of Lordaeron and exact his vengeance on the dreadlords to complete the circle of defeat for the Legion, but Varimathras and his kindred quickly escaped his wrath, taking refuge within the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; where they plotted their next move.\nKnowing that they would not be able to defeat the loyal army of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the combined might of the loyal &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, Varimathras instead appealed to Sylvanas alone in secret, revealing to her the diminishing powers of both &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and making a deal for her aid in overthrowing the weakening &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. Thirsty for revenge for turning her into the cursed &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas reveled in the chance to exact her vengeance upon Arthas. After the dreadlords separated him from his forces, Sylvanas attempted to assassinate him. However, due entirely to the interference of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, he escaped her vengeance. She instead turned her eye back to the Lordaeron capital city. Arthas fled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and was no longer a threat, so the conflict was narrowed down to the forces of the dreadlords against the forces of Sylvanas, both vying for control of Lordaeron and ultimately freedom. As the Lich King's control over the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; continued to wane, more and more undead were becoming free-willed and loyal to Sylvanas.\nAfter Arthas' retreat, Varimathras again visited Sylvanas, offering her a position in the dreadlord's army as an agent of their new world order. She refused, unwilling to once again give up her freedom. Varimathras then labeled her an enemy of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and warned her not to get in the way of their rule over the Plaguelands. Sylvanas knew that if she and her people were to ever live in peace, the dreadlords would have to be destroyed. She scoured the forest using her banshees to possess the most powerful denizens in order to build up her forces. She then sent her army against the forces of Varimathras, who stood no chance against them. Sylvanas devastated his forces and was ready to execute the dreadlord \u2014 who begged her for his life. He offered his service, as well as his knowledge of his brothers' tactics and base locations, in exchange for his life. In an act of twisted mercy, Sylvanas accepted his offer and ensured Varimathras that his life would be spared.\nSylvanas then used her newest subordinate to seek out the base of &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, who had enslaved a large number of human soldiers, manipulating them to do his bidding. Leading them was Lord &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the last remnants of the Lordaeron army. Despite the additional threat, Sylvanas was able to strike a crippling blow to both the humans and undead of the Scourge, using her &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s to possess some wayward scouts and infiltrate Detheroc's base. While the enemy forces slept, Sylvanas moved quickly to disable and destroy one base after another before they were able to notice the disturbance. Sylvanas tore Detheroc to shreds, and with him dead, the human forces regained their free will and were left with no choice but to forge a tenuous alliance with Sylvanas. With Garithos and his forces at their side, they then moved on to combat the final threat, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Power%20in%20Lordaeron\"&gt;assaulted&lt;/a&gt; Balnazzar's stronghold in the Lordaeron capital ruins in a two-pronged attack, Sylvanas' forces attacking from one side while Garithos' forces attacked from another. Balnazzar called in demonic reinforcements through a demon portal, but despite his resilience, he was ultimately defeated. He was cornered by Sylvanas and Garithos, and, as a last testament to Varimathras' loyalty, Sylvanas ordered him to kill his brother. Varimathras was reluctant to break the nathrezim code that they must never slay one of their own. However, he valued his own life above all else, and with no further hesitation brutally \"killed\" Balnazzar (Balnazzar however had faked his own death).\nOnce the task was complete and the dreadlords had fallen, Lordaeron was finally free of the Scourge. Garithos then demanded that Sylvanas and her forces get out of \"his\" city. Sylvanas instead gave Varimathras the order to kill Garithos. He did so with pleasure and thus solidified his place among the Forsaken of Lordaeron. Within the sewer system of the ruined capital city, Varimathras aided Sylvanas in the construction of the new capital, henceforth known as the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. It was also at this time that Sylvanas named her people, the free-willed undead, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon after taking their new capital, Varimathras informed Sylvanas about Arthas' fate in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, that he was now merged with the Lich King and sitting on the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. He was also approached by &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt;, but the dreadlord forbade him to see Sylvanas and refused to hear him out. Putress then went directly to Sylvanas and told her his plan about a &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing this, Sylvanas ordered him to seek out Varimathras in order to receive whatever or whoever he required to craft this weapon.\nAshbringer.\nThough he was in the service of the Dark Lady, it was revealed that he was not loyal to her and was still in contact with Balnazzar who wielded the disguise of &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;. After Balnazzar learned about &lt;a href=\"Alexandros\"&gt;Alexandros&lt;/a&gt;' plan to destroy the Forsaken, he commanded him to kill Alexandros using his sons, Renault or Darion. Some time after the Scourge attacks on &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the two dreadlords met and Varimathras received another ingredient for the new blight from &lt;a href=\"Castillian\"&gt;Castillian&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends: Crusader's Blood.\n&lt;a href=\"Reynah%20Firecaster\"&gt;Reynah Firecaster&lt;/a&gt; learned that her brother, &lt;a href=\"Rinn%20Firecaster\"&gt;Rinn Firecaster&lt;/a&gt; was killed by a captain of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. When Reynah arrived to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; she begged Varimathras for an audience with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; demanding justice for her brother who was killed in their lands. Varimathras, however, brushed her off, telling her that Sylvanas has more to worry about than one death and if she wants justice done do it herself.\nLater on, Varimathras alongside Sylvanas attacked a camp of the Scarlet Crusade and defeated its leader, &lt;a href=\"Renee%20Lauer\"&gt;Renee Lauer&lt;/a&gt;, who was responsible for the deaths. After this, Renee was resurrected as a Forsaken.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHe served the Banshee Queen as her majordomo and lieutenant, and worked ceaselessly to safeguard the Undercity from all threats. Sylvanas tasked him with conquering the human and dwarven lands in southern Lordaeron. He used to send Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; to deal with its crazed inhabitants. &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Darthalia\"&gt;High Executor Darthalia&lt;/a&gt; was also under his direct command and she orchestrated his planned assaults on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarimathras suspected that &lt;a href=\"Andron%20Gant\"&gt;Andron Gant&lt;/a&gt; provided aid to some other group and had his &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; examined it. He ordered the death of &lt;a href=\"Fenwick%20Thatros\"&gt;Fenwick Thatros&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to obtain documents from &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s current status. He also sent &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Faustin\"&gt;Apothecary Faustin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Zraedus\"&gt;Deathstalker Zraedus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; in order to survey lower &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nVarimathras noticed Sylvanas when she felt that Arthas has awoken.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that Varimathras had plotted his way into controlling a substantial part of the Forsaken, using them and his chief underling, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, to launch a surprise assault upon the combatants at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. This ambush resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Alliance and Horde soldiers, including famed Alliance hero &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas, and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle against his summoned Legion minions \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Overlord\"&gt;overlords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Dreadwhisperer\"&gt;dreadwhisperers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invader\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Varimathras made reference to \"years of planning\" (attempting to undermine Sylvanas) and the voice of an unseen &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;\"Master\"&lt;/a&gt; berated Varimathras for his failure to prevent the Horde party from reaching the throne room. At this point, Varimathras entered the fray himself and was defeated by Sylvanas herself.\nLegion.\nVarimathras is a boss in &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. In payment for his blunders at the Undercity, Varimathras has been tortured by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Coven%20of%20Shivarra\"&gt;Coven of Shivarra&lt;/a&gt;. The vindictive sisters stripped away both flesh and sanity, leaving only a singular desire to inflict suffering upon the mortals who cost him everything. He was killed by the adventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Before being slain, he hinted that the Horde had been deceived by Sylvanas and were blind to the darkness in their midst. His final words, \"death claims us all,\" echoed Sylvanas' sentiments and presaged the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nVarimathras has seemingly appeared to serve Sylvanas unquestionably ever since that time and now serves as her vizier, working ceaselessly to safeguard the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; from all outside threats, especially that of his former masters. The fact that Varimathras still has not betrayed Lady Sylvanas means that she must have a powerful ace up her sleeve, only time will tell what that might be. Then again, it's possible Varimathras has already betrayed the Forsaken, but how it has happened is not yet known. There are rumors that Balnazzar lives. It is possible that they have some grand scheme to manipulate the Forsaken and reclaim them for the Burning Legion, or for their own faction.\nThe dreadlord Varimathras polices the Forsaken and holds almost as much power as Sylvanas. However, there is a trend amongst the undead. They appear to be split into two camps, those that revere Sylvanas and those that follow Varimathras. Sylvanas doesn't truly trust Varimathras, but still believes he is her willing servant. If she isn't careful she may find out she no longer rules the Forsaken.\nA Forsaken messenger, &lt;a href=\"Kalasan\"&gt;Kalasan&lt;/a&gt;, had intercepted messages from a traitor in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; communicating with &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. He entered Sylvanas's throne room to tell her what he had found out but discovered his mistake. He hadn't noticed she wasn't in the throne room, and when he blurted out what he had found out, he was left alone with Varimathras who locked the doors behind him so he couldn't escape.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

A famed veteran of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, he served as &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s second-in-command during the Second War, and as Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;second War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later led the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and assisted &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;tragic battle&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s promotion to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang took up the position of leader of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and resided in &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Disgusted with Sylvanas' increasingly cruel and brutal reign, Saurfang turned against the Warchief and asked &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; for assistance in removing her from power. Both the armies of the Alliance and the Horde-loyalists gathered by Saurfang and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign &lt;a href=\"Battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;gathered at the gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, where Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which culminated in his death and in Sylvanas's departure, preventing massive bloodshed between the two factions.\nHe was one of the main protagonists in \"\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nVarok Saurfang was born on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and the younger brother of &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;. Broxigar and Varok also had an unnamed half brother, sharing the same mother but different fathers. Shortly after &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, 5 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he named Varok, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; as his lieutenants, and they helped oversee the Blackrock war machine as it prepared for the war with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Varok made the free decision to drink the &lt;a href=\"blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and led forces in the sacking of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;Blood Curse&lt;/a&gt; causing them to murder many innocent draenei, children included.\nAround the time of the Dark Portal's opening, Varok's mate &lt;a href=\"Remda\"&gt;Remda&lt;/a&gt; apparently died and was burned in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Having promised his mate that their son would not be exposed to the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s or cross the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, their son &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh&lt;/a&gt; was hidden away at &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, while Varok charged into the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, commanding Blackhand's army like an unstoppable force towards &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, never losing in battle until the Horde was routed at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. When Orgrim seized control of the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, he chose Varok as his second-in-command after witnessing Saurfang's efficient and brutal tactics on the field. Shortly after Orgrim's ascension, Saurfang participated in the war's final battle, the siege of Stormwind City, in which he personally hunted down &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s in the streets while the city burned around him. When the Horde marched from the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; during the Second War, Varok commanded a rearguard of Blackrock orcs to waylay the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. At some point during the war, he faced &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; and almost killed him.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Varok fought alongside the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hekazi\"&gt;Hekazi&lt;/a&gt;. He participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, witnessing &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s fall to the &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s. After the demonic bloodlust had been lifted from the orcs due to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice, Varok helped dozens of veterans come to grips with their previous atrocities, ultimately saving the lives of many great Horde soldiers. His own actions under the Blood Curse, however, continue to haunt him, as the sound of swine being killed when they are ready for slaughter reminds him of the death screams of the draenei children, and older veterans like Varok are often troubled by the memory. It disturbed Varok so deeply that he has refused to eat pork ever since. He will not shy away from war, or hesitate to defend his people and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. However, he refuses to start a war, and if it is within his power, he will prevent a warmongering spirit from doing so. Whether through actions or by words, he will stop them anyway he can... no matter what.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSaurfang was initially stationed in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt;, where he enforced the rule of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. He was the one who announced the death of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; when his &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Nefarian\"&gt;head&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"The%20Lord%20of%20Blackrock%20%28Horde%29%20%282%29\"&gt;turned in&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%23Opening%20the%20gates\"&gt;second War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang traveled to the front lines in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. He acted as the Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in the war against the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters.\nWar against the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers encountered Varok's now-adult son Dranosh, who later traveled to Azeroth and reunited with his father.\nVarok participated in the defense of Orgrimmar when it was &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, Thrall told Varok to marshal the Horde's forces and prepare them to travel to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround this time, Varok gave his battle armor and axe to Dranosh, who was put in command of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Varok himself is stationed in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; as an advisor to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. He commands the Kor'kron in Northrend and remains wary of the resurfacing bloodlust of the orcs, due to its employment in Hellscream's savage but successful tactics. Varok assisted adventurers in killing &lt;a href=\"Varidus%20the%20Flenser\"&gt;Varidus the Flenser&lt;/a&gt; but insisted on not telling Garrosh about this.\nDuring the battle for &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, the main entrance to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, Dranosh fell to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. At the behest of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers brought Dranosh's shattered armor back to his father. Although Varok mourned his son, he stated that the boy had died a hero much like &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Varok reminded &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who was lamenting the broken peace between the Alliance and the Horde, of his duty to lead their people.\nAfter Garrosh and Thrall returned to Warsong Hold after a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Varok gave them a message from &lt;a href=\"Korm%20Blackscar\"&gt;Korm Blackscar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of the Lich King.\nHorde adventurers could find him standing near &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; inside Icecrown Citadel at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. High Overlord Saurfang commanded the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" during the &lt;a href=\"Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;Gunship Battle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Varok appeared in both encounters with &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, though the exact circumstances differed depending on the adventurers' faction.\n Following Horde adventurers' victory in the Gunship Battle, Varok joined them in confronting &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt;, now risen into a powerful champion of the Lich King. He refused his son's offer to join him in the Scourge and declared that his boy died at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Once the undead form of his son was defeated, Varok collected his son's body, promised to give Dranosh a proper ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, and finally told Horde adventurers: \"Honor, young heroes. No matter how dire the battle, never forsake it.\"\n Following Alliance adventurers' victory in the Gunship Battle, Varok was forced to retreat. Despite his retreat, he returned after his son had been slain in order to collect his body. Though &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; initially refused to let him pass, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; arrived and Varian told Muradin to let the grieving father pass. Varok claimed his son's body and declared that he would not forget the king's kindness before leaving with his son's corpse.\nAs he had promised, Varok personally cremated Dranosh in Nagrand, near the final resting places of the &lt;a href=\"Remda\"&gt;boy's mother&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of his family. The death of his son deeply wounded Varok, and he wished to grieve in peace. His absence meant that the Horde no longer had his experience and leadership, and that would create severe problems in the days to come.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nSome months before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Garrosh. It was revealed that Saurfang would remain within the hold as part of the Horde's Northrend skeleton crew and as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. As Cairne bid Saurfang farewell, he could see in the orc's eyes that he knew that there would be plenty of ghosts to haunt him, if only in his memories.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nThrall mentioned that he would head over to Orgrimmar to find any orcs that wish to rebel against Garrosh, specifically Eitrigg and Saurfang.\nSaurfang arrived at the siege to fulfill the promise he made to Garrosh many years before. He met with Thrall and attempted to enter Orgrimmar but was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrim sent the Kor'kron army away and let the two orcs inside but could not guarantee their safety. Varok then followed Thrall to the lair of Hellscream below Orgrimmar. However, he became injured in a battle against &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; and insisted that Thrall continued without him. He was later encountered by heroes seeking to destroy Hellscream and end his reign and asked them about the fate of General Nazgrim. He was saddened to hear of Nazgrim's demise and laments the loss of the great leader and warrior Nazgrim has been. He then retrieves his axe from a dead mantid and returns to the surface.\nWar Crimes.\nSaurfang accompanied &lt;a href=\"Go%27el\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; to the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. He agreed with Baine as Garrosh's defender. Acknowledged as a hero by Horde and Alliance alike, he was called upon by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; as the third witness, and told the court of his conflicts with Garrosh in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. His threat to kill Garrosh should he take the orcs down another dark road (and his subsequent uprising against Garrosh in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;) was key testimony, and seen as proof by many that Garrosh had gone too far in the eyes of some fellow orcs.\nHowever, Saurfang did not desire the court to give Garrosh a death sentence. Were it up to him, Garrosh's love for his people would have earned him a trial tied to orcish customs, and a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; against Saurfang to determine whether he would live and repent or perish for his crimes.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nVarok is one of the several Garrison visitors that can appear every day. Upon entering &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; he will inform the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the Commander&lt;/a&gt; of various threats to the Draenor campaign and will direct them to deal with dungeon and raid bosses.\nLegion.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Varok became commander of the city's defenses. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; Varok barred the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; to a select few, and allowed the adventurer entry to see the dying &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Following Vol'jin's death, Varok was present at the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;s' funeral ceremony at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; took the mantle of Warchief, Varok was stationed inside &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; presiding over Orgrimmar as the leader of the orcs. Varok also personally led the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt; event from the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarok later traveled to the Broken Shore with a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, believing that he needed to regain his valor after the disastrous battle on the island. Unfortunately, he got shot by a &lt;a href=\"fel%20cannon\"&gt;fel cannon&lt;/a&gt; mid-air, asking the adventurer to proceed and make them pay. &lt;a href=\"Master%20Smith%20Helgar\"&gt;Master Smith Helgar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; later sent the warrior adventurer to find Varok and duel him on the Broken Shore as he is believed to be the greatest axe wielder on Azeroth and could be an inspiration to forge &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanite%20Bladebreaker\"&gt;The Arcanite Bladebreaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; adventurer reached Prestige Rank 2, Varok could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he was present at the ceremony hosted by newly-appointed Warchief Windrunner that congratulated the adventurer for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the Warchief, as well as an artifact appearance.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang will ride out of the city to the festival grounds at 8:10 A.M. and 8:10 P.M. each day for the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%23Tapping%20of%20the%20Keg\"&gt;tapping of the keg&lt;/a&gt; at 8:15. Adventurers present when he does this receive a 2 hour \"Brewfest Enthusiast\" &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; that increases &lt;a href=\"Experience%20point\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; gained by 10%.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Varok Saurfang was the last Horde leader to join the Orgrimmar parade. Though &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; grudgingly respected Varok, she also sensed that out of all the Horde leaders, Varok was most likely the one to challenge or outright oppose her should she misstep too badly.\nAt a dinner celebrating the Legion's defeat, Saurfang and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; expressed distrust towards &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, who went to speak with Sylvanas privately about a &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;mysterious new substance&lt;/a&gt;. When Baine told Saurfang that Gallywix had been sending many of his goblins to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang angrily stated that nothing good ever came from Silithus.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; had been saturated with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt;. Since it would be too costly for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to uproot them all, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had chosen to tolerate their presence. After Varok chastised a group of Orgrimmar &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s who were drunk on guard duty, Varok traveled to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; to attend the secret meeting he was summoned to by his warchief. After Sylvanas assured Varok that her champion &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt; was keeping this meeting private from Alliance spying, Sylvanas asked Varok to make a hypothetical battle plan on how to sack &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter evaluating all the scenarios he could think of, Varok concluded that the Horde would be unable to sack Stormwind City, and any progress at doing so would be tentative at best. Sylvanas suggested Varok think of a more elaborate strategy with Stormwind's conquering as the final phase rather than the sole objective. Enraged by Sylvanas' warmongering, Varok finally questioned his warchief why she was eager to start a bloody war with the Alliance. Sylvanas rationalized that she believed that the Alliance and Horde will never forgive the transgressions they had committed against one another and that war was inevitable. Thus, the only way to ensure peace for the Horde was to dominate the Alliance in war and win it on their terms. When Varok suggested that the Horde should then be preparing to defend themselves for the next war instead of instigating it, Sylvanas countered by explaining that while Varok himself had shown that Stormwind City was seemingly impenetrable to conquering, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; showed that Orgrimmar was not; thus the Horde was more vulnerable to losing in a war than the Alliance. With &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; undoubtedly changing warcraft, Sylvanas proposed that they take every opportunity to achieve victory and ensure lasting peace for future generations of the Horde. Varok came to agree with Sylvanas' sound reasoning but still could not fathom what strategy would be effective enough to sack Stormwind when they lack the logistics to maintain an invasion.\nSylvanas led Varok to the realization that the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;war with the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had weakened both factions' navies and the deterrence of swift reprisal that enforced the stalemate between the Horde and Alliance was no longer feasible. With both the Alliance and Horde's navies diminished, they would be unable to transport troops and thus would be slow to project military power to reinforce distant warfronts. With such a weakness, the Horde could secure &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the center of Alliance military power in Kalimdor, would be a feasible target to conquer; especially if the Horde took the Alliance by surprise. The cost, however, would be that their holdings in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; would likely be susceptible to reprisal, especially Sylvanas' own capital, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas, however, proposed to politically divide the Alliance by baiting the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; into demanding the Alliance prioritize the retaking of their homeland and thus dividing the Alliance's forces. The Alliance would lack the fleet nor the strength to retake Kalimdor and thus weaken or become politically fractured. Furthermore, holding Darnassus hostage would paralyze the Alliance from counterattacking as the night elves would not stand for their city being annihilated and thus create a divide between them and the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt;s, who had lost their nation years ago and were not prioritized for military aid on that warfront either. With such a political crisis, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; would not be able to act and each Alliance nation will act in its own interest to defend themselves from a unified Horde. Varok came to the realization that was how they intended to defeat Stormwind, by politically carving each individual nation away from the Alliance and then dominating them into a surrender. However, Sylvanas was well aware that they can only divide the Alliance if the war to conquer Darnassus does not unite the Alliance against the Horde. That can only happen if the Horde wins in an honorable victory, which Sylvanas knows the Horde doesn't trust her to do. Thus, Sylvanas authorized Saurfang to create the battle plans and execute their strategy.\nTo lure out the Alliance from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas suggested duping the Alliance spies into believing a false narrative. Thus, Varok began planting misinformation and acting out an adversarial relationship with Sylvanas and Nathanos to make it seem as if he was priming the Horde to monopolize the Azerite in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; and was also bullying Sylvanas into endorsing his campaign. The Alliance took the bait; fearing the Horde was proliferating Azerite weapons, they sent a sizable night elf fleet to Silithus as deterrence. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Stormwind City to help the Alliance leadership plan the war, leaving only &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his skeleton crew of night elf defenders for the Horde to contend with. To scare the night elves into surrendering without creating a unifying atrocity for the Alliance to rally to, Varok suggested they bring many &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s with them. That way, the threat of raining death on Darnassus with impunity would deter the night elves in the city from resisting.\nBefore the Horde commenced their invasion, Varok deployed Horde rogues as his vanguard force and had them attack every night elf patrol and outpost. When the Horde army reached the junction in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang revealed to his army their secret plan to conquer Darnassus. After galvanizing his army with promises of battle and glory, Saurfang led the Horde to invade Ashenvale. Despite the Horde's overwhelming numbers, the night elf defenders met the invading army with fierce resistance. The night elves managed to hold off the Horde at the &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt; for a while until the Horde overcame them and routed their army. As the night elves fell back deeper into the forests, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; spoke to Varok from the concealment of the woods. Varok proclaimed that the night elves' lands would soon belong to the Horde and offers the night elves a chance to leave in peace; Malfurion responded that the Horde will pay in blood for each step it gains.\nDuring the Horde's march on Ashenvale, the forces led by Saurfang were lured into an ambush by Malfurion Stormrage and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;. Astranaar, being an island, was somewhere that Saurfang realized the Horde could not escape from. Saurfang challenged Malfurion to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; in order to buy his tacticians time to escape with their battle plans, but Malfurion did not care about orcish duels and was after Saurfang's life. He overwhelmed Saurfang and used &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt; to bind his legs, and Saurfang admitted to himself that there was nothing he could do against Malfurion's power. But as the inn they were fighting in began to collapse around them, Sylvanas fired an arrow of dark magic at Malfurion, distracting him from Saurfang. Saurfang was buried under collapsing rubble while Sylvanas rallied the Horde to route the night elves. Once Astranaar was secured, the Horde rescued Saurfang from the rubble. Saurfang was then briefed that Ashenvale was secure and the next step for the Horde was to advance to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Horde invaded Darkshore, many of their men were incinerated by the wall of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s Malfurion had erected. To compound to their troubles, the night elven fleet had returned and were aiding in the kaldorei defense. The night elves' defenses were enough to halt the Horde's advance, and Sylvanas and Saurfang knew they needed to act quickly before &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s reinforcements arrive to stop the invasion. Thus Sylvanas and Saurfang came up with a plan to divide the wisps' attention on multiple fronts, thus diminishing their effectiveness. Saurfang and Nathanos Blightcaller took a group and went to &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;; once there, they used a smuggler's passage to scale the mountain pass. Once they reached the north of Darkshore, they began desecrating the forest, distracting the wisps and dispersing the wisp wall. That allowed the Horde army under Sylvanas to breach the wisp wall. Saurfang later regrouped with the Horde army and oversaw the conquering of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaurfang found Sylvanas and Malfurion battling on the shores of Darkshore. Should Sylvanas fall in battle, it was up to Saurfang to kill Malfurion. The chaotic battle obscured who was the victor, but when Saurfang saw antlers, he instinctively threw his axe which transfixed upon Malfurion's back. The moment it hit Malfurion, Saurfang had regretted it, as the fight had not ended and he had dealt Malfurion a dishonorable blow. Sylvanas however, commended him for his actions and gave Saurfang the honor of finishing Malfurion off. Saurfang however, could not bring himself to kill him. Saurfang's chance to do so was soon over as Tyrande had arrived to protect and heal Malfurion. Though Tyrande criticized Saurfang for leading the Horde into this dishonorable war, Saurfang was unrepentant as he felt victory in this war was necessary for the survival of the Horde. For not killing her husband, Tyrande had decided not to kill Saurfang so long as he did not interfere in allowing both of them to leave in peace. Saurfang agreed, but also warned her that Darnassus was lost and if she returned to Teldrassil, she and Malfurion will die. Tyrande and Malfurion &lt;a href=\"hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;d to Stormwind and although he was sure Malfurion would recover and pay back the Horde in blood, he felt content in his decision as it was honorable.\nWhen Saurfang reported back to Sylvanas, Sylvanas and Nathanos were displeased to learn that Saurfang had allowed Malfurion to escape alive. When Sylvanas ordered to secure the beach, Varok ordered Nathanos to join the first wave in conquering Darnassus. However, Nathanos was contrary and wanted to fulfill a list of orders from his warchief. Ignoring Nathanos' contempt, he spotted the night elf ships &lt;a href=\"Morka%20Bruggu\"&gt;Morka Bruggu&lt;/a&gt; had commandeered and started making arrangements to use the ships to sail them to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Before he could act on his plans, Sylvanas ordered the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The siege weapons had carried out the task efficiently quick once Sylvanas had become stern with her order, and Saurfang could only watch in shock and dismay. Once the second volley launched, Saurfang tried to stop the siege, but it was too late. Once the second barrage hit, the lower half of the World Tree was engulfed in flames. The fire moved as if it were alive, climbing the tree, scrambling toward the city in the heights of its branches. Saurfang tried to rationalize Sylvanas' order but could come to no other conclusion other than madness. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; was meant to divide the Alliance, instead this atrocity would be its rallying cry and they would stop at nothing to get their vengeance. Varok roared at Sylvanas and scolded her for her lack of honor and the danger she put the Horde in. Sylvanas however, was calm and was already proceeding with planning the defense of Undercity. When Varok accused Sylvanas of damning the Horde for a thousand generations, Sylvanas retorted that this was a war and a failure of his own making. Darnassus was never the objective; the goal was to create a wedge that would split the Alliance apart. Sylvanas needed a weapon that would destroy hope and Varok gave that up to spare Malfurion. The genocide in Teldrassil is Sylvanas' way of remedying Saurfang's blunder. Sylvanas believes that the Alliance will now fight in pain and that will give them a chance at victory. Despite Saurfang's anger at Sylvanas, Varok believed she was right. A wound that can never heal was the objective and Saurfang had failed to inflict it on the Alliance. Now a prolonged war will come that will cost countless lives, and both the Alliance and the Horde would both understand that the only choices they have is victory or death. As Sylvanas turned back toward the World Tree, watching it burn, Saurfang made himself watch the flames consume city and citizens alike. He would not dishonor himself further by turning away. As he watched the genocide occur in front of him, Saurfang reflected on all the death he committed in past wars such as &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; and Stormwind and was ashamed that this time, there was no haze of corruption now to soften the horror. Saurfang lamented he had dishonored himself and the Horde in this war and would carry that burden with him until the end of his days; which he hoped would come soon.\nBattle for Lordaeron.\nOn the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Varok went up on the ramparts of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces were amassing before the fortress, as retaliation for the &lt;a href=\"burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, something he had warned Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; of. He was found by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, who asked him for advice, and told him about his eagerness to die with honor and glory. Saurfang's only advice to him was not to die, and he added that there was no honor or glory in this war.\nDisillusioned with the Horde, the orc removed his armor and went to meet the Alliance army head-on and alone, and finally earn the warrior death he longed for. With a torch held high above him, there would be no doubt that they would see him approaching. However, the young troll rushed to him and convinced him to live another day by returning &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh's&lt;/a&gt; necklace, which Varok had left behind to burn in a brazier. Varok took it, the same way he retrieved it from Dranosh's body, and returned back behind the walls just as the dawn arrived and the Alliance prepared to march forward.\nAs the war raged above the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Varok and the Horde champion initially worked on evacuating the city's civilians and fighting any infiltrators they found from the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Quarter\"&gt;Trade Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. After the evacuation, Varok soon joined Sylvanas in Lordaeron Keep.\nHe defended &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, taking up the Horde banner and leading the charge. The orc leader managed to strike an uppercut with the haft of his axe on the Alliance leader, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, knocking down the young king but was pushed back by King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Sylvanas and Saurfang looked in awe as Wrynn conjured a massive dome of light to heal and rally his wavering men, before clashing once again with the Alliance.\nWhen the Horde began to lose the battle, Saurfang was against Sylvanas's decision to use the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;. He argued with her that Horde troops would be caught in the field of fire, to which Sylvanas found it to be acceptable losses. He then vanished, watching the results of Sylvanas's tactics: the blight killed Alliance and Horde alike and Sylvanas raised them as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Varok returned when the Horde was pushed back to Lordaeron Keep's courtyard. There, Varok confronted Sylvanas about her honorless strategy, but she didn't care about honor; only victory. Sylvanas told Varok he could follow her or die his warrior's death and threatened to raise him as undead afterward. She then ordered everyone else to the Lordaeron throne room, while Saurfang chose to stay behind to face the encroaching Alliance army.\nOutside in the courtyard, Saurfang waited to confront the Alliance forces and refused Anduin's offer to stand down. He was defeated, but Anduin ordered his forces to stop before any could kill him, much to Saurfang's chagrin as he wanted an honorable death. Anduin said that &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; had told him that Saurfang represented what was best about the Horde and admired him for that, and the new king felt the same. Anduin attempted to persuade Saurfang that simply dying there had no honor; while Saurfang disagreed that an Alliance king had any say in such matters, Anduin stated that for that moment it was, and then ordered his men to take the High Overlord to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockades\"&gt;Stormwind Stockades&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin stated his intention to speak with Saurfang about reclaiming honor after returning to Stormwind, though Varok was skeptical that Anduin would live that long.\n&lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and the Horde adventurer infiltrated the Stockades to break out &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, and found Saurfang. Although they opened his cell, he stated that he had lost track of time and had spent it coming to a difficult decision: for her past actions, as long as Sylvanas was Warchief he would never return to her Horde. He also advises that one needs to know the difference between loyalty and honor and to pray to never have to choose between the two. Rokhan and Thalyssra respect his decision, and after he points out the way to the trolls, he bids them farewell with a simple \"lok'tar\" (victory), notably leaving out the \"Ogar\" (victory or death), and is left behind in his cell.\nLost Honor.\nSome time later, Anduin approached Saurfang in his cell to ask him why the orc had spared him at Lordaeron when he could have killed him and ended the war there. As Anduin asked him if he was wrong about Saurfang's honor and questioned if he wanted more innocents to suffer, Saurfang angrily shouted that he had given everything for the Horde but Sylvanas was destroying it, and what he wanted was to have his Horde back. Saurfang admitted to Anduin that the reason he had spared him was because he thought Anduin could stop Sylvanas, but as Anduin left the Stockades he told Saurfang he couldn't\u2014not alone. As Anduin left, he kept Saurfang's cell door open.\nTides of Vengeance.\nSaurfang left the Stockades via the sewers, emerging at &lt;a href=\"Mirror%20Lake\"&gt;Mirror Lake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;. As he traveled east into the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; of told the guards at &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt; to take the night off and provided them with plenty of alcohol to drink. Once they were drunk, they missed Saurfang passing by. Shaw also provided plenty of gold for more guards to stay at the &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; inn and told the captain of the guards to heavily guard the road from Lakeshire to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; due to a possible attack. Guards were pulled from southern Redridge as a result, allowing Saurfang to pass unhindered. It is unknown whether Saurfang knew of Shaw's actions.\nIn eastern Redridge, Saurfang came across Zekhan. Knowing that Sylvanas would send assassins after him, Saurfang told Zekhan to watch the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Pass\"&gt;Redridge Pass&lt;/a&gt; for any sign of Horde agents and to warn him if there were. With that Saurfang continued into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and set up camp at &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Reed%20Farm\"&gt;Misty Reed Farm&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually Saurfang was confronted by a team of Forsaken led by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lyana\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lyana&lt;/a&gt;, who had been following his trail from Mirror Lake and was there to kill him on Sylvanas's orders for turning his back on his duty and then conspiring with humans against Sylvanas. Zekhan and a Horde adventurer arrived and stood by Saurfang after all he had done for the Horde. When Lyana and her forces were killed, Saurfang told Zekhan and the adventurer to return to Orgrimmar and make it look like Saurfang escaped, to keep the adventurer in Sylvanas's favor, and so Zekhan could spread the word in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; that those who wish to restore the honor of the Horde must not give up hope. Promising his friends to see them again, Saurfang traveled further west into the swamp.\nMeeting with Thrall.\nIn the hopes of securing a future for the Horde, Varok returned to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; and sought out the home where &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his family had taken up residence. Upon reuniting with his old friend, Varok commented that despite the land's beauty, it was wrong, broken, and falling apart, just like the Horde. When he asked if Thrall knew what Sylvanas had done while he had been hiding, Thrall responded that he had left that life behind and would not take up the mantle of warchief again. Varok replied that he didn't ask for that but he had hoped he would at least fight for it. Moments later, the two orcs were attacked by Forsaken assassins. After a brief fight, they managed to defeat their ambushers, and Saurfang revealed that he had followed the assassins to Thrall's home. He continued, \"You and I... we don't get to hide\". With that, Thrall retrieved &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;an axe&lt;/a&gt; he had hidden in a compartment under his anvil and slung it over his shoulders, ready to fight for the Horde alongside Varok.\nRise of Azshara.\nSeeking to rescue &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang and Thrall made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; where they received aid from &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; who sent the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to aid them. As Saurfang, Thrall, and the Speaker ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; where they sought to minimize the spilling of Horde blood as they moved throughout the city. Amidst their quest, the group ran into &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, who had also come to rescue Baine at &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s request and after a brief moment agreed to work together to save Baine. When things started getting heated between Saurfang and Shaw, Jaina and Thrall were quick to get them focused on the task at hand. Upon nearly reaching Baine, the group was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Rowa%20Bloodstrike\"&gt;Rowa Bloodstrike&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed disappointment but not surprise by Saurfang's and Thrall's decision to rescue Baine. Unwilling to stand down, the group was forced to kill Rowa and moved forward to Baine, who was surprised at their presence. While Shaw moved to liberate Baine from his chains, Saurfang remarked that it felt too easy and the group was then attacked by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to kill them and Jaina in particular in vengeance for the &lt;a href=\"purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the group was successful in liberating Baine from his chains and Jaina teleported the group safely out of the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Jaina and Shaw departed to report the mission's success to Anduin, Saurfang asked for Jaina to let Anduin know that he did not stand alone.\nDeath.\nAs Saurfang's and Anduin's forces rallied together, Anduin and Saurfang had a private meeting in which Anduin asked what type of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Saurfang would be. In response Saurfang revealed that the Horde he joined was birthed by blood and tainted by &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;, founded on the great lie that anything it did was honorable as evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt; that was constructed with the bones of innocents leading to the Dark Portal. He further remarked that it wasn't Thrall or &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; but Sylvanas who inherited &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s bloody legacy. However, Anduin denied this telling him that his forces were the Horde but was interrupted by scornful Saurfang who remarked that he never knew honor. He further remarked that his loyalists deserved more and that he felt that the Horde was forever shackled to the past, which caused Anduin to point out that the Horde had no inclusive claim to regrets by invoking &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Saurfang was dismissive however pointing out that nothing could close the chasm between the Horde and Alliance, which made Anduin ask what they were fighting for. After a moment Saurfang and Anduin rallied their forces to break the cycle and defend Azeroth, with \"For Azeroth\" as their rallying cry.\nThus to protect Azeroth and depose of Sylvanas, the Horde revolutionaries and Alliance planned to strike at Orgrimmar and to that end set up camp in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. In response to Sylvanas's forces collapsing part of the canyon between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar, Saurfang turned to &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; breach the canyon. With his forces established within the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang turned to dealing with Sylvanas's spies and protecting their siege weapons. Knowing that Orgrimmar's greatest weakness was its multiple entrances Saurfang's strategy relied on attacking all three entrances at once. To that end, he directed for &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s forces to attack Orgrimmar from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to lead their forces to attack the city from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and he, Thrall, and Anduin would lead their forces to attack Orgrimmar from Durotar. He further ordered &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; to lead her people to protect &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; in case of Sylvanas launching a counterattack.\nHowever, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as their brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of Thrall voicing his suspicions that he would die. When Sylvanas questioned why she should accept his challenge, Saurfang merely pointed out that she wanted him to suffer, causing Sylvanas to wordlessly agree. While Sylvanas armed herself, Saurfang was granted &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;Dra'gora&lt;/a&gt; by Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; by Anduin. Sylvanas initially had the upper hand against Saurfang, however, when she began to mock him about hope, Saurfang got his second wind by declaring that Sylvanas couldn't kill hope. As Saurfang turned the tide against Sylvanas he claimed that she failed to kill hope at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, failed in getting the Horde and Alliance to keep killing each other, he further declared that the Horde would endure, that Horde was strong and was able to slash Sylvanas across her eye. This turn caused an enraged Sylvanas to declare that Horde was nothing, that they were all nothing. Sylvanas then killed Saurfang quickly with a blast of unknown magic, and abandoned the Horde altogether.\nLegacy.\nIn the aftermath of Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's betrayal, his beloved Horde reunited once more with her former loyalists defecting to his revolution. Saurfang's funeral was held in front of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where many heroes of the Horde and even a few of the Alliance attended. He was remembered for his role in leading the fight against &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and defending Azeroth against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall declared Saurfang an inspiration for all those who strived for true honor and that his legacy would live on their deeds. Anduin stated that his sacrifice would never be forgotten, and Thrall declared that Saurfang had earned his warriors' death and was to be buried in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; as he would have wanted. &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; believed that Saurfang's final act had given the Horde a renewal and rebirth, and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; credits their survival against &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; as a result of Saurfang's sacrifice.\nZekhan was deeply affected by Varok's death. When the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; asked him to serve as the Horde ambassador to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the troll hesitated at first but then accepted the mission after he thought he felt Saurfang's presence as a supporting hand on his shoulder. As part of a bargain, the death &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; later showed Zekhan a vision of Varok reunited with his family in a blissful afterlife where the old orc could hunt &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt; across the plains of Draenor with Dranosh and spend his evenings with his dearly missed wife, &lt;a href=\"Remda\"&gt;Remda&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to Zekhan, Bwonsamdi's vision was a lie, as the souls of almost everyone killed during the Fourth War were actually claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Shoaljai%20Tar%20Pits\"&gt;Shoaljai Tar Pits&lt;/a&gt;, Zekhan took it upon himself to save two captive Zandalari children from an ignited tar pool. As he carried them on his back, he tried to summon the wind to speed his feet, but nothing happened. He privately asked \"What now, ancestors?\" and heard Saurfang's voice reply \"You know\". He realized that this was true and used the wind to carry the children to safety while he remained stuck in the tar and only narrowly escaped death.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas drops a trinket named &lt;a href=\"Old%20Warrior%27s%20Soul\"&gt;Old Warrior's Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring events in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin fell under the control of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic, with his sword Shalamayne being transformed into the &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, as Anduin struggled to regain control from the Jailer, he suddenly saw his father &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; appear by his side to remind him that Shalamayne had been forged by valor, followed by Varok appearing at his other side to add that the sword had been forged by honor as well. Varian continued that both of their legacies along with that of Shalamayne were with Anduin. With their help, Anduin was able to split Kingsmourne back into its component swords of Shalla'tor and Ellemayne and free himself. It is not stated whether these appearances of Varok and Varian were their actual souls or only part of Anduin's imagination.\nAlthough Bwonsamdi's depiction of Varok's afterlife had been a false one, the old soldier did ultimately find peace in the afterlife, and managed to find and reunite with the souls of his family. During Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, an orc adventurer and Thrall's son &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt; created an offering of food to the orc ancestors. Unexpectedly, Varok's soul manifested alongside those of his brother Broxigar, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; to give their approval of the offering. Varok told Durak\u2014who was plagued with doubt about his own future\u2014that he would eventually find his life's path and that it would lead him to greatness. To the adventurer, Varok stated that he and the other ancestors were proud of them and would watch as they helped lead the orcs into a bright future. Finally, he asked the adventurer to deliver some personal messages to his friends: to tell Thrall that he was glad to have dragged him out of seclusion in Nagrand; to tell &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, who had originally suggested the recreation of the Kosh'harg only to face disagreement from Varok, that he had been right; and lastly, to inform Zekhan that Varok had found his family at last.\nQuotes.\nI am he that watches they.

He is one of the &lt;a href=\"Azure-Lord\"&gt;Azure-Lord&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and captain of the forces there.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Varos Cloudstrider has coordinated brutal attacks against the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; since the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. He was recalled to guard the Oculus, and he has already prepared his captains and drakes. Varos has also tapped the power coursing through the Oculus itself to bolster his defense.\"\nStrategies.\nThe fight is mostly a &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; which requires your party to be constantly repositioning to avoid the rotating Energize Cores arc. The ability causes several adjacent orbs around the outside edge of the platform to emit small tendrils toward Varos before releasing an actual blast that deals damage. The blast area depends on the location of the boss; if tanked in the center, the blast covers about 1/3 of the platform. Subsequent discharges always rotate one orb (1/8th of the platform) in a counter-clockwise direction.\nOn occasion Varos will summon a Captain who grabs a nearby flying drake and will start firing a beam onto the platform that follows one random group member and damages anyone on contact. Simply get as far as you can from it without putting yourself in danger of the Energize Cores or dragging the beam across another party member.\nAlthough some say that killing the dragons around the area will affect Varos' ability to summon Azure Captains, this is not true, as they appear out of thin air. However, in doing so you can eliminate the possibility for a player to accidentally aggro one of the nearby mobs (a player would have to target and attack one to pull it). It has been strongly recommended that you clear out the dragons above the platform so that the summoned Azure Captain doesn't aggro them.\nTanking in the center.\nThis is the most simple way to fight him, but somewhat dangerous for the tank. The tank should sit in the middle, only moving in small circles to avoid a laser beam from an Azure Captain.\nThe rest of the team will rotate around the tank and boss as needed. Remember that the Energize Cores will not over-rotate if the boss is moved or rotated (his position does not affect the location of the blast, only the length of it; imagine him firing a giant invisible cone of damage between the orbs).\nTanking around the edge.\nBecause the blast area of the Energize Cores appears between the orbs and Varos, a good tank can pull Varos to the edge of the platform (the one with the blast area) and drag him counter-clockwise around the platform (in the direction that the blast area is rotating). While tanking, try to stay on the inside of the circle to avoid getting hit by Energize Cores.\nWith the tank on the edge, the rest of the party can stand in the center of the area without having to dodge the blast area of the Energize Cores. Simply turn to keep facing Varos and avoid the beams as necessary.\nHealing Through.\nWith enough dps and healing a group with a group healer (Shaman or Holy Priest) can heal through the damage of Energize Cores.\nIf statically positioned at one side of the plataform you can get 3 to 4 Energize Cores blasts on a complete turn. Those blasts will drive your healer to switch group heals with tank heals to avoid the death of your tank (As example a Priest can use Prayer of Mending and Flash Heal trough the blast to have the tank at max health while party member retain enough health to survive the next blast).\nA lightwell can help if party members are trained on how to use it\nHaste potions and/or trinkets can help the healer to get his job done.\nWith this technique Varos fight becomes a dps race against your healer's mana pool."}

She was transformed into one of the monstrous naga when Azshara and her followers were sent to the bottom of the sea during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nTen thousand years later, Vashj answered &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s call and followed him first to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where she met up with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and rallied his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; to Illidan's cause, and then to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; when Illidan deposed &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; as lord of the shattered world. As the leader of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's naga&lt;/a&gt;, Vashj and her followers set up operations in the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, where the naga began to pump water from the region's lakes into their underground lair. During the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s invaded the &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt; where Vashj made her lair and slew the Coilfang matron.\nAfter her death, Vashj's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the warlike realm of the Necrolords in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;\u2014where she became a baroness serving under &lt;a href=\"Akarek\"&gt;Margrave Akarek&lt;/a&gt; in the House of Eyes, a faction of spymasters and assassins. The house was ultimately betrayed and destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, but Vashj remained a leader of the surviving Eyes and eventually joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; in the war against the traitorous Necrolords.\nBiography.\nLady Vashj was born in the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; as the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Lestharia%20Vashj\"&gt;Matron Lestharia Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, the city's beloved ruler. At some point, Vashj came to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; and became one of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s personal &lt;a href=\"handmaiden\"&gt;handmaiden&lt;/a&gt;s. Vashj considered it her birthright to serve Azshara. She copied the queen's hairstyle and clothing as much as possible. When the queen made Vashj her foremost handmaiden, remaining in the queen's favor became Vashj's sole concern. She was described as \"quite beautiful, with exotic, feline eyes\" although she was still not as beautiful as Azshara herself.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the Highborne were contacted by the titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara was enthralled by Sargeras' vast might. Like the queen, Vashj looked forward to his arrival on Azeroth; both women were certain that he would find Azshara irresistible.\nThe queen did indeed possess amazing charisma, and she doubtless enhanced it with magic. With a quiet word or a mere glance, Azshara could inspire any number of violent emotions; passion and rage were her favorite choices. Driven by sudden outbreaks of jealousy, her subjects occasionally squabbled over her affections and fought duels in the name of her honor. The queen was amused by such displays and did not always intervene to save the combatants from harm. It was precisely this sort of possessive fury that affected Vashj when Azshara and her handmaidens paid a visit to High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande had been captured by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in the palace. On a whim, the queen offered to make Tyrande one of her handmaidens, but Tyrande politely declined, saying she was sworn to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; before all others. Azshara was irritated by Tyrande's refusal, however diplomatic, and departed shortly thereafter.\nVashj could not forget the queen's offer so easily: the memory became a torment. Despite the fact that Tyrande had refused the queen, Vashj came to see the priestess as a rival for Azshara's affections. Irrationally certain that she had to act, Vashj tried to kill Tyrande but failed. Vashj then fled the prison cell before her attempt on Tyrande's life could be discovered.\nVashj herself was among the handmaidens who nursed &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; back to health after he got his eyes &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20sight\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; by Sargeras.\nCursed and transformed.\nDespite the Highborne's attempts to aid the Legion in summoning Sargeras, the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; was ultimately closed before Sargeras could reach &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was unable to withstand the added magical strain, and it began to collapse in on itself. Under the sudden impact, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; and the Well were blasted downward toward the ocean floor. The Well pierced the planet's molten core just before being utterly obliterated. Ancient Kalimdor was split apart, and the seas rushed in to fill the voids between the new landmasses. Azshara, Vashj, and quite a few other Highborne were caught in the rushing waters. Instead of drowning, however, Vashj and many others were cursed and transformed into &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Despite her subsequent mutations, Vashj has managed to retain her memories and personality. She has also become immortal, and she is not the only naga to receive this unexpected boon.\nWarcraft III: The Frozen Throne.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; contacted &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who was on Azeroth. Although Illidan had worked against the Legion's interests in the past, Kil'jaeden was willing to give Illidan another chance. If Illidan destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden promised to grant anything Illidan might desire. Accordingly, Illidan sought out new allies. He cast a powerful spell that reached the depths of the ocean, and a group of naga led by Lady Vashj responded, calling in some old &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; debts. One and all, they pledged themselves to Illidan. The naga did not come because of the history they shared with the former night elf, nor did they respect his demonic power. They came because the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; willed it and they sent them to make sure his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; succeeded so that it could spark a new war on Azeroth. If the former night elf became troublesome, they could simply command the naga to cut out his fel-corrupted heart. Their first act of loyalty was to facilitate Illidan's escape from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and bring him to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; confronted Vashj, the &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; inside of the tomb, she told Maiev that her justice had no place there, and when the warden demanded how she would know anything of the night elven way, Vashj replied by telling that the naga were night elves once. Then she slithered off to join Illidan in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Chamber of the Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan and the naga retrieved a magical artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. To use the eye, Illidan needed an additional source of magic. He located Dalaran and sent Vashj ahead to Lordaeron to scout the ley lines. When she arrived, her presence was noticed by the Lich King, who sent the Scourge to the ruins as well. Illidan and naga sorcerers later channeled a destructive spell through the Eye in order to destroy the Frozen Throne. Vashj and her naga were awed by the display of raw power. However, their attempt was thwarted, and Illidan made a hasty retreat to Outland in the hope of evading Kil'jaeden's wrath.\nMany naga died during the attack, but Lady Vashj and her surviving naga had managed to slip away from the fighting and take shelter deep within nearby &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan ordered her to find new allies for his army while he would scout Draenor.\nFurther allies.\nAt Illidan's direction, Lady Vashj and her naga sought out the Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his group of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Kael had been under the oppressive whip of a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; general named &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, who had sent Kael and his people on missions that any laymen could do while keeping the elves from the front lines. Kael first encountered Vashj when he found his &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; ruined, and thus his means across the river scuttled. She approached him with an offer of assistance. Kael was hesitant, having fought the naga alongside Maiev at Dalaran\u2014but Vashj insisted, and Kael accepted. Vashj watched Garithos' rage at Kael's dealings with her. But Garithos then sent Kael and his elves against an invading force of undead. Kael was eager to prove himself in battle, but Garithos recalled Kael's support, siege, and cavalry units to the front lines, leaving Kael with a very meager standing force.\nVashj felt that the time was ripe to intervene, and so offered her troops to strengthen his own. Kael was again hesitant, but Vashj insisted that it was better to survive than to obey the word of a rash tyrant. Together they defeated the undead forces and recaptured their bases. When Garithos approached, Kael ushered Vashj away, saying he could not ensure her safety. She did, but watched as Kael and his people were taken away in shackles supposedly for betraying the Alliance by siding with the naga. Vashj infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; through the sewer system and found Kael, killed his guards, and freed him. Vashj told Kael that escape was possible through the remains of the gate Kel'Thuzad had erected to summon Archimonde. She helped Kael escape the jails and kill &lt;a href=\"Jailor%20Kassan\"&gt;Jailor Kassan&lt;/a&gt;, robbing valuable items from the magical stores as they went, and freeing his people from their cells. Upon reaching the streets, however, Garithos proceeded to assault the portal with his forces. After a perilous defense, they fled through the portal to Outland.\nWhen they came through the portal to the shattered landscape of Outland, Vashj explained that it was once the homeworld of the orcs, but the destruction had turned it into the barren, broken waste it now was, and that Illidan was somewhere waiting for them. Vashj and Kael searched fruitlessly for days, until Vashj caught a familiar scent on the wind. Illidan had been captured by Maiev and was being hauled back to her base in a magical prison wagon. Vashj and Kael battled Maiev for dominance, but finally reclaimed the wagon and brought it back to their base, where Illidan was freed. Illidan thanked Vashj for her loyalty, but Vashj gave credit to Kael. Illidan then told them of his plan to rule Outland by overthrowing the current ruler &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd so Vashj and Kael defended Illidan as he closed the dimensional gates that supplied Magtheridon with his reinforcements. After they were all successfully closed, Illidan's armies &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Outland\"&gt;marched&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Vashj and her naga infiltrated the aqueducts and attacked the Black Temple from a side entrance, as &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the automated defenses. Vashj was responsible for killing the &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20of%20Torment\"&gt;Mistress of Torment&lt;/a&gt; with aid from only a few myrmidons and snapdragons for support. Eventually, they battled their way to Magtheridon, and in a titanic battle, defeated him.\nBut Kil'jaeden appeared and mocked their foolhardy attempt to betray him. He then commanded that they find the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and destroy it. Vashj, Kael, and Illidan went back to Azeroth and advanced upon &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, only to be met at every turn by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s prime generals. The battle came down to single combat between Illidan and the death knight Arthas Menethil. Arthas won the fight and warned Illidan to leave the planet and never return.\nThe Burning Crusade.\n \nOver the next few years, Vashj continued serving Illidan in the wastes of Outland. After &lt;a href=\"Gathios\"&gt;Gathios&lt;/a&gt; surveyed the defenses of Black Temple and found a weak point in its sewers, the blood elf asked Lady Vashj for assistance. She sent her champion, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Naj%27entus\"&gt;High Warlord Naj'entus&lt;/a&gt; and a small group of naga to guard the sewers.\nUnder the command of Vashj, the naga recently have begun to enslave the tribes of the Broken in an effort to bolster the naga's workforce and further their agenda in Outland. Nearly all of the &lt;a href=\"Wastewalker%20tribe\"&gt;Wastewalker tribe&lt;/a&gt; has been captured and put to work to drain the waters of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was to take control of all the waters of Outland, and through them, its people. To command the engineers who maintain and operate this machinery, Lady Vashj hired the renowned &lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%20Steamrigger\"&gt;Mekgineer Steamrigger&lt;/a&gt;, a gifted gnome technician whose illness has damaged his sanity.\nVashj herself carefully monitors Coilfang's operations from her seat of power within &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Far more at home here among the waters of the reservoir than locked within the cold stone walls of Black Temple, Vashj maintains a close eye on her minions and personally oversees the draining of Zangarmarsh. Lady Vashj would later partake in the battle in Shadowmoon Valley that would destroy Warden Shadowsong's forces and result in the warden's capture.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers invaded the &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt; where Vashj made her lair and slew the Coilfang matron, her dying breath an apology to her master.\nAttunement to the Battle of Mount Hyjal.\nAfter the Sundering ten thousand years earlier, Illidan had taken seven vials containing the waters of the Well of Eternity in order to create a new one at the top of Mt. Hyjal. Illidan used three to create the new Well of Eternity, but it was not known what happened to the other four until recently. It was revealed that Vashj received one of these vials, as did Kael'thas. In order to access the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, one must enter &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, Vashj's inner sanctum. The players must then slay Vashj and take her Vial of Eternity.\nShadowlands.\nShortly after her death, Vashj's soul arrived in the afterlife &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, the spymasters of the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. She was initially surprised by her destination, as she had always expected the afterlife to be a realm of beauty and extravagance and not a necrotic wasteland, but quickly found that she enjoyed the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt;'s fight for dominance more than any luxuries. Although she could have returned to her night elf form in the afterlife, she chose to retain the appearance of a naga\u2014it was in that form that she was recognized for her cunning and resolve, whereas during her time as a kaldorei, she was prized only for her beauty. Vashj swiftly earned the rank of baroness and came to serve as the trusted hand of &lt;a href=\"Akarek\"&gt;Margrave Akarek&lt;/a&gt;. The house's other baroness was &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;, but she and Vashj did not get along.\nVashj at some point took up the hobby of fishing at an isolated lake in southern Maldraxxus, a lake that was also inhabited by the soul of &lt;a href=\"the%20Lurker%20Below\"&gt;the Lurker Below&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; who'd served her in Serpentshrine Cavern and who'd been killed by adventurers.\nPursuing Mor'Bitan.\nAt one point, Akarek sent Vashj to investigate mysterious behavior in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, the same house destroyed the House of Eyes and killed Akarek. Draka\u2014following the margrave's orders\u2014went on to join the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, but Vashj saw this as Draka abandoning her loyalties and duties. Along with a group of surviving Eyes, including her servant &lt;a href=\"Khaliiq\"&gt;Khaliiq&lt;/a&gt;, Vashj continued trying to complete her final mission by claiming revenge against &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Bitan\"&gt;Mor'Bitan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; responsible for her house's fall. Draka eventually sent the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; to find Vashj in the marsh of &lt;a href=\"Glutharn%27s%20Decay\"&gt;Glutharn's Decay&lt;/a&gt; and recruit her help to the Chosen's side, but Vashj refused to do so before her mission was complete. On the baroness' request, the Maw Walker captured Mor'Bitan's lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Mephiles%20the%20Loyal\"&gt;Mephiles&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Vashj to extract his memories and learn of a secret ritual Mor'Bitan was planning at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Mound\"&gt;Rotting Mound&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker and baroness worked together to sabotage the ritual before luring the lich into the open and killing him. This act of deception empowered &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Guile\"&gt;one of the runes&lt;/a&gt; on the Maw Walker's &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt;, which Vashj recognized as having been forged by Maldraxxus' lost ruler, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. She admitted that this changed things and that the hero's help had earned her allegiance, so she agreed to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; to join her forces with Draka's. Vashj and Khaliiq subsequently helped defend the Seat when it was attacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nArt of War.\nAlthough Draka and her allies gained control of the Seat, it continued to be besieged by the traitor houses. Vashj devised a plan to permanently bolster the Seat's defenses: they would steal a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; from their foes. However, this would require aid from other surviving members of the House of Eyes. Vashj, Khaliiq, and Maw Walkers who had pledged themselves to the necrolords traveled north to the remains of Akarek's fallen necropolis &lt;a href=\"Nurakkir\"&gt;Nurakkir&lt;/a&gt;, which was being plundered by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;. There they met up with &lt;a href=\"Whisperer%20Vyn\"&gt;Whisperer Vyn&lt;/a&gt;, who had served aboard the fortress. Commanding a necropolis would require a complete crew, so the Maw Walkers were tasked with recruiting a navigator (Vyn's traumatized sister &lt;a href=\"Navigator%20Xennir\"&gt;Xennir&lt;/a&gt;), a mechanic (&lt;a href=\"Ansid%20the%20Mechanic\"&gt;Ansid&lt;/a&gt;, a Construct defector imprisoned by his fellows), and a helmsman (&lt;a href=\"Helmsman%20Caliroux\"&gt;Caliroux&lt;/a&gt;, a lich from the House of Rituals whom Khaliiq helped the Maw Walkers summon and enslave). With the crew assembled, the Eyes and the Maw Walkers proceeded to kill the Constructs' head gutter &lt;a href=\"Gorgantus%20the%20Gutter\"&gt;Gorgantus&lt;/a&gt; and take control of Nurakkir. Shortly after, the crew and the Maw Walkers put Vashj's plan into action and took control of the Construct necropolis &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;.\nVashj partook in the joint &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; and necrolord assault on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt;. Her spies identified several &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Projector\"&gt;astral projectors&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; to rally their troops, and she tasked Maw Walkers with destroying them in order to strike a blow to the Constructs' morale. Later, the baroness accompanied the necrolords as they assaulted &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;the stronghold&lt;/a&gt; of the House of Rituals in order to remove the influence of the traitor &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; (who was the one ultimately responsible for destroying the House of Eyes). Vashj fought alongside the other necrolords as they pushed through the house's southern entrance, into the &lt;a href=\"Grimoirium\"&gt;Grimoirium&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually into &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt; to confront their target alongside reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; (which included the soul of Vashj's old traitorous ally, Kael'thas). During the battle with Kel'Thuzad, Vashj and the others focused on holding off the lich's &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Bulwark\"&gt;skeletal minions&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walkers dealt with the lich himself. After Kel'Thuzad escaped in defeat and the necrolords gained the allegiance of &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;, Vashj commented that she'd had doubts about the Maw Walkers at first but that they had proven themselves to be valuable champions of the covenant.\nChains of Domination.\nVashj accompanied the covenant forces who invaded the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally appears as a visitor in &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the return of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, Vashj participated in the united covenant attack on &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, which she found to be exhilarating. She and Khaliiq subsequently returned to the Seat to witness the Primus naming Draka the new Margrave of the Chosen. Vashj was unimpressed by her rival's promotion, and when Khaliiq told her that the Primus would surely soon make her the margrave of the Eyes, Vashj replied that she'd earn her title through the relentlessness and guile that characterized their house.\nThe baroness returned to Keeper's Respite, where the covenants faced consistent problems with disguised &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; infiltrating their forces. In life, Vashj had learned from Illidan how to identify dreadlords, but she couldn't be in all places at once and reported the problem to the Primus. The necrolord leader asked a Maw Walker to go to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the help of &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who'd fought nathrezim in the past\u2014and at the same time help &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; forge a new &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; for the venthyr. Due to her experience with the nathrezim, Vashj was sent along to help the Maw Walker. She took Khaliiq and two of her &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Vashj\"&gt;other devoted&lt;/a&gt; with her. At &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;, she again ran into her old ally Kael'thas\u2014whom she mocked for his alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the venthyr &lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;Accuser&lt;/a&gt;, who repeatedly tried to make the baroness \"atone\" for her crimes. Vashj asked the Accuser to let Kael'thas join her and the Maw Walker on their mission. The Accuser agreed but told the Maw Walker to keep an eye on the two, since she worried that the baroness might be a bad influence on Kael. The trio accompanied Renathal's envoy to the Stonewright in &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Keep\"&gt;Dominance Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but the latter revealed that several members of Renathal's group were dreadlords themselves. Upon being unmasked, the nathrezim leader &lt;a href=\"Nal%27ragas\"&gt;Nal'ragas&lt;/a&gt; stole the Stonewright's &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;:Medallion of Wrath&lt;/a&gt; and teleported the Maw Walker, Vashj, and Kael to another part of the keep.\nThe trio used Vashj's &lt;a href=\"%3AOrb%20of%20Revelation\"&gt;:Orb of Revelation&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the tool she and Kael had once used to detect nathrezim during their time in the Illidari\u2014to uncover more infiltrators in the area and tracked Nal'ragas down to take back the Medallion of Wrath. When they caught up with her, however, she'd already given the medallion to her superior &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. Nal'ragas recognized Vashj and Kael as Illidan's lackeys and cryptically told them \"&lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt; sends his regards\" before they killed her. To track the medallion, Renathal, the Stonewright, and the three dreadlord hunters returned to Sinfall, where the latter uncovered even more of the infiltrators and their communications. Renathal and his fellow Harvesters performed a ritual that revealed that Mal'Ganis was in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker, Vashj, Kael, and the Stonewright headed there to confront the demons. With reinforcements from Renathal and the other venthyr, they imprisoned Mal'Ganis and took back the medallion, though the rest of the nathrezim managed to achieve their true objective of rescuing their imprisoned master &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, the Accuser remarked that Kael and Vashj seemed to have complimented each other well, allowing Kael to let go of more of the sins his soul was burdened with.\nReturning to Maldraxxus, Vashj tasked Khaliiq with helping Margrave Sin'dane clear out Kel'Thuzad's remaining loyalists\u2014the last of the traitors who'd been involved in Akarek's death\u2014from the House of Rituals. Before she could go about this mission, however, Khaliiq was sought out by a Maw Walker and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted her to help them save &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Vashj's old nemesis\u2014from the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker and Khaliiq returned to Vashj at the &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Redoubt\"&gt;Bleak Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; to ask for her permission. She allowed that her devoted could aid the Night Warrior, but only after she'd finished her current task. When Khaliiq asked if Vashj had known Tyrande in life, the baroness simply replied \"I know she is hard to kill\", then told Khaliiq to focus on the mission.\nEternity's End.\nVashj was one of the covenant representatives that the Primus summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to witness the opening of a portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Zereth Mortis, Maw Walkers found a &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Goop\"&gt;strange substance&lt;/a&gt; that they believed could be used to create a lure for &lt;a href=\"Hirukon\"&gt;Hirukon&lt;/a&gt;, an elusive &lt;a href=\"aurelid\"&gt;aurelid&lt;/a&gt;. They sought out Vashj at her favorite fishing spot in southern Maldraxxus to ask for her help, since she was familiar with deep sea creatures. The baroness stated that, in life, she could've used the substance to create a lure for the aurelid, but the required materials had been left behind in the mortal realm\u2014specifically near places where she spent most of her life. The Maw Walkers traveled back to the world of the living and obtained the items: a &lt;a href=\"Coilclutch%20Vine\"&gt;coilclutch vine&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Ruins of Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;, the city of her birth; a &lt;a href=\"Flipper%20Fish\"&gt;flipper fish&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, where she lived as a naga for millennia; and a &lt;a href=\"Pungent%20Blobfish\"&gt;pungent blobfish&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, the place of her death. Upon being given the materials, Vashj crafted the lure for the heroes as requested and, as an afterthought, thanked them for bringing her reminders of her past.\nAppearance.\nBefore her monstrous transformation, Vashj was described as being \"quite beautiful\". Her clothes were similar to those of her mistress, but lower quality. The only thing that made her stand out from the other handmaidens were her exotic feline eyes.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Vashj had turquoise/light blue skin, six arms with long, clawed and webbed fingers, and a long, scaly tail (which she joked about tripping over from time to time) with pink fins. In place of hair, she had about eighteen snakes on her head (one of which was actually a moray eel), which served as her \"extra\" eyes. Like most other female naga, her face largely retained its elven features, though it had exotic markings on it.\nQuests.\nChains of Domination campaign.\nIntroductory portion:\nDominance Keep portion:\nQuotes.\nWarcraft III: The Frozen Throne.\n\"For unit quotes, see &lt;a href=\"Quotes%20of%20Warcraft%20III/Neutral%20Heroes%23Naga%20Sea%20Witch\"&gt;Quotes of Warcraft III/Neutral Heroes#Naga Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn the TCG.\nIn her pre-&lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; form, Vashj is classified as a night elf &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nLady Vashj is an ancient naga priestess dedicated to the service of her race\u2019s queen, Azshara. Wicked and brilliant, Vashj served as one of Azshara\u2019s favored agents for many centuries-quietly planning the naga\u2019s return to the hated surface world. When Queen Azshara finally decided to make the naga\u2019s existence known, she sent Lady Vashj to establish contact with the surface dwellers. Lady Vashj met the demoncursed Illidan and they struck a pact to aid each other against their night elf enemies. To this day, Lady Vashj still serves her master Illidan in the wastes of Outland. Though her heart and loyalties lie with her Queen and her race, Vashj enjoys working with Illidan and sowing discord and terror wherever she can.\nShe was a &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;, which made her a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nVashj leans on her combat abilities more than her magic, but she is still a formidable sorceress. She is peerless with her magic bow. She wears &lt;a href=\"Witch%27s%20Circlet\"&gt;Witch's Circlet&lt;/a&gt;. Her longbow, &lt;a href=\"Frostfathom\"&gt;Frostfathom&lt;/a&gt;, was crafted by the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; and enchanted by Queen Azshara. Lady Vashj favors wind and water elemental powers when casting offensively. A retinue of naga &lt;a href=\"myrmidon\"&gt;myrmidon&lt;/a&gt; bodyguards always accompanies her.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Queen Azshara, formerly a beloved leader of the Highborne, escaped death in the depths of the sea when the Well of Eternity imploded. Such salvation came at a great cost, as the queen and many of her fellow Highborne were forever transformed into the monstrous naga, doomed to wander the seas for thousands of years. Their existence mostly remains a mystery to the peoples of modern Azeroth, though the Earthen Ring has learned of Azshara's naga seizing Vashj'ir for an unknown purpose as the cries of the elements echo across Azeroth from the Abyss.\"\nThe Sunken City.\nVashj'ir is a level 80-82 zone in \"\" where players will be called to explore the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; and stop the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; from seizing immeasurable power from the realm of &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; the Tidehunter. This expansive underwater zone will feature an unprecedented fight for survival against the naga overwhelming the area, several new quest hubs - including &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; naval ships and &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s - all-new underwater travel and combat mechanics, several pocketed undersea caves free from water's grip, a new five-player dungeon (&lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;), and the first-ever opportunity to explore the remains of the once-majestic city of Vashj'ir.\nBottled Distress Message Found Adrift at Sea.\n\"Need your help. Time is short. I'm held captive in what I hope to be a nightmare.\"\n\"Enjoying the ocean air just days ago. We were determined to control key trade routes through victory at sea over the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Their fleet came into our scopes. Our world became the deafening sound of battle, the smell of gunpowder, and the feeling of fear. Looking back now, though, that wasn't real fear.\"\n\"We weren't alone in those waters. Our naval warfare attracted attention and rendered us prey. With our vessel already torn apart and taking on water, we saw a tremendous creature rise from the depths and shatter the hull, sucking us down to the sea floor. It all happened so fast. I was quick to tread the waters, hoping to regroup with any survivors I could find through a dense &lt;a href=\"Kelp%27thar%20Forest\"&gt;garden of kelp&lt;/a&gt;, constantly gasping for a chance breath. That's when the onslaught began. From all directions swarms of brutal &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; swept through and captured a great many of us. Beaten near to death, I awoke in agony, bound in chains.\"\n\"And here I still sit. I can only describe our prison as very big and somehow very much alive. We're in the hands of the naga now.

Explorers can spot their entrances by searching for yellow tube worms with purple shells. Here, adventurers can place campfires and eat food. Some refuges have an innkeeper, vendors, seahorse point, and even a mailbox.

Not that it does much good. Another demigod, &lt;a href=\"L%27ghorek\"&gt;L'ghorek&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in the Depths, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Breach\"&gt;Abyssal Breach&lt;/a&gt; leading to &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;'s domain!\nThe naga are preparing an all-out attack on the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, and it is up to adventurers to stop them! After defending the breach, players can choose to either follow &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Captain Taylor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Legionnaire%20Nazgrim\"&gt;Legionnaire Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; through the breach into the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; to mount a rescue, or return to the surface ship and head back to the mainland to head to their capital city, and then &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;."}

Seated atop a high plateau, Wintergrasp has remained undisturbed for ages, its icy winds howling unheard amongst the ancient titan fortifications that dot the landscape. The fortress with its domed watchtowers guards the entrance to the Vault of Archavon, which contains titan relics of untold power, protected by ancient giants. It is their task to protect the artifacts, and they are bitter about the intrusion by both sides.\nHowever, an abundance of elemental materials and its strategically important titan fortifications are making Wintergrasp the focus of a vicious tug-of-war between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. And then there are the persistent rumors of an ancient titan vault beneath Wintergrasp's keep. One can only marvel at the thought of what treasures may be waiting there...\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring his journey to collect information and find a way to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; came to the Vault to find answers. However, although there was a lot of material to study, the giants who made it their home were less than cordial when he arrived, still furious after their previous encounters with the adventurers from both factions.\nEncounters and loot.\nThe bosses of the Vault of Archavon drop a random assortment of gear in a similar style as classic \"World of Warcraft\" before the expansions. Class-specific pieces can drop for both the PvE and PvP sets. The loot can be all PvP, PvE, or a mix of the two. The loot is completely random and is not impacted by the raid makeup, so it is advantageous to bring a variety of class/spec makeups to increase the likelihood that someone can actually use the drops.\nIt should be noted that the PvP gear cannot be disenchanted but the PvE can. It should also be noted that should a group to wipe, depending on how long it takes to get the group reassembled some members may be flagged for PvP while others are not. This is because the watchers are all PvP flagged, having all members manually flag will prevent members from accidentally not having certain buffs when the fights start.\nIn addition to the noted loot, all four bosses of the instance have a rare chance to drop the &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Grand%20Black%20War%20Mammoth\"&gt;Reins of the Grand Black War Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; on either 10-player or 25-player mode.\nAchievements.\nThe \"Earth, Wind, and Fire\" achievement is currently the most difficult achievement for this instance. Even though it only awards and has no associated title reward, this was intentional according to a Blizzard official.\nDungeon denizens.\nMobs.\nAs of patch 4.0.1, the Warders in the hall leading to have been removed.\nExternal links.\n "}

Astride his magnificent &lt;a href=\"nether%20drake\"&gt;nether drake&lt;/a&gt; Nazan, Vazruden presents an unstoppable aerial force of fire, claws, and shrieking terror.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nStage Two: Nazan.\nWhen Vazruden reaches 40% remaining health, he calls for Nazan to land and aid him on the ground.\nStrategy.\nVazruden, along with his mount &lt;a href=\"Nazan\"&gt;Nazan&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the last two bosses of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Ramparts\"&gt;Hellfire Ramparts&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href=\"Omor%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Omor the Unscarred&lt;/a&gt; is the other.) The fight has two phases, and is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt; fight in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; in phase 1 and fighting &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; in phase 2.\nBegin the fight by killing the two guards at the bottom of the ramp. After they die, Vazruden lands and fights; phase two begins when Vazruden is close to death. Nazan will then fly down, and is much easier to defeat if you bring fire resist gear (particularly your tank) or potions. Of the two, phase two is far more difficult.\nIf Vazruden is killed but the group wipes on Nazan, Vazruden can be looted, but he will only drop the letter. Although it is possible to loot this letter, after you wipe the boss is reset along with the two guards, so be careful. The rewards from this encounter drop from a chest that spawns in the middle of the platform.\nTank-and-spank fight.\nThere are two ways of overcoming this encounter, it's either:\nA) Tank-and-spank Vazruden, taking him down fast. (He isn't very tough but does hit fairly hard.) Keep an eye out for Nazan firing &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; fireballs from above, as they become a &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; when they land. If one hits you, move out of the fire fast. If no one is attacking him, Nazan may go after your healer, so it may be wise to have a ranged DPS or caster class distracting him.\nB) DPS Nazan while he's in the air, and offtank Vazruden. Nazan won't land until Vazruden is on 40-50% or if Nazan himself is on 20%. Nazan starts by moving around the area and spitting fireballs at random targets, pets and even snaketraps help with this, setting up more random targets for Nazan to choose from. \nNazan moves around the area and has got 3 locations where he can be DPSed by melee as well, but remember that he also can hit in melee at these spots, so it is advised that the tank brings Vazruden and tanks Nazan (while airborne) if you have a lot of melee in the party to avoid getting killed (he hits for about 1000 on a rogue).\nWhile using this tactic, keep in mind that he seem to have an aggro-reset when he lands, obviously to allow the tank to get aggro, so stop putting up DOT's at 30-40% depending on your party's DPS.\nNazan will as said land when Vazruden is close to dying, or if Nazan himself is on 20% (a high DPS group can kill Vazruden fast enough so that he dies just as or slightly before Nazan lands), generally heading straight for your healer. Keep them at the back of the group, and taunt Nazan fast. Priests should be able to keep themselves safe by using fade as Nazan lands, to drop the threat they've built up whilst healing their tank. As a backup measure, they may want to cast on themselves at this point, just in case.\nWhen choosing your tank for this phase, consider that a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; with 300 FR will take less damage from Nazan than a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; with 100 FR will. Tank that lack FR should have a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; (even a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;) to take when Nazan lands. Fire resist buffs, shaman totem, fire ward etc. is a good idea for this part.\nHaving your tank turn Nazan away from the rest of the group is generally unfeasible when the opponent has an AoE fire attack, which then becomes a 500 per 2 seconds DoT, so the tank will be constantly moving away from them. If you're in front of Nazan and you're not the tank, move immediately. It is best to fight in the big ring, where an experienced tank may be able to move Nazan in a way that allows raid members to avoid the flames. Ask if your tank thinks they can do this beforehand.\nThe best method for tanks do to this is to try to place Nazan in the middle of the ring and slowly rotate him around as his &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s are placed down. This is for several reasons: First, it allows the tank to move out of the fire &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s. Second, it allows some control over where the &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; will be placed. This allows the group and the tank to have good positional awareness of where the &lt;a href=\"DOT\"&gt;DOT&lt;/a&gt;s are and can avoid them easily. Third, it allows the rest of the party to easily move behind Nazan since they will have a fairly good understanding of which way he will be facing. A way that I have tried is simply tanking Nazan facing the path that you come down to reach the boss, and keeping the rest of the group in the circle area. Just make sure to move off his fireballs occasionally, you shouldn't need to turn the boss too much.\nNazan has a huge hitbox, so it will be easy for melee classes to stay far away from the tank to avoid stacking up the fire.\nBridge fight (tank and spank).\nThe way I did this was by fighting the whole battle on the bridge with everyone else behind the tank, take down Vazruden in the same way as said before and when a fireball lands just move from side to side to get away from the fire, this part is fairly simple. When Nazan lands as before he will go for the priest but run straight past the tank, making it much easier for the tank to get aggro. Then turn him away from the rest of the group and try and move from side to side to keep out of his AoE fire breath. I found that a very easy way to tank this fight and we didn't lose a single person although we did have a very good group. (64 Lock, 64 Shammy, 61 Warrior(Me), 61 Druid and 61 Priest)(Champion of Norrath tactic (Azjol-Nerub))\nDecoy healer.\nIf Nazan is killing your priest when he lands, and your group includes a Druid or Paladin, you can try a \"Decoy Healer\" strategy to give your priest a fighting chance. The idea is that, until Vazruden dies, your Druid / Paladin main-heals while the priest does DPS. This keeps the priest off Nazan's aggro list, so when Nazan lands he'll head for the decoy. If done with a Druid, they'll want to shift to Bear form as soon as Nazan hits the ground. This spares your Priest from Nazan's initial charge and gives your tank opportunity to build aggro on Nazan. And even if the tanks taunt fails, at least Nazan isn't wailing on the priest. Once Nazan is on the ground, the priest picks up main-heal duties again.\nAnti-aircraft fight.\nThis is similar to the tank-and-spank, but can be better for parties that cannot handle both Nazan's claw and fire attacks at the same time for that long or for less experienced tanks.\nWhen Vazruden lands, have a tank on him and no one else touch him. When Nazan is in the sky, ranged DPS him until he is at roughly 50% health while dodging fireballs and healing the tank.\nAfter Nazan reaches 50% health, have all DPS go to Vazruden. When Nazan lands your tank should be exposed to the breath weapon for a much shorter time. You can DPS Nazan to 40%, but any lower and he will land early.\nIt may even work best if you DPS Nazan to 30% (when he lands) and then have your tank taunt him use all cooldowns to finish him as soon as possible. With Nazan dead killing Vazruden should be easy.\nWarlock felguard tank.\nIf you are having problems avoiding the fire damage done by Nazan, using a Warlock's Felguard to tank him can be useful. The Felguard has 50% AoE avoidance and will take very little damage from the Fire Breaths and Fire Pools.\nStrategy (Heroic).\nNOTE: \"Guard respawn bug\", after the first wipe, the mobs continue respawning for up to about 6 times each before Nazan finally drops Vazruden off. If both mobs are killed quickly and near the same time (within 5 or so seconds of each other) the mobs stop respawning. After a wipe it's best to get both down on the first spawn, or it's just wasted mana on an already mana intensive fight. (Note that you do go out of combat after these 2 so a quick drinking session is possible.)\nThe fight is similar to normal only, as expected with heroic battles, the damage dealt is greatly increased and the attacks come much faster with respect to the frequency of fireballs and breaths. High Fire resist, by all, and this fight boils down to a tank and spank. Lower fire resists and this fight becomes a \"dodge the pools of flame\" as they build up.\nFire damage is up to 4,000-5,000 per fireball and breath attacks. Pools of flame do 1,000-2,000 damage per tick. As such, the best fire protection potions in existence will be used up with 1 hit by a fireball and, in phase 1, he casts fireballs at random party members, about once every 4 seconds.\nIf you fully resist a fireball or breath hit, no pool of flame will be created so you don't need to dodge around pools of flame with high resists. At 260 fire resist (buffed), you can resist 3+ fireball shots in a row, at 160+ FR you can resist 2+ in a row.\nUnlike normal mode, the anti-aircraft method does not work at all. He will pretty much ignore attacks on him and keep fireballing your party members. Note that there are reports of successful anti-aircraft method done in heroic mode.\nIn phase 1, Vazruden also uses a fear to \"CC\" the melee around him. He will then charge a ranged/non-feared person and cloth folks are 1-2 shot dropped if you aren't prepared for this (trinket, fear ward, tremor totem, stance, etc..) -- he is a heroic boss so hits very hard.\nAt transition\u2014which occurs at 0%-40% health on Vazruden, when Nazan lands, have your tank backup to where he lands and tank both if needed (turning your back on a heroic boss costs the tank all shield benefits and defense\u2014as you may imagine, this can be very painful/lethal). Similar to normal mode, it is quite possible to drop Vazruden as Nazan is landing or shortly after he lands. Just finish off Vazruden and go to work on Nazan.\nBest bet for this fight\u2014stay out of the pools of flame, keep a steady stream of damage on the boss, keep Nazan facing away from your party while tanking him. If your party and tank can move/strafe out of fire pools, you should have little problems with this battle.\nLoot.\nLoot note.\nUpon killing Nazan, a &lt;a href=\"Reinforced%20Fel%20Iron%20Chest\"&gt;Reinforced Fel Iron Chest&lt;/a&gt; spawns to the side and two pieces of loot from this encounter are in there.\nMake sure you wait a bit after killing Nazan for the chest to spawn, and look around for it. The usual strategy putting Nazan in the center of the ring and rotating him as he breathes often has him dying over the chest, hiding it from view. (This is no longer a problem as the chest is now positioned at the far end of the ring, but can not be interacted with until Nazan is dead.)\nObjective of.\nVazruden dropped an &lt;a href=\"Ominous%20Letter\"&gt;Ominous Letter&lt;/a&gt; quest-starter which led to killing bosses in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt;."}

She trades in &lt;a href=\"Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt; for useful items in the Maw and &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe lives among the shadows and, through unknown means, has managed to survive inside the Maw for years away from the eyes of &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. She is the closest thing &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s can find to a friendly face in the Maw. However, Ve'nari is very elusive and seems to always know more than she is saying. She states that her relationship with the adventurers is pure business: they give what she wants, and she gives what they need.\nHistory.\nVe'nari along with other members of &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ve\"&gt;Cartel Ve&lt;/a&gt; were assigned to the Maw. In time Ve'nari would come to hide from the rest of the cartel. The reasons for their animosity are unclear; while &lt;a href=\"Ve%27brax\"&gt;Ve'brax&lt;/a&gt; claims that Ve'nari betrayed them, Ve'nari maintains that it was they who betrayed her. According to the findings of &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt;, Ve'nari was the leader of the expedition into the Maw, but after discovering a defensible position in the area, Ve'nari arranged the elimination of her fellow cartel members to secure exclusive access to her newfound resources.\nAt some point Ve'nari secured an &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; within the Maw as her hideout and successfully remained out of sight of the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;. She took notice when &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurers&lt;/a&gt; from Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; entered the Maw and how they thwarted the Jailer's festivities. Becoming intrigued Ve'nari would choose to aid the Maw Walker and &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; when the pair was confronted by a &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Myrmidon\"&gt;Mawsworn Myrmidon&lt;/a&gt; and swiftly ended it. She subsequently offered them a proposition, to which Darion questioned her decision to offer them aid. To that Ve'nari merely pointed out that their presence drew attention that would be bad for her business dealings.\nVe'nari then offered the pair her aid in finding the missing &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Maldraxxi baron&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, in return for the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20the%20Horsemen\"&gt;Amulet of the Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; as she felt it held interesting power, and that the pair would leave as she preferred to keep a low profile. After receiving the amulet, Ve'nari led the way towards &lt;a href=\"Perdition%20Hold\"&gt;Perdition Hold&lt;/a&gt; to rescue the baron. As the trio traveled Darion admitted that they &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;sought&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;to rescue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;, which prompted Ve'nari to reveal that they were most likely taken to &lt;a href=\"Torghast\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. After warning that breaching the tower would be folly at this time, she aided in the rescue of Alexandros Mograine and then &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari%27s%20Portal\"&gt;opened a portal&lt;/a&gt; to her refugee from which the Azerothians could make their way to the &lt;a href=\"Waystone%20to%20Oribos\"&gt;waystone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Revendreth storyline, the Maw Walkers returned to the Maw seeking to liberate the lost Prince of the venthyr - &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;. Ve'nari aided the Maw Walkers by 'obtaining' a Torghast portal and setting it up in her refuge, though she wouldn't reveal how or where she obtained it from, only that she expected the Maw Walkers would need access to the Tower in due time.\nDespite her desire for secrecy, rumors of aiding the Maw Walker would reach the covenants and the other brokers within Oribos. As a result of this the covenants would implore the Maw Walker to seek her out to help rescue the souls within the Maw, while Cartel Ve member &lt;a href=\"Ve%27rayn\"&gt;Ve'rayn&lt;/a&gt; questioned the Maw Walker as to her whereabouts. As Ve'nari and the Maw Walker had established a partnership, with Ve'nari giving them a &lt;a href=\"Soulkeeper\"&gt;Soulkeeper&lt;/a&gt; to help liberate souls from the Maw in return for their silence, Ve'rayn would leave unemptied but not convinced that the Maw Walker didn't have knowledge of Ve'nari's whereabouts.\nAs Ve'nari and the Maw Walker bonded, she imparted life lessons to them. After coming to appreciate the Maw Walker, she outright declared them a reliable associate and entrusted them with a task that she would usually perform on her own: investigating a nearby device of broker origin. As the Maw Walker investigated the device they were attacked by Ve'brax and as the fight progressed, Ve'nari arrived to assist the Ma Walker. Following Ve'brax's death, Ve'nari declared that their partnership had become permanent as Cartel Ve wouldn't rest until they were both eliminated. She remarked how her former cartel did not handle envy particularly well, how those who had sent her to the Maw sought her death, implored them not to trust Cartel Ve, and that they were partners from now until their last flame flickered.\nChains of Domination.\nAfter the Jailer used his chains to pull &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; into the Maw, &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Tahl\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Tahl&lt;/a&gt; sensed the emergence of a second waystone within the Maw. Thus the Maw Walker turned to Ve'nari for help in locating and securing it, a task which Ve'nari accepted as she believed it would be beneficial to both of them. As the pair traveled to Korthia unseen amongst the Mawsworn, they discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; was unable to peer into the realm, causing Ve'nari to remark that Korthia must be strong in magic and that the legends may be true. They later discovered that while Korthia was protected from the Jailer's Eye, the Mawsworn were freely able to invade the realm. As the pair entered the City of Secrets, Ve'nari scanned the area, which allowed them to encounter &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt;, who tested them to see if they were the true Maw Walker. However, in the process the Maw Walker had a small burst of anima rapidly fly from them as their health drained. Unamused by this, Ve'nari prepared to attack Tal-Galan, who promptly stopped and declared them &lt;a href=\"The%20True%20Maw%20Walker\"&gt;The True Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Maw Walker activated the &lt;a href=\"Waystone%20to%20Oribos%20%28Korthia%29\"&gt;Waystone&lt;/a&gt; to Oribos, Ve'nari ventured into the small cave behind the waystone within &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later Tal-Galan offered Ve'nari his thanks for aiding the Maw Walker and offered to answer her questions. This prompted Ve'nari to declare that while a thank-you was polite, a favor was better. The Maw Walker and Ve'nari subsequently established a permanent connection between her refuge and the respite, during this process the Maw Walker transported &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari%27s%20Overstuffed%20Bag\"&gt;Ve'nari's Overstuffed Bag&lt;/a&gt; for her. However the Maw Walker quickly learned that the bag in question didn't truly belong to Ve'nari, who when questioned about it changed the subject, and had the Maw Walker test out the &lt;a href=\"Transferral%20Augmentor\"&gt;Transferral Augmentor&lt;/a&gt; until it landed the Maw Walker outside &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Beastwarrens\"&gt;Beastwarrens&lt;/a&gt;. Quick to take advantage of the opportunity Ve'nari, through a projection, directed the Maw Walker with placing &lt;a href=\"Aural%20Sequencer\"&gt;Aural Sequencers&lt;/a&gt; within the area in order to establish a functional signal. During this process, the pair noticed glittering feathers on the ground, which grew their curiosity. With the sequencers relaying information reliably, the pair discovered the caged &lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt; and learned the Mawsworn had captured Odyn's &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; and sought to turn them to their cause. Following Danica's liberation, she took the Maw Walker to &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; as Ve'nari ended the projection.\nShe was later approached by the Maw Walker who sought her help in binding the &lt;a href=\"Ilskahorn\"&gt;Ilskahorn&lt;/a&gt;, which allow for Odyn's Val'kyr to pierce the shroud protecting the Maw and invade it, to the Maw. Ve'nari subsequently directed the Maw Walker with collecting Tears of the Damned and draining the rage from the Furious Shades in the , in order to acquire the essence of the Maw to bind to the horn. With the Ilskahorn bound to the Maw, Ve'nari revealed that the horn should best be used at the Terminus Platform, where the River of Souls flows upward to Torghast. Thus it was there that the Eye of the Jailer was attacked by the Maw Walker, Danica, and her fellow Val'kyr, where it ultimately retreated into Torghast.\nAt some point following these events, the Maw Walker would kill Ve'rayn and deliver &lt;a href=\"Ve%27rayn%27s%20Head%20%28item%29\"&gt;her head&lt;/a&gt; to Ve'nari. After being briefly surprised, she remarked how they had done her a favor, as Ve'rayn had proven herself problematic for some time. She also remarked that while Cartel Ve would continue to send operatives after her, the eliminaton of Ve'rayn afforded her significant time.\nAfter Zovaal opened the way into &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, and the Primus collected the &lt;a href=\"Sigil\"&gt;Sigils&lt;/a&gt; in order to follow, Ve'nari approached Tal-Galan, who was quick to deduce that she sought his knowledge about Zereth Mortis. Oddly enough, despite Ve'nari's expressed interest in the realm of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, she was not amongst those who ventured into Zereth Mortis after the way to the realm was open.\nEternity's End.\nFollowing Zovaal's death, Ve'nari weighed the risk of Cartel Ve's wrath and made the decision to head into Zereth Mortis. She left a vestige in her place at her refuge that informed the Maw Walker of her decision. This vestige then revealed that thanks to them she had all the stygia she needed for her plans. The value of Stygia remained a mystery to the Maw Walkers, and yet Ve'nari saw its value as key to achieving her goal in Zereth Mortis. What these plans are is currently unknown, though they seemed to have become rendered moot when the Maw Walker discovered Ve'nari's corpse at the &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Catalyst\"&gt;Creation Catalyst&lt;/a&gt; in Zereth Mortis. While investigating her body, the Maw Walker determined that something went wrong when she sought to use her stygia in the catalyst, and that it was a quick death. However, those with &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; were able to deduce that there were small barely noticeable inconsistencies in the area, on account of their knowledge of Ve'nari and mastery of engineering.\nAfter five days, Ve'nari sent the Maw Walker a letter revealing her survival, and how she had faked her death to get Cartel Ve off her back. She then revealed that within Zereth Mortis, she created a device that allows her to travel the cosmos, which led to her meeting &lt;a href=\"Xolartios\"&gt;Xolartios&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to serve as her guide as they explored this new unkown.\nFaction.\nLike selected NPCs from other expansions, Ve'nari has her own reputation faction. Various standings with her are required to purchase some of her wares and gain access to some areas of the Maw. Uniquely, Ve'nari's goods can be purchased based on the highest reputation of all characters on your account, rather than the reputation of the character purchasing the item.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, Ve'nari's standing can gain paragon reputation. Earn another 10,000 points of standing with her to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Gift%20from%20Ve%27nari\"&gt;Mysterious Gift from Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; from her via the quest &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Gifts%20from%20Ve%27nari\"&gt;Mysterious Gifts from Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;. The chest contains , 1,000 Stygia, and can contain &lt;a href=\"Rook%20%28pet%29\"&gt;Rook (pet)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soulbound%20Gloomcharger%27s%20Reins\"&gt;Soulbound Gloomcharger's Reins&lt;/a&gt;.\nSources.\nVe'nari reputation is gained by completing her daily and weekly quests, as well as defeating encounters in the Maw:\nIt is recommended to focus on the daily quests first, then the weeklies. Once they're done, complete a Wrath of the Jailer event once a week (preferably with a group), and then kill rares and complete events around the Maw until &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; has filled, to maximize the reputation earned.\nRares and events have a decent chance of dropping a Maw Lore item quest, which can be turned in at Ve'nari for 100 reputation.\nVendor.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPurchasing and using the permanent upgrades Ve'nari sells awards the achievements &lt;a href=\"To%20%27Ghast%2C%20Two%20Curios\"&gt;To 'Ghast, Two Curios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%27Ghast%20Five\"&gt;'Ghast Five&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nDialogue.\nAfter Rule 4: Make a List:\nAfter Rule 5: Be Audacious:\nAfter Rule 6: Concealment is Everything:\nGossip.\nIt is preferable when an investment pays off.\nGreetings Maw Walker. I have a special message for you.\n&lt;You see the smoldering corpse of Ve'nari. Looking around, it seems she was trying to use her stockpile of stygia to interact with the surrounding machinery.\nSomething must have gone horribly wrong.&gt;\n (Appears only once)\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nVe'nari appears as a in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" . Her flavor text reads: \"Ve'nari is perhaps the only kind entity to be found in the Maw, but she keeps things strictly business. This mysterious being has a vast amount of knowledge, and she will share it for a price.\""}

As such, they rediscovered the use of the Light. The way of the priest is a new one for the tauren, but it draws on the ancient traditions of their &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s, and they are not forging a new path so much as rediscovering old ways that we had forgotten.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Tahu and the Seers answered &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;'s call to unite all the priesthoods of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nConcurrently with the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Rise\"&gt;Elder Rise&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Tahu Sagewind and &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; discussed whether the tauren have overlooked a key aspect of balance, noting the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' near exclusive worship of the &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;, known to the tauren as &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;. Yet in their culture, both Mu'sha and &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun, are the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. As Tahu realized this, he pondered what could happen should tauren start to harness the power of the sun. The pair then concluded that the night elves, through their ties to tauren druids, passed on their cultural prejudice against the sun to their tauren students. To properly revere the Earth Mother they hold sacred, both of them decided to strive for balance and further explore the powers of An'she.\nMany have speculated that this intense pondering led Tahu to abandon his druidic path in order to create the first priests of the tauren, allowing them to channel the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to aid their people, while Aponi abandoned her warrior ways and became the first tauren paladin, in an order now known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the priesthood was officially created and began recruiting to train tauren priests, notably some &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; who renounced their path, such as &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Ravenfeather\"&gt;Seer Ravenfeather&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Ravenfeather\"&gt;Seer Ravenfeather&lt;/a&gt; summoned young seers to teach them the ways of the priests. She notably taught them a &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;versatile and quick healing technique&lt;/a&gt;, and then to heal the tauren injured during battles against the &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback tribe&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt;, so they'll have a chance to put their new knowledge to use right away.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the priest trainer &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Liwatha\"&gt;Seer Liwatha&lt;/a&gt; requested to meet young tauren seers who completed their early training with skill and dedication, and were now ready to become a full &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;.

He also sent them to Shadowfang Keep to recover materials and the holy symbol of Commander Springvale for the creation of weapons at the height of their dedication, as Seer Liwatha did in the past.\nDragonflight.\nBy the time of the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Seers had recruited and trained &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; as priests of the sun in their ranks, such as &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Shinetotem\"&gt;Seer Shinetotem&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nIn their faith, the Light is associated with An'she, which gives them their powers. It is important to note that they don't use &lt;a href=\"solar%20magic\"&gt;solar magic&lt;/a&gt;, since it is associated to &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic rather than holy magic. When they refer to the Light, they use the terms \"An'she's light\", \"the light of the Sun\", and \"Sun's light\". The power of An'she can appear either as red flames emerging from a white-hot source or as golden magic similar to other &lt;a href=\"divine%20magic\"&gt;divine magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to use their holy powers, they may pray to An'she silently or verbally. As they become more skilled, their skills will expand, and they gain access to many new powers. Through the powers of An'she, &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; is notably able to speak with the spirits of long departed, and can compel them to tell the truth."}

She was once a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; member of the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nIwen was alive at the time of the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; settlers that would eventually come to form the nation of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Threatened by them, &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; ordered the Drust to initiate raids and attacks upon the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s that had come to Kul Tiras, though Sef spoke out against it, believing it to be unnecessary and that the Drust and Humanity could live in harmony. Given an ultimatum, to attack the humans or to live in the woods forever, Sef chose the latter; believing Tul simply meant to exile her. Instead, she was murdered by Gorak Tul and her soul torn from her body then shackled to the remains; forcing her to live as a spirit forever in the woods that would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Glenbrook%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Glenbrook Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, her death meant as an example to those who would seek to work with the humans. This, amongst the other atrocities that Gorak Tul would commit against the humans, eventually led to Sef's fellow Thornspeakers rebelling against Gorak Tul and aiding the humans.\nSef remained as a spirit until the arrival of an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who was skilled in the art of &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. Having heard her whispers upon the wind, the adventurer trekked into Drustvar and met with Sef's disembodied spirit. Telling them that she wished to walk amongst the living once again, though was unwilling to possess a living creature as the other Drust had been doing, she wished for the enchanter to help her create a golem with which to animate. With this done, she could guard the forests of Drustvar once again and keep the innocent safe from harm. After having &lt;a href=\"Sef%20Iwen%27s%20Remains\"&gt;her remains&lt;/a&gt; cleansed and destroyed by the enchanter and the various pieces required for her new body collected; Sef Iwen sent the enchanter to power a soul core with the spirits of the vengeful Drust who haunted &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Koval\"&gt;Gol Koval&lt;/a&gt;. Powering up an old Drust shrine within Gol Koval that took the two to her &lt;a href=\"Iwen%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;abandoned sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains, Sef, unfortunately, realized too late that the souls she had trapped were more powerful than anticipated. Rather than be used as fuel for her new body's soul core, the souls managed to animate the &lt;a href=\"Animated%20Golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to take vengeance upon Iwen and the enchanter; forcing the latter to destroy the golem before Sef was consumed. With her new body destroyed, Sef briefly mentioned the idea of trying again, though took the failure as a sign that she was meant to move on. Gifting the enchanter who had aided her with her knowledge, Sef's spirit passed on to the afterlife in peace."}

{"id": "210714", "revid": "1773829", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=210714", "title": "Select", "text": "Selecting a &lt;a href=\"unit\"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt; is the act of identifying it as a player's &lt;a href=\"target\"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; in the game interface, typically by clicking on it or pressing the Tab key. Technically this is called targeting, but saying \"select\" can be used to specify that the player is simply identifying the unit within the interface rather than starting an in-world action targeted at it. A &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;'s AI routine may also select units, but this is usually called \"targeting\" since no human input is involved.\nSelecting can also be a synonym for interacting - selecting a target \"and\" initiating an action on it, often either talking or auto-attacking (depending on hostility level), almost always by right-clicking on it.\nSelecting targets.\nLeft clicking a &lt;a href=\"PC\"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; will select it. Right clicking will select it too, but also initiates direct interaction, so be wary when selecting enemies. The Tab key targets and selects attackable units &lt;a href=\"facing\"&gt;in front&lt;/a&gt; of the player, and &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s can step through targeting/selection choices via the &lt;a href=\"MACRO%20target\"&gt;/target&lt;/a&gt; command and other &lt;a href=\"Macro%20API%23Targeting%20functions\"&gt;targeting functions&lt;/a&gt;.\nClicking on a &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; that is being ridden will almost always select the character, not the mount. The mount is in effect a rather large extension of the unit, displayed under the unit. A few &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s disobey this rule, and have mounts that can be targeted separately from themselves. This rule also doesn't apply to &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s, although some of them prevent the \"occupant(s)\" from being targeted. A selectable object in front of another unit will prevent players from clicking on the obscured unit to target it, but those units can still be selected using the Tab key, &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s, or sometimes simply by changing the camera angle.\nOnce selected, the player's target becomes the default target for any spells cast by the player and any commands used by the player, the target's name will be used in any &lt;a href=\"emote\"&gt;emote&lt;/a&gt;s (and &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;s using the %t substitution), and other players will be able to see that the player has selected that target. The target is highlighted in the game world with their name appearing above them and a selection circle around them. The color of the circle and the name indicates hostility - red is aggressive, yellow is passive until attacked, and green is \"non-combatant\". Their portrait appears next to the player's portrait at the top of the screen, and can be right-clicked for a number of options such as &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"whisper\"&gt;whisper&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"dueling\"&gt;dueling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"inspect\"&gt;inspect&lt;/a&gt;ing or &lt;a href=\"kick\"&gt;kick&lt;/a&gt;ing a target player, or setting a &lt;a href=\"focus%20target\"&gt;focus target&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raid%20icon\"&gt;raid icon&lt;/a&gt; on any unit. If \"Target of target\" is enabled in the interface options, any unit the target has selected will also be displayed!\nInteracting.\nRight-clicking interacts with a &lt;a href=\"unit\"&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"object\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt;, and if it is a unit, selects it - objects cannot be selected. There's also a key binding that can interact with a selected target (and therefore does not work on objects). Interacting is entirely dependent on the type of unit or object clicked on.\nWith &lt;a href=\"friendly\"&gt;friendly&lt;/a&gt; NPCs, most commonly it will open a dialog if the NPC has a dialog for the player, often including quest options and completion. These interactions will change the cursor to a speech bubble, exclamation point, or question mark when hovering on the target. Other possibilities include a bag or anvil cursor for vendor and repair NPCs, a book for trainers, or a winged boot for flight masters. &lt;a href=\"Hostile\"&gt;Hostile&lt;/a&gt; attackable NPCs and neutral &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s will show a sword icon, and right-clicking will activate the character's &lt;a href=\"auto-attack\"&gt;auto-attack&lt;/a&gt; with equipped weapons. &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt; NPCs vary in how they respond. Neutral vendors will generally open a dialog. Many are not interactable, and unattackable hostile NPCs are often the same way - although some can be spoken to.\nOther units may not be NPCs at all, and are more akin to fixed &lt;a href=\"object\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt;s. These and true objects vary even more widely in interaction effect, but often display a gear cursor for any number of purposes. Objects include &lt;a href=\"mailbox\"&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"door\"&gt;door&lt;/a&gt;s. Because they must be right-clicked on, interacting with objects can be extremely difficult if there are visual obstructions between the player's camera and the object, including crowds of other players. Zooming in the camera as much as possible and standing right next to the object can sometimes cause the obstructions to be hidden, allowing interaction.\nObjects and hostile units that show no special icon when hovered upon cannot be interacted with directly. However, events affecting these objects may still be triggered by the player, such as interacting with a &lt;a href=\"lever\"&gt;lever&lt;/a&gt; object to open a door."}

Fight on the battlefields of the Broken Shore and forge a destiny free from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s grasp!\nRewards.\nYou will also receive: \nProgress.\nHow go your efforts on the warfront?\nCompletion.\nStep by step, we march closer to victory. We must not relent!\nOnly through courage and persistence will we stop the insidious evil that threatens &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;the soul of this world&lt;/a&gt;."}

You are awarded 250 reputation with the Shattered Sun for killing him in heroic. \nDungeon Journal.\n\"Once a respected captain of Kael'Thas Sunstrider's personal guard, Selin Fireheart has maintained an unswervingly fierce loyalty to his lord while losing his sanity. Selin has been seduced by the demonic energies of the crystals which surround his chamber, and cannot stop from reveling in their vile power. He will slay any who dare approach the Magister's Terrace and will drink the magic, life, and blood from their dead bodies.\"\nNotes.\nThe first two mobs in the dead center of the room may be safely pulled without attracting the attention of the other two groups. Fight the next two six-pulls out in the hall if you can. Crowd control\u2014sap, sheep, trap, mind control, whatever you have\u2014is useful for these pulls. Engaging the boss will aggro all mobs in the room, so a high-level character running solo is advised to take them out first.\nSelin Fireheart is superficially similar to &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kalithresh\"&gt;Warlord Kalithresh&lt;/a&gt;. Periodically he will run to one of the large green crystals in his room and begin casting Siphon Fel Crystal which increases both his size and (melee \"and\" magic) damage dealt while restoring his mana. Once the crystal is completely drained or smashed (whichever happens first) Selin will resume combat while casting Fel Explosion continuously until he is again out of mana. The sooner you break the crystal the less mana he will have to pound your group with Fel Explosion.\nThe moment Selin begins draining a crystal, everyone not engaged in trying to regain aggro should immediately switch targets to the crystal and destroy it. Alternatively, with sufficient healing one may ignore the crystals and maintain damage on Selin; 1800 +heal should be sufficient for this.\nWhen combat with Selin begins, an orange barrier (similar to the one blocking the rear exit of the room) will appear and block the archway you came in through, so make sure that everyone and their pets are fully in Selin's room before the fight begins or they could possibly become stuck outside (or stuck in the barrier). Note that aggroing Selin will also aggro all remaining Wretched.\nOne might be able to break Selin's Drain Life by simply jumping off the stage and breaking his line of sight.\nA Badge/Kara geared team should have little difficulty with this boss as his aoe is able to be healed through on normal with medium difficulty.\nHeroic Mode.\nSame fight, crystals have considerably more hp however and need to be taken down faster than in normal mode to avoid too much mana regain. He will also drain mana from players, however, it is negligible. He will, of course, do his Fel Explosions after a Drain Mana. As with the Drain Life, the Drain Mana can be interrupted or dispelled.\nGains.\nAfter killing this NPC you will gain: \nSpeculation.\nGiven his description as a captain of Kael'thas' personal guard, it might refer to the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;."}

A powerful &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;, he was a spiritual leader for his people as well. When &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the Darkspears' &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;island home&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Sen'jin allied with them against the forces threatening his people but was ultimately killed by &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. The Darkspears subsequently joined the Horde under the leadership of Sen'jin's son &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nFor years, Sen'jin led the Darkspear tribe in peace on the remote &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;. He dreamed of creating a home for the Darkspears where they could thrive and live free from fear and his vision for trolls was for them to return to being a people led by a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; as they had been in the distant past. He looked at other trolls and saw the folly in their desires to conquer the world and recreate their ancient empires, and he realized that conquest was not the only path to achieving a sense of freedom. While he maintained great respect for troll traditions and encouraged his son &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to become a shadow hunter, he did so by looking forward and always stressing lessons in leadership rather than traditions to copy blindly. Sen'jin also personally encouraged Vol'jin's best friend &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; to become a &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;, leading some Darkspears to believe that Zalazane was being trained to lead after Sen'jin while Vol'jin was destined for greater things, even though both youths believed in Sen'jin's dream of a Darkspear homeland.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, new troubles began on the Darkspear Islands. A &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; expedition of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marines\"&gt;Kul Tiras Marines&lt;/a&gt; followed the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; escaping from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and arrived on one of the islands where they established a settlement, pushing the trolls further into the island. Meanwhile, the once-docile &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s had become fevered, prodded by the Sea Witch &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt; that lived in the ocean, who they offered sacrifices to. One night shortly after these attacks began, Sen'jin experienced a powerful vision in which he saw a young &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"far%20seer\"&gt;far seer&lt;/a&gt; who would save his people and lead them from the islands. Sen'jin subsequently told Vol'jin that he had to immediately enter the jungle of &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt; to be tested by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. The judgment was normally reserved for older trolls, but Sen'jin insisted that there was no time. As Vol'jin and Zalazane departed for First Home, Sen'jin looked at his son like he was never going to see him again.\nSen'jin's vision soon came true when &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were forced to moor on the Darkspear Islands after the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; nearly destroyed their ships. Sen'jin approached the orcs, warning them of the humans nearby. Thrall promised to force the humans from his island. After defeating the humans' leader\u2014an &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and forcing them into a retreat, they were suddenly attacked by Zar'jira's murloc minions. The murlocs captured Sen'jin's trolls, the witch doctor himself, Thrall, some of the orcs, and the remaining humans and imprisoned them in the caverns below the islands.\nThrall managed to escape the prison and rescued many orcs and trolls, but a &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Sorcerer\"&gt;murloc sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; took Sen'jin into the deepest part of the underground lair, where he brutally attacked him and sacrificed him to the Sea Witch just as Thrall arrived. Thrall battled through the murlocs and finally destroyed the murloc sorcerer, but Sen'jin's wounds were deep and he was dying. With his last breath, the witch doctor implored Thrall to take his people from the islands and save them from destruction.\nShadows of the Horde.\nFollowing Vol'jin's near death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s, Sen'jin appeared before his son alongside &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the loa of the dead, who stated that Vol'jin should be giving himself to his care instead of clinging to life. After a brief exchange, Sen'jin convinced Bwonsamdi that Vol'jin might have many reasons to remain alive and that it should suffice for the loa that at least one would be serving Bwonsamdi's purposes. Sen'jin's spirit subsequently faded from view, but he assured Vol'jin that he would always be with him as long as he remained true to himself.\nAfter Vol'jin escaped from the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and prepared to die with the rest of &lt;a href=\"the%20Thirty-three\"&gt;the Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt; to defend &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, he reached out to the loa whereupon his father was the first to appear before him. Sen'jin expressed his pride in his son and remarked that Vol'jin had transcended being his son when he became a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;. After granting Vol'jin a vision of the history of troll civilization and discussing the nature of what it meant to be a troll, Sen'jin stated his belief that the future of trollkind was in Vol'jin's hands.\nLegacy.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn honor of Sen'jin's memory, the Darkspear settlement in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; is called &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Darkspear trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, much like how the orcs represent &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, represent Sen'jin or perhaps more likely &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament.\nIn the RPG.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%26amp%3B%20Horde%20Compendium\"&gt;Alliance &amp; Horde Compendium&lt;/a&gt;\" states that after Thrall saved the Darkspear tribe from certain annihilation, the tribe's shaman leader pledged their loyalty to the Horde forever. However, it's not stated if this refers to Sen'jin or Vol'jin.\nIn the TCG.\nSen'jin is classified as a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Judgment\"&gt;The Judgment&lt;/a&gt;\" implies that Sen'jin ascended to the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; after his death. The last loa Vol'jin saw before leaving &lt;a href=\"First%20Home\"&gt;First Home&lt;/a&gt; appeared stronger and newer than the others and had a familiarity to it that he couldn't place. When Vol'jin and &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Darkspear village, Vol'jin quickly realized that Sen'jin had been killed and that his father was \"no longer among the Darkspears. At least, not as a troll.\" Sen'jin's numerous appearances to Vol'jin alongside &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" lend evidence to this theory, but it is also worth noting that Bwonsamdi watches over the spirits of departed Darkspear trolls."}

This feature is part of what caused Draenor's explosion.\nThe gateway used to summon &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; and the other demons in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; was closer to the Dark Portal than a dimensional gateway \u2014 the terminus of that portal was located on a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;-controlled world.\nInvasion of Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; side of the now-closed Dark Portal, the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, planned to open dimensional gateways that would lead the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to new, unspoiled worlds to conquer. &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; also desired a world of his own, and together they led their armies in an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in order to gather the artifacts required for their plans: the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the last hours of the conflict, Ner'zhul cast the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;Spell of Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; in order to create his gateways. Huge dimensional rifts crackling with the cosmic energies of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; appeared over the skies of Draenor. The energies emitted from these newly formed rifts torn apart the fabric of reality in Draenor and caused massive tidal waves, earthquakes, and volcanoes to erupt.

There are only three currently in the game, though they are located in other regions than the four gateways closed by Illidan in ' which were shown in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; (later retconned to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;):\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Gathios%20the%20Shatterer\"&gt;Gathios the Shatterer&lt;/a&gt;, the portals closed in the aftermath of the Third War in Shadowmoon Valley have remained sealed and aren't the same ones that appeared in the forge camps. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Malande\"&gt;Lady Malande&lt;/a&gt; also informed Illidan that Kael'thas could not attend the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Council\"&gt;Illidari Council&lt;/a&gt; in the Black Temple since he was on the task to close another Legion\u2019s gate in the Netherstorm.\nNotes.\nThe \"portals to other worlds\" make up a collection of portals of which &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; revealed in the Developer Panels that Illidan closed these in Outland.

This altered state proved to be a blessing in disguise, however, as their enhanced minds and magical abilities allowed the ethereals to fight Dimensius and his limited forces to a standstill.

{"id": "18716", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18716", "title": "Diminishing returns", "text": "Diminishing returns means that certain &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ability\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; become less effective against a target if used frequently within a short period of time. While diminishing returns mostly applies to &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;player characters&lt;/a&gt;, some abilities also have diminishing returns in PvE. The &lt;a href=\"%23Table\"&gt;table below&lt;/a&gt; contains a list of abilities that are affected by DR, and under what circumstances. In addition, DR categories are listed. Effects within the same category share diminishing returns.\nWhen an ability with diminishing returns is used against a target in PvP, the first effect has full PvP duration. If the same category of effect (e.g. root) is used on that target within 18 seconds, that effect's duration is reduced by 50%. On the third use, the duration is reduced by 75%. After this, the target is immune from all effects in that category for the next 18 seconds. Note that when used against another player, effects will only last for their PvP duration, often far shorter than the duration stated in the ability's tooltip. The maximum PvP duration is 8 seconds.\nSpells must be used on the same target within 18 seconds of the * end* of the duration in order to be diminished. In other words, if a target hasn't had a root spell active on them for more than 18 seconds, this category of diminishing returns will be reset on the target, and the next rooting spell will have full effect.\nDiminishing returns for &lt;a href=\"Knock%20back\"&gt;knockback effects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;taunts&lt;/a&gt; are a special case with different timings. Knockbacks are immediately immune after first usage, and reset after 10 seconds versus 18 seconds. Taunts that force aggro from mobs or pets reset after 18 seconds like usual, but they only become immune after fifth usage instead of after the third.\nTable.\nThe table below has been sorted out into diminishing returns categories. Each ability shares diminishing returns with the other abilities it has been listed with, and no others unless otherwise stated.\nNote that the table data is for World of Warcraft Shadowlands only, not Classic.\nValues marked with ?! are not sure to be the real. Modify if you know the correct ones.\nIn PvE.\nMany types of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; also suffer from diminishing returns versus &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, usually stuns. Diminishing returns do not count per player but per creature; every creature has its own diminishing return for each group of CC and all players in your party / raid will be affected by that diminishing return.\nWarlords of Draenor.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" will see dramatic adjustments to existing diminishing returns categories. \n6 diminishing returns categories remain:"}

They are mainly found in tropical areas, such as the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, or on the islands of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s commonly tame and ride dinosaurs. A common rite of passage among the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; is to travel to one of the violent, beast-ruled islands near the &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; to steal or subdue a wild creature. The lesser troll races have their own, humbler versions of this tradition, but the mastery of &lt;a href=\"ravasaur\"&gt;ravasaur&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s is nothing compared to the power required to call upon a &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere may or may not be a link between the dinosaurs and the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Among the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, there are those who believe that &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s are descended from dinosaurs such as an extinct type of raptor that had &lt;a href=\"Feathered%20Raptor%20Arm\"&gt;feathered arms&lt;/a&gt;. The feathers suggest some kind of missing link between the two different kinds of animals. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durrin%20Direshovel\"&gt;Durrin Direshovel&lt;/a&gt; claimed to have found the mandible of an ancestor of the Un'Goro dinosaurs peeking out of the ground in &lt;a href=\"Terror%20Run\"&gt;Terror Run&lt;/a&gt;. He calculated that the dinosaur that the mandible belonged to would have been nearly 300 feet long from tip to tail while alive, longer than some of the largest &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and far larger than any currently living dinosaur in the Un'Goro Crater. Some ancient dinosaurs had talons that were up to 3 feet long.\nSome dinosaurs appear to be especially resistant against various diseases and corruptions. The &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"King%20Dred\"&gt;King Dred&lt;/a&gt; is immune to the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"falcosaur\"&gt;falcosaur&lt;/a&gt;s are unable to be corrupted or infused with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nThe term \"&lt;a href=\"dinomancer\"&gt;dinomancer&lt;/a&gt;\" applies to individuals who either tame dinosaurs, whether by normal means or magically as well as those who transform into dinosaurs.\nAs a hunter pet.\nThree different dinosaur families can be &lt;a href=\"Tame%20Beast\"&gt;tamed&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn Hearthstone.\nDinosaurs play a prominent role in the \" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Many of the dinosaurs featured in the expansion have soaked up the primal, &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; energies of the crater, allowing them to gain powerful .\nBeyond the familar species such as devilsaurs and pterrordax, the expansion also introduces several new species of dinosaur not previously seen in the \"Warcraft\" universe. These include:\nIn the RPG.\nThese ancient lizards inspire awe and respect wherever they go. While animals, dinosaurs possess a might and magnificence that places them above other creatures of the natural world; many sapient races revere dinosaurs, or consider it a test of personal honor to hunt one of the great beasts.\nWhile many types of dinosaurs exist, most are carnivores and thust share the same basic traits. Their forelimbs tend to prove ill-suited for combat, so they attack with their horned heads and teeth. They stake out territories and guard them fiercely. (This territorial instinct exists in herbivourus dinosaurs as well, but they tend to more peaceful behavior, attacking only when a creature wounds or threatens them.)\nDinosaurs have rough reptilian skin, thick and pebbly in texture. Their coloration varies, but many dinosaurs tend to blend in well with their natural surroundings. Despite there reptilian appearance Dinosaurs are warm blooded like birds.

{"id": "395280", "revid": "40361979", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=395280", "title": "Dire Gnomes", "text": "Background.\nDire Gnomes are a rare type of mutated gnomes, altered by radiation from a Automatic cooking-device project, that are notably larger and more muscular than regular gnomes. They are about twice as tall, and also have a lot of fat and muscles. Due to their appearance, Dire gnomes are often mistaken for dwarves, although they are hairless, and they appear more malformed and muscular. They are also commonly hunched over slightly.\nDire gnomes do not have nearly the same level of intelligence as regular gnomes do, but due to their race's general high intellect they are capable of developing a decent level of intelligence. Dire gnomes are easily angered, and can quickly go into a frenzied state if offended, going into a trance-like state where they destroy and/or kill just about everything in sight until they manage to calm down.\nA high temper, hairlessness and malformed characteristics are the best way to identify a Dire Gnome.\nIt is speculated that there are ways to better control Dire Gnomes, or even restore their minds to their original state. Unfortunately, due to a lack of interest from most scientists and magical users, no research are being conducted to restore them. Although some argue they could be a good edition to the Alliance military, most gnomish scientists compare them to Hobgoblins, and refer to them as \"Slow, stupid, and both scientifically and practically useless\" and justify the lack of care with their relatively short average life-spans of ten to twenty years.\nReproduction.\nIf a Dire Gnome and Gnome reproduces, the result can be anything between. Although it is possible for the result to be a pure Dire Gnome, it's more common for the result to be a regular gnome. A regular gnome with the DNA of a Dire Gnome tends to be more muscular, and have a slightly lower level of intelligence than most.\nIf two Dire Gnomes reproduces, due to their unstable DNA sequence, it is likely that their child will mutate further, becoming more malformed than their parents. The surroundings play a big role on how Dire Gnomes evolve, meaning after a few short generations a Dire Gnome could evolve into an entirely new subspecies. The gender of the participants of mating has a lot to say about whether it's more likely to be a Dire Gnome, or regular Gnome. If the Dire Gnome is female, it is more likely for the child to be a Dire gnome, and the other way around for regular Gnomes. The amount of female Dire Gnomes compared to the amount of males is very small, as most of the survivors of the failed Cooking-device project were males, and the only known cases of female Dire Gnomes are second-generation ones.\nDire Leper Gnomes.\nDire Leper gnomes are extremely rare compared to the regular. Dire Leper Gnomes were Dire Gnomes exposed to the radiation in Gnomeregan when it was irradiated. Many of them didn't survive the exposure to radiation due to their unstable DNA sequence, causing a higher percentage of the Dire Gnome population to die than regular gnomes, although some very few did survive. Dire leper gnomes are extremely mutated, even compared to the regular Dire Gnomes. Their skin is green, with a yellowish hue, and random spikes adorns them, often growing on their shoulders or back, as well as fangs an claws that can potentially be poisonous. A low sizzling can be heard from them, as their thick hides fight for survival against the acidic properties of their radioactive sweat, much like Hobgoblins, but a lot more dangerous and radioactive.\nDire Leper gnomes hardly have anything of their original minds, as the maddening radiation and constant pain caused by their acidic sweat leaves them in constant pain and torment. Dire Leper Gnomes are extremely aggressive and bloodthirsty, and will usually attack anything they see on sight, apart from fellow Dire Lepper Gnomes, and in some cases, Leper Gnomes. Dire Leper Gnomes often rely on instinct, and will cannibalize corpses of other humanoid beings without second thought for the sake of survival."}

It was once a proud &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; city called Eldre'Thalas (or Eldre'thalas), but now lies in ruins, overrun by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"satyrs\"&gt;satyrs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Only a tiny remnant of the original Highborne population remains in the form of a murderous sect called the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sub-region of Dire Maul plays host to two night elf &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s: the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Commons%20Digsite\"&gt;Broken Commons Digsite&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul%20Digsite\"&gt;Dire Maul Digsite&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ruins stand strong because of an ancient crafting technique that bound arcane energy within the stone.\nHistory.\nEldre'Thalas.\nEldre'Thalas was one of the capitals of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s Highborne servitors. Within its walls, the elves lived in peace. Among them was a group of powerful &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of these powerful highborne was &lt;a href=\"Millicent%20Serene\"&gt;Millicent Serene&lt;/a&gt; whose crowning achievement was the &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20of%20Fertility\"&gt;Fruit of Fertility&lt;/a&gt;, a magical vine imbued with an aura of protection and growth. All of Eldre'Thalas flourished from its existence.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Eldre'Thalas was protected by &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;. Its ancient defender was &lt;a href=\"Tendris%20Warpwood\"&gt;Tendris Warpwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; hit, the city barely escaped destruction. Prince Tothreldrin and his followers conjured a spell that shielded the city from the destructive forces of the Sundering.\nIn Year 25, the majority of elves, including the prince, was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; when they raided Dire Maul. The surviving ones fled the ruined city and wandered in the woods for years, trying to wean themselves off demonic power and feel whole again.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nDire Maul is the location of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt;'s annual championship gladiator matches. The gladiatorial games begin with individual single combat matches and whichever gladiator team can survive the individual trials intact can advance to team combat matches to vie for the team championship. It is presumed that members of the teams who were unable to advance to team combat matches continue to fight in single combat matches to vie for the single combat championship (such as &lt;a href=\"Bloodeye%20Redfist\"&gt;Bloodeye Redfist&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;'s team, consisting of an amnesic &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, claimed victory over the previous year's team champions: &lt;a href=\"Giago\"&gt;Giago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Two-Heads\"&gt;Two-Heads&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brlee\"&gt;Brlee&lt;/a&gt; (members of the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; Clan of Ancient Draenor). In the attendance was a masked man who reported this event to &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn another fight, Varian fought against five &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Kingslayer%20Orkus\"&gt;Kingslayer Orkus&lt;/a&gt; witnessed it.\nCataclysm.\nDire Maul was lowered to a level 36-52 dungeon in Cataclysm. &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; has appeared in Dire Maul and given the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; Ogres power as a reward for their loyalty and work for the Twilight's Hammer clan. Despite his attempts though, Cho'gall was pushed out of Dire Maul by adventurers of the Horde and Alliance.\nTraveler.\nKing Gordok had his prisoner &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s here in a pit and watched them fight in an amphitheater.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; led by Captain &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; entered Dire Maul, killed King Gordok, becoming the new leader of the Gordunni ogres. He commanded them to leave Dire Maul and search &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext to the amphitheater, there was a big dome of thorns, constructed by &lt;a href=\"Chugara%20Razorflank\"&gt;Chugara Razorflank&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a prison for captured wyverns. It was ripped and destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt; planted and grew a massive oak over it.\nThe following day, every ogre left the stronghold, and &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt; oversaw its total evacuation.\nExploring Azeroth.\nWith the death of Malus and most of the Hidden, the Gordunni returned to Dire Maul and resumed their usual activities in the arena and the forests of Feralas. &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; visited the ruins and learned about Malus who used to be their king. Many ogre warriors reside in the Gordok Commons. According to some stories, there are powers that the Horde still doesn't know the half of it, and Zekhas advises to watch this place.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Built thousands of years ago to house the kaldorei's arcane secrets, the formerly great city of Eldre'Thalas now lies in ruin, writhing with warped, twisted forces. Competing covens once fought for control of Dire Maul's corrupted energy, but they have since settled into uneasy truces, choosing to exploit the power within their own territories rather than continue to battle over the entire complex.\"\nGeography and layout.\nDire Maul contains three wings, two of which are connected, all part of the same giant map. The wings are known as Warpwood Quarter (east), Capital Gardens (west) and Gordok Commons (north). The Capital Gardens and the Gordok Commons are contained in a single instance, and used to be connected via &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Dire%20Maul%29\"&gt;The Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;, but this is no longer the case. At the end of a long hallway not on the official map, you will now find only a dead end, and you will be displayed as nowhere, yet in the Gordok Commons. At the center of Dire Maul, connecting the three wings, is an open plaza populated by ogres and containing what was a special &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; arena. This &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Maul%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;the Maul&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of a rectangular pit with entrances and exits on the east and west sides, was similar to the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, in that \"free for all\" PvP combat is permitted within its confines.\nWarpwood Quarter (36-46).\nWarpwood Quarter (aka Dire Maul East ) has been taken over by the nefarious &lt;a href=\"Alzzin%20the%20Wildshaper\"&gt;Alzzin the Wildshaper&lt;/a&gt;, a satyr who has corrupted the &lt;a href=\"Fruit%20of%20Fertility\"&gt;Fruit of Fertility&lt;/a&gt; so that it produces vile . Alzzin has attracted all manner of corrupted plant life, satyrs, &lt;a href=\"mages\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; to his cause. The entire district is overgrown with crazed plant life. Dire Maul East is considered the easiest of the three wings.\nCapital Gardens (39-49).\nCapital Gardens (a.k.a Dire Maul West) is haunted by the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"skeletons\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; of deceased Highborne, and is home to a variety of arcane creatures, including &lt;a href=\"ancients\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mana%20surge\"&gt;mana surge&lt;/a&gt;s. Yet the most notable resident of the Capital Gardens is &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt;, a demon imprisoned on this plane by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt;. Millennia ago, the Prince, aided by his Shen'dralar loyalists, constructed five mystical pylons to bind Immol'thar so that they could siphon his energy to sustain their immortality. &lt;a href=\"Tendris%20Warpwood\"&gt;Tendris Warpwood&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupted &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War\"&gt;Ancient of War&lt;/a&gt;, also resides in the Capital Gardens. It also guards the door leading from Capital Gardens into Immol'thar's prison, where players can also access &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Dire%20Maul%29\"&gt;The Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;.\nGordok Commons (42-52).\nGordok Commons (a.k.a Dire Maul North) is considered the hardest, or, at the very least, the most interesting and unusual, wing of Dire Maul. The district is now occupied by a tribe of ogres known as the &lt;a href=\"Gordok\"&gt;Gordok&lt;/a&gt;. Dire Maul is unique in that parties adventuring there have a choice. They may, in the traditional fashion, kill all the various bosses in the instance for some guaranteed rare drops, or they can use a series of questing and sneaking tasks to perform a \"&lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul%20tribute%20run\"&gt;tribute run&lt;/a&gt;.\" In a tribute run the characters only kill &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the Gordok tribe, while keeping the other bosses alive. As a reward for sparing the lives of the other instance bosses, the characters receive higher quality, though fewer, rare drops from a tribute chest. In addition, the Gordok proclaim the characters to be kings, which grants access to a variety of two-hour &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s, alcoholic brews, and the quest &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Gordok%20Business\"&gt;Unfinished Gordok Business&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy guides.\nSome tips for doing Dire Maul in just one visit:\nResources.\nHerbs"}

{"id": "27336", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27336", "title": "Dire Maul tribute run", "text": "The Dire Maul Tribute Run is a way to get gear from the &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; instance. When &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; is killed, the player is declared king and all the remaining bosses give tribute, which is often better than the gear they drop when you kill them individually. The goal is therefore to kill the king without killing any other bosses.\nNeeded items.\nAt level 80 you do not need the trap repair or Gordok ogre suit items, as you can avoid boss aggro by sticking close to the walls and being careful.\nHeading to the instance.\nAll the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s outside the instance can be avoided entirely by riding around them. Take care and stick together just in case one &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;s. Head up the ramp into Eldreth Row, follow the corridor as it turns right and then left. At the T-junction, directly across from the entrance corridor is a massive closed arched doorway. Alcoves to the right and left provide a path around the door.\nBeyond the large door are the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Commons\"&gt;Broken Commons&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the arena. The DM North entrance is all the way across on the other side. Ride around the perimeter of the commons until you reach the doors, avoiding ogres and dogs as you go. Up the ramp you will find a door.\nInside the instance.\nAround the corner inside the instance, there is one ogre on a short patrol path. Kill it and wait for a couple of patrols to pass. As they do, pull them back to the entrance alcove and dispose of them.\nFrom the entrance alcove, head to the left, pulling and killing ogre groups until you have reached the corner. You should now be near a separate room that has a slight ramp up to it and a large raised rectangular part in the middle.\nWhen you head in to the new area, be careful of more patrols; take your time, pulling and killing. Head to the left and get to the corner. You will now be able to see a ramp up to the rectangular platform; &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Fengus\"&gt;Guard Fengus&lt;/a&gt; patrols that area, and he comes down and turns right, walks up to the corner and then goes back. Be wary of him; if you do aggro him, run to the instance entrance while leaving a durable member (who will die) to keep Fengus occupied long enough that everyone else gets out, at which point he will reset rather than go to the instance entrance to greet you when you come back in. If he does aggro, it's still early enough in the run to reset the instance and try again without too much lost time.\nYou need to get across the room to the door on the west side: the shortest path is to follow the left wall, but you'll have to deal with Fengus' patrol pattern. It helps to put a raid marker on him, which can sometimes be seen through terrain objects and let you know he's coming.\nInside the Inner Instance.\nHead in and clear the mobs, including some bugs which need a little &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; lesson. At the bottom of the ramp, you'll come to a room where you can see a Broken Ice Trap. Hang back for a minute and watch &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Slip%27Kik\"&gt;Guard Slip'Kik&lt;/a&gt;, who patrols this area. His patrol pattern takes him right over the Broken Ice Trap. Pull the mobs by the fire back away from Slip'kik when his patrol pattern allows for it and dispose of them.\nWhen Guard Slip'Kik walks away, quickly fix the trap with 1 &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Oil\"&gt;Frost Oil&lt;/a&gt; &amp; 1 &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Widget\"&gt;Thorium Widget&lt;/a&gt;. Then move back and wait for the idiot of an ogre to activate the trap. He will now be frozen for the remainder of the instance.\nIt is possible to get past &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Slip%27kik\"&gt;Guard Slip'kik&lt;/a&gt; without using the trap at all, although it is a little tricky. You must carefully observe Guard Slip'kik's patrol pattern \u2013 make sure he is at the complete other end of the room, as far away as possible, before you attempt to pull other mobs in the room. Before moving past him, you will need to pull a total of two groups of mobs and one &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Eye%20of%20Kilrogg\"&gt;Wandering Eye of Kilrogg&lt;/a&gt;. These groups are: two ogre-mages and their pets in the far corner of the room, past the trap, and under the staircase two whirlwind axe ogres. Make sure, however, that when pulling the first group (with the mages) that the entire group runs all the way back into the doorway that led into the room, as they have range and you will need to be that far back in order for them to move out of Guard Slip'kik's patrol path. The ogres with the whirlwind axes are easier, but similarly pull them far back so that you are not within Guard Slip'kik's patrol. Once you have downed these two groups, head into the far corner where the mages were, then run along that wall towards the stairs until you get to a small pillar jutting out of the wall that blocks you from walking further. Make sure you are as close against this wall as possible. Guard Slip'kik should walk by without aggro, giving you enough time to run towards the stairs, pulling the remaining mobs three quarters up the stairway. This is difficult, as you must be high enough that Guard Slip'kik will not aggro when he walks back, and you don't want to aggro the group of mobs at the top of the stairs. It may take a bit of practice, but without much trouble you can save yourself a few gold or time going to town to get the ingredients if you forgot them.\nThe goblin by the fire is &lt;a href=\"Knot%20Thimblejack\"&gt;Knot Thimblejack&lt;/a&gt;: he can make you a &lt;a href=\"Gordok%20Ogre%20Suit\"&gt;Gordok Ogre Suit&lt;/a&gt; if you have the &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Tannin\"&gt;Ogre Tannin&lt;/a&gt;, which is on the platform directly above you.\nFight your way through the rest of this room and up the ramp to the next level. You will need to clear this level of all mobs, which is only a couple of groups. Once you have done that, heal up and rebuff, as when you loot the Ogre Tannin (&lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Gordok%20Bushwacker\"&gt;Gordok Bushwacker&lt;/a&gt; will come down the ramp and attack; he is not hard as long as you have rested. He has a very high probability of dropping the key to free Knot Thimblejack, if you haven't picked one up yet.\nWhoever has the Ogre Tannin can head back to the Goblin and make the Gordok Ogre Suit, or make it themselves if they've learned the pattern. I would recommend that you all go down in case one of the Eyes turns up. Once you have it, head up back up the ramp and clear all the mobs away from the door area.\nKing's Area.\nHead through the inner Courtyard door. Clear the mobs until you reach &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Kromcrush\"&gt;Captain Kromcrush&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, use the Gordok Ogre Suit and have a little chat with him. He will turn red and run back the way you came. Do not worry; you cannot aggro him after he has turned red from the ogre suit. Also do not waste the opportunity to see an ogre dance - whoever has the suit on should try a few emotes as they can be quite funny!\nClear your way up to the dais where &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; is. He does not call for help and does not generally run off the dais or knock people off, so it's only necessary to clear enough of the ogres to get there safely.\nBoss Fight.\nUsually you'll want to keep the King's advisor (&lt;a href=\"Cho%27Rush%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Cho'Rush the Observer&lt;/a&gt;) alive as this will improve the tribute loot. Cho'Rush does, however, drop very nice loot, some of which is better than what can be found in the tribute chest. He will, however, heal the King so it's best to keep him busy in some way that prevents him from doing this. Hunters can use &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; on him to buy a few seconds at the start of the fight, but he is immune to other forms of crowd control. The best solution is to have one durable player offtank him and pull him far away from the King. A Shaman is ideal for this task, as he can tank, heal, and interrupt casting with low rank Earth Shock and Grounding Totem. Other self-sufficient classes such as Paladins and Druids can capably offtank him, and even a well-geared Rogue can keep Cho'Rush busy with stuns and interrupts. One very easy way (maybe the best way) to tank the King's advisor is to have a warlock put his Felhunter on him and ask the warlock to put curse of tongues on the advisor. You wouldn't even need to heal the Felhunter since he does it himself and the warlock can actually join the Boss fight himself. The King hits like a truck, so keep him on the tank and off your cloth. If all goes well you will now have the King's dropped loot and the &lt;a href=\"Gordok%20Tribute\"&gt;Gordok Tribute&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are good swimmers and may attack from the water; others hunt &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;s. A dire bear will attempt to get a good hold on a victim and then bite until the victim is dead.\nSome dire bears are known to have bony protrusions all over their body, as if their skeletons were trying to fight their way out.

Although dire gargoyles are not actually &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures, they are staunch allies of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and can often be seen circling the battlefields like hungry crows. These ice-skinned predators enjoy pain and torment, and their laughter sounds like shattering ice. They thrill to the excitement of the chase and the glory of a kill. They are a bloodthirsty, sadistic, and frighteningly destructive race.\nLike the basic gargoyle species, they have been brought from the frozen north by the Lich King's armies. Like their cousins, they are voracious flying creatures who like to revel in slaughter and mayhem. They also have crystalline hides which can become a stone-like surface. Although they can't attack in that state, they can take time to regenerate from their injuries. As it is known as a dire creature, it would imply that it is larger than the standard race it evolved from. Normal gargoyles are less intelligent and less humanoid than dire gargoyles. As a result, Arthas has not bothered to enslave normal gargoyles. However, Arthas does consider the dire gargoyles his allies.\nDire gargoyles are not particularly bright creatures, and likening them to crows is no mistake. Despite their humanoid appearance, gargoyles are not sapient. They will attack at a whim, swooping from above to tear into the enemy's ranks with little thought for their own protection. These vicious creatures enjoy chaos and disintegration and revel in sprays of blood and torn flesh. They are not interested in combat strategy or grand army tactics, preferring simply to take advantage of the enemy wherever they see weakness.\nBecause dire gargoyles are not particularly intelligent, this strategy serves them well. They hover above the enemy while it is being attacked by a greater foe and then swoop down and carry off those too weak to struggle effectively. They enjoy such sadistic measures, and creatures carried away in this fashion can expect to live for a while \u2014 just long enough to regret the situation. A dire gargoyle that comes across a solitary target takes great pleasure in tormenting its prey. It attacks, withdraws, attacks again from concealment, withdraws, and attacks again, all the while taunting the harried creature."}

A variety of reasons might be behind this unusual size and musculature. For example, they might have been altered &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemically&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;ally, or they might also simply have been born larger than average. Regardless of the day-to-day prejudices that these trolls must contend with from other races, dire trolls are not regarded as monstrous by other trolls. &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt; children can be seen riding upon the backs of dire troll children.\nAmong the military of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; are the elite dire trolls. These trolls are warriors who have perfected their arts, traded portions of their lives for the dark gift of brutal strength, and serve Zandalar as her greatest weapons of war. Long ago it was decided that the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; dire trolls should always have a seat on the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that those specials needs of the elite warriors were met by the government, and to provide the wisdom of war to those councilors who may seldom see a battlefront. Dire trolls are short lived.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt; used the forbidden &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a trick he had learned from his father &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Jok'non&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to transform a few &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; trolls into hulking berserkers possessed of otherwordly strength.

Cautious by direwolf standards, the &lt;a href=\"Riding%20Harness\"&gt;dustmane&lt;/a&gt; can only be coaxed to ride with something it considers special.\nIn the RPG.\nDire wolves look like normal &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, but these creatures are nearly twice the size.

As tall as a man, these great wolves have long tusked jaws that look like they could snap an iron bar. They have burning red eyes. Dire wolves are mottled gray or black in color. Dire wolves thrive in the northern regions of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. Though they can be trained as vicious combatants, most will avoid &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and other races, preferring to hunt down game. Untamed dire wolves hunt and fight much like their smaller brethren. Any substantial opposition will cause a pack to break off, looking for easier prey. Trained dire wolves will attempt to bite at vulnerable tendons in the legs or try to pierce the necks of opposing mounts. Dire wolves are efficient pack hunters that kill anything they catch. Orcs have always been enthralled with the creatures' cunning and strength, and train them as their preferred mounts. Dire wolves prefer to attack in packs, surrounding and flanking a foe when they can. Orcs sometimes use these fearsome monsters as mounts, preferring them to &lt;a href=\"warhorse\"&gt;warhorse&lt;/a&gt;s for their dexterity and ferocity.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Darkwolf\"&gt;Darkwolves&lt;/a&gt; may have been domesticated dire wolves."}

These saurian titans populate many islands in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. Though they can seem like gentle giants, they are among the toughest and strongest of all things that walk on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Even at a tiny size, direhorns are known to wreak havoc on unsuspecting victims.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s are regarded for their beast taming, and one of their greatest allies is that of the direhorn. With plated skin that can be harder than plate armor and spikes protruding from various directions, direhorns offer protection both for themselves and their masters. It was custom for a direhorn's future master to be the first to see it when it broke free from its shell. The Zandalari breed specific direhorn species for their small size for use as mounts. A common coming-of-age rite among the Zandalari is to travel to one of the violent, beast-ruled islands near &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;the capital&lt;/a&gt; to steal or subdue a wild creature, such as a direhorn or &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt;. Before a Zandalari sets out to tame a direhorn, they are known to traditionally carve sigils into their arm with ceremonial horns, speak to a bestial &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, drink a wild draught, wear a twin-tusk mask, and \"roar with the inner voice\". There is an old Zandalari saying about wild direhorns: \"Run!\"\nThe Zandalari recently deployed direhorns for use as living war engines to aid them in defending the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; allies on the Isle of Thunder.\nAs a hunter pet.\nDirehorns were added in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt; as a tamable &lt;a href=\"pet%20family\"&gt;pet family&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s that have learned the required skill. Aspiring direhorn owners should seek out clues regarding these auspicious beasts. The direhorn's special ability is &lt;a href=\"Gore%20%28pet%20ability%29\"&gt;Gore (pet ability)&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to tame a direhorn, hunters will need find an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Tome%20of%20Dinomancy\"&gt;Ancient Tome of Dinomancy&lt;/a&gt;, which drops from the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Dinomancer\"&gt;Zandalari Dinomancer&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt;.

Drivers are completely unaffected by movement impairing effects when using a vehicle, though some effects can move the vehicle itself. Some vehicles can fly, while others are stationary and can merely rotate, such as the or the .\nUI.\nTo indicate that a character can board a vehicle, the pointer becomes a folded-over arrow.

This may bring up an interface unique to the vehicle, with a different frame including its own action bar (with fewer, larger buttons) and a dismount button. Dismounting a vehicle often causes the character to fly upwards and gain a temporary parachute buff to float safely to the ground. Not all vehicles show these pointers, as some are only activated through conversation with vehicle in &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; mode."}

{"id": "312045", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=312045", "title": "Veil", "text": "The Veil (&lt;a href=\"%23Other%20names\"&gt;see below for other names and denotations&lt;/a&gt;) is the border between the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and the countless &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s beyond the Shadowlands.\nThe Veil can be seen as a shadowy version of the physical &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, and can be routinely visited as a spirit when &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s die and release from their corpse unless they are in a zone in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe Veil is a greyscale &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the departed linger until they are gathered by a &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; to be brought to the Shadowlands. Kyrian Watchers known as &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt;s dwell in the Veil and appear to those who die to peer into the soul's inner self and evaluate whether they are ready to be dead. If the Watchers deem the soul ready, they will call forth a kyrian Bearer to come and bring their soul to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in the Shadowlands. If they aren't ready, the Watchers return them to life. The Kyrian ferrying souls across the veil into the Shadowlands also ensures a steady supply of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; for all the realms.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Tony%20Two-Tusk\"&gt;Spirit of Tony Two-Tusk&lt;/a&gt; describes the Veil as \"all grey and dark, swirling clouds\". While &lt;a href=\"Uuna\"&gt;Uuna&lt;/a&gt; was in the Veil, she described it as dark and she was unable to see anything, though she could hear people interacting with her in the physical world. From within the Shadowlands, she could see the light of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; who was in the physical world, but it was so bright that it scared her. The &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Falathim\"&gt;Lake Falathim&lt;/a&gt; allowed her to see &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a friend&lt;/a&gt; in the physical world.\nSometimes, the spirits roam the Veil without resting. It can be because their resting place wasn't complete, because of a battle in their resting place, or because of the corruption of their resting place. To bring eternal peace to the souls, it is needed to destroy the source of corruption or by making a ceremony with items such as &lt;a href=\"Tuskarr%20Ritual%20Object\"&gt;Tuskarr Ritual Object&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpirits in the Veil can physically interact with objects and people in the living world.\nThere are various ways for the living to enter the Veil. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Murkweed\"&gt;Murkweed&lt;/a&gt; plant's toxins are so potent that it even fools the spirit, allowing one to temporarily enter. Inhaling certain incenses are also capable of allowing passage to the Veil. It can also be seen with some devices and potions while being alive. Many not-dead mortals who visit the Veil do not return.\n&lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; is perceived differently in the Veil. &lt;a href=\"Salanar%20the%20Horseman\"&gt;Salanar the Horseman&lt;/a&gt;, who inhabits the realm, mentioned that only a few days had passed for him between the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; when it was really years in the living world.\nWhile within the Veil, visions of past events may be seen.\nAppearances.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", the Veil can be seen when a &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; dies. They can be resurrected by a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;Spirit Healer&lt;/a&gt; (or by finding the &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt; of their physical body, though this may be just a game mechanic)."}

They were hired by a goblin smuggler out of &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"Gremnik%20Rizzlesprang\"&gt;Gremnik Rizzlesprang&lt;/a&gt;, who was covetous of Lord Valthalak's spellbook. Gremnik was killed not long after by a group of Valthalak's &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin\"&gt;spectral assassins&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe company invaded deep into the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;upper reaches of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, against its lord and leader &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;General Valthalak&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Anthion%20Harmon\"&gt;Anthion Harmon&lt;/a&gt;, always loved challenge. Everything went surprisingly according to plan, right up to the point where they were prying Valthalak's spellbook out of his stiff fingers.\nSpellbook in hand, they prepared to leave, but &lt;a href=\"Kormok\"&gt;Kormok&lt;/a&gt;, the two-headed &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, grabbed the amulet that Valthalak was wearing. The rest of the company went crazy; some telling to leave it alone, and others who wanted it for themselves. The whole company stood in the middle of that massive chamber and fought over this amulet, their echoes heard at every level of the spire. In the end, they broke the amulet into three pieces, not knowing the curse that would await them, and they rolled a dice. The &lt;a href=\"Top%20Piece%20of%20Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;top piece&lt;/a&gt; got to &lt;a href=\"Theldren\"&gt;Theldren&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Left%20Piece%20of%20Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;left piece&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Isalien\"&gt;Isalien&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Right%20Piece%20of%20Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;right piece&lt;/a&gt; to siblings &lt;a href=\"Jarien%20and%20Sothos\"&gt;Jarien and Sothos&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoments later, Valthatlak's spirit made an entrance and started summoning forth all spectral assassins he could to assail the mercenaries. Since they were not in any condition to fight back, they chose to run. &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Grayhoof\"&gt;Mor Grayhoof&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, slipped and fell to the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;lower reaches of the spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe company broke up afterward, with too much bad blood and the incident with the amulet was the straw that broke the team. Ever since then Valthalak's servants have been picking the members off one by one. Most of the amulet piece holders are dead, their souls corrupted by the portion of Valthalak's spirit contained within it.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Mokvar\"&gt;Mokvar&lt;/a&gt;'s death during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deliana\"&gt;Deliana&lt;/a&gt; is now the last surviving member of the Veiled Blade."}

With threat being practically a non-issue in the current game, the reduction of Fade in PvE becomes less attractive but if a priest finds themselves with mana issues, the reduction in Shadowfiend would be useful, and also provides a little additional dps.\nIn PvP, the reduction in cooldown of Fade is useful for Shadow priests, with the &lt;a href=\"Phantasm\"&gt;Phantasm&lt;/a&gt; talent causing Fade to free the priest from all roots and snares. 2 points in Veiled Shadows results in a 20% reduction in Fade's cooldown, and being able to escape more often can save the priest's life."}
