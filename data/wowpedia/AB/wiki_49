Freed from the grasp of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, they regrouped under the banner of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, took control of as their headquarters, and cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;. They fight as hard for the safety of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as anyone living.\nAfter getting their vengeance, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose. They dedicated themselves to the protection of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and some of their members rejoined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, of which they were members before their death against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the death knights and the Lich King &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; come to an agreement: they will help him get revenge on the Legion, and in return, he will keep the Scourge contained and help them with powerful weapons. The Ebon Blade later fought alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt;, and moved their &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Ebon Blade expanded its rank with the heroes who died honorably on the battlefields. After he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; who destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, piercing the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; between Azeroth and the Realm of the Dead, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon took the lead of the Ebon Blade. While they assisted the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;resurgence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Ebon Blade followed their Highlord in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the fall of the Banished One, the death knights returned to Azeroth, focusing their efforts on safeguarding &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and preventing the Scourge from spreading across Azeroth.\nHistory.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Knights of the Ebon Blade were originally an army of Scourge death knights trained in the halls of Acherus and were under the direct command of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. They were supposedly trained for the specific purpose of destroying both the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, the last bastions of Light in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey managed to destroy &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Scarlet Crusade presence in the before turning on &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Light's Hope Chapel.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, wielding the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, leads &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and a force of 10,000 &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; against 300 &lt;a href=\"Defender%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Defenders of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and the Argent Dawn leadership located at Light's Hope.\nThe Scourge forces pound hard and take out an entire third of the Argent Dawn defense, but Mograine starts having problems attacking further defenders with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. The paladin emerged to defend Light's Hope Chapel, and along with the paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, he unleashed his holy fury against the invading armies of undead. Fordring's &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-given powers overpower and defeat Mograine, as well as immediately kill the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces in the immediate area, causing &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt; to flee. The Light overwhelmed the might of the Scourge, and the death knights knew defeat. Darion orders the remaining death knight forces to stand down while Fordring berates him for his foolishness and tells him that Arthas sent him and his death knights on a suicide mission.\nAs they await the paladin's judgment, they witness a vision of Mograine's father, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary Ashbringer himself. He told his son that he would one day wield the Ashbringer and use it to mete out justice, but \"that day is not today\".\nThe Lich King himself arrives not long afterwards and confirmed that the attack on Light's Hope Chapel was merely a ploy to strike at Tirion. Realizing the depths of his betrayal, Darion was enraged that he had been used as fodder, and he lashed out at his master with his wrath. However, the Lich King easily cast him aside, and incapacitated Darion and the other death knights. He then focuses his attention on Fordring, incapacitating him with a crippling spell and knocking back the Argent soldiers who charged in. Remembering the words spoken by his father, Mograine throws the corrupted Ashbringer to Fordring, whose powers of the Light succeed in purifying it. With the purified blade in hand, Fordring charges into the Lich King and throws him back. Aware that even he stands little chance against the Ashbringer near the Chapel, the Lich King retreats, promising that the next time he meets Fordring, it will not be on holy ground.\nAfter Arthas' departure, Fordring calls for the union of the Argent Dawn and the Order of the Silver Hand into the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, intended to bring the war to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; itself. Mograine pledges himself and his knights to the same cause, naming his new order the Knights of the Ebon Blade. With their free will restored, Mograine and his death knights return to Acherus and capture it, destroying the Scourge remnants within. With their new base secured, Mograine then sends his knights to rejoin their people, sending them to throw themselves at the mercy of either &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; (if their race belonged to the Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (if they belonged to the Horde).\nThe surviving death knights that remained loyal to the Scourge formed the &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20Suffering\"&gt;Host of Suffering&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt;, who fled when the Scourge was defeated at Light's Hope, as their leader.\nNorthrend invasion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; began, the Ebon Blade launched the invasion of Northrend alongside the Alliance, the Horde, and the Argent Crusade. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, only the Ebon Blade and the Argent Crusade had remained fully dedicated to the war against the Scourge. The two neutral factions had rallied their forces and readied themselves to unleash a new offensive against the Lich King and his servants across the continent.\nThe disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; broke a tenuous trust that had only just begun to form between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and nearly ended the war against the Lich King before it had truly been joined. It was then the Ebon Blade and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; that took over the push for the Lich King's head, and kept both factions from forgetting entirely who the true enemy was.\nWorking in tandem, the death knights and paladins focused their attention on &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, entrenching themselves in the region. In the region, they established Ebon Watch as a small outpost and from there conducted their own operations\u2014and some in cooperation with the Argent Crusade.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Vault\"&gt;Shadow Vault&lt;/a&gt; fell under the control of the Knights of the Ebon Blade led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Lankral\"&gt;Duke Lankral&lt;/a&gt;, the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt; was one of the projects of Ebon Blade. At first, the Ebon Blade sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to fight the vrykul at the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Ledge\"&gt;Savage Ledge&lt;/a&gt;, and then to kill &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Ufrang%20the%20Mighty\"&gt;Thane Ufrang the Mighty&lt;/a&gt;. After this, the adventurers were sent there to free their captive death knights, to weaken the vrykul resolve by burning their banners, to help &lt;a href=\"the%20Bone%20Witch\"&gt;the Bone Witch&lt;/a&gt; wreaking havoc from within, to burn down their buildings, to plant their banners in the bodies of their fallen warriors, and also to slay their &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs the sole way for any kind of force to invade &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; would be to breach , and , each made almost entirely of saronite, near indestructible, and manned by massive Scourge constructs, the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; working with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was what allowed them to pass these defenses.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nAs armies began to prepare for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade and the Knights of the Ebon Blade launched preliminary attacks on its defenses. In the lead-up to the final battle, the Argent Crusade forged a new alliance with the Knights of the Ebon Blade, one which would lead the assault on the Icecrown Citadel's defenses, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; was born; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUY3oZH6Piz4\"&gt;united, they gathered in the mighty fortress's shadow to begin the assault&lt;/a&gt;. Having swept aside opposition and seized the Citadel's entrance, the gates were battered down and the Ashen Verdict secured a foothold just inside the entrance, from which they would push deeper into the complex.\nCataclysm.\nAlthough the members of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; still stand by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; heroes who joined them in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s actions since the slaying of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; had deeply concerned the crusaders. They, along with certain members of the Ebon Blade, decided to watch Sylvanas and the Forsaken very closely, as similarities between her and the Lich King kept increasing in number by the day.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe death knights of the Ebon Blade offered their aid to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;commander of the Alliance or Horde's forces&lt;/a&gt; and joined their &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;. Having an exalted status with the Ebon Blade even offered the commander the possibility to have death knights defend their base.\nAmong them, &lt;a href=\"Human%20Death%20Knight\"&gt;Human Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; were notably taken out by the &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; sent from the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Death%20Knight\"&gt;Orc Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; were taken out by the &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; sent from the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; garrison of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaking the chance to discover the secrets of , &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt; (Horde). Though the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; had been defeated, Darion claimed that they were no closer to unlocking the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; than they were when jousting pointlessly at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bolvar\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0remained resigned to his fate. Darion believed that perhaps there was something there that could aid their cause. Ner'zhul was not always the Lich King, he explained. Once, he was a mere orc dabbling in dark powers beyond his comprehension. He asked the commanders of the Alliance and Horde's forces to find whatever they could of Ner'zhul's early studies, and they returned with a Dark Parchment from the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, which Darion brought back to the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Hold\"&gt;Ebon Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Traveling%20Adventurer\"&gt;death knight adventurer&lt;/a&gt; also appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nFollowing the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Ebon Blade come to an agreement with the new Lich King, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;: The Ebon Blade will willingly act as the Lich King's agents against the Legion, if the Scourge remains contained to Northrend. The Lich King offers powerful weapons to champions of the Ebon Blade, directing students of to the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; to defeat and take the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and sending the students of to the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20Catacombs\"&gt;catacombs&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to obtain &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;. For those trained by , the Lich King summons them directly to Icecrown Citadel, where they gather the broken shards of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; to forge into a pair of new weapons, the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Once these three weapons are obtained, the death knights wielding them are brought to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and granted the Lich King's blessing, empowered to act in his name against the Legion.\nThe Knights of the Ebon Blade set out to reform the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, adding new powerful champions into their ranks.\nAt one point, the champions of the Ebon Blade entered the Monastery in order to retrieve the saddle of &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;'s steed, killing &lt;a href=\"Faralis%20the%20Fanatic\"&gt;Faralis the Fanatic&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nLater they assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, now led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Goodchilde\"&gt;High Commander Goodchilde&lt;/a&gt;, in their quest to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; as a member of their new &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; declared they would not leave until every last crusader had been killed and every banner burned.\nThe Knights of the Ebon Blade aided in the war against the Burning Legion by sending out packs of ghouls to fight against the demons, as well as creating new death knights from the casualties of the Alliance and the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; also asked &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; champions to aid him in rescuing &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; from his imprisonment in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Koltira is successfully rescued after the two death knights fight through the guards.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nUnder Bolvar's command, the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; acquired fallen champions of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; through the battlefields and graveyards of Azeroth.\nThus the Knights of the Ebon Blade welcomed a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt; of death knights into their fold, being raised by the Lich King in preparation for times ahead. They were then sent by Darion Mograine to travel to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. \nFollowing the Fourth War, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s reports mentioned that the Scarlet Crusade was effectively totally wiped out by the Ebon Blade.\nShadowlands.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar was no longer the Lich King. Several undead in Acherus attacked the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, but they made a short work of them and secured the Ebon Hold. As the rift between the Shadowlands and Azeroth was opened, Bolvar took the direct leadership of the organization as their new Highlord. Following the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the Ebon Blade stepped forward to help the Alliance and Horde combat the threat. Sally Whitemane and Nazgrim became the Ebon Blade's emissary to the factions, while members of both factions were called to Icecrown Citadel to work against Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAboard Acherus, they and Lord Darion Mograine went atop the Citadel where the rest of the Knights of the Ebon Blade and Bolvar were waiting alongside the leaders of the Alliance and the Horde. After explaining how dire the situation was, the Highlord directed the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to use the shattered fragments of the Helm of Domination to conjure a portal to enter the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; with the troops of the Ebon Blade.\nHowever, the chaotic energies of this place have scattered the death knights, and their forces were already depleted after only mere moments there. They had to face the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces, losing a large number of their troops during their advance, enough for &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to be shocked at the few death knights remaining.\nHaving no choice but to continue to advance before enemy reinforcements arrive, Darion led the Ebon Blade's charge alongside an adventurer to save the captured leaders of the Horde and Alliance. When they finally arrived at the exit, the Jailer's forces attacked them and only the adventurer made it out, with the others including Darion captured.\nLater, Bolvar managed to travel to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, alongside other Ebon Blade death knights, where they united with the denizens of the city to defend the Shadowlands. In time Darion was rescued, and joined his fellow death knights within Oribos. In order for new allies from Azeroth to come in the Shadowlands, &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade%20Acolyte\"&gt;acolytes&lt;/a&gt; of the Ebon Blade were ordered to establish portals to access Oribos from the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the covenants rallied together to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Ardenweald\"&gt;defend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; from Sylvanas and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Ebon Blade remained behind in Orbis to defend the city.\nFollowing the departure of Zovaal to an unknown destination at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar ordered the death knights to take the unconscious &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; prisoner within Oribos in the hopes that they could interrogate her about the Jailer's plan. Sylvanas was eventually released from their custody, after Uther was able to aid her, and she decided to join the fight against the Jailer.\nSeveral members of the Ebon Blade accompanied Bolvar and the other heroes into &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Following the death of Zovaal, Darion declared that the Ebon Blade no longer needed to maintain a presence within Oribos and would soon make their exodus from the city and return to Azeroth. However, the death knights' vigil was far from over, as without the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; to control them, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; threatened to spread across the world like the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague that created them&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the Ebon Blade's mission was to return to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and keep the Scourge in check, while safeguarding &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt; was killed and his Scourge attack on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; thwarted, Lor'themar promised to inform the Ebon Blade of these events. He also feared that things were far worse in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Watch\"&gt;Ebon Watch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; remained out of an abundance of caution for years, and that caution turned out to be rather prescient, as they face the unleashed Scourge in the region. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the Ebon Blade knights led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Lankral\"&gt;Duke Lankral&lt;/a&gt; still control the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Vault\"&gt;Shadow Vault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, but now that the Scourge is no longer under &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s control, it is only a matter of time before a counterattack, since it's such a plum location.\nMembers.\nTroops.\nThey deploy &lt;a href=\"Pack%20of%20Ghouls\"&gt;pack of ghouls&lt;/a&gt;, zombies, geists, skeletons, gargoyles, wights, banshees, abominations, Ebon Knights, Ebon Ravagers, and &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Knight%20Frostreavers\"&gt;Ebon Knights Frostreavers&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nAll players, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, start out at with the Knights of the Ebon Blade.

Empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, these mighty warriors brandish both their warhammers and holy fire in the battle against all who would trample the meek and innocent, as they seek to be an example of the Light's teachings, protecting the weak and vanquishing the evil of the world. Under the command of the &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, they led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to victory against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor years, they remained loyal to &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; and kept the peace in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, settling civil disputes and quelling any &lt;a href=\"demi-human\"&gt;demi-human&lt;/a&gt; uprisings in the realm. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Order was suspended by one of its own members, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, as Uther refused to purge the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; infected by the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. Although the paladins continued to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, their leadership was decimated during the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;fall of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; succeeded the late Uther. With the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros became a symbol of resistance until he was &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. His death shattered the Silver Hand, who eventually split up between the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; for ideological reasons.\nHowever, a part of the Order remained active in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; paladins from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; were still referred to as \"Knights of the Silver Hand\". Years later, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; came out of his exile and regrouped the remains of the Order in Lordaeron to resume the fight against the undead and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion led his knights during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and later merged them with the Argent Dawn to form the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and take the fight to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29%23Quotes\"&gt;fall of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand paladins remained loyal to the Alliance and pursued their fight against &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;threaten&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, while those in the Argent Crusade worked to restore the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;northern Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade was &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;decimated&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, and in his last breath, Tirion Fordring handed the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Champion of the Light&lt;/a&gt; whom he chose as his successor. In order to save Azeroth, the Silver Hand was formally reestablished and supported by each major paladin order. From the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, they fought alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt; united as the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. At the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand split up and supported once more the Alliance against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFoundation and the Second War.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; forces amassed for the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, made other preparations. The Alliance was composed of disparate nations, some of which were rivals. They all had different customs and ways of life. Lothar needed something to bind them as one. He needed champions whom every human could rally behind, no matter where they came from. The &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s were the most obvious choice to fill this role, but they hadn't fared well as the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt; was devastated during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Though they were brave, they lacked martial training and were better suited to using the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to mend wounds off the battlefield. Lothar needed something else.\nThe solution came from the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to create an order that would suffer less attrition in battle, the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently learned everything that had transpired in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, including how the clerics had fared, met Anduin Lothar and offered him to create a new order that would represent the best qualities of humanity. An order that would include soldiers gifted not only in wielding the Light, but also possessing leadership qualities and mastering the arts of traditional warfare, while embodying the qualities of loyalty, bravery, and honor. With Lothar's consent, Alonsus Faol and Uther recruited noble knights and members of the priesthood from Lordaeron, so that the Archbishop could respectively train them in the ways of the Light and in martial combat as his apprentices. There was &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the priest who had helped forge the Alliance at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;; then &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain of a man who was gifted with immense physical strength; &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, a knight renowned for his zeal and resilience; &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, an accomplished knight and a pious believer who had already apprenticed under Faol for some years; and lastly &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;, a battle-hardened knight from Stormwind, a comrade of Lothar, who had fought in the First War.\nFaol welcomed his students with open arms, which he later named paladins, while the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; would later serve as their base of operations. Yet for the time being, Lothar kept them close, ordering them to travel alongside the main Alliance army. Day and night, the holy warriors were trained vigorously by Faol, who taught them how to use the Light to comfort their allies and smite their enemies, and also how to lead by example. They would be more than just weapons, as no matter how dire times became, the paladins would serve as lights in the darkness, as beacons of hope to guide the Alliance. The Archbishop instructed them to live simple lives, they would seek no fortune or glory in war. Until the end of their days, they would put the needs of others above their own. As training progressed, Faol presented the five paladins a set of enchanted &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s from the church. Each libram represented what Faol saw as a core trait of the Silver Hand and challenged his students to become living embodiments of what their holy tomes represented: Turalyon would hold the Libram of Protection, Uther would hold the Libram of Justice, Tirion would hold the Libram of Retribution, Saidan would hold the Libram of Holiness, and Gavinrad would hold the Libram of Compassion. The Order of the Silver Hand was born.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Uther was appointed the first of the paladins. He was then followed by Dathrohan, Tirion, Turalyon, and Gavinrad. Its name and symbol had been taken from the \"Legend of the Silver Hand\", legacy of the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, as a symbol of those Light-wielding warriors who placed self-sacrifice above all else. During their formation, Lothar often checked in on the emergent order, and was so pleased that he asked the new paladins Turalyon and Uther to serve as his lieutenants. Alonsus Faol gladly agreed to satisfy the Supreme Commander's request, but he did not release his students from his care yet. It would be weeks before they were ready to set foot on the battlefield.\nThe Knights of the Silver Hand made their first appearance during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, where they rode through the Alliance lines while their presence filled their fellow soldiers with hope and courage. They called upon their holy powers to mend wounded soldiers and ease their fearful hearths, and when they faced the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde, they used their sacred powers in the form of blazing white light waves of energies that rippled over the Alliance soldiers, striking down the reanimated human corpses and sweeping away the death knights' corruptive fog. In the end, both sides were evenly matched, neither able to gain an advantage over the other, and they continued to occupy each other for the duration of the battle.\nDuring the months following the start of the war, Alonsus Faol recruited knights willing to learn how to wield the Light and clerics ready to take up arms for their noble cause in order to become members of the Silver Hand, their number increasing from five paladins to fourteen in a short time. Their leader Uther commanded such presence on the battlefield that his knights at times seemed both invincible and unstoppable. For the Alliance armies, they were truly a sight to behold, as the paladins healed the wounds sustained in combat and restored faith in the promise of freedom from &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish tyranny, while the sight of them wielding their mighty warhammers and holy powers gave others inspiration on the battlefield and the home front. Even some of the Alliance's greatest knights and warriors were in awe when they saw them smashing orcs down while healing fallen allies at the same time.\nThey were also known to minister to the masses during the war, gathering inside &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es to deepen their faith. Through meditating, communing, and tithing at these sanctified sites, they discovered new ways to channel their healing and spiritual powers. They could cast their blessing upon soldiers, sense evil, and even heal grievous wounds with but a touch.\nSubsequently, the paladins were instrumental in winning the war. They quell a &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt; revolt at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and confronted the Horde forces in the city and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Bay\"&gt;Tyr's Bay&lt;/a&gt; until the orcs razed down the city with a massive naval assault. At the same time, Uther and his knights were watching over the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt; and came to offer comfort to those who were suffering the misfortunes of war on the recently attacked island township of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;. During the journey, they faced pirates sent to assassinate the Lightbringer, and destroyed the orc troops still present near the island. When the Horde managed to reach Lordaeron and began the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;Siege of Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins took part in the defense of the realm under the command of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;King Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal was revealed by Anduin Lothar, and the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; was found guilty of its pact with the Horde. Consequently, some paladins joined the Alliance troops led by the high elf &lt;a href=\"Milan\"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; to save the captured peasants and magi, and to attack &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac City&lt;/a&gt; in order to halt the advance of Horde reinforcements towards Capital City. Without their reinforcements and the help of Alterac, the siege ended with the victory of the Alliance and a full retreat of the Horde back to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the meantime, it was also the support of the paladins that enabled the Alliance to make a swift march south towards Khaz Modan in their pursuit of the orcs, as it would have never been possible without the holy warriors who worked day and night, mending the wounded and filling their hearts with resolve and courage. During the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins under Turalyon led hunting parties to root out the orcs and drive them from the region, while Uther and his knights were sent by Lothar to Lordaeron, in order to make sure that the region was safe again from the orcs.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, while Doomhammer and Lothar squared off in a titanic battle, Uther and his men made their return and joined the throng. They ran forward to follow their fellow, auras springing up around them as well as they dove into the gathered Horde. Shortly after the start of the battle, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; arrived with his troops to support their allies. Though Doomhammer narrowly succeeded in vanquishing Lothar, the great hero's death did not have the effect the warchief had hoped for. Among the paladins, Uther was the first known to have manifested his powers on the battlefield, and Turalyon himself did not master his powers until after Lothar's death, but once he did, the orcish army cowered from his blinding light, which shone \"brighter than the brightest day\", before he disarmed Doomhammer and struck him unconscious rather than kill him, so that he could stand trial in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; for all the crimes he has committed.\nAfter the battle, control over the Alliance army fell to Turalyon. Uther expressed his happiness at seeing Turalyon's faith finally emerge, and Turalyon bestowed the title of \"the Lightbringer\" upon the older paladin. One week later, Turalyon led the Alliance's charge against the orc's last stand, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; itself, in what was considered the fiercest and bloodiest battle of the Second War. The Azerothian side of the Dark Portal was destroyed, thanks in part to the bravery and skill of Uther Lightbringer and the Order of the Silver Hand. Turalyon and the other paladins then rallied the Alliance forces while many of the orcs began to panic, some stood and fought, some surrendered, and others fled. The Alliance was victorious.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nAs the fires of the Second War died down, the Order of the Silver Hand coordinated with the Church of the Holy Light to help the Alliance of Lordaeron move forward. On Faol's decree, they healed the sick and granted shelter to the survivors broken by the war in Lordaeron and Stormwind, with Turalyon and Uther being present and helping in Stormwind City for a time. At the same time, the Alliance of Lordaeron took aggressive steps to contain the orcish threat, and a number of large internment camps were constructed in southern Lordaeron, guarded by both veteran soldiers and paladins of the Silver Hand, such as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skarloc\"&gt;Captain Skarloc&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt;. The camps proved to be a great success, though the captive orcs were tense and anxious to do battle once more, the various camp wardens kept the peace and maintained a strong semblance of order.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, where only &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; had journeyed as he told his comrades to stay behind before the closing of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand dedicated themselves to safeguarding the land from orc attacks by directing a few settlements across Lordaeron. The Order also began to train new paladins in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, swelling the ranks of the Order with a number of stout-hearted dwarves and some &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, a paladin pupil of Uther the Lightbringer.\nDuring these times, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Bastion of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; was considered as the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; of the Order, containing countless of their treasures, while the Silver Hand notably used the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Old Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, a center for learning and enlightenment known as a proud bastion of Lordaeron's priesthood, as a seminary and major training ground for paladins in training, notably those of the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after the war, the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; felt an affinity toward the Order of the Silver Hand and consequently learned how to wield the Light, as they adopted more techniques over time to help them in their duty to protect the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20crisis\"&gt;Alterac crisis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Senturus\"&gt;Lord Duncan Senturus&lt;/a&gt; and his paladins of the Silver Hand encountered &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, sent by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to save the Dragonqueen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, and took them to an unnamed settlement of the Order about three days from the port of &lt;a href=\"Hasic\"&gt;Hasic&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their reluctance to cooperate with the mage, they agreed to help them in their quest, escorting them to Hasic, which they found in ruins after an attack by a pair of dragon riders of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. They subsequently allied with &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Dragonreaver\"&gt;Falstad Dragonreaver&lt;/a&gt; and his wing of &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s in order to reach &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and while en route, Senturus sacrificed himself to save Rhonin and his companions when they were ambushed by Dragonmaw dragonriders. During meetings of great importance in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;Lordaeron's palace&lt;/a&gt;, especially when monarchs were visiting, the Knights of the Silver Hand were needed for protection and surveillance, being the only military unit they all trusted, so that even &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; agreed to having themselves searched by selected sentries from the holy order, even despite its outward allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears passed as tensions abated and a lasting peace settled over &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With his paladins, the Supreme commander &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; kept the peace in the kingdom, settling civil disputes and quelling &lt;a href=\"demi-human\"&gt;demi-human&lt;/a&gt; uprisings throughout the realm, while his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; integrated the Order through a ceremony performed at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; by Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen news of an upstart &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; rallying the few remaining &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;orc clans&lt;/a&gt;, those not suffering from lethargy like those who were imprisoned, and who succeeded in teaching them all he learned from &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; as a gladiator, King Terenas sent Uther and his paladins to quell the warchief's uprising while revolt against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; internment camps were about to unfold. However, the crafty orcs could never be found as the young warchief proved to be something of a tactical genius and evaded Uther's best efforts to corral his hit-and-run attacks. At the same time, the Silver Hand defended the settlements at the borders of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; warbands. Prince Arthas gained fame for counterattacking and defeating the trolls, but &lt;a href=\"Kedehern%20Falamar\"&gt;Kedehern Falamar&lt;/a&gt;, another Silver Hand member, perished during the fight and was considered a hero. Kedehern's Silver Hand masters brought his armor back to his father, &lt;a href=\"Brogan\"&gt;Brogan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;'s life was saved by the orc &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;. When Eitrigg was captured by &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;' soldiers, Tirion felt he owed a debt of honor and fought to rescue him. For assaulting Alliance soldiers, Tirion was brought to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to stand &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; before the jury composed of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop Alonsus Faol, and Prince Arthas. Despite the offer to be freed in exchange for breaking his vow, Tirion refused and Uther had no choice but to &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicate&lt;/a&gt; exile his old friend from Lordaeron. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Myranda%20the%20Hag\"&gt;Myranda the Hag&lt;/a&gt;, most trusted advisor of Tirion, was later banished after she openly dissented the verdict of the Order of the Silver Hand.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, King Terenas feared that Thrall would soon manage to gather all the remaining renegade orcs hidden in the lands of Lordaeron, which would be critical for the kingdom. He ordered Uther with the Knights of the Silver Hand and his son to ride towards southern Lordaeron, in order to contain the orcish threat and deal with them once and for all. In the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins notably fought against the bandits of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, and later the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;, who have recently captured citizens from &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; to sacrifice them to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, as they have re-embraced their demon worshiping.\nIn the meantime, a faction largely led by &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; started growing among the ranks of the Silver Hand. This &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; was intolerant of what they deemed as the \"&lt;a href=\"Demi-human\"&gt;lesser races&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Scourge of Lordaeron.\nIn the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, after preparing for many long months, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; released the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; upon Lordaeron. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow paladins investigated the infected regions in the hope of finding a way to stop the plague, but despite their efforts, the plague continued to spread and threatened to tear the Alliance apart.\nWhile the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; swept across Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; had managed to track the shipment of grain to Andorhal, where he succeeded in killing the culprit, the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, but even so, the undead ranks continued to swell with every soldier that fell defending the land. Frustrated and stymied by the seemingly unstoppable enemy, Arthas took increasingly extreme steps to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and conquer them, notably at &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;, where the city was about to be attacked by an army of undead, and the defenders had just baked and eaten the grain from Andorhal before the attack started. Along with soldiers of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s army, he was able to slay those infected before they could spread the disease to the entire town. Shortly thereafter the large undead army laid siege to the town, Arthas and his armies barely held off the undead long enough for the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; with Uther and his paladins, thus managing to repel the undead.\nHorrified, humiliated, and disturbed by his near-defeat, Arthas quickly left for &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, followed by Uther and his paladins, where they found that the city had been infected with the plague by &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, as the necromancer had told him. When Uther refused to follow Arthas' command to kill the infected population of Stratholme before they could die and be reborn as undead, Arthas turned his back on the other paladins, calling their refusal an act of treason, then relieved Uther from command, suspended his paladins from service and sent them away, while he called all those still loyal to Lordaeron to follow their prince. Consequently, Uther took the paladins that remained loyal to him and left Stratholme, abandoning Arthas to his barbaric actions.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, some former paladins, now called &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;deathlords&lt;/a&gt;, also committed the same heinous act in many other cities across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. When the Scourge swept again through Stratholme, the Silver Hand manufactured &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; to use against the invaders. They stored it inside small crates along with other vital supplies and distributed them throughout the city. Unfortunately, the remaining citizens turned into Scourge reinforcements before the supplies could ever be used.\nAt the same time, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; organized a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;'s inn, where he revealed the dark orb he kept after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. With the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan\"&gt;Doan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, he succeeded in purifying the artifact and decided that it would be forged into a weapon of retribution. Despite being suspended, the paladins unofficially continued to explore all available options to wipe out the Scourge under the command of Alexandros and &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the purge, Prince Arthas took the fleet to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, while the Silver Hand continued to defend Lordaeron villages. Uther informed King Terenas Menethil of his son's inhumane actions in Stratholme, and much to the sorrow of the King, they agreed that Arthas' judgment, and perhaps sanity, was wavering. Terenas sent an emissary to recall Arthas' expedition in Northrend and order their return. Disenfranchised, the paladins still worked selflessly to protect &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity from the gnawing jaws of evil, and were stretched thin fighting the spread of the plague. However, the Scourge continued to grow, taking villages and its turned inhabitants, with a small help from &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; and his corrupted food supplies. When a village that &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt; was stationed in was turned, Thomas understood that Rivendare was a traitor and reported it to the rest of the Silver Hand.\nIn the meantime, the Prince's fear and resolve proved to be his ultimate undoing. As he tracked the plague's source to Northrend, intending to end its threat forever, he instead fell prey to the machinations of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and lost his soul to the cursed runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. After Arthas became a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; in the service of the Lich King and killed all his men of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he returned to Lordaeron with his armies of undead to kill his father and destroy &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Four days after the death of Terenas, Uther ordered &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Champions of Peace&lt;/a&gt; to guard the cemetery near &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, where the remains of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; were buried. Despite the horrifying conditions, Andorhal was one of the few places in Lordaeron still under Alliance control. There, Uther and many of the surviving paladins had gathered in the city. They used it as a headquarters from which they launched attacks against the undead. As the Scourge swept over Lordaeron, panic seized the living and many gave in to despair, while some looked to the holy paladins for salvation. Lord Uther was the greatest of these righteous warriors, and if anyone had the power to stop the fallen prince, it was him.\nWhen Arthas came to retrieve the remains of the necromancer in order to revive him, Gavinrad refused and was personally killed by the death knight, who fed &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with his soul, while he unleashed his undead forces upon the paladins &lt;a href=\"Ballador%20the%20Bright\"&gt;Ballador the Bright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Truthbearer\"&gt;Sage Truthbearer&lt;/a&gt;, respective commanders of the &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Light\"&gt;Champions of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Champions of Truth&lt;/a&gt;. In the city of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, Uther stood against his former apprentice to protect the enchanted &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;Urn of King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;. In a battle that would decide Lordaeron's fate, &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; clashed with the legendary &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Hammer of the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Each weapon blow between the legendary paladin and the champion of the Lich King erupted in a shower of warring energies, it was a struggle between Light and darkness, between life and death. Although he almost lost against his former master and waited for the killing blow, Arthas took advantage of Uther's hesitation and took his soul with the cursed runeblade. The death knight then recovered and &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemed&lt;/a&gt; his father's urn, before continuing the scourging of the kingdom.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, a contingent of paladins of the Silver Hand led by &lt;a href=\"Davil%20Crokford\"&gt;Davil Crokford&lt;/a&gt; allied themselves with the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Captain Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;, having learned of the Scourge's impending attack on the town. But despite the paladins' successful efforts in steadying the line and holding back the undead, they ended up being defeated by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt; after Davil Crokford managed to slay the &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Horgus%20the%20Ravager\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt;, before perishing from his mortal wounds.\nAfter learning of the deaths of Terenas and Uther, Alexandros returned from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the mighty &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in hands and was reported to be paring down the Scourge's numbers. Subsequently, many paladins traveled to quarantined lands to ease the suffering of those left within the plague-ridden colonies, but although they were immune to &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; of any kind, they were persecuted by the general populace, who believed that they had been infected by the foul plague. Some of these paladins traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. When they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;icy fortress&lt;/a&gt;, embittered by the trials they had to suffer through, they had become dark and brooding. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; offered them untold power in exchange for their services and loyalty. Those fallen paladins, whose souls were twisted and bound to the will of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, became &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, the Scourge's mightiest generals.\nAt the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;destruction of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was gathering troops and Lordaeronians refugees to sail for &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Silver Hand stayed behind to defend those that couldn't get on the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; ships, such as &lt;a href=\"Krohm%20Dawnhammer\"&gt;Krohm Dawnhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who guided countless innocents to safety with his legendary shining hammer. A few paladins were also among the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; which reached Kalimdor. They later fought the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, notably &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Lionheart\"&gt;Duke Lionheart&lt;/a&gt;, who worked alongside the orcs to hunt down the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s left after the death of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the paladin &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; led the troops of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; against the demons and undead.\nAfter the Third War.\nSeveral months after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the surviving paladins joined the last bastions of human resistance. However, some of them were captured by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and were brought to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;, who was later freed by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently pledged himself to their cause.\nAfterward, detachments of paladins emerged again from the rubble of Lordaeron to form a resistance, protecting those who fled to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; under the control of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Some joined the &lt;a href=\"Garithos%27%20Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Garithos' Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt;, notably one who led a few &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;surviving royal guards&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard%20%28Lordaeron%29\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the others guarded the ruined &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20palace%20gardens\"&gt;Lordaeron palace gardens&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Dagren%20the%20Orcslayer\"&gt;Dagren the Orcslayer&lt;/a&gt;, Magroth the Defender, and &lt;a href=\"Halahk%20the%20Lifebringer\"&gt;Halahk the Lifebringer&lt;/a&gt;, respectively directing the &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Force\"&gt;Crippling Force&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Defenders%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Defenders of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Circle of Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. However, their combined efforts were not enough as they were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the Scourge to destroy the resistance.\nAmong the few who managed to survive the massacre, some were rallied by Dagren the Orcslayer to join the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Settlers\"&gt;Human Settlers&lt;/a&gt;. They later traveled to Kalimdor under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, in order to fight the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and locate Jaina Proudmoore. During the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Dagren the Orcslayer and the paladins were assigned to the protection of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, the &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Petty%20Officer\"&gt;Chief Petty Officer&lt;/a&gt; was a mighty Kul Tiran paladin and one of the Admiral's most loyal officers who ensured his protection until his death during the final battle in Theramore.\nThe paladins who remained in Lordaeron continued to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; for the next years. Elusive and resourceful, the undead were unable to defeat them in battle. Under the leadership of Lord Commander &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highlord\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, wielder of the Ashbringer, the Knights of the Silver Hand banded together to continue the war against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. However, dissensions started appearing in the leadership of the human resistance. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; suggested that, in order to retake their fallen cities, the Order should recruit among the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Other prominent leaders such as &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, considering the fate of Lordaeron the affairs of men.\nFrom their base at &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, used as a rallying point due to &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;'s offer for refuge, they were able to gain some victories during the next years. Worried about the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; entrenching themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins established a base in the now-abandoned Monastery of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, that would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Hoping to recruit additional personnel, they also made an alliance with Lord &lt;a href=\"Valdelmar\"&gt;Valdelmar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, extending their protection to the fortified city from daily attacks of the undead. However, during an attack on &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Commander &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; was killed, his corpse possessed as a fleshly costume by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, who then started slowly working against the Order's objectives from the inside.\nFearing that the Ashbringer might destroy the Forsaken before his &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;plans&lt;/a&gt; could come to fruition, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; had Balnazzar arrange Alexandros's death by manipulating and corrupting his son, &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, to led his father and &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; to Stratholme, where an army of undead waited for them. While Highlord Mograine managed to destroy all the undead, he dropped his blade in fatigue to the ground, and coming from behind, his son Renault picked up Ashbringer and ran it through Mograine's heart. The death of Alexandros shocked the paladins, creating divisions among them, while the corpse of the Highlord and the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; were later recovered by Kel'Thuzad. The &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; raised the legendary paladin into undeath and transformed him into an obedient servant as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, while the Ashbringer was no more than an unholy shadow of what it was once after having been used for such an atrocious purpose.\nThe possessed Saidan Dathrohan then reorganized what remained of the Silver Hand in Lordaeron into the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. These paladins strove fanatically to destroy evil, without any regards to the means used, and despised all non-human races. Other paladins, disgusted with the Scarlet Crusaders' immoral zealotry, suspicious of Saidan and his closest companions, and who believed that their comrades had fallen from their once-noble purpose, left to form the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, which took a less extreme approach by remaining faithful to the principles of the Light, and accepted members from all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s races into their ranks. At &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell Tyrosus and a few others were chosen for the secret task of unearthing the bodies of a thousand fallen heroes of the Light, bringing them to be interred once more in sacred ground, in order to protect the honored dead from being raised as nothing more than cogs in the Lich King's undead army.\nAfter his death against Arthas, Uther's body was retrieved and buried in a &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;great tomb&lt;/a&gt; built for him to the south of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt;, vigilantly guarded by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thel%27danis\"&gt;High Priest Thel'danis&lt;/a&gt;, the caretaker of the tomb.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the Third War, the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; served as the main spiritual hub for the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Light\"&gt;Church of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the paladins in the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valgar%20Highforge\"&gt;Valgar Highforge&lt;/a&gt; at their head. Upholders of the Holy Light and defenders of the Alliance, these paladins were present from the northern forests of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, fighting back the advance of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, to the southern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, ceaselessly upholding their vigil against &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;demonic forces&lt;/a&gt; from beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;ref name=\"The World of Warcraft Townhall/Classes#The Paladin\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"The%20World%20of%20Warcraft%20Townhall/Classes%23The%20Paladin\"&gt;The World of Warcraft Townhall/Classes#The Paladin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter their induction, some human paladins traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; in order to continue their training and to help keep the kingdom's peace. At the abbey, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20McBride\"&gt;Marshal McBride&lt;/a&gt; began marshaling paladins of the Order and other &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;recruits&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of the &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s that infested the woods and moved into &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Ridge%20Mine\"&gt;Echo Ridge Mine&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, some dwarf paladins came to aid in the &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;. They were later summoned by &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most influential paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, in order to continue their training and studies, but also to perform holy trials to show themselves worthy of serving the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. These new Knights of the Silver Hand were sent on missions to fight the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; during their training, but also against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nEveryone in the Silver Hand thought that &lt;a href=\"Merideth%20Carlson\"&gt;Merideth Carlson&lt;/a&gt; was mad for coming up with the idea of a &lt;a href=\"Manna-Enriched%20Horse%20Feed\"&gt;special horse feed&lt;/a&gt; destined to nourish spiritual horses. Relationships with the horse breeder were eventually mended, in order to allow the young paladins to be able to obtain their own &lt;a href=\"charger\"&gt;charger&lt;/a&gt;, a tedious task that involved months of obtaining materials all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, guided by Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker.\nThe Silver Hand paladins in Lordaeron remained scattered until &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; came out of exile. When his son &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt; was killed by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt; for trying to leave the Scarlet Crusade, Tirion avenged him and vowed over his son's body to reform the Order of the Silver Hand, once more be a force of good dedicated to extinguishing the evil, regardless of its politics or pleasantries, that plagued the world.\nThe Order is mentioned to be active during the initial assault on &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; mentioned them in a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Marjhan\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Marjhan&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, threatening the latter to inform Lord Fordring and his knights that they are no longer here on amicable terms, and that the Highlord would take great pleasure in seeing to their \"atonement\".\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn addition to the Scarlet Crusade, the Silver Hand found a rival in the newly-emerged &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt;, a group of errant paladins who had come to prominence in the restored elven lands north of Lordaeron. Some of these elves had been knights of the Silver Hand before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, a former pupil of &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; who held his former master indirectly responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and decided to defile &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, believing Uther's \"mishandling\" of the young prince's training was responsible for Arthas' betrayal, and that he failed to stop him. In order to prove their dominance over the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, Blood Knights were sent to defile the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand's founding place. The ghostly paladins &lt;a href=\"Aelmar%20the%20Vanquisher\"&gt;Aelmar the Vanquisher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cathela%20the%20Seeker\"&gt;Cathela the Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gregor%20the%20Justiciar\"&gt;Gregor the Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vicar%20Hieronymus\"&gt;Vicar Hieronymus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nemas%20the%20Arbiter\"&gt;Nemas the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; appeared to defend the chapel alongside &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; who was defeated.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;reopening of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Paladin\"&gt;Ironforge paladins&lt;/a&gt; joined the Azerothian defenses to repel the attacks of the demons led by a gigantic &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Commander\"&gt;Pit Commander&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the reopening, a battalion of knights of the Silver Hand led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irulon%20Trueblade\"&gt;Lord Irulon Trueblade&lt;/a&gt; launched an expedition into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to help secure the other side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, notably by helping the Alliance and Horde forces already there to fortify their positions. When one of their paladins accused of desertion, &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;, returned with the news that an army of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s was on its way to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Trueblade vouched for him and urged &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Duron\"&gt;Commander Duron&lt;/a&gt; to put the army on high alert.\nSoon after they shored up their defensive lines, the combined strength of the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, Silver Hand, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; troops stationed at the portal confronted &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, Ragnok was disintegrated by a radiant and sacred swing of Jorad's hammer. Without their leader and the nether dragons' support, the remains of the death knight's forces were driven off by the coalition, stopping them from getting a foothold in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; decimated a large Scourge army somewhere in Lordaeron. The red dragon noticed that some of the undead wore paladins' armor.\n\"The following section was retconned by the comics and no longer refers to the current lore.\"\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; instance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers sent a few years prior to the Third War by the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; could be present during &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Ashbringer%20event\"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; at the inn of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; with the other members of the Silver Hand: the two paladins &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt;, the priest &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;, and the mage &lt;a href=\"Doan\"&gt;Doan&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, they were able to witness the purification of what would later become the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the head of the paladins of the Silver Hand and the Argent Dawn, Highlord Tirion Fordring emerged at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; to defend it from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, unleashing his holy fury upon the armies of undead until the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt; were ultimately defeated. During his confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion reclaimed and purified the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, leading the Dark Lord of the Scourge to retreat and at the same time freeing the death knights from his grip. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion called for a union between the Argent Dawn and the remains of the Order of the Silver Hand in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Together they formed the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, which sailed to Northrend and fought to end the reign of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Reverent%20Paladin\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the Order were present in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Lazaril\"&gt;Bishop Lazaril&lt;/a&gt;'s altar and her &lt;a href=\"Reverent%20Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt;, as they were creating holy artifacts from the concentration of light of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, in order to protect the Alliance capitals and destroy the floating &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es of the Lich King.\nIn the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion Fordring managed to set foot at &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; under the disguise of a &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20of%20the%20Crusade\"&gt;Cleric of the Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, while an envoy of the Silver Hand named &lt;a href=\"Ares%20the%20Oathbound\"&gt;Ares the Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to transport the Ashbringer separately, in order to protect the Highlord should the Lich King's forces attempt to intercept him. During the transport, Ares was fatally wounded by an undead, and later directed an adventurer to retrieve the artifact in the &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Catacombs\"&gt;Utgarde Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. With his dying breath, he implored them to deliver it to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irulon%20Trueblade\"&gt;Lord Irulon Trueblade&lt;/a&gt;, who returned the weapon to Tirion. In honor of the knights who sacrificed themselves for their sacred duty, the Highlord revealed his identity and declared that the Order of the Silver Hand had arrived, and that they would advance until they defeated the Lich King. Later, Trueblade mentioned that the Silver Hand worked toward &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, and that Tirion remained their greatest hope with the Ashbringer to stand a chance against Arthas.\nAlong with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand were instrumental in Arthas's ultimate defeat, with Tirion himself using the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; to sunder &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; instance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers were sent by the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to protect Arthas from the deceptions and assassination attempts of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, which seek to change the course of time by preventing the purge from occurring. Thus, the adventurers witnessed the suspension of the Silver Hand and the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;purge of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm and aftermath.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"paladin%20trainers\"&gt;paladin trainers&lt;/a&gt; in the kingdoms of Stormwind and Ironforge were still greeting new members as part of an Order of the Silver Hand that did not merge with the Argent Crusade. Those paladins who remained loyal to the Alliance were sent in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent the deaths of allies at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, but also at the cursed &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; to obtain unique materials, so that &lt;a href=\"Therum%20Deepforge\"&gt;Therum Deepforge&lt;/a&gt; can create weapons at the height of their dedication.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;'s conquest, &lt;a href=\"Crusade%20Commander%20Korfax\"&gt;Crusade Commander Korfax&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; ordered adventurers to retrieve some priceless artifacts of the Order in the fortified city, among them the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20Uther\"&gt;Shroud of Uther&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%27s%20Sigil\"&gt;Gavinrad's Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, hidden in chests within the barracks as these artifacts of the founding members of the Silver Hand were too holy for the now-undead scarlet crusaders to touch. Once in his possession, Korfax announced that he intends to deliver them to &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, as they belong in the hands of the righteous.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the Knight of the Silver Hand &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;, who succumbed to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;, fell to the corruption of the Scourge and was raised as a death knight. Following his resurrection, Aurius took control of the city in his father's absence until &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to defeat him. The ghost of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt; also sent some adventurers in the burning city to retrieve valuable relics of the Silver Hand, among them lost volumes of the &lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Annals of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Galford\"&gt;Instructor Galford&lt;/a&gt;, considering them as fitting additions to the rededicated Light's Hope Chapel. Under the command of Eligor Dawnbringer, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt; was reconquered after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;, and following their victory, he mentioned that the former Bastion of the Silver Hand was now back in the hands of its rightful owners, with the countless treasures of the Order still inside.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war%23Invasion%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Invasion of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20Paladin\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; of the Silver Hand were present among the ranks of the forces, and during the &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;Alliance assault&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Iron%20Horde\"&gt;war against the Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; in , paladins of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Wrynn%27s%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Valant%20Brightsworn\"&gt;Valant Brightsworn&lt;/a&gt; was mobilized as the paladin leader at the &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Outpost\"&gt;Stormshield Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, where he managed the patrols on the island, while &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Knight\"&gt;Guardian knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Knight\"&gt;Holy knights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Retribution%20Knight\"&gt;Retribution knights&lt;/a&gt; of the Silver Hand were seen fighting against the Horde forces on the battlefield. Some of them could also be met as &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20followers\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nFollowing the failed Argent Crusade's assault on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, and the loss of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Maxwell Tyrosus came into contact with a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; in order to reunite those who still have the conviction to save their home, but also to find and secure the holy legendary artifacts that are &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Ashbringer (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, the only weapons that would allow them to fight back against the Legion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;demonic invasions&lt;/a&gt;, Marshal &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; led the defense of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and managed to repel the attacks. In &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Crusader\"&gt;crusaders&lt;/a&gt; came to help defend &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; after being rescued from &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s by adventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter successfully securing all of the artifacts, and bringing back Tirion's body to be buried with dignity amongst the ancient heroes of the Light, a ceremony took place within the hidden &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; to unite every paladin order on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The reformed Silver Hand grew and was made up of the paladins of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt;. Each of them pledged their order's loyalty to the paladin hero, now the new Highlord as Tirion Fordring's heir.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Order of the Silver Hand began to mobilize on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, with the support of Lord Shadowbreaker, who has volunteered to coordinate their forces on the ground, sending reconnaissance troops across the islands to watch over the legion's movements and bring back the survivors they found. Subsequently, the Silver Hand organized the recruitment and training of new troops with the help of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ansela\"&gt;Commander Ansela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Born\"&gt;Commander Born&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Kern\"&gt;Crusader Kern&lt;/a&gt;. The ongoing offensive on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; also drew the interest of many &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Recruit\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; who wished to join the ranks of the Silver Hand, some were judged by the Highlord itself, who eliminated the &lt;a href=\"Volzarak%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Legion infiltrator&lt;/a&gt; among them.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; was still under the control of the Scourge led by &lt;a href=\"Raemien%20the%20Soultaker\"&gt;Raemien the Soultaker&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand managed to regain control of &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operations in the &lt;a href=\"Elders%27%20Square\"&gt;Elders' Square&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, the Sanctum of Light was &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; who came to retrieve Tirion's body, in order to make him the last member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. They overpowered Maxwell Tyrosus, then made their way to the bottom of the catacombs where Lady Liadrin tried to stop them, but was defeated as well. Just as they were about to claim Tirion, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself intervened and burned the surrounded death knights, forcing them to flee and granting victory to the paladins.\nDuring one of their expedition, Maxwell Tyrosus and his scouts reported to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the Highlord that an extraordinarily luminescent object had emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, before it crashed towards the coast of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Their discovery was in fact the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the heart of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; bearing &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s message for Azeroth, and according to him, the key that must be brought to the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the Legion, or all the universe would be doomed. In another message for Arator, Turalyon informed his son that the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; has been sent to Azeroth to destroy all that he holds dear, and that he must gather the defenders of the Light to fight.\nWith the information sent by Turalyon, the war council of the Silver Hand sent their troops on different missions, notably to pursue Balnazzar by pinpointing his movements in eastern &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, to bolster their forces by increasing recruitment efforts and seeking for new allies, and to dealt with demons incursions across the Broken Isles. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Justicar%20Julia%20Celeste\"&gt;Justicar Julia Celeste&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand kept a close eye on Legion movements at &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt; in Azsuna, where their intel suggested that Balnazzar was possibly present. They managed to sabotage the advance of the Legion by killing the &lt;a href=\"Imp%20mother\"&gt;Imp mother&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Ozram\"&gt;Ozram&lt;/a&gt; and a large number of demons, and also found Balnazzar's &lt;a href=\"%3ACodex%20of%20Command\"&gt;:Codex of Command&lt;/a&gt;. As they were unable to access the information inside, &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; was contacted to help, and she deciphered it after the paladins brought her a &lt;a href=\"%3AFel%20Lexicon\"&gt;:Fel Lexicon&lt;/a&gt; and demon blood.\nThe contents of the Codex taught the paladins about a Legion invasion force at &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;, where they planned to open a portal directly to the demon world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside the Conclave, &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator the Redeemer&lt;/a&gt; led an assault with their troops. However, the paladins gave no further news after their departure. They were later rescued by the Highlord, who learned from Aponi's libram that their assault was a failure when Balnazzar appeared through his portal and defeated them, before imprisoning them on Niskara. They also learned from a &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Mysterious Stranger&lt;/a&gt; that Balnazzar and his armies were about to attack the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, headquarters of the Conclave hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Order of the Silver Hand agreed to support the Conclave, and accepted Delas' request to join them as the first night elf paladin, alongside her uncle &lt;a href=\"Nerus%20Moonfang\"&gt;Nerus Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; after the Highlord freed his family from &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder%20Zorak\"&gt;Oathbinder Zorak&lt;/a&gt;'s curse. Subsequently, the paladins were sent in recovery and supply missions across the Broken Isles, notably to collect &lt;a href=\"%3ABlood%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;:Blood of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, but also a rare metal called &lt;a href=\"%3ALumenstone\"&gt;:Lumenstone&lt;/a&gt; for the creation of weapons and armors. When the battle began in the Netherlight Temple, the Silver Hand fought against the demonic assailants, which led to the final death of Balnazzar with the help of &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing their victory, the Knights of the Silver Hand joined the other class orders in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, represented by &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting, to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. The paladins then helped to repel the legion's assault on Dalaran, and fought alongside their allies during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, with the Highlord and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Ridgers\"&gt;Captain Ridgers&lt;/a&gt; at their head at &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand troops were present on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of the Highlord, Lady Liadrin, Arator the Redeemer, and Vindicator Boros, and were sent to fight the Legion and protect the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; impaled Azeroth with his &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, gravely injuring its &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, a paladin champion among other champions of Azeroth drained the sword of its corruption with a sacred artifact of the Silver Hand, serving as a vessel for its vast power.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins of the Alliance bore the banner of the Silver Hand and planted &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Banner\"&gt;Blessed Banner&lt;/a&gt;s on the battlefield. They only employed Alliance races and fought once more on the side of the Alliance against the Horde, notably &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the Silver Hand has splintered once again at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, they fought alongside several elite members of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, while Turalyon scoffed at the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; armies being led by a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, questioning what has happened on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to allow this. He then claimed he would take pleasure in enacting justice from a \"misguided paladin of the Horde\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins &lt;a href=\"Kyara%20Bladeturner\"&gt;Kyara Bladeturner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Dreya\"&gt;Matron Dreya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nella%20Slagheart\"&gt;Nella Slagheart&lt;/a&gt; fought against Horde soldiers during the .\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the Champion &lt;a href=\"Frida%20Ironbellows\"&gt;Frida Ironbellows&lt;/a&gt; fought the Horde as the vanguard for the Alliance's assault, she was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Anointed%20Disciple\"&gt;Anointed Disciple&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Darkforged%20Crusader\"&gt;Darkforged Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, paladins of the Silver Hand were present among the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; troops sent in missions on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the armistice, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Knights of the Silver Hand were still present in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, where its halls have been cleared to store many artifacts mostly recovered from &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. These artifacts were far too dangerous to be stored elsewhere, and above all far too tempting for anyone to resist, which requires sacred protections. After &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Mykos\"&gt;Lorekeeper Mykos&lt;/a&gt; removed the mark from the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Dire%20Maul%29\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt; on \"&lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Light%20and%20How%20to%20Swing%20It\"&gt;:The Light and How to Swing It&lt;/a&gt;\", a book written by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, he donated it to the Sanctum's archives.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sent an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, but lost all contact with, they sent a bigger and stronger expeditionary force. Aboard the ship, young human and dwarf paladins were among a crew of novice &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s charged to &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach%20storyline\"&gt;find out what happened&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand made its appearance in the paladin section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt;, represented by &lt;a href=\"Gilda%20Silvershield\"&gt;Gilda Silvershield&lt;/a&gt; and one of the foremost paladins in the realm, the paladin trainer &lt;a href=\"Ezul%27aan\"&gt;Ezul'aan&lt;/a&gt;, who asked to meet young paladins who impressed him with their rapid progress. He later sent them to fight the enemies of the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to obtain materials for the creation of weapons at the height of their dedication, as Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker did in the past.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s memories, the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s witnessed the creation of the Order of the Silver Hand in &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, where the first paladins and the Archbishop were present to induct Uther into their ranks. In Uther's corrupted memories of the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Betrayer\"&gt;Silver Hand Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;s were present among the followers of Arthas and torched the city when the prince began his purge. In Uther's final memory, paladins of the order were seen fighting the undead in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, while some of them were healed by priests of the Church.\nIn his &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20the%20Shadowlands%20and%20Beyond\"&gt;grimoire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the paladins of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, like the now &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, were an example of mortals who dedicated themselves to service and duty in life and whose &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s were consequently sent to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; after death.\nDragonflight.\nFollowing the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a few paladins joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in their exploration of the ancestral homeland of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter they collected one of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s memories in his &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; followed &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;. Honored to help the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in the restoration of the legendary &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;, the old paladin decided to alert the Knights of the Silver Hand, considering that they may know something, and as followers of Tyr, that they deserved to hear what he witnessed and would certainly help their cause.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Battlefield\"&gt;Time-Lost Battlefield&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, an infinite battle between the forces Alliance and the Horde which have bled into the &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeways&lt;/a&gt;, paladins of the Silver Hand could be seen fighting on the battlefield under the leadership of an alternate version of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. They were later confronted by adventurers sent to end this time anomaly.\nA representative of the Silver Hand was later sent at &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;, and was consulted by Travard and Watcher Koranos to found worty recruits to reforge the Tyr's Guard. However, while the Silver Hand envoy gave them the names of a few of their paladins, none of them were what they were looking for.\nCulture.\nThe Order of the Silver Hand was founded on the moral foundation of five core traits, inspired by five holy tomes that were some of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;church's&lt;/a&gt; most ancient relics. Each libram represented what Archbishop Alonsus Faol saw as a core trait of the Order: retribution, holiness, protection, justice, and compassion.\nAs the martial branch of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins of the Silver Hand are followers of the philosophy of the Holy Light, which boils down to the three teachings called the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light%23The%20Three%20Virtues\"&gt;Three Virtues&lt;/a&gt;. They apply them at all times in order to make the world a place everyone can appreciate; a world of honor and justice, and embody the qualities of loyalty, bravery and honor. Compassion, patience, bravery mean as much to a paladin as strength in battle, and sacrifice is a key component in what it takes to uphold their duties.\nThe paladins seem to have a thousand different rites for every minor occasion, and are also known to be very sanctimonious. For them; any service, however humble, that helped another was of the Light. Nevertheless, they are known for their experience in meting out justice, which can sometimes turn into an &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;inquisition&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe paladins had a more ritualistic way of looking at battle, and focused more on the attitude one brought into the fight than the actual mechanics of swordplay. In battle, they charge their enemies onto their steeds, using mainly swords and warhammers, but also maces, axes, and their shields. During a fight to the death, the Holy code of the Order asks the paladin that they give a reprieve to their enemy if they collapse, as butchering a fallen foe in the midst of single combat is unquestionably dishonorable. They also cannot slay any foe who cannot defend himself, notably someone asleep or unconscious, as the stain would be too great for their oaths. According to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, they have an aura about them, a sense of calm and wisdom and even majesty, as if they were above the problems of this world. For the mage, it was a magic he did not understand but one he respected a great deal, and in many ways it was the opposite of his own &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, which sought to control the elements and other forces.\nNot all paladins of the Silver Hand come from noble families, like &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; who came from a family that owned and worked a pumpkin farm in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. When a paladin enters the ranks of the Order they can change their name, like &lt;a href=\"Davil%20Lightfire\"&gt;Davil Lightfire&lt;/a&gt;, originally Davil Crokford. As paladins, they consider themselves to be \u201cBrothers\u201d and \u201cSisters\u201d. Along with their shoulders and warhammer, they received their own &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt; during their ceremony of induction, but also their paladin symbol. They are holy &lt;a href=\"Relic\"&gt;relics&lt;/a&gt; filled with sacred texts, and which paladins use to channel their &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;powers&lt;/a&gt;, or to write down important information. When they obtain their steed, they name them following the tradition of the paladins and priests, inherited from the informal tradition of the knights and nobles of Lordaeron, by a quality they admire.\nBefore a dangerous mission, the Knights of the Silver Hand take no risks, the chief paladin of the group gives their seal of command to their second in case something happens to them. If the leader dies, their second in possession of the seal of command rises to the rank of their predecessor and takes charge of the troops. After being killed on a mission or on the battlefield, the armor of a fallen paladin is retrieved by its comrades and later brought back in honor to the family by the master(s) of the deceased. When buried, paladins can be placed in conventional &lt;a href=\"Cemetery\"&gt;cemeteries&lt;/a&gt;, or in the resting places of the honored dead such as the catacombs of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the cemetery of &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and the crypts of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn times of peace, some of them exchange their weapons and armor for simple robes, applying the teachings of Faol on the dichotomy of paladins to serve humbly in devastated communities after wars; as they are both warriors and healers. They also support the society through charitable works, are sent on missions to protect the Alliance and their allies, and allowed the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s to rest, either by purging or by using a holy censer to exorcise them.\nThe paladins of the Silver Hand do not mistreat their prisoners, and do not deny them any basic rights, including food, drink, and the right to defend themselves by giving their side of the story. During interrogation, they disapprove the practice of torture or brutality, instead asking the accused to confess, or by seeking to negotiate with them. In case of total refusal to comply, they use the Light to make them answer their questions, forcing them to tell the truth although it is very painful.\nIn case of treason, desertion, or any acts contrary to the rules of the Order, paladins can be &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt;. After having stand &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, their light-given powers are stripped, and they are then banned from the paladinship and exiled. Though it had only been used a few times, every paladin lived in mortal fear of it. Sometimes used by some of the more fringe elements of the priesthood and the paladinhood, the scourges are instruments of self-flagellation meant to cleanse impurities.\nFormation.\nThe training to become a paladin of the Order can take several months for &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, and up to several years for younger and inexperienced apprentices, although training can be accelerated for &lt;a href=\"squire\"&gt;squire&lt;/a&gt;s if necessary. Becoming an apprentice requires attending to an establishment of the Church or the Silver Hand, and proving itself worthy of receiving the teachings of the Light. Whether young or adult, those who succeed are admitted and begin their training, the unworthy are dismissed but may retry later.\nIn the past, they were mainly trained at the Cathedral of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the former main spiritual hub of the Church before the Third War, or at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, a center for learning and enlightenment known as a proud bastion of Lordaeron's priesthood, which served as a seminary and major training ground for paladins in training. Nowadays, they are mainly trained by their seniors in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, or in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%23Inhabitants\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, they are trained in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Hall of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; that serves as a center of arcane and divine practice and study.\nDespite the Church's wishes to bolster its ranks, it understands the sacrifices needed to ensure the paladins serving it are worthy, thus requiring long training and several tests that could take their lives. Apprentices are trained to use a variety of weapons, they learn combat tactics and many techniques, as well as how to ride and fight on their steed. Their training sessions are long and difficult, lasting up to several hours a day until exhaustion, and this for days and nights. Training at arms is important for a paladin, so are prayer and meditation, as they must be able to cut down their enemies but must also be able to heal their allies and themselves. In &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;places of worship&lt;/a&gt;, they are instructed to pray, to meditate for hours, and often discuss the nature of paladins and the rigorous disciplines they must observe. They study many sacred texts, learn to take care of church duties and religious services, are instructed on the ways of the Order and its code of honor, but also on the protocols of politics and knighthood. They also learn to abnegate themselves through meditation, in order to become conduits for the Light and use its powers.\nAfter being deemed worthy, becoming a paladin and officially joining the organization requires passing a ceremony of induction headed by a high member of the Church of the Light, in presence of &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and fellow &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, where they take their oath of allegiance on a banner of the Silver Hand:\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; became a paladin, she was instructed to \"speak the vows\". She vowed to follow the guiding principles - to act honorably, to uphold what is righteous, to fight against injustice, and to celebrate with her new brothers and sisters of the Silver Hand:\nFollowing the ceremony, these new paladins receive their &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"%3ABadge%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;:Badge of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to formalize their status. Thereafter, they continue to be trained by their master, in order to learn how to use their new holy powers. Once their training is complete, and to improve their new abilities, young paladins are given various missions and trials. One of the most influential paladins of the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt;, is notably responsible for placing the new members on the path to greater virtue, as they devote themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and defend &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from any threats. They must succeed to prove themselves worthy to learn the use of the &lt;a href=\"Sense%20Undead\"&gt;perception of the undead&lt;/a&gt;, but above all, to access to one of the paladin's greatest honors, the &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;power of resurrection&lt;/a&gt;.\nYoung paladins get a &lt;a href=\"warhorse\"&gt;warhorse&lt;/a&gt; as their first mount. After proving themselves, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; helped them to obtain their own &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Charger\"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt;. Those holy steeds are devoted to the cause of their owner, and are the spirits of former &lt;a href=\"deathcharger\"&gt;deathcharger&lt;/a&gt;s recovered from &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s and redeemed by a sacred ritual. Once a tedious task that involved months of obtaining materials all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand has now most of those materials at hand since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nAs the martial branch of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Order of the Silver Hand seeks to be an example of the Light's teachings as well as enforce its laws, and therefore, has its own hierarchical structure to organize its activities, in order to protect the weak and vanquish the evil of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; is the secret hall located beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; that serves as a catacomb. It houses the remains of a thousand heroes of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and is the headquarters of the organization from where they operated since the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\nOnce under the command of the Supreme Commander and the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; of the Church, the Silver Hand is led by an &lt;a href=\"Highlord\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. When they are chosen by their predecessor, the new Highlord must record their name in the &lt;a href=\"Libram%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Libram of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt; during a ceremony attended by all members of the Silver Hand. They act as the highest authority of the organization, are recognized as a heroic figure among the paladins, embodying the faith and justice of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and the one to whom all paladins swear fidelity.\nThe leaders of the Silver Hand, or the \"war council\", are the high-ranking members entrusted with a position of authority in the organization. They advise and assist the Highlord, take care of organizing and directing the missions of their paladins, make decisions to determine future objectives and actions of the Order, and represent it when the Highlord is not present. Since the reformation of the Silver Hand, the actual leaders are:\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, many leaders of the Silver Hand were killed by Arthas and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Others such as &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Lord Commander Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; left the ranks of the Silver Hand and fought under the banner of the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Champions of the Silver Hand are chosen by the Highlord to lead the paladin troops against the enemies of the Silver Hand, and also to perform the function of bodyguard for the Highlord. Since the reformation of the Silver Hand, the actual champions are: &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nerus%20Moonfang\"&gt;Nerus Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maximillian%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Maximillian of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;. Before the Third War, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was the revered champion of the Silver Hand.\nMembership.\nOnce only made up of humans, the Silver Hand began recruiting &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. After their integration into the Alliance, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; were also recruited. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nerus%20Moonfang\"&gt;Nerus Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, are unique cases recruited by the Highlord to serve as champions.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the recruitment of new troops is organized by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ansela\"&gt;Commander Ansela&lt;/a&gt;, a grizzled war veteran and seasoned teacher, and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Born\"&gt;Commander Born&lt;/a&gt;, a hard teacher who has trained some of the greatest paladin knights in the recent times. With some officers, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of coordinating the forces of the Silver Hand, thus they organize the missions, assaults, and investigations for the paladins, but also the meetings between leaders of the organization, the contact and recruitment of potential allies, the establishment of defenses to counter enemy attacks, all of this with the consideration of dozens of logistics, among them communications, resources, weapons, armors, the creation of supply lines for foods and medicines, and many others.\nThe Order of the Silver Hand has a large number of paladins in its ranks. Under the orders of a military hierarchy, including captains, commanders, generals, and &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers%23Champions\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, they dedicate their lives to the protection of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them were once &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to their specialty, some paladins may become &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Protector\"&gt;Protector&lt;/a&gt;s who defend their allies in battle, while others may become &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Mender\"&gt;Mender&lt;/a&gt;s acting as &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s. The mission of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Highguard\"&gt;Highguards&lt;/a&gt; is to protect the Sanctum of Light and the Highlord when they are on a mission. The &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s are sent to perform reconnaissance on the field and obtain information for their superiors. The Order has its own &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Smith\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt;, who recently learned to produce weapons and armor made of &lt;a href=\"Lumenstone\"&gt;Lumenstone&lt;/a&gt;. It is the task of the &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;s, with &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Elda\"&gt;Sister Elda&lt;/a&gt; as their Head Archivist, to preserve, study and archive in their libraries all the knowledge the Silver Hand accumulated over time.\nIn times of great need, the Order of the Silver Hand can rally its mightiest forces into one pure destructive form, the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20170310190550if_/http%3A//fr.wowhead.com/spell%3D221587\"&gt;Vanguard of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Through a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Orders\"&gt;Libram&lt;/a&gt; in which the paladins had channeled their power, the Highlord can unleash that power to send his army for an important mission or battle. In the Sanctum of Light, &lt;a href=\"Terric%20the%20Illuminator\"&gt;Terric the Illuminator&lt;/a&gt; is the one who takes care of rallying the troops to form the Vanguard of the Silver Hand.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand counted among its ranks some &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;, but also possibly &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s, the only one known being &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Doan\"&gt;Arcanist Doan&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations.\nHaving led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to victory against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the holy knights of the Silver Hand are recognized as valiant and mighty champions of Humanity. By their nature of warriors of the Light affiliated with the Church, they were the only military unit trusted by all the monarchs of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and served as protectors during meetings of great importance in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;Lordaeron's palace&lt;/a&gt;, while they would not have been a part of the defense under normal conditions. In the modern &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins of the Silver Hand are an elite known for their abilities as fighters, healers, and for leading their comrades in battle.\nThey are close allies of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, as their remaining members in Lordaeron cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, until the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; where they merged together to form the Argent Crusade under the command of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, they oppose the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and consider them as an aberration of the Silver Hand, since their extreme and corrupt fanaticism led to the death of many innocent people.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; respect, if not like the Knights of the Silver Hand, as they know the prowess of the holy order in battle. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Dragonreaver&lt;/a&gt; and his wing of &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s even agreed to let &lt;a href=\"Duncan%20Senturus\"&gt;Lord Duncan Senturus&lt;/a&gt; ride with them on their gryphons for a battle against &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; dragonriders.\nJust like the Church considered the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s for centuries, some paladins showed hostility for &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and all the others &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s, seeing them as damned souls, but also as an occasional and necessary evil, which they would do without at any other time. Even &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; had never been very comfortable with magi, sharing the common perception that their &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; was unholy and possibly even demonic, but he learned to accept it.\nDespite being allies against the Legion, the Silver Hand and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; maintain a strained and aggressive relationship. They are factionally opposed, with a different philosophy on their relationship with the Light. Once, the Blood Knights considered themselves to be better than the other paladins, and the true masters of the Light, going so far as to attempt to assert their dominance with their assault on &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. This duality resurfaced noticeably during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Silver Hand have a hostile relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their alliance to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knights\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; led an &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on the Sanctum of Light to retrieve Tirion's body and make him the last member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. Although they managed to make their way through the paladins, their attempt was interrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself, leaving the Ebon Blade in hostility with the Silver Hand, but also with the Argent Crusade.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe Silver Hand was a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; faction led by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;. Among their ranks it counted the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; units &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;, and regular units like &lt;a href=\"Footman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rifleman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;riflemen&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=\"Militia%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;militias&lt;/a&gt;. They appeared as an allied faction in &lt;a href=\"The%20Defense%20of%20Strahnbrad%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;The Defense of Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20and%20Roll%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;Blackrock and Roll&lt;/a&gt;, and as an enemy faction in &lt;a href=\"Digging%20up%20the%20Dead%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;Digging up the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAlthough the study of the Holy Light lends itself to scholars and priests, they are not the only faithful followers. The Knights of the Silver Hand is an organization of paladins who have also studied and devoted themselves to the three virtues. It is the holy order that gives the paladins their sense of righteousness and allows a sense of community to strengthen their resolve. Although it is a proud organization, the paladins must give up a great deal to join, including their independence. Uther Lightbringer founded the Order before the Alliance launched the Second War. The paladins were instrumental in winning the war and actually helped the Holy Light catch on with the citizenry of Azeroth when people saw the mighty paladins do battle with their holy power.\nIn recent years, the Knights of the Silver Hand entered a dark period when one of their own, Prince Arthas, turned his back on the Order in his dark pursuit of vengeance. He fully embraced the evil he thought he was hunting and became a death knight in service to the Scourge. This event dealt a great blow to the paladins of the Order, as they had to watch one of their best turn into a mighty enemy. Many paladins feel responsibility for him because the Holy Light teaches that every person can strengthen other people. Since they were unable to strengthen Arthas, the entire world suffered.\nMany Knights of the Silver Hand remained on Lordaeron for several reasons ranging from missing the fleeing boats, to a sense of duty to clear their homeland of the undead. With the destruction of Lordaeron in front of them and the knowledge that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; had betrayed them, some knights actually went mad. Following the invasion of the Scourge, many of the Order's paladins joined a zealous group of followers of the Light known as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. However, many of these paladins have become fanatical towards their ambition of destroying the Scourge, to the point that those not wearing their colors are deemed corrupted. They hunt the undead in Lordaeron with a zeal that frightens. Many innocent mortals have been killed through misunderstandings, or simply \"just making sure\". These &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s have a frightening policy: When in doubt, assume the person is undead and kill him. These knights would never admit that they walk the same dark road that led to Arthas\u2019s damnation, but few of them continue to follow the &lt;a href=\"three%20virtues\"&gt;three virtues&lt;/a&gt;. Those who question their leaders are assumed to be undead sympathizers and are slain. Many serve the Scarlet Crusade out of fear, as to speak up means instant death.\nAfter leaving the Crusade, some paladins decided to join the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Some paladins of the Silver Hand, brought to their knees by their failure to do anything to stop the plague and save Lordaeron from the Lich King's depredations, have also turned from the light and joined &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Others fled south, to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The paladin order, still referring to themselves as the Order of the Silver Hand, now thrives under new leadership at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the followers of the Holy Light spread their philosophy to the dwarves of Ironforge, who soon adopted the tenets of the Order as well. Though decimated, the Knights of the Silver Hand eventually bounced back.\nBrann also fought with a good number of Uther's knights in the Second War. He says that they were good folk, if a bit too righteous for their own good, but he finds some habits of the knighthood stubborn.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", the following cards represent the members of the Silver Hand:"}

{"id": "48928", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=48928", "title": "Knock back", "text": "Knock back (also known as punting) is an effect that lifts an enemy off the ground and knocks them back a certain distance, without dismounting mounted players.\nPlayer abilities with knock back effects were implemented in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, they had been much sought after by players, traditionally only being given to bosses, &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTips.\nKnockback abilities can have great strategic value. By knocking back melee attackers, incoming damage can be interrupted. Ranged specs can benefit from keeping enemies as far away as possible, while melee specs may find this to be less desirable. Knockback can also be used to keep enemies away from allies, or to prevent them from reaching a target, such as flag capture points in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. \nIn PvP, knockback can be used to punt other players off high edges. Top locations for this include the &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill%20%28Arathi%20Basin%29\"&gt;Lumber Mill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, and the central island in &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Skilful use of knockback abilities in these locations can single-handedly kill several enemy players, or at least punt them far enough away for the base to be captured. All players should take great care in these locations not to put themselves in a position where they can be knocked off.\nKnockback effects can also be used to interrupt casting. The cast will be interrupted while the target is in motion, and must then be started afresh once the target is stationary, providing substantial disruption. This can be particularly effective against healers, or in countering any long or particularly dangerous cast. Certain PvE targets, when interrupted by a knockback mid-cast, may fail to resume casting the ability, situationally making knockbacks as useful as &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;s. In battlegrounds, knockback can be used to interrupt node captures or flag collections.\nAbilities.\nThe following is a \"partial\" list of player abilities with knockback effects:"}

DeCandido&lt;/a&gt; taking place in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;, one year before the beginning of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDescription.\nThe Burning Legion has been defeated, and eastern regions of Kalimdor are now shared by two nations: the orcs of Durotar, led by their noble Warchief, Thrall; and the humans of Theramore, led by one of the most powerful mages alive -- Lady Jaina Proudmoore.\nBut the tentative peace between orcs and humans is suddenly crumbling. Random attacks against Durotar's holdings suggest that the humans have renewed their aggression toward the orcs. Now Jaina and Thrall must avert disaster before old hatreds are rekindled -- and Kalimdor is plunged into another devastating war.\nJaina's search to uncover the truth behind the attacks leads her to a shocking revelation. Her encounter with a legendary, long-lost wizard will challenge everything that she believes and illuminate the secret history of the world of Warcraft.\nExplanation.\n\"At the end of and , &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were allies on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. But in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, the two sides are enemies again. My task with the novel Cycle of Hatred, was to help explain that change. It takes place during the four-year gap between the two games, and involves the humans on Kalimdor led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the orcs on the same continent led by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the characters in the Warcraft universe, I found Jaina and Thrall to be two of the three most compelling characters. Jaina is a powerful female wizard, who is put in a position of leading a small group of humans in a hostile land in the wake of a brutal war against a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; horde. Thrall is an orc raised by humans as a slave, who leads a rebellion of orcs against human bondage, and inspires the orcs to return to their old ways before they were cursed by demons. Both leaders are trying to forge a new future, moving past the old hatreds. Unfortunately, the old hatreds don't die easily. If you're wondering who the third character is, you'll have to read the book to find out -- the character is also in the book, but who it is is a surprise.\" *big grin*\nPlot.\n&lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; remained at relative peace for three years, though the two former archenemies were still wary of each other. Eventually, a series of minor shipping incidents led to extreme tension between the two powers, enough that the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, who controlled the region's only neutral port, complained.\nDespite the tension, Thrall requested Jaina's aid in relocating a herd of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Lizards\"&gt;Thunder Lizards&lt;/a&gt; displaced by a mysterious logging operation at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina intended to relocate the Lizards to a largely unpopulated region on the far side of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, but was astonished to discover that the area was magically warded to protect its single inhabitant: &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe former &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; brushed off Jaina's admiration, but filled in the gaps of what had been happening amidst the tensions between Theramore and Durotar: a minor demon, &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; had revived the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and was playing the two powers against each other.\nJaina and Aegwynn hastily returned to Theramore, where they discovered that Jaina's own chamberlain had been corrupted by the Burning Blade, and one of Thrall's advisors was too. After dealing with the turncoat, Jaina, Lorena and Aegwynn took on Zmodlor himself. Unfortunately, the demon was backed by a small cabal of Warlocks (either &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, the text is unclear). After they dealt with the traitors in Jaina's ranks, and Thrall's in his, both leaders proposed a more official treaty."}

He is referred to as an elemental lord, which could make him near &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in power, as well as sharing a title (\"Firelord\") with him. He is also called \"The Dirge of Karabor\".\nHistory.\nCyrukh was brought into being four years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. For years, the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies used by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had dampened the power of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and thrown them into turmoil. Yet as the magic of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s began killing Draenor, the elementals rallied together, vowing to destroy the orcs and stop their desecration of the land. They pooled their dwindling strength and fused into a single mighty being: Cyrukh.\nThe orcs were gathering near a volcano outside &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; when, without warning, the mountain erupted into fire. Cyrukh took form in the heart of the volcano and unleashed his elemental wrath on the orcs. A roaring firestorm swept down the mountain and tore through the Horde's ranks. Cyrukh's appearance stunned and terrified the orcs, especially former &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; who saw his attack as a sign that they had angered the elements by embracing fel magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; scrambled to forestall catastrophe, for if the warlocks abandoned the Horde then they would never stand a chance against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. In Cyrukh, Gul'dan saw an opportunity: the elements gathering themselves all in one place had made them vulnerable. Gul'dan planned to steal Cyrukh's power for himself and for the rest of the Horde, and destroy the connection between orcs and elementals once and for all. Gul'dan and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; gathered on the slopes of the volcano and channeled a powerful spell: &lt;a href=\"The%20Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;The Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt;. None of them, not even those who had once been shaman, hesitated to perform the task. Together, they flooded Cyrukh with fel power and shattered his physical form. The mountain roared in protest, chasms tore through the earth and spewed forth rivers of fel and elemental energies. Gul'dan and his warlocks used those energies to infuse the other orcs with strength.\nThe Horde was now more powerful than ever before, and the last connection between the orcs and the elemental spirits had been severed. The fel volcano would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nHis model is a recolored &lt;a href=\"molten%20giant\"&gt;molten giant&lt;/a&gt; one called a \"fel giant\"."}

He is the Harbormaster of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, but used to be one of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted knights. He is also the guardian of House Proudmoore's ward, &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt;, a job given to him by Daelin himself.\nBiography.\nBackground.\nDuring a battle in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; struck the transport ship that Cyrus and a friend of his were on, wounding his friend from splinters flying across the deck. It was serious enough that he could have been sent home, but not wishing to leave the war before it was over, Cyrus's friend patched himself up and told the healers he was fine. Days later he died painfully in his bunk from infection; only then did he ask for help, but he was far too gone for any healer to save him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a young girl named &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Kul Tiras by her father, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus was hand-picked by Daelin to raise her and forced him to take a desk job. It was the only reason he wasn't at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; with Daelin during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Though he did as ordered, at the time Cyrus was hurt by this, believing that Daelin didn't have faith in him to have him as part of the guard. Over the years, however, he came to realize it was exactly the opposite - Daelin wanted Taelia to grow up strong of arm and noble of heart - and had faith that Sir Crestfall could make that happen.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nYears later, after Daelin's death at Theramore and after Kul Tiras left the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, an Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; was arrested when they arrived in Kul Tiras with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrus hired &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; to intentionally get arrested so he could break the emissary out of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Boralus shortly after, they were confronted by the harbor guards on the order of &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. However Cyrus reminded the guards that they served Kul Tiras and the Proudmoores, not &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, and that they answered to him. He gave Greymane his office to use as a war room, fearing that, like his friend in the Second War, &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s advisers have kept her blind to the infections that have spread through the kingdom that he loves.\nWith Cyrus' support, the Alliance brought Kul Tiras back into the fold and together they fended off their common enemies during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance eventually joined forces with &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; rebels and they marched together to face &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her loyalists outside the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent any further bloodshed, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Saurfang died in the duel but tricked Sylvanas into revealing her despicable character, which swayed a majority of her followers to abandon her, thus ending the Fourth War. When Cyrus heard the news of Saurfang's death, he revealed to the Alliance emissary that he once almost died fighting against Saurfang during the Second War and the orc killed many of his soldiers. Cyrus dreamed of getting his revenge on Saurfang even in his old age, but he begrudgingly respected Saurfang for the good he did later in life and thinks he may have atoned for his transgressions in his own way.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI once fought against Saurfang. In the Second War. He killed a lot of good soldiers. Nearly killed me.\nI've hated him for years. Always dreamt of giving him some payback, even in my old age.\nBut... he had done his share of good since then. And he saved many Alliance lives in the end.\nI never did give him that payback. But maybe he repaid that debt on his own.\nMaybe."}

K'ara's final act was to convince the draenei to eject it from the vessel, but this was easier said than done. The Void energy instinctively caused K'ara to go to war against the other naaru aboard the vessel, D'ore and &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;. Their violent clash of Light and Void threatened to kill any draenei who interfered, yet &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; stepped forward nonetheless. He used the Light to shield the other naaru and cast K'ara out of the vessel. But the battle sapped his strength, physically and mentally, and his visions of the future became unreliable. K'ara was ejected from the \"Genedar\" in the chaos of the crash, and came to be known as the Dark Star to the orcs of . \nMeanwhile D'ore and K'ure were too weakened to land the \"Genedar\", and the vessel soon plummeted to the ground, killing D'ore and many of the draenei on board. D'ore's remains were gathered by &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari\"&gt;Sha'tari&lt;/a&gt;, who then brought them to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;; there, they hoped to study them in order to hopefully learn enough to communicate with the other naaru and draenei beyond Draenor.\nIn time, D'ore's body would became a shadowy void that attracted and consumed souls. It will regenerate its power from the Light over time, a process that has now lasted for hundreds of years and that is said by D'ore itself to be almost complete.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, D'ore appeared in order to redeem Maladaar's spirit. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, D'ore had been regenerating into a being of Light once more. The champions of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; visited D'ore in Auchindoun to collect his &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;pure Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAshbringer Crystal.\nThere is speculation that the crystal that would be crafted into the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; may have come from a fragment of D'ore's body."}

They are operated by &lt;a href=\"mortar%20team\"&gt;mortar team&lt;/a&gt;s. They were used extensively as siege weapons by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Ammo is called mortar shells.\nIn the RPG.\nMortars launch a grenadelike weapon such as an explosive shell in a high arc to land near or on a target.\nBackground.\nMortars are used by the dwarven armies of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; as a mobile form of artillery, when cannons simply cannot be rolled in. Dwarven &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20team\"&gt;Mortar team&lt;/a&gt;s consist of a carrier/gunner and a spotter/loader. They are well known for their battlecry, \"MORTAR COMBAT!\" (a reference to the video game Mortal Kombat), and their advice to targets within earshot: \"Hey, you! Catch!\" \nFrom the time the dwarves first learned to use mortars to the present day, there have been only 3 reported cases of the enemy being stupid enough to actually try catching the shell, with a successful catch being made only once. The name of the individual who performed this impressive feat has been lost, along with most of his anatomy and all insect and plant life in a 15-foot radius of the place where he was standing.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nIt is an &lt;a href=\"explosive\"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt; weapon only &lt;a href=\"Engineer\"&gt;Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s can &lt;a href=\"use\"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"craft\"&gt;craft&lt;/a&gt; that produces a Ground Targeted &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt;. When mortars are &lt;a href=\"use\"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt;d, a green targetting symbol appears on the ground that can be moved around. The targetting symbol becomes a red 'no' symbol when moved out of range. After acquiring a valid target, click to fire the mortar.

As long-range siege units, they are effective against anything with Fortified armor. Mortar Teams may learn Fragmentation Shards when the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Castle&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked, which allows them to deal extra damage towards Medium-armored units.\nThey are the only artillery unit to not be considered mechanical, meaning that Mortar Teams can be affected by spells which can increase or decrease their offense depending on what spell is used on them. A popular tactic is to have several &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sorcereresses&lt;/a&gt; cast Invisibility on your Hero and Mortar Teams and sneak them into an enemy base to destroy their Town Hall, as most players generally do not fortify their main base or put detector units in them. When the enemy attempts to return to the base to defend it, teleport out to preserve the Mortar Teams.\nSpells and abilities.\nFlare.\nYou can cast an unlimited amount of Flares but there is a 120 sec. cooldown before you can cast another Flare. \nFragmentation Shards (Passive).\nThe damage dealt by Fragmentation Shards is affected by both &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20armor%20and%20attack%20types%23The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Armor type&lt;/a&gt; and value.\nSo the damage values listed above will actually be half as much against Medium armor,\nand 50% more against Unarmored."}

All of these professions are noble and have their places, but in these troubled post-war days, one craft has risen above the others in sheer profit margins: the mortician. Morticians do not go hungry. \n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; populations always need replenishing with fresh troops, and graveyard raiding is a common job for undead minions. City and town guards devote precious time to protecting these plots, and some have even petitioned to bring the cemeteries inside the cities, which would take up valuable space and spread disease. Some morticians have seized this opportunity by hiring guards themselves and charging top dollar for \"guaranteed safe resting places\" for citizens' loved ones. Mausoleums gain popularity, as undead can easily dig through dirt but have more trouble with marble walls. Sadly, this option is also quite expensive and not available to the poor. An underground movement also has risen in popularity, although it defies most &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; sensibilities: cremation. The &lt;a href=\"shamanistic\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; religions of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have no problem giving the body to fire at death; and while cremation is not against the teaching of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance citizens do not want to practice what they see as a barbarian ritual. Yet cremation does allow the body to deteriorate without becoming fouled with &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, and this option appeals to many.\nThere was a mortuary school in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;."}

Even so, humanity continued to harry the forest trolls. The Mossflayer tribe had been driven out of much of its ancestral territory in Lordaeron by the time the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; broke out. Like all other forest trolls, the Mossflayers allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the Second War under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, a famous troll hero from the Amani tribe. When the Horde was soundly defeated, Zul'jin disappeared, and the forest trolls abandoned their &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish allies. Disgusted with the Horde's defeat, the Mossflayer trolls decided they would have nothing further to do with such incompetent and reckless allies.\nInstead, the trolls focused on trying to keep humanity from overrunning all of Lordaeron. When the plague of undeath began spreading across the land, the Mossflayer tribe was quick to take advantage of the blossoming chaos. Because the plague was designed to convert only the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; race into undeath, human defenses soon faltered, and the Mossflayers managed to retake parts of their ancient territory. The plague took its toll on the landscape, the plants and animals, while not undead, remained diseased and decaying. Despite this, the Mossflayer tribe clung to their settlement, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Mashar\"&gt;Zul'Mashar&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast corner of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. \nA large hunting party of Mossflayer trolls left their settlement some time ago in search of live game to take back to their people. The hunt took them far from home, for many animals had been affected by the plague. At last the trolls came upon several animals that seemed healthy. Slaying the beasts, the trolls rewarded themselves by feasting on a portion of the hunt. Unfortunately for the hunting party, a powerful &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; had deliberately cursed the beasts. Any living creature that consumed the animals' flesh would be converted into undeath. Afterwards, the lich was able to impose his will upon the undead trolls. Following the lich's commands, most of the undead trolls formed a base of operations in the southwest of the Eastern Plaguelands. One of the undead trolls was given a horrifying mission by his new master: to return home and infect the rest of his people. &lt;a href=\"Infiltrator%20Hameya\"&gt;Hameya&lt;/a&gt; managed to hold onto his willpower long enough to scribble a brief account of what had occurred. His desperate note offered a reward for anyone who killed him before he reached his home.\nRecent reports on the Mossflayer tribe paint a grim picture of subsequent events. A large number of fresh graves have been dug near the village, and several undead trolls have been spotted, hiding themselves among their unsuspecting brethren. It would seem that no one was able to stop &lt;a href=\"Infiltrator%20Hameya\"&gt;Hameya&lt;/a&gt; in time, and he succeeded in accomplishing the lich's dread mission. Unless the Mossflayers come to their senses and flee the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the tribe will certainly be transformed in its entirety.\nCataclysm.\nIt seems that the living members of the tribe have managed to survive up until the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, however the undead trolls are still very much a threat, not only to the surviving Mossflayers but to others as well. &lt;a href=\"Vex%27tul\"&gt;Vex'tul&lt;/a&gt; is a member of the tribe which after the death of his master, Zaeldarr, joined &lt;a href=\"Fiona%27s%20Caravan\"&gt;Fiona's Caravan&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Mossflayer%20Speaker\"&gt;Mossflayer Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nAs the description of &lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Lady%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;The Dark Lady&lt;/a&gt; mentions the Plaguelands, it's possible that &lt;a href=\"Zul%27rogg\"&gt;Zul'rogg&lt;/a&gt; and his followers were members of the Mossflayer tribe."}

{"id": "52447", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=52447", "title": "Most Valuable Poster", "text": "A Most Valuable Poster (MVP) is a player who has answered players' questions consistently and accurately in the past such that &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; gives a note of credibility to what they post. They continue to promote constructive posting wherever they can. They contribute to the community and encourage polite discussion throughout the forums. When you see an MVP post, listen to what they have to say \u2014 they were chosen for their knowledge of the game, also.\nThe MVP program is not to say that no one else is helpful, nor that MVPs are 100% helpful. But for the sake of the new player asking a question, the MVP title means \"This poster is likely telling you the truth with the intent of helping you.\" MVPs have no special knowledge, nor moderation powers. They quite simply just remember things said previously, or know where to look up answers, and are willing and able to do so.\nAlthough they do not technically have moderation powers, while the Community Managers are working the MVPs have instant access to them and as such can request for a specific thread or post to be looked at.\nHistory.\nThe MVP (Most Valuable Poster) program for the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"forum\"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt;s started on 11/11/05 for the English US forums, 10/30/06 for the English, German, and French EU forums, 1/30/07 for the Spanish EU forums, 3/13/09 for the Latin US Forums, and 12/2/10 for the Russian EU Forums. \nThe first four posters ever involved with the WoW portion of the program were &lt;a href=\"Faizaniel\"&gt;Faizaniel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hyacinth\"&gt;Hyacinth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trepas\"&gt;Trepas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Palehoof\"&gt;Palehoof&lt;/a&gt;. Of the four, only &lt;a href=\"Faizaniel\"&gt;Faizaniel&lt;/a&gt; remains as an MVP. In the initial phase, using the original forum architecture, MVP posters posted in light blue font. Later in the program they also received an animated forum avatar: an &lt;a href=\"Ironhide%20Devilsaur\"&gt;Ironhide Devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; from Un'goro Crater. The font was, conceptually, between grey and blue. Not quite a staff poster, but not just another player either. The light, or as some say, \"Pale\" blue font, indicated that Blizzard notes that poster is reliably accurate and honest in their posting, and has a history of being helpful to other posters. \nIn a future revision of the forum architecture that was implemented by Blizzard, MVP posters posted in a bright green font. In the current new Battle.net forums, they still post in green, but the green is not quite as bright in comparison to the way it was on the old forums, and thus generally thought to be much easier on the eyes. Regarding the old almost-blue font, many concerns were brought up saying that the light blue font was, alternately, too much or not enough. Some posters complained that the light blue was too close to grey and they could not tell the difference. Some others complained that the light blue was still \"blue\" and afforded undue recognition. Still others simply mistook MVP posters for staff members and treated them accordingly. MVPs are flagged by &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt;, rather than by character. Any alternate character on an MVP's account will also post with the same green font.\nOn November 30, 2009, Blizzard poster &lt;a href=\"Zarhym\"&gt;Zarhym&lt;/a&gt; announced a new avatar for the MVPs: an &lt;a href=\"Ironbound%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Ironbound Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt;. This was stated as being part of the five year anniversary of World of Warcraft, which was also the four year anniversary of the MVP program. The green font remains, but the cheerfully bobbing head of \"Dino Bob the Avasaur\" as he was sometimes called has been retired. On the new Battle.net forums, however, MVPs no longer post with a special avatar. Their current avatars are the same as what they would have otherwise been as normal posters, with the only difference being that the frame around the avatars are green coloured. This change was implemented due to the high number of people mistaking MVPs for Blizzard staff.\nOn February 15, 2018, Community Manager &lt;a href=\"Ornyx\"&gt;Ornyx&lt;/a&gt; announced that changes were being made to the WoW MVP Program (NA). The goal originally had been to \"recognize active forums poster who contributed to our community through things like high-quality class guides or assisting and guiding new players with helpful information.\" With the prevalence of third-party communities today that didn't exist at the time of the program's founding, this led Blizzard to feel that MVPs were no longer able to fulfill that goal on their singular forums platform. As such, the purpose of the MVP program would shift more to providing communication and feedback between Blizzard and the more popular external communities. In order to facilitate the change, the MVP program will now use an application-based recruitment system. The changes only affect WoW (NA) and does not affect Customer and Technical Support MVPs. Those currently MVPs that are affected are encouraged to renew their status through the new application system. The new system went live on February 20, 2018.\nEU English MVPs.\nOn the European forums, the MVP program is divided into two groups. Namely, Community MVPs and CS (Customer Service) MVPs. Community MVPs were selected by the European community team, and CS MVPs were selected by the forum customer service team. Some community MVPs were selected based on their posts on the customer or technical support forum prior to the new arrangement of the MVP program in Europe. Although these MVPs prefer to post in the support boards, they are still categorized as community MVPs.\nCommunity MVPs\nCustomer Service MVPs\nEU German MVPs.\nCustomer Service MVPs\nEU Spanish MVPs.\nCustomer Service MVPs\nEU Russian MVPs.\nCustomer Service MVPs"}

Previously, the two forge camps in Blade's Edge had high drop rates and well placed mobs, but this has since been removed. Now, Motes of Fire are among the highest demanded items in the game, making prices high and farming difficult due to competition.\nIf you're intending on making a lot of money from farming motes, buying green fire resist gear can be a worthwhile investment. Getting your fire resist up to a good number is very helpful, as the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elementals\"&gt;Fire Elementals&lt;/a&gt; that drop Motes of Fire only do &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage, leaving you virtually impervious. However, this can mean you're less likely to be able to kill anything else as quickly, and almost all the locations listed here have other mobs (and other players) in the area. \nMiners can acquire a steady supply from their regular mining activities, but for those of other professions, the only way to farm these is to kill lots of elementals. The drop rate is decent.\nFire elementals can be found in the following locations:"}

Each mermaid was allotted a certain amount of the Mother's power over rocks and water from birth, and the moment that power got used up they turned into bubbles and died.

This later also proved true (according to the folktale, at least) when Halia slit the nearly-dead Ery's feet open, jumped into &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with her, and surfaced with her transformed into a mermaid.\nDespite the similar names, the Mother seems to be distinct from the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt; that the Kul Tirans worship; when Halia begged Ery to slit her feet the first time, Ery refused, citing the fact that she had sworn herself to the Tidemother. Beyond this, nothing is known about who or what the Mother is. She and the mermaids may not even be real at all, but just a Kul Tiran legend. "}

The clan's elder shaman Mother Kashur thought that perhaps their ancestors or elemental spirits had some plans for her so she blessed her.\nYears later, Draka came to Mother Kashur asking for help with her physical weakness since Frostwolf Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; had forbidden her family from attending the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; celebration in fear of the other clans' disrespect. As Draka begged, Kashur agreed and asked her grandfather &lt;a href=\"Tal%27kraa\"&gt;Tal'kraa&lt;/a&gt; who told her how to proceed. Mother Kashur sent Draka out for components of a 'spell' for a potion, wing feather of a &lt;a href=\"windroc\"&gt;windroc&lt;/a&gt;, horn of a &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt;, and fur of a &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt;. If Draka slayed these beasts and gathered the reagents Draka would be made strong.\nWhen Draka returned, Kashur explained that there would be no potion, but rather that the hunt had already made her stronger. The quest truly had the necessary effect so Draka would eventually take part in the Kosh'harg celebration and meet the love of her life, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nKashur was an old friend of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. She accompanied her clan for the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; celebrations and during one, she tended to the injuries of young &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; done by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough old and decrepit, she vowed to keep walking to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; for as long as she could walk. She brought Durotan to the cave of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of Tal'kraa, who wanted to see him.\nOne day, she insisted on joining a &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; hunt, only to be fatally trampled before anyone could intervene. Even as the Frostwolf clan mourned her, they celebrated her life and the end that she had chosen; and she was replaced as the clan's elder shaman by her apprentice &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;.\nMother Kashur's spirit, like all the spirits of the orcish ancestors, was drawn to the sacred mountain of Oshu'gun by the psychic call of the dying naaru &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; impersonated her to convince &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; that the Frostwolves should reject the practices of &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt; and study the path of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; resisted this idea.\nMother Kashur is known to have had a great black wolf named &lt;a href=\"Dreamwalker%20%28wolf%29\"&gt;Dreamwalker&lt;/a&gt; as her companion and mount.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nFollowing Kashur's death, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; took over the role of clan mother. During the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Kashur spoke to Geyah in her dreams, saying that she wished to speak to a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. Geyah told the adventurer to gather reagents for a potion that would let them see Kashur's spirit, but this was in reality only a test of their dedication. When the adventurer met her at the &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Grounds\"&gt;Ancestral Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, Kashur revealed that a disturbance had agitated the spirits of the orc ancestors, causing them all to move south toward Oshu'gun. Kashur sent the hero into the mountain to investigate.\nInside, the hero discovered that it was the wounded &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt; who was unwillingly drawing the spirits toward itself. With the help of the other naaru, the adventurer obtained a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Mirror\"&gt;soul mirror&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20Crypts\"&gt;Auchenai Crypts&lt;/a&gt; and used it for the only available recourse: destroying the orc spirits before they could transform into &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Although upset, Kashur thanked the hero for risking their life to ensure the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;'s safety and the peace of the ancestors, then sent them back to Geyah to deliver the news.\nAfter the adventurer left, the Mag'har &lt;a href=\"Nakha\"&gt;Seer Nakha&lt;/a&gt; sought out Kashur's spirit as well. Kashur told Nakha of \"a song that only the spirits could hear\", which had troubled the ancestors at first until the hero had helped them find rest.

Besides requiring high amounts of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Resistance\"&gt;Shadow Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, the fight is rather basic &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;. All previous bosses (&lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;Shade of Akama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reliquary of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gurtogg%20Bloodboil\"&gt;Gurtogg Bloodboil&lt;/a&gt;) need to be killed before the door to Mother Shahraz opens. She must be killed before the raid can gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Council\"&gt;Illidari Council&lt;/a&gt;. Given her location, quotes, and abilities, it can be surmised that she is the leader of the concubines in Black Temple and probably even a concubine herself.\nOverview.\nMother Shahraz will link allies together with Fatal Attraction while also dealing heavy damage to the raid with her Beams.\nPreparation.\nThe main tank wears his normal tanking gear. All other raid members need very high (best maxed) shadow resistance. This is best accomplished using the BT crafted &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20resistance\"&gt;Shadow resistance&lt;/a&gt; gear plus the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Medallion of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; buff is mandatory, a &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%20of%20Major%20Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Cauldron of Major Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; can help too. The fight is very mana intensive for healers.\nEverybody should have a &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the universal nerfing of TBC raid contents in patch 3.0.2, she can be brought down without any shadow resistance gear provided the DPS and Healing are good.\nPositioning.\nThree tanks must stand close together in front of her to distribute the Saber Lash damage. She must face away from the raid, the melee group sets up behind her. Ranged and healers set up in one big group. It's a good idea to have the raid stand under the right-hand pillar, and the melee group with the boss at the opposite pillar, because the lower ceiling there somewhat reduces falling damage.\nThe encounter can be reset by running to the rear of the room (away from her platform).\nFatal Attraction.\nThis ability is the most frequent cause for wipes, one common wipe situation occurs when the FA targets are teleported into the melee group, and a Saber Lash happens at the same time. There is some evidence that the beams and FA not only target players, but also totems. It's therefore a very good idea if all shamans continuously keep up four totems. One healer should be predesignated as FA target healer, and spam heal the affected players. They must move apart very quickly, and try not to hurt too many other raid members. This is easier said than done, because often enough two players run in the same direction, both thinking due to lag that the other guy was \"behind\" and should break off, while in reality they're just close together, and each see themself as being \"first\". Good communication between the FA targets is essential.\nDistributed setup.\nA one-group setup as described above has the disadvantage that the FA targets can be teleported into that one group, and then a lot of AoE damage is taken. By setting up in several (up to four) smaller groups, the number of people affected by the AoE is smaller, while the probability of having some people affected by it increases. Overall, distributed setups have the disadvantage that FA targets have problems to find safe spots to run to.\nClose-in setup.\nWhen the whole raid clusters very close to her (\"under her skirt\"), nobody can be hit by the beams. The problem is that if only one person does not stand close enough, a wipe is highly probable.\nThis will cause everyone to be affected by the silence, including healers.\nSoloing.\nMother Shahraz can be a nightmare for casters, as she will close in and use her 10-second Silence ability, thus giving her that amount of time to do damage without reprisal. Casters should blow any damage-enhancing cooldowns at the start of the encounter, stack any DOTs available between silences, and use any healing or damage-mitigating abilities they have available to give them more time to get the kill."}

{"id": "19851", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19851", "title": "Experience point", "text": "An experience point (abbreviated XP or EXP) is a unit of measurement for character &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; advancement. Advancing to the next level requires a fixed amount of experience points which is determined by &lt;a href=\"Experience%20to%20level\"&gt;a formula&lt;/a&gt;.\nGaining levels is based on the concept that as characters defeat stronger enemies, they gain combat experience that allows them to improve their skills. This system was established in the 1970s by the classic pen-and-paper RPG \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and is present in some form or another in almost all role-playing games.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", you generally get XP from killing &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s and completing &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, but you can also get some from &lt;a href=\"exploring\"&gt;exploring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;gathering herbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, collecting fragments with &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; and opening &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;s. Since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, XP is awarded also for completing objectives and actions that yield &lt;a href=\"honor\"&gt;honor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; (honorable kills not included).\nAnother notable source of XP is completing &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; runs with a &lt;a href=\"pickup%20group\"&gt;random group&lt;/a&gt; matched together via the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; (unlocked at level 15). In addition to the normal rewards in an instance, players are rewarded extra XP and gold on completion of the run.\nIn summation, there are three alternative activities that can be utilized while &lt;a href=\"leveling\"&gt;leveling&lt;/a&gt; your character -- &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;questing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;. When a player grows tired of one mode of gameplay they can switch to another.\nRest bonus.\nWhile in an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; or anywhere in a &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;, your player portrait will begin to glow and your level circle will say \"zzz\", indicating that you are &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;resting&lt;/a&gt;. If you log off here, you will continue to rest while offline. \nWhen rested, your XP bar will turn blue, and a notch will appear indicating exactly how rested you are. (If there isn't enough room to show it on your current XP bar, it will show up after you gain a level.) You will earn double XP from killing monsters, mining ore nodes, gathering herbs, collecting archaeology fragments, and opening chests while rested until your XP bar fills to the notch. At that point, the message\nwill appear and you will resume normal XP gains.\nOne bubble of rested XP (5% of your current level) is earned for every 8 hours spent resting. A maximum of 30 bubbles (150% of your current level) may be earned. In other words, you can leave your character resting in an inn or capital city for up to 10 days (without gaining experience) before you earn the maximum amount of rest state, and a resting character stores up one full level of rest in 160 hours (6.67 days).\nOther XP bonuses.\nMany &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt; items grant greater XP gains while wearing them. The XP bonuses stack with each other and with the &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt; bonus. The effect of some heirlooms stops at level 80, while some remain active all the way to 85.\nXP in a group.\nA multiplied amount of XP is divided between &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; members in the same area when a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; is defeated by a member, the factor increasing with each additional player in the party. Two-member parties have a slightly different formula. The division of XP among party members is a &lt;a href=\"Mob_experience%23Group_Experience\"&gt;calculation&lt;/a&gt; based on the various levels of the party members and the level of the mob.\nThe net result for a player in a group is less XP per monster. Experience from other sources (quests, etc.) is not affected.\nXP from monsters in a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; group is dramatically decreased.\nDisabling XP gain.\nIf you do not want to gain XP, you can visit &lt;a href=\"Behsten\"&gt;Behsten&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"Slahtz\"&gt;Slahtz&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) to turn off all experience gain. It costs to disable XP gain, and another to re-enable it. Be aware that any potential XP gains wasted in this way cannot be recovered. Disabling XP gain does not affect the gain of guild experience or guild reputation from turning in quests. Disabling experience applys the &lt;a href=\"Experience%20Eliminated\"&gt;Experience Eliminated&lt;/a&gt; buff.\nThis is useful for players who wish to stay in a &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; bracket (say 15-19) while still able to farm for better equipment and kill monsters without reaching level 20. This is called &lt;a href=\"twinking\"&gt;twinking&lt;/a&gt;. Players with XP gain disabled (twinks) are matched against other twinks in the battleground queue system.\nAnother use for this feature is visiting old content at the original level, e.g. raids at level 70. &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20the%20Titans\"&gt;Herald of the Titans&lt;/a&gt; is an achievement that requires all members of the raid to be level 80.\nPlayer participation.\nPlayers must &lt;a href=\"tap\"&gt;tap&lt;/a&gt; a mob and genuinely participate in combat to gain credit for the kill. There is no experience gain if most of the damage was caused by an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, or if all damage was caused by a permanent pet. Thusm low-level players cannot get experience (and loot) from high-level mobs by pulling them to guards, and pet classes cannot use their pets to &lt;a href=\"AFK\"&gt;AFK&lt;/a&gt; grind.\nOut-leveling zones.\nIf you are at or above the maximum level for a given expansion, killing creatures from that expansion's zones will only give 10% of normal experience. Quests will continue to give their standard EXP, or gold for level-capped players.\nExample:\nMob gray level.\nKilling a mob stops giving XP if the level of that mob is too low. The mob name will have turned gray. The mob level at which this happens is called the Gray Level, and depends on your character level.\nThe full formula for the Gray Level is rather complicated, so here is a table. Mobs at or below the level given in the table do not give XP.\nQuest XP.\nThe following formula for quest XP was obtained by studying the XP rewards provided for various quests and various levels.\n Character_Level &lt;= Quest_Level + 5 : Quest_XP = (100 %) or Full_Quest_XP\n Character_Level = Quest_Level + 6 : Quest_XP = ( 80 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.8 / 5) * 5\n Character_Level = Quest_Level + 7 : Quest_XP = ( 60 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.6 / 5) * 5\n Character_Level = Quest_Level + 8 : Quest_XP = ( 40 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.4 / 5) * 5\n Character_Level = Quest_Level + 9 : Quest_XP = ( 20 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.2 / 5) * 5\n Character_Level &gt;= Quest_Level + 10 : Quest_XP = ( 10 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.1 / 5) * 5\nSome lower level quests (Quest_Level &lt; 10) seem to give full XP only for Character_Level &lt;= Quest_Level + 4, differing by 1 level with the table above.\nFor the table, see &lt;a href=\"Mob%20difficulty%20colors\"&gt;Mob difficulty colors&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlizzard has awarded full xp for the completion of a quest of any color except grey. See &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/questbasics.html\"&gt;Wow-Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The level at which a quest becomes green is exactly the same as for mobs. \nIn respect to current level, higher level quests do yield a larger relative xp gain. However, in the time it takes to do these harder quests it is possible to do several of the lower quests. Each to their own, but don't confuse the absolute value of xp gained as a number with the relative xp gained as a percentage of current level requirements. One strategy is to avoid reds, miss most oranges and focus on a mix of yellow and greens. If you are meant to do them then you will find you have time later. If by then you have already moved on, there are plenty of shiny new quests in the next zone.\nAlso, bear in mind that by completing higher as opposed to lower level quests, you may reach a point where the quests below you are grey and you're not high enough level to pick up any new ones, and will have to move to a new area to get quests.\nMatch the green and yellow quests and there is more than enough to see you questing all the way through the game.\nMoney for experience at top level.\nWhen a character has reached the highest level attainable, depending on the current &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;, they will receive money instead of experience points. In this case the normal gold reward a quest may give is not awarded. However, the xp to gold conversion always results in a larger gold reward than the normal gold reward. As far as can be determined, the conversion formula is:\n Money in copper = XP * 6 (Level 1-80 quests)\n Money in copper = XP * 2.383285303 (Cataclysm 81-85 quests)\nFor example, a player with the expansions up to Wrath of the Lich King completes a quest at level 80 that normally awards and 22,050 experience points (&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/wotlk/quest%3D12892\"&gt;example quest&lt;/a&gt;). The player would instead receive from the xp to gold conversion, but they would not receive the normal reward in addition to that. Players who have turned off their experience gains by visiting &lt;a href=\"Behsten\"&gt;Behsten&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Slahtz\"&gt;Slahtz&lt;/a&gt; do not get any money in compensation for the XP they would otherwise gain.\nNote that some sources of XP, such as battlegrounds, do \"not\" reward players max level players with gold in place of XP.\nExperience to level.\nThe experience needed for a given level is specified by a formula that takes in to account several different factors. Up to level 10, it takes 8*CL kills of creatures of your same level to advance to the next level, where CL is your Current Level. \nAt level 11, the \"difficulty reduction factor\" added in patch 2.3.0 will kick in, thus reducing the XP needed to level. Though this initially lasted until level 30, the reduction factor was extended to level 60 with the release of Cataclysm. The general purpose of these difficulty reduction factors is to keep the total time spent leveling a character relatively constant, despite the level cap increasing with each expansion.\nAt level 60, the expected XP from killing a mob of your level increases significantly, as it is assumed that you will be killing mobs in Outland. This increases XP required to level. At the same time, however, another reduction factor (active 60-70 only, added at the release of WotLK and adjusted for Cataclysm) goes into effect reducing the XP needed. \nAt level 70, the expected XP from killing a mob of your level increases drastically again, as it is assumed that you will be killing mobs in Northrend. The 60-70 XP reduction factor changes to a different factor added at the release of Cataclysm; however, this is less of a reduction, so players will see a large jump in the XP needed to level compared to what they had in Outland.

Note that this percentage, when added to one, is the same as RF(CL) (discrepancies are caused by rounding). \nIn \"Wrath\", the XP needed to level (from 70 to 80) jumps again, but the amount of experience it takes to get to level 70 is reduced. The halfway point for 70-80 is 204100 XP into 75.\nExperience to level pre-4.3.\nThis table shows the character's current level and the amount of XP required to advance to the next level (e.g. \"22: 24000\" means that if you are level 22, you need a total of 24,000 XP to advance to level 23). This is a compilation of the tables below with all current values. This also shows the difference (percent change) in current XP requirements as compared to before Cataclysm. Note that this percentage, when added to one, is the same as RF(CL) (discrepancies are caused by rounding). \nExperience to level pre-Wrath.\nThis table shows the character's current level and the amount of XP required to advance to the next level (e.g. \"22: 24000\" means that if you are level 22, you need a total of 24,000 XP to advance to level 23). This also shows the difference (percent change) in current XP requirements as compared to before Patch 2.3.0. Note that this percentage, when added to one, is the same as RF(CL) (discrepancies are caused by rounding).\nPre-2.3 table.\nThis table shows the experience needed to advance, by level, before &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;. The table shows the character's current level and the amount of &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; required to advance to the next level (e.g. \"22: 27300\" means that if you are level 22, you need a total of 27,300 XP to advance to level 23).\nThe total experience needed to reach level 60 was 4,084,700. The total for 60 to 70 was 6,762,300, making 1 to 70 10,847,000 points in total.\nThe total number of same-level mobs that must be killed to reach level 60 with no rest or quests was 16,971 which would take approximately 76 hours at 16 seconds per kill.\nAn amusing but probably not very significant figure is that the half-way point to 60 for raw experience point accumulation is 12,550 XP into level 48. Halfway to 70 for raw experience point accumulation is 344,500 XP into level 62. In actual practice, quests contribute significantly to XP so the half-way point is somewhere below this.\nVanilla / Classic table.\nThis table shows the experience needed to advance, by level, during the original vanilla WoW and Classic WoW. \nRest XP.\nThe maximum amount of \"rest\" that one can accumulate on a character is 150% of XP for the current level, (or 30 \"bubbles\") half of which is \"earned\" XP and half of which is \"bonus\" XP. This is because, every time you kill a mob, both the earned XP and the bonus XP is deducted from your rest. So, for example, if you are lvl 10 and 80% through the level (or 6080/7600) the maximum rest would be 11400. If you grind mobs until your rest is gone (and complete no quests), it will take you to level 12 at 1180/9800, or 12% through level 12, having earned 5700 XP from killing mobs and gotten 5700 XP \"free\" for being rested. Keep in mind that quest (and discovery) XP does not count against your rest. Watch your rest marker when turning in a quest, and you will see it jump by the same amount as did your current XP.\nWrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm XP Reductions.\nThe below 60-69 XP Values are for Beta Build 9014 with the changes to 60-70 leveling for the expansion. \nThe 70-79 XP Values are for Beta Build 8926.\nThe XP needed to level from 70 to 80 has been reduced by 20% with patch 4.0.3a.\nWith Patch 4.3.0, the required experience for level 70 to 80 has been reduced again by roughly 33%. This has been the second and final reduction in Cataclysm. This table shows the updated values from level 70 to 80."}

{"id": "316791", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=316791", "title": "Expertise", "text": "Expertise (also known as Exp and Ept) was a secondary &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;. Each percent of expertise decreased the chance that melee or ranged attacks made by the player will be &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt;d by the same percentage. If the dodge chance was completely negated by expertise, any leftover expertise would then negate &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parried&lt;/a&gt; by the same amount. With &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, Expertise also increased &lt;a href=\"Spell%20hit\"&gt;Spell hit&lt;/a&gt; for casters by the same amount.\nFor example, a special attack against a boss level target would have 7.5% to be dodged and 7.5% chance to be parried (from the front only).\nExpertise was removed with &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"hit\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; rating. The developers described the process of reaching the expertise and hit caps as a penalty rather than an augmentation, with players inevitably regarding the stats as mandatory rather than \"fun\". As a result, the stats were removed, with players effectively automatically capped in both expertise and hit.\nExpertise rating.\nNote that there is a difference between \"expertise\" and \"expertise rating\". \"Expertise\" is the attribute itself; \"expertise rating\" is a rating which is converted into expertise at a ratio determined by your level. For example, a level 90 character will gain 1% expertise for every 340 expertise rating. Expertise rating is the main source for expertise, typically gained from &lt;a href=\"gear\"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; and enhancements such as &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRacial bonuses.\nCertain race's &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s provide passive expertise bonuses. All racials provide a 1% bonus to expertise for certain types of weapons.\nThese bonuses are applied to weapons individually. An orc dual-wielding an axe and a mace would therefore benefit from a 1% expertise bonus to the axe, but not to the mace. The 1% expertise granted by these &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt;s is equivalent to 340 rating at level 90.\nExpertise caps.\nFor boss-level mobs (which are calculated as level + 3) the soft cap is 7.5% dodge or 7.5% expertise (2550 expertise rating), and the hard cap is an additional 7.5% &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; or 15% expertise (5100 expertise rating at level 90). Melee DPS classes will usually focus on the soft cap, since bosses cannot parry when attacked from behind. Some tanks will like to collect a lot of expertise in order to avoid boss parries, which may result in the &lt;a href=\"Parry-Hasting\"&gt;Parry-Hasting&lt;/a&gt; effect. However, recently the boss Parry-Hasting effect has been disabled on some of the bosses.\nFor level 87 and below (heroic bosses and trash mobs in raids) the dodge and parry caps are the same.\nTanking.\nExpertise is of two-fold use to tanks. First, by reducing the target's avoidance, it improves a tank's threat generation (more of his/her attacks will land). More importantly, because mobs may attack more quickly after parrying an attack, expertise reduces the total damage that the tank may receive by reducing the chance that his target parries. The increase in attack speed varies (from 0-40% of the speed of the parried attack), and can stack if multiple attacks are parried in rapid succession, leading to a potential source of massive burst damage. However, this parry-hasting effect from when a boss parries has been disabled from most bosses except the last 3 in 25m TOC.\nDPS.\nMelee DPS also benefit from expertise. With sufficient expertise, melee classes can attack their target from the front without being dodged or parried (although facing restrictions, such as those on &lt;a href=\"Backstab\"&gt;Backstab&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shred\"&gt;Shred&lt;/a&gt;, still apply). It is possible to have enough expertise to prevent dodges and parries, but parries are much harder to prevent, and players without such high expertise values should remain behind the target to prevent parried attacks from increasing the target's attack speed against the tank.\nDPS will need a total of 7.5%, or 2550 expertise rating, to avoid Dodges on yellow attacks against a raid boss.\nExpertise against bosses.\nThe dodge and parry chances for boss-mobs is 7.5% dodge and 7.5% parry. This means that a player would need 7.5% expertise (2550 expertise rating) to negate a boss's dodge chance, and 15% expertise (5100 rating) to prevent parries.\nTo \"cap\" expertise against a raid boss, melee DPS need only concern themselves with the boss' dodge chance, provided that they attack from behind. This dictates a goal of 2550 expertise rating. Tanks, however, attack from the front, and need to worry about both dodge and parry."}

Last I heard of him, he was working at a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;smithy&lt;/a&gt; with a hunting party up in Lordaeron.\nI can't tell you too many of the details about the process, but I can tell you it requires blood from a rare, still-beating black drake whelp's heart.

It is not a common drop, however, and may take \"many\" kills to obtain. Perhaps the only bonus would be to &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;skinners&lt;/a&gt; who can at least skin the dragon corpses.\nEven if you don't quit before you find the heart, it is \"extremely\" (and even perhaps unreasonably) difficult to find, more akin to trying to find a &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;.
