These dark skinned dwarves were formerly ruled by &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and vied for control of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow ruled by Queen &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, widow of the late Emperor &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and daughter of King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron clan seek to forge a new future for themselves independent of the tyranny of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and his minions, which has long been imposed upon them in their home of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, so they have become part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Under Moira's guidance, some of the Dark Iron clan have even moved into Ironforge to train the local dwarves in the ways of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nLike all dwarves, the Dark Iron dwarves of the Dark Iron clan are descendants of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; the Dark Iron clan, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited the darkest, deepest crevices of Ironforge. The Dark Iron clan was unsuccessful in wresting control of Ironforge from the Bronzebeard clan and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; during the War of the Three Hammers.\nThaurissan and his Dark Irons vowed revenge against Ironforge. He took his followers south and founded &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;a city&lt;/a&gt; (which he named after himself) within the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Despite years of prosperity, Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt; did not soften in their desire to defeat the Bronzebeards and Wildhammers; they launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Thaurissan was routed by &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; at Ironforge, and retreated back to the Redridge Mountains. Modgud's assault on Grim Batol was marginally more effective, though she herself fell in battle to &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Some say Modgud was manipulated to ruin by &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a dark magical &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; she had acquired. As for the Dark Iron dwarves that fought for Modgud at Grim Batol, they were consequently cursed at the end of the conflict and became &lt;a href=\"skardyn\"&gt;skardyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the combined forces of Ironforge and Grim Batol marched on Thaurissan, he attempted to summon an ancient power sleeping beneath the Redridge Mountains. &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; the Firelord, immortal lord of all &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, had been banished by the Titans when the world was young. Now, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. The volcano, known as &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, became bordered by the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. They remain within the Spire to this day.\nFirst and Second Wars.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; moved into &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, they were confronted by the fire elemental and Dark Iron dwarf minions of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Cho'gall used his fledgling connection to the Old Gods to convince the dwarves and Ragnaros's lieutenants, who also served the Old Gods, to let the Shadow Council stay in the upper reaches of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. If the warlocks remained there, they would not be disturbed by Ragnaros or his followers.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched to Blackrock Spire to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim was introduced by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to the Dark Iron dwarves. The dwarves, at Ragnaros' secret behest, allowed the Horde to use Blackrock Spire as its headquarters.\nAfter the Second War, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; snuck back into the Spire once the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; left the area, and the Blackrocks struck a deal with the Dark Irons, with the dwarves descending even deeper into the mountain, while the orcs occupied the higher levels. The bargain was never intended to be kept, and they eventually went on to fight each other.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFor many years, Dark Iron clan served Ragnaros. They were centered in the depths of Blackrock Mountain, in their dark capital of &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;. A great deal of Dark Iron activity could be seen in the Searing Gorge and in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. There had also been incursions into the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, the Burning Steppes, and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Emperor &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; delighted in the power that Ragnaros had bestowed upon him he bristled at his servitude to the Firelord. When Ragnaros ordered Thaurissan to prepare the Dark Irons for a new war, the emperor was overjoyed. He had long dreamed of conquering the other dwarf clans, not only to rule over them but also to wield their combined power to break free of the Firelord's control.\nDark Irons are enemies of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to have helped &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; in the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, as some Dark Iron dwarves and even the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Ambassador\"&gt;Dark Iron Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the poisoned &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; capital. It's unclear what exactly they did, though.\nSome Dark Irons broke ties with the clan in order to seek out business relations with the Alliance and Horde. This group is known as the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons proclaimed the Brotherhood an enemy of the clan for their relations, and the two groups were sent into conflict.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; sent a team to kill Emperor Thaurissan, and retrieve his abductee \u2014 the previously thought to be ensorcelled &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 back to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Moira refused to come home and announced that she was pregnant, and that the death of her husband has left a terrible, fiery rage within her heart. Once Emperor Dagran Thaurissan died in his throne room at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron clan's leadership was transferred over to his wife Moira Bronzebeard. Moira would rule as the &lt;a href=\"Queen\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;-Regent until her son comes of age to be crowned emperor.\nThe split.\nIn the power vacuum that followed the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the petrified King Magni Bronzebeard's estranged daughter, Moira, who had married into the much despised Dark Iron clan, briefly claimed Ironforge's throne and effectively locked down the city. If not for the intervention of &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and his son, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, her brash actions might have sparked another civil war. With Varian's guidance, control of Ironforge has since been divided equally among the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron clans through the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Yet as bitterness and prejudice fester among the clans, the council's ability to govern as one remains uncertain.\nThe Dark Iron clan thus was no longer united. One group of Dark Irons has joined the Alliance with their leader Moira Thaurissan, while the other group has followed Ragnaros into an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Moira's hold over the Dark Iron clan is tenuous at best and there are in fact Twilight's Hammer agents within the faction that proclaim loyalty to Moira. In secret, these traitors gather information on not only the other Dark Irons but also the Alliance as a whole for their Twilight Hammer masters. Non-Alliance Dark Irons have a presence primarily in &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, with other camps at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Ruins of Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Angor%20Fortress\"&gt;Angor Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, and small numbers scattered across &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt; was in flux during the era due to Moira's duties in Ironforge, and she hasn't had the chance to ensure the security of her son's future kingdom; however, should she have spare time, Shadowforge City would likely rise. Nevertheless, Shadowforge City remained the capital of the faction that has proclaimed loyalty to Moira.\nWith Ragnaros' permanent death in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, the clan was finally freed from his enslavement, although there are &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;those that still worshipped him&lt;/a&gt; regardless.\nLandfall.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, many Dark Irons followed the Alliance and took the part on their campaign against the Horde attacking them in &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood in the Snow.\nThe Dark Iron &lt;a href=\"Forgeguard\"&gt;Forgeguard&lt;/a&gt; led by Queen-Regent Moira aided in the defense of Ironforge against the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; ambassador, &lt;a href=\"Hekima%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Hekima&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in Dun Morogh. They defeated their enemies and gained the respect of King Wrynn and the other members of the Council.\nThe Jade hunters.\nTo help promote the union of their clans the Council of Three Hammers combined &lt;a href=\"Fenella%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fenella Darkvire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Carrick%20Irongrin\"&gt;Carrick Irongrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fendrig%20Redbeard\"&gt;Fendrig Redbeard&lt;/a&gt; as a team to help rebuild the Jade Serpent statue.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; appears to have united with the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; once again, with &lt;a href=\"Hansel%20Heavyhands\"&gt;Hansel Heavyhands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burrian%20Coalpart\"&gt;Burrian Coalpart&lt;/a&gt; assisting the invasion of on the Alliance side. &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; was also an important part of the invasion. A Dark Iron expedition was sent into &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; to spy on the , as they knew the Blackrock orcs better than anyone else in the Alliance expedition. They established &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Rise\"&gt;Bastion Rise&lt;/a&gt; in the savage jungle. The Dark Irons continued participating in the war effort for its remaining duration.\nLegion.\nSeveral units of the clan led by Moira participated in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; alongside other defenders against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasions&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral members, including Moira, joined the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; was helping them find and gather other priests for the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Dark Irons work alongside the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt; in a dig at &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. A force of the Dark Irons fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dark Iron dwarves were experimenting with &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"the%20Black%20Anvil\"&gt;the Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, Shadowforge City was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;.

To repair the Anvil, a &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20o%27%20the%20Molten%20Core\"&gt;Fragment of the Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; was taken to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; to re-energize, during which the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Cult of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; was discovered to exist who aimed to bring back &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.

Though the majority of them are members of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, many are also members of independent organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mountain-Lord%20Rendan\"&gt;Mountain-Lord Rendan&lt;/a&gt;'s followers.\nSome dwarves from the Dark Iron clan became the cursed &lt;a href=\"skardyn\"&gt;skardyn&lt;/a&gt; that roam &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical appearance.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Dark Iron dwarves have darkish gray or black skin, with red glowing eyes. As of \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", their hair glows slightly and embers flake off the ends.\nThey are fire-resistant, but on the other hand, they have a weakness to water which \"extinguishes\" them. According to &lt;a href=\"Guldros%20Onyxbrand\"&gt;Guldros Onyxbrand&lt;/a&gt;, his father once got extinguished and his family had to \"kindle\" him twice a day for a month before he could walk straight again.\nCulture.\nDark Iron dwarves are known for being manipulative, underhanded, greedy, cruel, and despotic but &lt;a href=\"Franclorn%20Forgewright\"&gt;Franclorn Forgewright&lt;/a&gt; states that they were not always that way and that these evil traits may have been caused by the influence of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. This may be true as certain individuals such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Angerforge\"&gt;General Angerforge&lt;/a&gt;, Franclorn Forgewright, and the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; have shown themselves to be stalwart, valorous, and even honorable, despite their history of strife with the other dwarven clans and even among themselves. Predominantly, Dark Iron dwarves are known for their fiery tempers and fierce determination.\nDark Iron politics is both treacherous and brutal. There is only one punishment for crimes committed against the Dark Iron dwarves: death. Ancient tradition calls for the guilty to pay the blood price in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Law\"&gt;Ring of the Law&lt;/a&gt; by battling savage creatures gathered from across Azeroth. To date, it is unknown if anyone has ever survived this brutal crucible. Dark Iron dwarves are also known for their craftsmanship, their sorcery, and their sturdy architecture.\nDark Irons have a habit of bringing their own food and drink with them when traveling. This developed from the fact that among their clan, poisoning is not uncommon. A host should not take offense, as it's not meant to be a slight against them.\nDark Iron dwarves need a lot of rest and they have a hard time sleeping without pillows.\nThe hammer &lt;a href=\"Ironfoe\"&gt;Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, forged by &lt;a href=\"Franclorn%20Forgewright\"&gt;Franclorn Forgewright&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the Dark Irons' most sacred artifacts.\nJust like the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, some Dark Iron dwarves have adopted the values \u200b\u200band philosophy of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, becoming followers and practitioners of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Their Queen, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, joined the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; as a priestess with &lt;a href=\"Betild%20Deepanvil\"&gt;Betild Deepanvil&lt;/a&gt; and other Dark Iron priests.Dark Iron &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; were also present in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, fighting alongside the Alliance. Some of them also joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, notably the Champion of the Light &lt;a href=\"Frida%20Ironbellows\"&gt;Frida Ironbellows&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Anointed%20Disciple\"&gt;Anointed Disciple&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Darkforged%20Crusader\"&gt;Darkforged Crusader&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. The paladin &lt;a href=\"Nella%20Slagheart\"&gt;Nella Slagheart&lt;/a&gt; fought against the Horde soldiers with the order's &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nClans and organizations.\nAdditionally, the &lt;a href=\"skardyn\"&gt;skardyn&lt;/a&gt; are a race of cursed descendants of Dark Iron dwarves from below &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nPhysical appearance.\nDark Iron dwarves easily stand out from the other two clans. They physically resemble Bronzebeard dwarves, but they are less stocky and more dexterous. Their skin is pale white to sickly gray, and their hair and beards are white, black, or orange. Their eyes glow with orange flame - one of many gifts from their fiery master, Ragnaros.\nHistory.\nOnce, long ago, three clans lived in Ironforge peacefully. The Wildhammer faction was drawn to the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain, while Bronzebeard dwarves chose to mine the mountain itself. The Dark Irons became fascinated with the mountains\u2019 depths, where fire and brimstone simmer. Here they discovered dark iron, as well as forged a connection with the magma below. They also gained an unnatural obsession with arcane magic, and many had at least some training in spellcasting. Some say whatever they discovered below eventually corrupted the race.\nDuring the War of the Three Hammers, the Bronzebeards cast out the Wildhammers and Dark Irons. Founding Thaurissan in the Redridge Mountains to the south, the sorcerer-thane built up his armies and unleashed a two-pronged assault; one on Ironforge and one on Grim Batol, intent on ruling all dwarves. Despite overwhelming forces and several near losses, the Bronzebeards beat back Thaurissan\u2019s forces, while the Wildhammers slew Modgud at Grim Batol. After this crushing defeat, Thaurissan withdrew back to his city, and the Wildhammer clan joined the Bronzebeards in marching to finish this war.\nTwo combined armies marched south, intent on destroying Thaurissan once and for all. However, their thane had other ideas. The mad king still believed he could win, and sent out powerful magics, seeking something powerful enough to wipe out both armies. Ruled by fear, Thaurissan didn\u2019t know what he was getting himself into when his spell found something far worse than defeat in the war.\nIn his self-empowering madness, Thaurissan freed Ragnaros the greatest fire elemental ever from his prison who was long ago imprisoned by the titans. His eruption into the world destroyed 80% of the Redridge Mountain range, and nestled in the middle of the devastation rose the great volcano now known as Blackrock Mountain. The Searing Gorge bordered it to the north, while the Burning Steppes, formerly lush and beautiful but now destroyed, formed in the south. Ragnaros\u2019s rebirth killed Thaurissan and destroyed his city. His kin, however, survived, and to this day they live within Blackrock Depths, in servitude to Ragnaros and his elemental minions.\nOther dwarves long thought that the Dark Irons were destroyed when the spell that summoned Ragnaros destroyed much of the range. However, it wasn\u2019t to be. To this day they pay for Thaurissan\u2019s colossal mistake by serving Ragnaros in his armies. Their lives revolve around Ragnaros\u2019s will.\nCulture.\nDark Iron dwarves avoid straight combat, preferring ambushes and ranged assaults. Dark Irons are self-serving, with little of the clan loyalty so dominant in the other two dwarven clans. A Dark Iron willingly flees or betrays his allies in order to save his own life.\nDark Iron dwarves speak Common and Dwarven. Dark Iron dwarves sometimes learn &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; to speak with the creatures around their territory, and their elemental masters teach some of them their ancient language, Kalimag.\nMilitary.\nLike most dwarves, Dark Iron dwarves follow a rigid and militarized organization. Every Dark Iron dwarf soldier is well-trained and well-armed, often with the finest equipment he can afford. However, the years under the dirt, as well as a diabolical outlook on life, change the Dark Irons\u2019 tactics. Skullduggery and backstabbing are just as potent as a good line formation. Even better, in some cases.\nDark Iron dwarves are cunning, and quicker than other dwarves. Whereas a unit of Bronzebeard dwarves would march straight into enemy lines, Dark Iron dwarves prefer setting up ambushes, or sending lightning-fast strikes. Dark Iron dwarves grew comfortable in the shadows over the many years of their exile and enslavement, and are not above petty tricks such as traps and assassination.\nMost Dark Iron dwarves form smaller units than their Bronzebeard cousins, to spread their numbers and allow for flanking and pincer maneuvers. Rogues and assassins mix evenly with warriors and marksmen.\nDark Iron dwarves are also well-versed in arcane magic, more so than any other dwarven race. Due to untold years of living next to molten lava and fire, the Dark Iron clan developed a strong link to flames and fire magic. Fire-aligned elementalists battle alongside elite marksmen and stealthy skulkers, raining death on Blackrock Depths\u2019 enemies. Battles against Dark Iron dwarves are often hellish, taxing both sides as the Dark Iron elementalists grow overzealous.\nDark Iron dwarves are still dwarves and bring heavy firepower to the field. However, as in all elements of Dark Iron warfare, the dwarves prize subterfuge and sneak attacks over direct confrontation. Dark Iron snipers lie in wait for incoming enemies, while dwarven bombardiers place bombs in strategic places. Great siege engines rumble softly, set to ambush tight passes or simply mow over enemies with great disregard. Occasionally Dark Iron tinkers unleash entire payloads of flame and brimstone on opposing forces.\nDark Iron dwarves have unconventional backup as well. Fire elementals, servants of Ragnaros, appear intermittently with dwarven forces. Unlike the dwarves, fire elementals have no care for the art of subtlety. Lava elementals and flamewakers roar through battle, burning anything that gets in their way."}

His character is a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; who is usually portrayed as being one of the silliest of the group. The first appearance of his character in the comics was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/1\"&gt;comic #1 'I'm a good healer'&lt;/a&gt;. \nGigzara.\nGigzara (or Gigz) is the first friend of Keydar's to be seen in the comic. She is a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;. Though the most sensitive of the group, Gigzara is also prone to violent outbursts. Gigzara loves &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;, and if the ingredient's required are not around, she will improvise (kill people/animals and cook them). She can be seen in the early comics usually healing people; however as they continue she eventually starts to participate in other ways. The first appearance of her character in the comics was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/1\"&gt;comic #1 'I'm a good healer'&lt;/a&gt;.\nMijikai.\nMijikai (or Miji) is a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; frequently seen as one of the most impatient members of the group. Its worth noting, Mijikai in Japanese is the word for short (Not height-wise). The first appearance of his character in the comics was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/2\"&gt;comic #2 'Gnomes...'&lt;/a&gt;. \nNarya.\nNarya is a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; who seems to be good friends with Mijikai. He is also married to Nyteblade. The first appearance of his character in the comics was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/3\"&gt;comic #3 'Lag'&lt;/a&gt;.\nNyteblade.\nNyteblade (or Nyte) is the wife of Narya. She is a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;. The first appearance of her character in the comics was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/8\"&gt;comic #8 'lol, oops'&lt;/a&gt;.\nKrom.\nKrom is a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;. Krom is the grumpiest, most serious member of the group. Krom dislikes Keydar. The first appearance of his character in the comics was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/8\"&gt;comic #8 'lol, oops'&lt;/a&gt;.\nDonald.\nDonald is the representation of a &lt;a href=\"noob\"&gt;noob&lt;/a&gt; in Dark Legacy Comics. He always appears in ever more increasingly silly storylines and is by far the stupidest of the group. He is a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and it is implied at first that he is a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, but it's later revealed that he's actually a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;. The first appearance of his character in the comics was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/45\"&gt;comic #45 'Bufs plz'&lt;/a&gt;. \nHorace.\nHorace is an &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; -- to be more precise an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fnpc%3D21660\"&gt;Cabal Abjurist&lt;/a&gt;. Although not a member of the Dark Legacy group, he's nevertheless a character who often appears throughout the comics. Horace is often seen exploited in every possible way by the players until he decides to create the NPC Alliance to counterattack against the players. His first appearance was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/92\"&gt;comic #92 'The Other Guys'&lt;/a&gt;.\nGretta.\nGretta is Horace's wife, an Orc &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fnpc%3D21662\"&gt;Cabal Tomb-Raider&lt;/a&gt;. She appears to immensely love Horace. Her first appearance was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/92\"&gt;comic #92 'The Other Guys'&lt;/a&gt;.\nMax Blackhammer.\nMax appears to be a representation of a &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; and armor repairer, who tries to take at least three gold baths a day. He participated in Horace's NPC rebellion. His first appearance was in &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.darklegacycomics.com/90\"&gt;comic #90 'Profession'&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrivia.\nThe Characters and the original guild are on the US realm . Of all the characters, only Keydar has reached 60 and seems to continue to play. However, he is no longer in the guild Dark Legacy."}

{"id": "12941", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12941", "title": "Dark Pact (Classic)", "text": "Dark Pact is a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; instant ability which transfers mana from your pet to you. This spell is acquired as a talent, requiring 30 points in the Affliction tree.\nNotes.\nThe amount of mana transferred receives 96% of your +spellpower bonus. \nUsing this talent does not stop your mana regeneration, or your pet's, or cancel an &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Shift%20%28imp%20ability%29\"&gt;Phase Shift (imp ability)&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Pact generates &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and tactics.\nThis talent is actually pretty great, as you would expect from something at the top of a talent tree. At one talent point, it is considered a \"must have\" for any Warlock that is deep in the Affliction build, and many Warlocks invest 31 points into the tree primarily for this ability.\nDark Pact allows you to continually steal your pet's mana. It is often used with a &lt;a href=\"Felhunter\"&gt;Felhunter&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%20Talents%23Improved%20Felhunter\"&gt;Improved Felhunter&lt;/a&gt; talent, which usually can regenerate mana faster than you can spend it. Prior to obtaining the felhunter, a phase-shifted imp set to \"passive\" can be used as a mana battery as well. \nWhile Dark Pact contributes significantly in PvP, Raiding and Instances, it may shine best in simple grinding. It effectively results in \"no\" downtime for a Warlock that is grinding for experience or drops. Combined with &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Drain%20Soul\"&gt;Improved Drain Soul&lt;/a&gt; and one of these pets, Dark Pact can see a Warlock cycle through 10-20 equal level non-elite targets \"indefinitely\", very rarely needing to draw on &lt;a href=\"Life%20Tap\"&gt;Life Tap&lt;/a&gt;. Grinding sessions of 1/2 an hour to an hour or more, without need for food/water, are very typical.\nAn interesting application of this is right after dying. The first thing you do (regardless of what pet you actually want) is to summon an imp. You can then steal all his mana, buff yourself up and fill your own mana pool before summoning whatever pet you actually want. It winds up being a faster way of getting back on your feet.\nNotes.\nThis appears to be an alternate version of the Liches' &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Dark%20Ritual\"&gt;Dark Ritual&lt;/a&gt; ability from Warcraft 3:\nBy sacrificing one of his/her minions, the lich or warlock is able to absorb the energies from his/her comrade, replenishing his/her dark magical magical powers."}

The Azeroth side portal is located in what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, while its counterpart is in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on Outland, on the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. Before the destruction of Draenor, it was located in the eastern section of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally created in a joint effort between &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the demonically possessed &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Portal served as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s method of reaching Azeroth and beginning the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, as a way to weaken it for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s eventual invasion. It since served as a link between worlds during the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the united &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in the alternate universe Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The portal appears to be functionally indestructible, as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; were only able to destroy the structure, not the portal itself.\nSince making its debut in \"\", the Dark Portal remains one of the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;'s most recognizable and iconic structures.\nHistory.\nThe first opening.\nThe Dark Portal was created through a joint effort between the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, possessed by the Dark &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as a means to allow the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, under the demonic influence of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, to invade the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Following Medivh's instructions, Gul'dan and &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Warchief Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; had the Horde construct the Draenor side of the gateway on a convergence of &lt;a href=\"ley%20lines\"&gt;ley lines&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern edge of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Once the structure was complete, the orcish stonemasons who built it were betrayed and murdered by warlocks in order to prime its final seal. Gul'dan and Medivh then worked together to tear a rift in the fabric of reality. On Draenor, nearly all of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; prisoners that still lived were brought to the base of the portal. The moment the ritual began, Gul'dan instantly drained all of their life essences, creating the massive spike of power needed to bridge the distance between the two worlds. Meanwhile, Medivh called on his powers as a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; to rip open the Azerothian side of the rift in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the amount of magical power involved, almost every creature attuned to magic on Azeroth felt ripples from the portal's opening, though most couldn't detect where the disturbance came from. Another consequence of the opening was that &lt;a href=\"teleportation\"&gt;teleportation&lt;/a&gt; spells became perturbed by emanations from the region where the portal laid. Blackhand immediately sent scouts from the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt; clans, along with warlock overseers, to establish a camp and build a stone frame around the Azerothian side of the rift in order to stabilize it. The armies of the orcs subsequently began pouring through it into the unsuspecting &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, it served as a passage to untold numbers of orc and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; warriors, reinforcing the Horde's already overflowing ranks. The lands around the Portal that were once dead swamps were being transformed into barren soil the color of blood, which was now teeming with strange, demonic beasts. These &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; were the domain of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, who were entrusted with the keeping of the Portal.\nAt the end of the Second War, following their defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, some Horde forces escaped through the portal back to Draenor before it was secured by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent the orcs from returning, the archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow magi cast a great spell that &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;destroyed the gateway&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth. The resultant blast of arcane energy also caused the Draenor side of the portal to explode. Khadgar then convinced the Alliance &lt;a href=\"High%20Command\"&gt;High Command&lt;/a&gt; to construct &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; to keep watch over its ruins. Unbeknownst to the archmage and the people of Azeroth, however, the link between the worlds remained as an unseen tear in the fabric of reality.\nThe second opening.\nOn the Draenor side of the Portal, the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, Chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, planned to open &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;multiple portals&lt;/a&gt; that would lead the Horde to new, unspoiled worlds to conquer. Powering these portals, however, would require several mystical artifacts from Azeroth: the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. To procure them, the elder shaman reopened the Dark Portal using the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and sent his forces through, to strike quickly and retreat to Draenor once the enchanted objects were obtained.\nDuring that time, the Portal was protected by the entire &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Malgrim%20Stormhand\"&gt;Malgrim Stormhand&lt;/a&gt;, second of the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;, also stayed behind with a dozen warriors. Some more &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s also participated in the gateway's defense. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, convinced that the orcs were actually preparing a new invasion of Azeroth, assembled his most trusted lieutenants, including Khadgar and the paladin &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, to form an &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; through the Portal to put an end to the orcish threat once and for all. But even after the Sons of Lothar managed to push to Draenor, battles still raged for the control of the Azerothian side of the Portal for months, with the two sides repeatedly winning and losing control of it.\nDespite the Alliance counterattack, Ner'zhul finally opened his portals to other worlds, but he did not foresee the terrible price he would pay. The portals' tremendous energies tore Draenor apart. The orc chieftains Grommash Hellscream and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who saw that Ner'zhul's portals would destroy their world, and his insanity would destroy their people\u2014led their clans through the Dark Portal back to the relative safety of Azeroth. The Alliance expeditionary forces, meanwhile, remained on Draenor, agreeing to make the ultimate sacrifice by destroying the Dark Portal from their side in order to prevent that world's destruction from destroying Azeroth as well. There were indications they may have taken one of Ner'zhul's portals to another world, but they in fact managed to survive Draenor's destruction, taking refuge &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;near the portal&lt;/a&gt; in hopes it may yet be opened again.\nThe third opening.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his allies took control of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elf &lt;a href=\"High%20Nethermancer%20Zerevor\"&gt;Zerevor&lt;/a&gt; placed warding spells over the Portal.\nThe Dark Portal remained dormant for twenty years until an artifact of incredible power was found by the demon &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;, a lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Though the exact nature of the artifact is unknown, Kazzak used it to reopen the Dark Portal and cross into the shattered remains of Draenor now known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. In his wake, legions of demons came spilling through into Azeroth. The forces of Nethergarde Keep were quickly rallied, and with aid from the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and numerous &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s the demons were pushed back through the Portal, securing it once more. The adventurers, not satisfied in securing only one side of the Portal, &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;pressed through to Outland&lt;/a&gt; after Kazzak, where they went on to reestablish contact with the lost Alliance expeditionary forces and tame the savage world, defeating many of its demonically corrupted inhabitants before they could threaten Azeroth. Despite continued attempts by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to reassert control over the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the Outland side of the Dark Portal\u2014the gateway was kept open to allow for the free flow of supplies and reinforcements into Outland.\nSome time after the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had taken control of the Outland-side of the portal, an army of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s led by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt; attempted to seize the Stair of Destiny. The defenders successfully fought back the assault, but a stray blast from one of the nether dragons resulted in the temporary closing of the gateway. The &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; was, however, able to open a rift to Azeroth, which was stabilized by magicians of the Alliance and Horde after she and a group of nether dragons left through it. These same magicians were presumably able to then use this rift to restore the Portal to proper working order.\nWith the Dark Portal open but effectively secured on both sides, it would fall from the public consciousness for several years, perceived as nothing more than a historical landmark and arcane curiosity.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; tried to get to the Portal and escape Outland.\nWhile the Alliance and Horde directed their forces to the Black Temple, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his Legion comrades made his return to Quel'Thalas through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, while his armies took a portal in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war against the Lich King, a naga sea witch &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; created a storm in the crater of the Dark Portal to distract its guardians. Fel orc &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt; then stepped to Azeroth through the portal and killed some of the guardians.\nSince the Cataclysm, a fragile Alliance between &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt; was forged, even if neither side trusted one another in order to continue guarding the portal. Other than that, both sides would keep fighting against the demons coming through the Dark Portal and those surrounding it.\nThe Dark Portal valley seemed abandoned when the \"&lt;a href=\"Cloudkicker\"&gt;Cloudkicker&lt;/a&gt;\" arrived with &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and her companions. Upon landing, they found their allies from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in the tents, &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw%20clan\"&gt;Woodpaw clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Jaggal\"&gt;Jaggal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sivet\"&gt;Sivet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;same-named leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and her three cubs, &lt;a href=\"Wuul%20Breezerider\"&gt;Wuul Breezerider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elmarine\"&gt;Elmarine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shagtusk\"&gt;Shagtusk&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reuniting with everyone and recapitulating the plan, the army entered Outland to attack the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe portal preempted.\nThis perception changed dramatically when powerful magic was used to redirect Azeroth's Dark Portal\u2014not to another place, but to another time. The escaped Horde Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, having traveled across space and time to an alternate version of Draenor's past with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, changed the parallel universe's course of events to prevent the demonic &lt;a href=\"blood%20pact\"&gt;blood pact&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately led to the original opening of the Portal. Manipulating his people to suit his own ends, Garrosh instead orchestrated the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, an uncorrupted\u2014and seemingly unstoppable\u2014orcish war machine under the command of . In Garrosh's , it was this Horde that constructed the Stair of Destiny, enslaving the members of the Shadow Council to power it. Finally, using the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, the very artifact with which he and Kairozdormu had arrived in the alternate timeline, Garrosh linked the Stair of Destiny from the past of his parallel universe to the present of ours, turning the Portal a bloody shade of red and initiating the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;Iron Horde Incursion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s once again stormed the Dark Portal, but not before Nethergarde Keep and its Horde counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Okril%27lon%20Hold\"&gt;Okril'lon Hold&lt;/a&gt;, fell to the invading forces. Scrambling to regain lost ground but nevertheless better prepared than their predecessors, these heroes, led by none other than Dark Portal veteran &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance hero &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and the former Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; fought the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; back through the gateway and into the alternate Draenor. After confronting the orc leadership\u2014the \"Warlords of Draenor\"\u2014Khadgar and his companions used the Iron Horde's own advanced weaponry to destroy the Stair of Destiny once again, ending the immediate threat it presented to Azeroth. Unlike the last time, however, an older, wiser Khadgar had not trapped himself in Draenor: The Alliance and Horde quickly established fortified bases on the island of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, where they conjured portals to Azeroth to allow for free passage to and from their homeworld. Meanwhile, skilled mages in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; reestablished contact with Outland's &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; using portals of their own, circumnavigating the newly severed connection between Azeroth and modern Outland.\nAzeroth's Dark Portal has currently been redirected to convey troops and supplies to the fortresses of &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; on Ashran. Given this security, it remains largely unattended, a silent monument to its own violent legacy. The path out of the Portal crater was widened extensively by the invaders, and the ramp of the portal, already grooved from the march of the orcs and their equipment from previous wars, has now borne the full brunt of much larger and heavier war machines in great numbers. The lower portion of the ramp especially has taken extensive damage, appearing battered and frail as if ready to break apart.\nAt an unknown point after the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the connection between Draenor and Azeroth closed.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWhen \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" launched, the Dark Portal was a noticeable (but unusable) feature in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, located southeast of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The Portal is located in the southeastern corner of the Blasted Lands and (until &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.1\"&gt;patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;) was surrounded by elite demons and servants of the named demons, and the glow around the Portal's gateway was blue, indicating its inactivity. When a player walked through the gate they merely passed through to the back of the gate as if nothing was there - the portal was merely for show in game. At the time, the portal was considered to be decorative only, a piece of \"Warcraft\" lore to look at. The Portal on the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; side appears to be rather simple - the only decoration on it being the two \"guardians\" on either side of the gateway and the coiled snake-head above it.\nWith the announcement of \"\", it was revealed that the Dark Portal would be reopened and be the primary means of traveling to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. In preparation for the expansion, Blizzard released &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.1\"&gt;patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, \"Before the Storm\", which prepared the original areas of the world for the impending expansion. In addition to the changes to the map, the addition of new NPCs and the new means of transportation to the new races' capitals, the demons and demon-slaves were removed from around the Dark Portal and the crater it rests in and replaced with what appears to be a base camp of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, either helping those going in, or keeping something from coming out. The glow around the gateway turned green, indicating that the Portal is open.\nThe usually quiet portal temporarily became a hub of server activity when a quest (&lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Breach%20%28Blasted%20Lands%29\"&gt;Into the Breach (Blasted Lands)&lt;/a&gt;) associated with the &lt;a href=\"World%20Event\"&gt;World Event&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;The Dark Portal Opens&lt;/a&gt;\" took place there.\nGoing through the Portal, like accessing the blood elf and draenei starting areas, once required the \"\" expansion pack to be installed; since &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2\"&gt;patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt;, this content is included with all paid accounts. Prior to this, when a player tried to enter the Dark Portal without having that expansion pack installed, the player would simply pass through to the rear side and get a notification reading \"Burning Crusade Expansion Pack Required\". A player used to need to have a character of level 58 or higher, but this is no longer a requirement. If the Expansion Pack was installed, but the character is under level 58, the player used to get \"Must be Level 58\", but now players are able to access the region at any level. The 'Travel hubs' section below includes directions for reaching the Dark Portal before level 58.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; for information about the other side of the portal.\nReopening.\nThe final patch before the release of \"\" (&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.3\"&gt;2.0.3&lt;/a&gt;) included a &lt;a href=\"world%20event\"&gt;world event&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal%20Opens\"&gt;reopening of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Invading &lt;a href=\"Felguard\"&gt;Felguard&lt;/a&gt;s and invading &lt;a href=\"Voidwalker\"&gt;Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s began to pour through the dark portal, and the camps in front of the portal were manned by &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; defenders. The leader of these forces offered the quest &lt;a href=\"Into%20the%20Breach%20%28Blasted%20Lands%29\"&gt;Into the Breach&lt;/a&gt;. This quest simply involved killing six of the invading Felguards (due to number of people fighting for these kills.) Completing the quest earned you the , a special version of the . When used, the Tabard produced a visual effect similar to &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt;, and the wearer would flex.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; also vanished from his former place in the Blasted Lands to take up his new residence in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. His vacated office was taken up by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;. Not content to sit in a hole in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;, Highlord Kruul would periodically lay siege to major cities and other areas, summoning demon minions and killing everybody in sight until driven off.\nTravel hubs.\nTo reach the Dark Portal, Alliance players can fly or ride to &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, while Horde players can travel to &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;. From either base, players may then ride down the main road down to the Portal crater.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, there are portals to the Dark Portal from near the portal trainers in major cities (e.g.: the Mage Tower in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the mage trainer area in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, the Pools of Vision in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;). These portals require level 58 to use and will deposit the player into a crack in the crater in front of the portal. Alliance and Horde portals all drop players in the same location; though players will be &lt;a href=\"Honorless%20Target\"&gt;Honorless Target&lt;/a&gt;s for thirty seconds following their arrival in the Blasted Lands, players on PvP servers will not be completely safe from combat until they reach the Stair of Destiny on the Outland side of the portal.\nPhysical appearance.\nEvery time the rift between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; has been widened, it has been seen to have a large, stone-carved facade that lends it a well-defined rectangular shape. This frame serves to stabilize the rift, allowing it to stay open for extended periods. On both ends of the connection, destruction of the Portal's frame has proven to render it impassable until it can be reopened by a being of suitable magical ability.\nThe first portal.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; first opened the original Dark Portal, it consisted only of a magical rift. The stone frame was built by the first orcs who came through it from Draenor. By the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, it was described as a fifty-foot tall portal encircled by a ring of towering obsidian stones. The first portal's frame was set atop a small flight of steps and featured large, curved horns as well as carvings of curved runes and rather angry-looking skulls. It was destroyed at the conclusion of the Second War by archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian%20%28interlude%29\"&gt;Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt; flashback cutscene in \"Warcraft III\", the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; dungeon in \"The Burning Crusade\", and card artwork in the \"&lt;a href=\"Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\" depict the portal as having already had a stone framework around it when first opened by Medivh. However, as of the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Chronicle%20Volume%202\"&gt;Chronicle Volume 2&lt;/a&gt;\" and its account of the portal's creation, these depictions are canonically inaccurate.\nThe second portal.\nThe Portal was later reconstructed when the orc chieftain &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, in search of powerful enchanted artifacts with which to open yet more portals, reopened the rift from Draenor and sent his forces back to Azeroth. As had been done with the first portal, the Horde built a physical frame around the rift, creating a new Dark Portal that could remain open permanently without needing a constant influx of power. This second version, flanked by carvings of large, hooded figures wielding swords and crowned with a stone serpent baring its fangs as if petrified mid-strike, is the one known to most modern adventurers; it stands to this day within the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the second Portal's frame has changed little in the years since it appeared, the rift it contains has changed color multiple times. Both before and after the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%23Destruction%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Destruction of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, during which Khadgar severed the connection between Azeroth's Dark Portal and its &lt;a href=\"The%20Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;sibling&lt;/a&gt; on the Draenor side, the rift appeared blue. Many years later, its hue shifted to a green color when the demon &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; used an unknown artifact to restore this connection and pass through to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, it took on a shade of crimson red when its connection to modern Outland was preempted by &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;powerful magic&lt;/a&gt; that instead linked it to a .\nCompared to the Stair of Destiny.\nIt is interesting to note that as imposing as the Dark Portal is, it is significantly smaller and less ornate than its counterpart, the Stair of Destiny. It's unknown what the potential ramifications of this size discrepancy are, though it might be this way for gameplay reasons as the Azeroth portal was implemented in Vanilla and looks like how it did in ', while the Outland one was implemented in '.\nBoth versions of the Stair of Destiny featured larger, more detailed versions of the hooded guardians that adorn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth's&lt;/a&gt; Dark Portal, and replaced the upper image of a striking serpent with full, intricate carvings of a dragon's head and two claws. They were further embellished with all manner of runes and stonework on the front, side, and even rear faces, in contrast with the relative plainness of the Azeroth Portal. While Outland's version of the Stair is by no means pristine, with large chunks of stone and other features likely knocked off the structure during the cataclysmic events of &lt;a href=\"Draenor%23Destruction%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Draenor's destruction&lt;/a&gt;, the alternate Draenor's newly constructed version of the Stair lies in ruins following the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;counterattack&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;Iron Horde Incursion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf all the various incarnations of the Dark Portal, whether in Azeroth, Draenor, or Outland, the only one to ever be seen under construction is the alternate Draenor's Stair of Destiny.\nKnown discrepancies.\nThere are a few instances in which the appearances of the first and second Dark Portals were unintentionally switched:\nSpeculation.\nSince lorewise the Dark Portal is no longer connected to the alternate Draenor during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; was last seen on Azeroth walking towards the Blasted Lands before appearing in Outland's Nagrand, it is likely that the Dark Portal has been reconnected to the Dark Portal in the Stair of Destiny in Hellfire Peninsula."}

Its name comes from the main-universe &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. It was used by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to conquer the world Garrosh had escaped from. The power source for the portal were the captured (who very likely had wanted to use it for invading different world), &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; and .\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion force was pushed from Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; led the united &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; vanguard in the counter attack, eventually freeing the three &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, disabling the portal and crashing down the structure with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Worldbreaker\"&gt;Iron Worldbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Gul'dan took over the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, he had the portal's ruins checked by his &lt;a href=\"warlocks\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs also sent their workers and supplies to the site.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Magril%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Magril the Seer&lt;/a&gt; the area still contained a portion of its power. This probably led to the opening of another portal in front of the Dark Portal's ruined stairs - the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; - from which &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; arrived. At the site of the two portals Khadgar, heroes of Azeroth and Draenor attacked and defeated the demon lord.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the two timelines were linked by his shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;. While not directly specified to be the case, it is very likely that Garrosh used the shard to link the Dark Portal in the alternate universe to that of the main one in order to invade Azeroth."}

{"id": "273017", "revid": "34702620", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=273017", "title": "Dark Ranger (Warcraft III)", "text": "A cunning Hero, adept at manipulating opponents. Forcibly raised from the dead, the former &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; enjoy nothing more than sowing dissension and hatred within the enemy ranks. Attacks land and air units.\nHero names.\n&lt;a href=\"Anya%20Eversong\"&gt;Anya Eversong&lt;/a&gt;, Nara Pathstrider, Anthis Sunbow, &lt;a href=\"Clea%20Deathstrider\"&gt;Clea Deathstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyndia%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Cyndia Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt;, Mira Shadewither, Amora Eagleye, Siren Ghostsong, and Somand Wayfinder.\nInformation.\nThe Dark Ranger is an interesting Hero as she can perform many roles for the player. Outside of the staff of silence (which is rarely seen in many matches), she is generally the only unit who can prevent spellcasters from supporting their allies. She's often the third Hero for professional Undead players if a Tavern is available, since her silencing capability can easily change the tide of a battle and her Dark Minions make excellent fodder for the Death Knight's Death Pact and the Lich's Dark Ritual.\nSilence generally takes second priority over the first spell given to her, due to a lack of enemy spellcasters early-game. Increasing Silence's potency increases both the duration and AoE of her spell, allowing her to take down more spellcasters. \nBlack Arrows allow works similarly to the Priestess of the Moon's Searing Arrows, though any targets she kills with them also generates a dark minion (skeleton warrior) if they were killed under the effects of the arrow. The minion is considerably weaker than a raised &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Warrior%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and is generally not recommended for Undead players to start with this skill first.\nLife Drain is essentially the same as the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Mage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blood Mage&lt;/a&gt;'s Mana Siphon. It's generally recommended to invest into this skill first if she is your starting Hero, because it allows her to handle stronger creep camps early in the game. If she's your second or third Hero, it's better to invest into Black Arrows instead.\nCharm is perhaps one of her best skills - she can essentially bring any unit into the player's fray. While this doesn't work as well on creeps (since all the good creeps are level 7 and higher), she can reduce the enemy army slightly by stealing one of their more powerful units like &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, she can also work much like a permanent &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; by stealing an enemy worker and accessing their tech tree - though such opportunities are rare and generally ill-advised.\nThe Dark Ranger is classified as an Undead hero so a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; can help heal her if necessary.\nSpells and abilities.\nSilnce.\nSilence is an awesome anti-magic spell. It's great on enemy Heroes to prevent them from using their special abilities. However, be reminded that the Silence ability will last a shorter duration on enemy Heroes than their units due to Hero Resistance.\nIf you see a large pack of spellcasters use Silence on them rather than an enemy Hero. If you can get both, that is even better!\nDispel or use an Anti-Magic shell with a unit that isn't caught in Silence's radius.\nlack Arrow.\nNotes: Only units that create corpses can spawn Dark Minions.\nThis adds a passive \"Claws of Attack\"-style bonus onto the Dark Ranger, much like the Searing Arrows from the Priestess of the Moon. In small battles you should conserve the mana and only use when a creep is about to die. Mark down ground targets who are being attacked by the Dark Ranger so they die faster and generate a dark minion to quickly overwhelm the enemy. In more hectic battles the extra damage adds nicely over time. Note that ground targets killed under Black Arrows' effects won't leave a corpse behind.\nRemember that in order to get the Minion, the target needs to get hit by the arrow and killed within 3 seconds to generate the minion. Attacking every enemy on the field and then waiting for them to die will not work.\nLife rain.\nThis is useful for healing your Dark Ranger.\nThe ability will keep draining hit points until the target is at a distance of 80.\nIf your Dark Ranger is at full health when you use this skill, you aren\u2019t getting good use out of it. Let the Dark Ranger take some damage while creeping and then heal her with Life Drain. That extra tanking could help your other units survive the crucial early battles.\nThis spell is a \"leash\" spell must be maintained to get the full effect. If the enemy passes out of range or the Dark Ranger is hit with a disable, the spell will end prematurely. "}

She could be found in all four wings of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. \nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Velonara was present in &lt;a href=\"Axefall\"&gt;Axefall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, dealing with the poisoned troll named &lt;a href=\"Lunzul\"&gt;Lunzul&lt;/a&gt;.

She then joins the Garrison as a follower.\nLegion.\nAfter the disastrous battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Velonara was present at &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral ceremony, accompanying Lady Sylvanas. She defended her when &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were revealed among the crowd by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, she appeared at the &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; to represent the dark rangers in the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, the union of all hunters on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Hunter%20Moorgoth\"&gt;Death Hunter Moorgoth&lt;/a&gt; admitted to having a crush on Velonara and asked the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; to speak with her on his behalf.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Velonara participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horde controls Darkshore, Velonara is stationed at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. She enlisted Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s with striking against the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to take control of the elemental breaches within Darkshore as the Horde and Alliance were focused on one another.\nDuring the annual ritual remembering the losses of the blood elves to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, a vision of the living Ranger Velonara can be seen fighting alongside her Farstrider comrades against the Scourge led by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; near the gate of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; as part of the recreation of the past when Quel'Thalas fell. She was the last to fall before Arthas proceeded further into the elven home.\nIn the aftermath of Sylvanas's betrayal of the Horde, the death of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the Horde agreed that the position of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; was not needed in times of peace. As such, instead of a singular dictator, the Horde would be led by a conglomerate of leaders who would represent their people's interests known as the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;. Following the council's formation, Velonara came to reside near the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; district of the city. Though once fiercely loyal to Sylvanas, Velonara declared that her people were the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; and Forsaken and that she stood with them and the Horde. She also revealed that while some of her fellow dark rangers &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;sided&lt;/a&gt; with Sylvanas, many others have remained with the Horde.\nShadowlands.\nSometime later she joined the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in mustering in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as they sought to reclaim as much as they could of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Declaring that her first duty was the safety of the Forsaken, Velonara directed &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, with eradicating the blighted undead attacking &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;. With this task done, Velonara alongside other influential figures that had risen to prominence among the Forsaken, joined &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; in a meeting to determine their next of course of action. \nWhile &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; wanted to directly focus on dealing with the plague in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; questioned what they should do about Calia, only for Velonara to declare that they should focus on the blight. She then turned to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; and questioned if he had more plague eaters, only for him to reveal to Calia and the others that he only had one left, and that while he could make more for them to be effective, they must be formulated to survive the plague. This in turn inspired Calia to point out that they might be able to turn to the plague-lords of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; for insight. When Faranell revealed that he required an undiluted sample of the plague from deep within its reaches, Calia vowed to acquire it for him, but both Faranell and Belmont were skeptical of her being able to acquire it and survive. Calia then called upon the light and with the champion by her side, she ventured into the plague and successfully acquired the plague sample, which greatly surprised Belmont. With the sample in their possession, Calia, Voss, the champion, and the plague eater went to Maldraxxus.\nIn time they returned with the empowered plague eater, where Calia informed Faranell of how the blight sample became a living manifestation, to which Faranell was quick to declare it ingenious, as it would be easier to kill. This plan was ultimately successful as the plague manifested as an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam\"&gt;Amalgam&lt;/a&gt; and was slain, liberating the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from the plague. Following this, Voss declared that the Forsaken have many points of view and should be led by a council, not a single ruler, a motion accepted by the other Forsaken leaders, with Velonara declaring that she and her fellow dark rangers stood with Voss. Thus a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; composed of Voss, Calia, Belmont, Faranell, and Velonara was created to lead the Forsaken. In the aftermath Velonara reflected that for years the dark rangers had worked as agents for &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, but now with the Desolate Council they serve a greater cause: shaping their people's future. Though knowing that they couldn't be certain of what lied ahead, she vowed that the dark rangers would do everything in their power to defend this kingdom.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Forsythe\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Forsythe&lt;/a&gt; seized control of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, they used it as a staging ground to strike against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Velonara and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; subsequently traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; for their plan of counterattack, where they found themselves joined by Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. While Faranell sent them to gather ingredients for a concoction for the war effort, Velonara, vowing to not let the crusade imitate their people in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, sent them to destroy slanderous propaganda. After Faranell's concoction was used to weaken the defenses on the isle, Velonara called in the full force of the Forsaken and took part in the subsequent assault. In the aftermath, Velonara returned to the Ruins of Lordaeron, where she and the other members of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; declared the champion represented what it meant to be Forsaken.\nQuests.\nOnce the inn is built, she is involved in the following quests:\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nOur quivers must remain full.

{"id": "191801", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=191801", "title": "Dark Riders", "text": "The Dark Riders (also called the Black Riders) were once a group of traveling merchants who crossed the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who cursed them to an eternity of hunting &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s for him. They were led by &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt; and are a major cause of danger in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;. They are infamous for being a merciless group of relic hunters. They are the focus of the graphic novel \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBackground.\nThe Dark Riders were charlatan merchants who tried to sell fraudulent magical artifacts to &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh, being possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, cursed the merchants to forever pay for their dishonesty by collecting true &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al artifacts from all over the kingdom for Medivh, and bringing them back to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. It is not known exactly what curse Medivh placed on them, or if they are undead or not, but the Dark Riders have haunted the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and especially &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, ever since.\nNo physical description is provided, but the Riders are described as speaking in a shrieking voice \"both harsh and shrill\". One of them used a small gem to communicate with someone referred to as the \"Lord\" from whom the Riders took directions. In their quest, some of the artifacts the Dark Riders obtained over the years were the vampiric sword &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and the scythe &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Riders first appear at the &lt;a href=\"Yorgen%20Farmstead\"&gt;Yorgen Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;, apparently drawn by the time/space warping caused by the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; had previously unearthed and lost again inside &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;. They murdered &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt;'s wife and children after determining that they did not know where the Scythe was located. Jitters remained hidden while witnessing these events, and later recorded them.\nThe Dark Riders are mentioned as being allies of the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt;, though no details are given as to the nature of this alliance.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Riders learned about the holy artifact &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, used by kindhearted &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to heal the sick and protect the innocent in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. When Ariden and his riders managed to find the staff and tried to touch it, a wave of pure holy energy erupted from the weapon and sent them slinking back to Karazhan. It was one of the few artifacts they would ever willingly abandon, and perhaps the only one.\nDark Riders.\nA group of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; led by their commander &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt; attacked the riders in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and received some of their stolen items. When Revil Kost used an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Cloak of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, he was able to see a Dark Rider's face. It was the face of a terrified man.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Dark Riders, stole the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt; brought it back to Duskwood, in order to give it to a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; adventurer. The druid, as well as a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; seeking artifacts of their own &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt;, met with Revil Kost at &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; and pursued Ariden to the Riders' base in the catacombs beneath Karazhan. Together with Revil, Ariden was slain and the adventurers retrieved the Scythe of Elune, Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester, and Apocalypse. Revil promised to return the remainder of the Riders' stolen items to their rightful owners. Revil, however, feared that the riders will regroup once again.\nIn the RPG.\nSome rumors say that the dark riders may have originated from, or at one time taken up residence in, &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; as well. Dark riders are huge beings that suddenly appear with &lt;a href=\"Hell%20hound\"&gt;hellhounds&lt;/a&gt; at their feet to run down frantic travelers. Some nights they skirt the perimeter of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, howling loudly.\nInspiration.\nThey seem to be almost identical to the from the \"\" trilogy of books. Both are dark minions referred to as \"Black Riders\" or \"Dark Riders\", speak harshly and shrilly, have the power to communicate with an immaterial being designated \"the Lord\" (the Warcraft Black Riders' usage of a \"bauble\" to communicate with their master is also likely a reference to the stones used in Lord of the Rings), and seek a specific ancient cursed \"tool\" of great power (&lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and respectively) with which they have an intrinsic bond and had been previously discovered in a cave by a supposedly insignificant male character who knew nothing of the artifact's true properties (&lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt;, )."}

After Garrosh began building his new &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;base of power&lt;/a&gt; beneath Orgrimmar, most of the Ragefire Dark Shaman swore allegiance to his cause, and began training Kor'kron shamans in the art of dark shamanism.\nContext.\nThe Dark Shaman are summoning and enslaving beasts from the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding with &lt;a href=\"hell%20hound\"&gt;hell hound&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"lava%20worm\"&gt;lava worm&lt;/a&gt;s, sustaining them with &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt; flesh.

It is further revealed that the dark shaman were always working in secret under Garrosh's orders but when &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Bagran\"&gt;Commander Bagran&lt;/a&gt; discovered them, Garrosh ordered him to kill them all to hide the truth.\nTwo of them appear as &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;."}

But when a Bloodsail pirate ship crashed onto the hozen village of Unga Ingoo, the hozen suddenly found themselves supplied with cannons, potent jungle punch, pirate hats, and worse: ideas. Now pirate hozen are ravaging the local villages, stealing everything that isn\u2019t nailed down. Brewmaster Bo has had enough! He\u2019s looking for adventurers to help him storm the scurvy shores of Unga Ingoo, defeat the nefarious Captain Ook, and steal some hozen brew for a change!\"\nScenario denizens.\nThe scenario takes place on &lt;a href=\"Unga%20Ingoo\"&gt;Unga Ingoo&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby isles, which are located at the southern tip of the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage guide.\nStage 1: Escort Brewmaster Bo.\nBrewmaster Bo arrives, along with the players, at the southern end of the isle and must be escorted to the cauldron in the middle of the Unga village. On the way, you will encounter two hozen gladiators by the names of &lt;a href=\"Gagoon\"&gt;Gagoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oku-Oku\"&gt;Oku-Oku&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 2: Fill the Brewing Cauldron.\nAs Brewmaster Bo starts working on his brew, he needs to be defended and be supplied 200 units of brew. One player should remain behind and use the cannons and bombs on the beach to defend him, while the other two scour the island for brew. While small quantities of brew is found all over the island, there are four locations - the northwestern island, the southwestern ship, the northeastern cave and the southeastern cliff - where you can get large quantities of brew. Each of these location does either have a named mob, a small mini-game (Unstable Keg), a large quantity of hozen or a few hozen that are running around with beer. These four locations are there every time, but what mob or event spawns in which location is completely random. The following mobs and/or events can be encountered:\nFinal Stage: Defeat Captain Ook.\nIn the final phase, Brewmaster Bo has completed the brew and fallen asleep from all the hard work. However, the battle is not yet over as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Ook\"&gt;Captain Ook&lt;/a&gt; appears on his giant banana boat. When he is defeated, more citizens of Marista appear to partake in the victory celebration. Brewmaster Bo also presents his finalized brew, called Unga Jungle-Brew, which turns the player into a hozen pirate for five minutes when used.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It becomes more powerful with each thought it consumes, but is incapable of ever sating its hunger. Its unknowing victims lose all desire for wealth and instead become compelled to start giving away everything they own until they are completely penniless. The Uninvited can pass through walls and can only be seen under the light of a full moon, in which it appears as a vortex of shadow with black voids for its eyes and mouth. The only way for a goblin to protect themselves and their fortune from the creature is to throw discs called &lt;a href=\"tossaway\"&gt;tossaway&lt;/a&gt;s behind them, since the monster always stops to count coins that are dropped on the ground. Even the bravest goblins fear a visit from the Uninvited.\nHistory.\nThe first known victim of the Uninvited was the &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Klaxz%20Boompowder\"&gt;Klaxz Boompowder&lt;/a&gt;, who attracted the creature's attention during the funeral of his rival &lt;a href=\"Rikter%20Hogsnozzle\"&gt;Rikter Hogsnozzle&lt;/a&gt;. Klaxz went to the event looking as wealthy as he could and included a &lt;a href=\"Galleon%20%28coin%29\"&gt;galleon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a long-lost and now priceless type of coin\u2014among his burial gifts, impressing the other funeral goers and making him the center of attention at the subsequent party. Unbeknownst to the others, the galleon he gifted was a worthless fake since he didn't want to part with the real deal. This display of unbridled greed yielded a breach in etiquette so great that it offended the dead and extended an irrevocable invitation to the creature that would later become known as the Uninvited Guest. It watched the party from the shadows, sensing the true nature of the funeral goers, and subsequently followed Klaxz home.\nAs the prince slept, the Uninvited hovered next to him and began feeding on his thoughts. Over the following days, Klaxz started acting strange by forgiving debts, offering discounts, giving away his and his wife &lt;a href=\"Slixi%20Boompowder\"&gt;Slixi&lt;/a&gt;'s valuables, and even refusing to eat, all while the Uninvited writhed around and inside him, consuming his thoughts of wealth before he was even conscious of having them. Klaxz himself never noticed anything strange other than an occasional brief tugging in his belly. Slixi suspected another trade prince had arranged for a spell to be put on her husband and sent the &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bang\"&gt;Bang&lt;/a&gt; on a fact-finding mission. In the meantime, she buried her husband's stash of real galleons in the woods to prevent him from giving them away. Bang returned with nothing but tales of poisonings, hexes, and old legends about otherworldly creatures that preyed on unsuspecting victims. One aging &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; told a tale about an \"invisible evil\" that fed on the souls of the living and left them mad, and which could only be seen under a full moon.\nOver the following days, Klaxz's affliction worsened, culminating in giving away his and Slixi's now completely empty house. After confronting her husband for the last time, Slixi returned to the house and felt an icy sensation moving up her neck. Realizing that the Uninvited was still there and still hungry, she fled into the moonlit woods to dig up the galleons, now the last thing she owned. As she ran with the coins, she tripped and dropped them, only to subsequently notice that her invisible pursuer was lining them up and counting them. She collected the closest galleons and backed away past a patch of moonlight until she felt pinpricks moving up her spine and she realized her mistake. She tossed the last galleons behind her and caught a glimpse of the Uninvited in the moonlight before running away. She managed to escape, possibly because she no longer had anything the Uninvited could feed on\u2014neither money nor an ounce of greed.\nSlixi subsequently invented &lt;a href=\"tossaway\"&gt;tossaway&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014painted-gold coins identical to galleons\u2014and as the tale of Klaxz's fate spread, everyone who heard it rushed to the market to buy Slixi's invention. The Uninvited Guest roams &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to this day, and all smart goblins know to throw a few tossaways behind them if they meet a penniless goblin in order to avoid becoming the creature's next victim."}

You can only have one copy of a unique item in all of your inventory, including what you have in the &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;. If you have an opportunity to acquire another of the same item then you will be unable to. For example, if a mob drops the same item that you already possess, you won't be able to loot the item. If the mob is skinnable this will also prevent you from skinning the mob.\nThis can be particularly troublesome with unique &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt; items since you want to have over a dozen bags total preferably. If you are upgrading a bag, and have a choice of upgrading a unique or a non-unique with the same number of slots, replacing the unique bag gives you one less potential problem. \nIt is possible to have someone mail you a second identical item but you will be unable to retrieve it from your mail until you get rid of your previous unique item since you will be unable to collect another identical item. The mail \"trick\" simply gives another person control of the unique so you can't use it.\nTo remove a unique item from your mailbox, if you already possess one in your inventory, you must sell the item in your possession to a vendor and then remove the second unique item from the mailbox. You then dispose of it appropriately (such as mailing to another character) and use the \"buyback\" feature to return the original item to your inventory.\nA handful of items are \"Unique (X)\", where you can only have X copies of that item between your inventory and bank. For example, if you have five of an item with the \"Unique (5)\" property, you cannot loot or otherwise acquire any more of them.\nUnique-equipped.\nIf an item says it is unique-equipped, it means that you can have only one of those items equipped at any one time. You can have as many as you see fit in your inventory, but only one actually equipped to one of your slots. Some particular items (namely &lt;a href=\"%23Jewelcrafter-only_designs\"&gt;Jewelcrafting-specific gems&lt;/a&gt;) permit a specific number (greater than one) to be active at one time.\nThis is mostly to prevent overpowering of characters with powerful gems, but still allows them to craft and sell them to others even when they already have one. It is also used on rings and trinkets, especially ones, to prevent you from equipping two of them while still allowing you to loot more than one, presumably to sell or &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchant&lt;/a&gt;."}

From their corpses take the Amulet of Grol, the Amulet of Sevine, and the Amulet of Allistarj.\nRemember to USE your Enchanted Azsharite Fel Weaponry to weaken the triad. They cannot be killed otherwise - but use them wisely...\nDescription.\nTo reach the Defiler, you must first destroy the triad of power and recover the amulet pieces. When you recover all three pieces, return to me and I shall give you further instruction.\nGo &lt;name&gt;! To the Blasted Lands! Sevine, Allistarj, and Grol must fall! \nProgress.\nThe three shall form the one, the one shall light the way.\nCompletion.\nThe amulet of Razelikh the Defiler is once again complete but he senses the disruption in his chain of command. He knows you come for him...\nNotes.\nIn order to defeat Allistarj, Grol, and Sevine, you MUST use your Azsharite weapon, or (see below) the Fel Salve.\nUsing the weapon (or salve) significantly reduces the abilities of the target, and enables you to actually defeat the mobs. Without it, you will be unable to reduce the mob past 1%. Equipping the weapon gives a 30 second cooldown to the on use ability, so equip it before combat. The three targets are no longer immune to magic, so go nuts.\nNote that the ability does wear off after ~15 seconds or so, and will need to be reapplied.\nIf you lose your Azsharite weapon.\nIf you've thrown out (or forgotten) your Azsharite weapon, you can talk to the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Hero%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Fallen Hero of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; and he'll give you a &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Salve\"&gt;Fel Salve&lt;/a&gt; which has the same on-use ability as the weapon.\nAllistarj tactics.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Allistarj\"&gt;Archmage Allistarj&lt;/a&gt; does not have a lot of health (he's a squishy, after all). However, despite being a caster, he can easily kill a player with melee damage.\nArchmage Allistarj is found in the left branch of the cave just south of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The giant Felboar Kirith is in the right branch of the same cave (from an earlier quest in this chain).\nSevine tactics.\nArguably the toughest of the three minions, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sevine\"&gt;Lady Sevine&lt;/a&gt; does major damage with warlock spells, but more importantly will summon multiple &lt;a href=\"Infernal\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt;s, if given the opportunity. However, it appears that the Felcurse effect will interrupt the summons. Without the Infernals, she is much less formidable.\nLady Sevine is found overlooking the Blasted Lands from the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms%20%28Blasted%20Lands%29\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrol tactics.\n&lt;a href=\"Grol%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Grol the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; is a straight-up fury-type Ogre warrior. Lots of health, lots of crits, no magic to speak of. The Felcurse (from the weapon or salve) makes him noticeably smaller for the duration. One presumes that it takes off some of his Attack Power along with hit points, et cetera. It is recommended that you clear the area before fighting him, as he can send you\nflying into other mobs.\nGrol the Destroyer is found in &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where the Servants of Grol were found in an earlier part of the quest."}

Sitting just off &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the square celebrates the unity of the kingdom's four ruling houses: &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;. At its center stands a large statue and memorial to &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the late Lord Admiral of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, constructed following his death at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. The square and its surrounding spaces serves as a major meeting place in the city, as well as a location for important ceremonies and addresses.\nLayout.\nUnity Square is mainly divided into two sections, consisting of a main square closer to &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and a smaller plateau overlooking the bay of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;. Smaller, adjacent overlooks also connect to the main sections. Paths from the square lead to the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Academy\"&gt;Proudmoore Academy&lt;/a&gt;, Proudmoore Keep, and &lt;a href=\"Upton%20Borough\"&gt;Upton Borough&lt;/a&gt; in the west, north, and northeast respectively.\nHistory.\nAfter Kul Tiras's &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar%23Admiral%27s%20Fall\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a large statue of the fallen Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was installed in the center of the main plaza. Memorials to this great loss were held annually, with the ruling houses of Kul Tiras traditionally attending. This service was presided over by Daelin's widow and successor, Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Katherine Proudmoore would hold a public address in the southern plateau of Unity Square, in which she announced her intention to step down as Lord Admiral in favor of Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. The event was quickly interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Guard\"&gt;Proudmoore Guard&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;emissary&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who brought evidence of an Ashvane plot against &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and Kul Tiras. In response, Lady Ashvane detonated a sack of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; to cover her escape, while fighting erupted throughout the square between her forces and those of the city guard. Smoke-producing devices were also used to cause chaos in the square. However, launched prematurely, the attempted coup was eventually crushed, and Lord Admiral Katherine survived. Ashvane herself escaped the city, and would continue to wage war against House Proudmoore in what became the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater in the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; would be &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; directly by &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; forces, who breached the city walls. The outer square saw a battle between &lt;a href=\"Hadal%20Darkfathom\"&gt;Hadal Darkfathom&lt;/a&gt; and Proudmoore loyalists, with the &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt; ultimately being killed. The southern plateau of Unity Square was heavily damaged in the fighting, with much of it collapsing into the nearby waters. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces would push through this damage to reach and slay the beast known as &lt;a href=\"Viq%27Goth\"&gt;Viq'Goth&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of the Proudmoore victory in the Siege of Boralus, a ceremony was held in Unity Square's plateau, which was repaired following the battle. There, the gathered and recently-reunited houses of Kul Tiras pledged themselves to the the new Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, appointed by her mother. Also in attendance was High King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance, who was introduced to Taelia, now revealed to be the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;."}

The plague affects all it touches, sterilizing the land, warping its natural inhabitants into bloodthirsty mutants, and twisting the local flora into disgusting mockeries of proper plants. The &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; (most specifically &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; that runs through &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; are perhaps the most startling examples of the long term effects of the blight.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", the blight is a core mechanic of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; race, working in a way similar to the &lt;a href=\"zerg\"&gt;zerg&lt;/a&gt;'s creep in \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\".

Whenever a building is finished, it instantly generates more blighted area around it. The haunted gold mine and necropolis will generate more blight around it than any other building. Undead units will passively regenerate health on blight, whereas undead Heroes will regenerate even better on it. The &lt;a href=\"Sacrificial%20Skull\"&gt;Sacrificial Skull&lt;/a&gt; also can generate blight.\nIf the buildings that created blight are destroyed and buildings from a non-undead faction are then built on blighted ground, the blight will disappear around these buildings, but trees will retain their sickly appearance and not return to health. Orc and human buildings seem to pave it over, while night elf buildings heal the land. &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Warcraft_III%29%23Detonate\"&gt;Detonate&lt;/a&gt; may also remove blight.\nIn Wrath of the Lich King.\nThe lower levels of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; were under siege by three necropoli, which the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was using to create blighted ground and turn these areas into sanctuaries for the undead. Their intention was to corrupt the entire zone.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Lands\"&gt;Lost Lands&lt;/a&gt; in Sholazar were also in the process of being blighted."}

Plated in gold and chrome with a variety of impressive inlaid jewels, these mechanical constructs are known for their endless generosity and gift-giving.\nThe Blingtron line didn't really pick up until the &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%204000\"&gt;4000 series&lt;/a&gt; hit the vendor shelves. Few remember the &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%203000\"&gt;Blingtron 3000&lt;/a&gt;, but it was an engineering marvel in its own right. When a new series of Blingtron units are released, the older series is considered obsolete and sent to their deaths in &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Guild\"&gt;bloody gladiatorial arenas&lt;/a&gt;. They may be created with planned obsolescence.\nA Blingtron's generosity circuits don't mature until they have been built to maximum specification. As such, one should not expect any free handouts from them until maturation. Blingtrons are built with several sockets that carry gems. While the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s forces were occupied with the sabotage of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, one Blingtron managed to build a secret vault of riches, guarded by &lt;a href=\"alarm-o-bot\"&gt;alarm-o-bot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20pummeler\"&gt;crowd pummeler&lt;/a&gt;s. Touching a Blingtron's power supply may be enough to kill small critters, such as moles.\nBackground.\nOrigin.\nThough Blingtrons seem to be fairly common, it seems no one really knows where the design for it came from, as explained by &lt;a href=\"Didi%20the%20Wrench\"&gt;Didi the Wrench&lt;/a&gt;. One rumor does pop up more than others, though: &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt;. Didi and an &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Area 52 and asked &lt;a href=\"Rocket-Chief%20Fuselage\"&gt;Rocket-Chief Fuselage&lt;/a&gt; what he knew about the Blingtron unit's inventor. After traveling to several different locations and asking several other people what they knew, the adventurer was directed to &lt;a href=\"Nixx%20Sprocketspring\"&gt;Nixx Sprocketspring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;.\nNixx revealed that the inventor of the Blingtron was \"some no-good, dirty, little &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; who don't know nuttin about engineering\" and that he had a granddaughter, &lt;a href=\"Winkey\"&gt;Winkey&lt;/a&gt;, down on &lt;a href=\"Southbreak%20Shore\"&gt;Southbreak Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Winkey revealed the name of her grandfather, &lt;a href=\"Gnopetto%20Bizzfuse\"&gt;Gnopetto Bizzfuse&lt;/a&gt;, whose one and only invention was the Blingtron unit. Everyone wanted to learn his secrets of how he created Blingtron's internal circuitry, but he refused to share it. He eventually died after the sea rose and devoured his shop off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe adventurer borrowed Winkey's diving helm, dived into the sea, and managed to find Gnopetto's old &lt;a href=\"Gnopetto%27s%20workshop\"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;, a journal and the old, still intact circuit design for Blingtron. Using the circuit design, Didi was able to finish the for &lt;a href=\"Reaves\"&gt;Reaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeries.\n&lt;a href=\"Blingtron%202000\"&gt;Blingtron 2000&lt;/a&gt; appear far smaller and weaker than most other Blingtrons and appear to have been consigned to death in the &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Brawler's Guild&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%203000\"&gt;Blingtron 3000&lt;/a&gt;. Blingtron 2000's greatest achievement consisted of tiny bits of chocolate coated with a thick layer of gold.\nBlingtron 3000, described as \"Last Year's Model\", was rendered obsolete with the introduction of the Blingtron 4000, and was therefore consigned to the &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Brawler's Guild&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Card%20Trader%20Ami\"&gt;Card Trader Ami&lt;/a&gt; commented that the Blingtron line didn't really pick up until the 4000 series hit the vendor shelves and that few remember the Blingtron 3000, but it was a real engineering marvel in its own right.\n&lt;a href=\"Blingtron%204000\"&gt;Blingtron 4000&lt;/a&gt; is described as a robot of infinite wealth who likes to be called \"Bling\". He appears to be very friendly, wishing adventurers a nice day, and readily offers gifts to them. According to his calibrations, the gifts should invoke feelings of enjoyment and gratitude. When talked to, Blingtron 4000 asks adventurers, if they are \"ready to appear visually attractive to your species\", after which he changes their appearance with a short-term buff. His despawning line of may be considered to be pure frivolity, or possibly a serious statement of their destination upon teleporting away.\n&lt;a href=\"Blingtron%205000\"&gt;Blingtron 5000&lt;/a&gt;, though broadly similar to the Blingtron 4000, is notably damaged, lacking teeth and featuring numerous broken and missing components. The 4000's cheery greeting of \"What is up, my primary &lt;male/female&gt; sibling?\" was replaced with a somewhat disturbing \"There's a party in your heart, and all the bladed weapons are invited. Have a pleasant day.\"\nLikewise, the 4000's \"Party Mechanical\" buff with the description \"Dashing. Daring. Exciting. Blingtron is all of these things, and he can't wait to hit the next party scene. Get your quality time with him now, because he'll be out of here soon!\" was replaced with a more threatening \"Killing Time\" with the description \"This Blingtron unit has been called away from something important... and looks a little angry. You had better talk to him while you can.\"\nThis is further seen in their behavior with the adventurers they interact with. While the 4000 units are very polite and friendly, saying \"I am pleased to offer this gift to you, &lt;race&gt; &lt;class&gt;. According to my calibrations, it will invoke feelings of enjoyment and gratitude. Have a nice day.\", the 5000 instead directly threatens them with \"You will accept this gift, and you will like it. To do otherwise will automatically engage my organic incineration weapons. Thank you.\"\nAdditionally, 5000 units will immediately attack any nearby 4000 or 5000 units, engaging in a violent fight to the death in which there can be only one winner. Destroying another Blingtron will cause the victor to gain a stack of the \"Gold Star\" buff, causing them to grow in size and strength.\n&lt;a href=\"Blingtron%206000\"&gt;Blingtron 6000&lt;/a&gt; is the result of summoning &lt;a href=\"Reaves\"&gt;Reaves&lt;/a&gt; after attaching . It uses a noticeably more neutral tone than the 4000 and 5000 units, simply stating \"While I am programmed for gift distribution, my observations indicate that you are programmed for gift reception. Shall we engage in a mutually-favorable transaction?\" when talked to by adventurers. 6000 units do not engage with 4000 units, but will instantly kill a 5000 unit in a single hit if attacked. When \"partying\" with a 6000 unit, the adventurer is teleported to a random location in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; or .\n&lt;a href=\"Blingtron%20MK2\"&gt;Blingtron MK2&lt;/a&gt; is fought during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Blingtron%207000\"&gt;Blingtron 7000&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the latest model of Blingtron, and is constructed using schematics found in &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;. It contains many accessories that make it appear \"high tech\", including an antenna on the left side of its head and a red left optic sensor. More fragile than the previous two versions, it can be easily defeated in combat by a 6000 or 5000 unit. Like the 6000 unit, it can transform a user to \"party mode\", but cannot teleport a user. The gifts it dispenses can include &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; Equipment, including a &lt;a href=\"Makeshift%20Azerite%20Detector\"&gt;Makeshift Azerite Detector&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War.\nThe worrisome darker turn in the Blingtron series that began with the 5000 units becomes far darker with the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Decoded%20Message\"&gt;Decoded Message&lt;/a&gt;s, occasionally found in the 5000's gift packages. These messages describe an ongoing secret war, in which the Blingtrons are engaged in a vast struggle against a formidable enemy which has infected the Blingtrons with a virus, later identified as a \"clockwork assembly system hack\". Despite the Blingtrons' efforts, organic awareness of the War is growing quickly.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Bejeweled%20%22Egg%22\"&gt;Bejeweled \"Egg\"&lt;/a&gt; is a treasure in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not an egg but rather a damaged blingtron head without a body. It might be the one who built the &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%27s%20Secret%20Vault\"&gt;secret vault&lt;/a&gt; in Tanaan."}

In the opposite corner, a Gnomish Tesla Coil appears. Do not bother doing any damage to the 3000 just yet.\nBlingtron 3000 will repeatedly summon Blingtron 2000s. The objective is to line up a chain of \"dead\" 2000s a few yards apart starting up at the tesla coil and ending up near the 3000's position. Once the chain of roughly seven 2000s extend from the tesla coil to the 3000, quickly run over to the coil and turn it on. This stuns the 3000 and causes it to take an additional 900% damage, which is the only conceivable way to beat the enrage timer. Save all cooldowns for this point.\nBlingtron 3000's 5.8 million health translates to just above 48K DPS over the whole two minutes, but players will have significantly less time to do any meaningful damage to the 3000."}

The world first heroic kill was by Paragon (25 person) on 2 January 2011.\nThe Ascendant Council is a three phase council fight. During the first phase, you fight &lt;a href=\"Feludius\"&gt;Feludius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ignacious\"&gt;Ignacious&lt;/a&gt; - water and fire ascendants. During the second phase, you face &lt;a href=\"Arion\"&gt;Arion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terrastra\"&gt;Terrastra&lt;/a&gt; - air and earth ascendants respectively. During the last phase, you must defeat all four, as they merge together into an Elementium Monstrosity.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"As the most powerful Twilight's Hammer cultists to be twisted into elemental beings, the Ascendant Council members have long forgotten their existences as mere mortals. From their wicked sanctum, they oversee the selection of new ascension candidates.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: You Dare Invade?\nAt the start of the encounter, Feludius and Ignacious enter the battle. Arion and Terrastra then watch from the balconies above. In Heroic Difficulty Arion and Terrastra assist their fellow Councillors.\nAscendant Councillor of Water\nAscendant Councillor of Flame\nStage Two: We Will Handle Them!\nOnce either Feludius or Ignacious reaches 25% health, both Councillors retreat. Arion and Terrastra then descend from above to carry on the fight.\nAscendant Councillor of Air\nAscendant Councillor of Earth\nStage Three: BEHOLD YOUR DOOM!\nOnce either Arion or Terrastra reaches 25% health, the Councillors grow impatient and place all combatants in a stasis field. All four Councillors combine to form the Elementium Monstrosity, beginning the final phase of the encounter.\nThe initial health of the Elementium Monstrosity equals the combined remaining health of each of the four Councillors.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nThe first phase pits players against Feludius (ice) and Ignacious (fire) while the others watch from the balcony. It lasts until one of the elementals reaches 25% health. For the first phase, put ranged DPS on Feludius, melee DPS on Ignacious and take them down together. Because the Elementium Monstrosity's hitpoints in phase three depend on how much health the individual elementals had before they despawned, it is ideal to get both Feludius and Ignacious down to 25%.\nHeart of Ice is a magic debuff by Feludius that causes nearby players to deal additional damage to Ingacious. Burning Blood is the same kind of debuff cast by Ignacious that causes nearby players to deal additional damage to Feludius. It's debatable whether to move to the groups of players that are assigned to one boss, or to dispel the debuff.\nAfter Ignacius has cast Inferno Leap (similar to &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt;) he will move to the tank and leave a trail of fire. Players should move to the fire to remove the Waterlogged debuff, or they will be stunned and take significant damage when Feludius cast Frozen Blood.\nCalling out when Ignacius is about to cast Aegis of Flame is important since the raid will need to focus DPS at that time. If the DPS is focused enough, the Aegis will be brought down before the fire AoE causes too much damage from Rising Flames.\nPhase 2.\nNow Arion (wind) and Terrastra (earth) will come in. Once again, split DPS with ranged on Arion and melee on Terrastra, and try to get them both down to 25% at the same time.\nWhen the phase starts players should be on the lookout for the black tornadoes that spawn - these should not be confused with the Gravity Well that causes players to be grounded. When players have touched the tornado they get Swirling Winds, which will make players avoid the Quake ability by Terrastra that causes about 100k damage. After Quake has been cast, players should move to the Gravity Well to make them Grounded. This will make players immune to the Thundershock ability by Arion, causing about 100k damage.\nPhase 3.\nOnce the elementals combine into the Elementium Monstrosity, it will have the combined HP of whatever the four individual mobs had when they despawned. Although Elementium Monstrosity is a tank and spank, the damage from its Electric Instability ability increases with time, hence it is easier if the previous bosses were kept as close to 25% health as possible.\nAn achievement, &lt;a href=\"Elementary\"&gt;Elementary&lt;/a&gt;, is available for only allowing a single Liquid Ice patch.\nSolo strategy.\nTry to have both bosses hit 25% health at the same time in phases one and two, as any remaining health is transferred to the third-phase boss. Wait for the stun to wear off and kill the monstrosity in phase three. There are no mechanics of note for soloing players.\nTo easily get &lt;a href=\"Elementary\"&gt;Elementary&lt;/a&gt;, stand just outside the center circle so the Monstrosity won't move. Don't stand underneath it when it spawns, as it will move a few yards away.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The remaining assistants will aggro the player who most recently attacked them, and when they get \"close\" to their target, will channel a debuff (while on the run!) that reduces the effectiveness of healing.\nAssign a DPS party member, preferably one with multiple instant ranged attacks (or AoE snares) to kite the assistants around, keeping them off the tank, for the duration of the fight. The assistants do not deal much damage, so this role is reasonably safe for a even a cloth-wearer. On heroic, Obsidius will periodically use Thunderclap; the kiter should therefore stay well away from the boss to avoid getting snared himself.\nTwice during the fight, everything will stop for a moment while Ascendant Lord Obsidius \"changes bodies\" into one of his assistants. The new Ascendant Lord Obsidius will grow back to his former enlarged state, and everyone will need to switch targets and resume kiting/DPS. Tank threat is transferred; however, the kiter will need to pick up the assistant left in place of Obsidius.\nObsidius will cast Twilight Corruption, dealing 24000/48000 damage over 12 seconds on a random player; this magic DoT debuff should be dispelled.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It started when &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; commanded that &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Set one year after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the campaign was minor in comparison, though the end result paved the way for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to reach the height of its power until the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. These events were portrayed in \"\".\nPrelude.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;defeated&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; ventured through a portal in an attempt to escape &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction and find other worlds to conquer. He was captured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who destroyed his body and tortured his spirit until the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; agreed to serve him again. Once he did, Kil'jaeden bound his spirit to the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, trapped him in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and sent it to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; remained in the Frozen Throne, atop a spire in the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, and plotted his freedom while he seemingly served the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was released by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; after ten thousand years of imprisonment. He would eventually consume the power of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, and use its power to kill the powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius the Darkener&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remaining nathrezim demons in Lordaeron didn't know about Archimonde's death, unlike the Scourge leaders &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; were told by King Arthas as he returned from Kalimdor. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, was aware of the Legion's fall but did not believe that all was lost. He was still confident about the Scourge, the dreadlords, and the Lich King. When he reached to the Lich King, however, the entity refused him. Kil'jaeden realized that if the Lich King conquered Azeroth, any future demonic invasions would be nearly impossible. He was angered by Archimonde's defeat but this betrayal was a bigger concern than vengeance. He sensed a new demon who could complete the task of destroying the Lich King. Months after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden found Illidan Stormrage and convinced him to destroy the Lich King.\nRise of the naga.\nKil'jaeden told Illidan that his creation, the Lich King had betrayed him, but that his spirit was still trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for the destruction of the Frozen Throne, Kil'jaeden promised to grant Illidan his heart's desire.\nTo do so, Illidan summoned the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to the surface of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in ten thousand years. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; appointed &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20naga\"&gt;Illidan's naga&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Terror%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;The warden's hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; who served as Illidan's jailor, followed Illidan's trail in a quest to recapture him. She tracked him through &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; until he escaped by boat. Continuing the chase, Maiev and her &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; followed him to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev found old runes left by the evil &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. The runes revealed the presence of a powerful magical artifact hidden within the tomb. Fearing that Illidan would become more dangerous than ever with such an artifact, Maiev pursued Illidan deeper into the tomb. By the time they found the Betrayer, however, he had already obtained the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. He used the Eye trying to kill Maiev and her Watchers by making the tomb collapse upon their heads. This resulted in the deaths of many of Maiev's followers - including her trusted lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev herself was able to escape due to her &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nWhen she returned to her base, Maiev found her forces under attack by Illidan's. She sent a runner back to Kalimdor to ask &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his lover &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; for aid. With the aid that the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; provided, the united night elves were able to push Illidan's forces back from Maiev's base. They forced the Betrayer to flee to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where he would try to continue his quest despite the pursuit of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntervention in Lordaeron.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Remnants\"&gt;Alliance Remnants&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion and his allies landed in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion left to examine the corruption of Lordaeron's woods while Maiev and Tyrande continued the hunt. In their search, they met &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, prince of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Though he had not heard anything about a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas and his men had been attacked by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; that were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and were planning on escaping across the &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;River Arevass&lt;/a&gt;. To gain the aid of his blood elves in the hunt for Illidan, Maiev and Tyrande agreed to help him across the river. However, the caravan came under siege by the Scourge. In the last battle to cross the river, Tyrande used &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; on the bridge and stopped the undead wave from pursuing their weakened men. The bridge collapsed and Tyrande fell into the river, where she was swept away by the currents. While Kael'thas wished to rescue Tyrande, Maiev insisted that Tyrande knew the risks and demanded his help in locating and capturing Illidan.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;The spell at Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the meantime, Malfurion discovered that Illidan was using the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to damage &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. When he returned to Maiev outside &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the warden told Malfurion that Tyrande had been torn apart by the undead (as she did not want Malfurion to abandon the hunt to search for her). They confronted and battled &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge, rescued &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; and finally stopped Illidan's spell against Northrend by killing the naga summoners. This left the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; unstable and resulted in its destruction. Enraged, Illidan called the others fools and explained that his objective was to destroy their common enemy by striking at the Lich King's stronghold of Icecrown. Malfurion chastised Illidan for not thinking about the consequences and blamed him for Tyrande's death. When &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that she could still be alive, Malfurion &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;trapped&lt;/a&gt; Maiev for her deceit and left to find Tyrande with Illidan's aid.\nIllidan's departure.\nMalfurion and Illidan battled a heavy &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; presence. After holding the line against the six Scourge bases and defeating a forest troll tribe, Illidan rescued the &lt;a href=\"Priestess\"&gt;Priestess&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; personally. As a result, Malfurion allowed Illidan to depart without further pursuit from the night elven government. Illidan opened a portal and traveled to Outland. Despite Tyrande's warnings, Maiev continued to &lt;a href=\"independent\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt;ly lead her forces to chase him.\nAlthough Illidan's indirect attack on the Frozen Throne did not succeed, the damage caused by his spell had ruptured the Frozen Throne (widening the rift &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; made when &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; pushed it from the throne for &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; to find). As a result, the Lich King's powers were waning rapidly.\n&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nMisconceptions.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; returned to Dalaran he reported to Grand Marshal Garithos. Garithos informed Kael that a massive undead army is marching towards the Alterac mountains seeking to reclaim Dalaran. While the Alliance army moved to the front to repel them, Kael was ordered to repair the observatories near the city since they were also been told that a second strike force advance through &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Kael backed by Alliance troops had managed to beat the undead and repair the observatories. Kael was then reported that the second strike force is heading towards them but as he was prepared to repel them, &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; had ordered all human and dwarven troops to the front thus leaving Kael only with his blood elves and with no cavalry and artillery support.\nWhen his forces were beset by the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; accepted aid from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. For this, his commander, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, charged the blood elves with treason, sending them to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nEscape from Dalaran.\nWith aid from Vashj, Kael and his soldiers were able to escape the dungeons of Dalaran. They went through a portal that brought them to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Kael stated that, if Illidan could cure the magic addiction suffered by his people, they would serve him gladly.\nBattles in Outland.\nKael and Vashj soon found Illidan, who had been once again captured by Maiev. They defeated her forces and released him. Illidan explained that he came to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to hide from Kil'jaeden, who would no doubt be outraged by Illidan's failure to destroy the Lich King. Kael pledged himself to Illidan's service.\nIllidan sought to depose the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and take control over Outland. He planned to close the &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s Magtheridon used to bring reinforcements to Outland. &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; swore to serve Illidan if it meant defeating Magtheridon and his &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic armies.\nFall of Magtheridon and Kil'jaeden's command.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and his allies stormed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. After overcoming armies of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orcs\"&gt;fel orcs&lt;/a&gt; and demons (along with various traps), they confronted and defeated &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;. Moments after Illidan proclaimed himself the new Lord of Outland, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; appeared. He chastised Illidan for his failure, but offered him one more chance: destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; or face his eternal wrath.\n&lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Legacy of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe return to Northrend.\nAs a result of his growing weakness, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; began losing control over his minions. Aware that Kil'jaeden's reprisal was coming, he ordered his champion, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, to return to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and defend him. The weakening of the Lich King on &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;'s day resulted in a split of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; legions into the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;-loyal &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Forces\"&gt;free-willed undead&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; (who would later become the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;) and his own &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; followers which started &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;a war&lt;/a&gt; between them and also the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;. After surviving an &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Farewell\"&gt;assassination attempt&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas set sail for Northrend.\nBeneath Azjol'Nerub.\nArriving in Northrend, Arthas met the &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. In order to reach &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; in time to save the Lich King, Anub'arak suggested traveling through &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Symphony%20of%20Frost%20and%20Flame\"&gt;Battle at Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; reached &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge engaged Illidan's forces. Arthas then fought and defeated &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt; in single combat, so he could enter &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and take the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. After his victory, Arthas took from Illidan the dagger &lt;a href=\"Stormfury%2C%20Black%20Blade%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Stormfury, Black Blade of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy.\nThe merging.\nWith Illidan out of the way, Arthas ascended the spire and shattered the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. He donned the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and merged with &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to become the second &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt; retreated to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, becoming a prominent force there. After defeating &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20forces\"&gt;Magtheridon's forces&lt;/a&gt;, many of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s underlings became part of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and left &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; as her jailer. Illidan's forces were able to avoid Kil'jaeden's attempt to punish Illidan. Illidan's reign would eventually come to &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;an end&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;Plaguelands civil war&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the annihilation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, was also a result of Illidan's attempt to destroy the Lich King remotely using the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in Dalaran.\nThe newly merged Lich King hunted down the few survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; expedition and many of them were raised in undeath as members of a &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;new dark force&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; led the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; until the Lich King awakened and &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;declared war&lt;/a&gt; against the living."}

She was one of many Wild Gods to fight in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and defend the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but she fell in battle against the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronokon\"&gt;Ronokon&lt;/a&gt;. A great shrine was built in the forests of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; to commemorate her sacrifice, and her massive &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20Ashamane\"&gt;fangs&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 all that remained of her after her violent death \u2014 were put on display there.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nOnce, while traveling Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; discovered a panther cub under attack by a pack of wolves, her mother already slain. To Freya's surprise, though the wolves had wounded the tiny creature, she continued to fight, swiping viciously with her claws against the larger predators. Before long the wolves were driven away, unwilling to suffer further injuries for their meal. Freya picked up the cub only to be greeted by a flurry of scratches, but she was not angered; on the contrary, Freya was delighted by the panther's unrelenting wildness. Freya healed the panther cub's injuries and named her Ashamane, after her striking black fur.\nOver the years, Ashamane grew into a massive panther and no wolf dared to hunt her. Freya was pleased to see that she did not succumb to desires for vengeance. Ashamane could have stalked and killed every wolf in her valley easily, but she didn't. The wolves had no malice toward Ashamane, they were simply hungry, and so she held no malice towards them. But she did enjoy toying with them. The wolf pack that had attacked her as a cub would sometimes awake to an earth-shattering roar. Ashamane would creep up to their den and announce her presence loudly, sending them fleeing.\nOver time, Ashamane realized that she had become more powerful than any other panther she had ever seen. The passing years did not age her but instead made her stronger. Generations of wildlife came and went before her eyes. There were other animals like her; powerful, iconic creatures who seemed to live a different existence than the rest of nature. They were the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, and Ashamane was one of them. Ashamane's untamed heart had difficulty accepting immortality. The chaos of the wilderness, the struggle for survival\u2014they had been the core of Ashamane's being. Now they were irrelevant. She had ascended above her old life. There was no prey that could evade her. There was no joy in an effortless hunt. There was no predator that could challenge her.\nAshamane strode openly through the jungles of Azeroth. Other wild creatures had nothing to fear from her. Stories of a giant, majestic panther spread among the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s who ventured into the area. Some sought to venerate her as one of their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. Ashamane rarely let them see her. Other trolls tracked her for a different reason. Certain hunters craved the glory that would surely come from bringing down such a magnificent being. There was no greater challenge than defeating a loa. One by one, these ambitious trolls crept into the jungle, arrogance burning in their hearts. Ashamane was delighted. No matter how clever they were, no matter how silent they moved or how true their aim, they all returned to their tribes empty-handed, the sound of her roar still ringing in their ears, and the sight of her fangs forever haunting their dreams. She did not need to take their lives. They understood their place in the wilds when she was done with them. That was enough.\nUnlike many of the other Wild Gods, Ashamane did not travel the land with Freya. But she would watch Freya and the others from afar, and Freya would always smile when she noticed. No matter what Ashamane thought, there was a connection between them through the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; that Freya had created and the Wild Gods were linked to. Eventually Ashamane traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and had her first experience with the Emerald Dream. She was immediately taken with its thriving vision of an untamed world. She made her home on the western slopes of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and spent thousands of years drifting in the Dream, exploring its mysteries and power.\nWar of the Ancients.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Ashamane battled an army of demons in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; that was preparing to siege &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. She fought until the leader was forced to face her himself, which had been Ashamane's plan all along, as it was one of the laws of survival: the pack was not defeated until the leader's throat was between her jaws. The &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ronokon\"&gt;Ronokon&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Legion's efforts in Suramar, was eventually drawn out, enraged by Ashamane's interference. Ronokon and Ashamane fought in Val'sharah for hours, Ronokon keeping her at bay with his spear. After so much war, Ashamane had grown weary; her pace slowed and her wounds ached, but her will was not broken. With her last strength she leaped at Ronokon, allowing him to drive his spear through her chest, but in the process she dug her claws into his shoulders and her fangs into his neck. Despite Ronokon's thrashing, Ashamane remained embedded in him until he died in a great fel explosion that tore a deep gash into the land and burned Ashamane to ash.\nAshamane's sacrifice saved countless lives and gave the elves of Suramar time to craft a shield over their city that would save them from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. A great shrine was built in her honor in Val'sharah, and her &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20Ashamane\"&gt;fangs&lt;/a&gt; were adorned and put on display there. It is said they still carry much of her power. A group of druids called the &lt;a href=\"Ashen\"&gt;Ashen&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Delandros%20Shimmermoon\"&gt;Delandros Shimmermoon&lt;/a&gt;, now watch over the fangs and shrine.\nLegion.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Ashamane\"&gt;Echo of Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; to direct the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid of the Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Ferocity\"&gt;Essence of Ferocity&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fenryr\"&gt;Fenryr&lt;/a&gt;, in order to power the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Idol of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and commune with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. When Malorne becomes trapped in an &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; recreation of his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, a figment of Ashamane is seen battling demons during the War of the Ancients.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing her death, Ashamane's soul was sent to &lt;a href=\"Heartwood%20Grove\"&gt;Heartwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, an afterlife for those connected to the power of nature and a place where &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s go to be brought back to life.\nDue to the recent &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought in Ardenweald, the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; was forced to decide which groves must be allowed to wither so that their anima may nourish the rest. Though Heartwood Grove was selected for culling, the &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; containing Ashamane's soul was among the few chosen to be moved to &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Vaal\"&gt;Tirna Vaal&lt;/a&gt; rather than be sacrificed with their grove.\nBefore it could be moved, however, Ashamane's wildseed was taken by the forces of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s ally, &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;. After rejecting an offer to join him, he sent her soul into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to be tortured by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. However, she was eventually rescued by a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; pledged to the Winter Queen, with the aid of the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Although desiring revenge against Mueh'zala, Ashamane knew she must rest first. Ashamane, along with Vol'jin and the fallen Loa &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, were returned to Ardenweald, where the Winter Queen took them into her care."}

Discovering that his father's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; had become corrupted and trapped in the sword, Darion impaled himself with Ashbringer in hope of freeing Alexandros. While successful, Darion became undead and joined the Scourge. He continued to wield the corrupted sword as the Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;. During the second &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Ashbringer was purified when Darion betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and relinquished the sword to &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion Fordring wielded Ashbringer during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to shatter &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the Lich King in their culminating battle at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Following Fordring's death during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashbringer passed to his &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;successor&lt;/a&gt;, a Champion of the Light who wielded it as the new Highlord of the Silver Hand. Ashbringer's power was later drained to neutralize &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sword's story has been slowly revealed since &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;\"World of Warcraft\"&lt;/a&gt;'s inception. While Ashbringer had a pronounced role in ', players were unable to wield it until the release of '. The Ashbringer is featured in a titular four-part .\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Highlord Alexandros Mograine found a mysterious, dark crystal on the body of a dead &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The crystal was described as a \"living embodiment of shadow\".\nMograine kept the crystal a secret for years until just before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Ashbringer%20event\"&gt;revealed it&lt;/a&gt; to the other leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that they try to find the crystal's antithesis \u2014 a manifestation of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; itself \u2014 that could be used against the impending &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; invasion. Mograine's peers were appalled at the sight of the dark crystal and tried to destroy it with holy spells. Unexpectedly, the crystal absorbed the spells and became the crystal of pure light that Mograine mentioned moments before. The group agreed to forge a weapon from the crystal that would smite the undead with such power that only a cloud of ash would remain in its wake.\nDays later, Mograine and his advisor &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to visit &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; with the unique crystal of pure light. They gave their condolences on &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s fate in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and asked him to have a weapon forged from it. To avenge Muradin, Magni personally took on the task and forged the Ashbringer to oppose &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas, and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. While Magni never took much stock in the belief that Master dwarven &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s could impart emotions into the weapons they create, standing before &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Anvil\"&gt;The Great Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, he found himself thinking of how he would not see Muradin again. He thus harnessed all of his rage, fury, the desire for vengeance, and willed them into being with each strike of his hammer. It is said he worked for three days straight, hoped the sword would be used to avenge his brother. When he was finished, he gave Mograine the finest blade that had ever been crafted by his hand.\nFall of the Highlord.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' betrayal, the remaining leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; banded together to fight the undead of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The Ashbringer became the most lethal weapon in their arsenal \u2014 and it quickly garnered the attention of Kel'Thuzad. The dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; (in the newly-possessed body of &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;) sought to manipulate the remnants of the paladin order to advance his goals for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After Mograine stated his intentions to attack the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Balnazzar put plans into motion to eliminate Alexandros (ostensibly to protect his brother, &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, who was in the Undercity secretly manipulating &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;).\nTherefore, Balnazzar made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate Alexandros and end his threat to both of them, he corrupted one of Alexandros' sons, &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, and set a trap for the Highlord. Renault led his father and Fairbanks to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, where legions of the Scourge awaited them. During the battle, Renault hid while Alexandros and Fairbanks fended for themselves. At some point, Fairbanks eventually became trapped alive under a pile of corpses, while Alexandros alone continued to smite thousands of the undead, but eventually became weary and dropped Ashbringer. Renault came out of hiding and slew his father with the sword, which corrupted the blade. Later, Kel'Thuzad resurrected Alexandros as one of his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and reclaimed his corrupted blade. Consequently, Balnazzar gained complete authority over the remnants of the Silver Hand and reformed it as the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, while Renault became Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking to free his father, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; led a mission into Naxxramas with a small party of &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; members. Upon finding him, Alexandros was unresponsive to his son's pleas and attempts to redeem him, forcing Darion to reluctantly kill him. After the battle, Darion took the Corrupted Ashbringer and fled from the necropolis. The blade had been corrupted to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s cause, and Darion realized that he could hear the voice of his father, his spirit trapped inside the weapon and desperate for a way out.\nAs Darion obeyed his father's wishes, he sought out his older brother Renault at the Scarlet Monastery. There, Darion confronted his brother, who lashed out and attempted to kill him. But before Renault was able to deal the final blow, Alexandros' spirit emerged from Ashbringer and decapitated his traitorous son, before retreating back into the blade. Whatever satisfaction Alexandros Mograine felt did not release him from his curse, as he was still trapped.\nHaving no other choice, Darion sought out &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, an old hero who was living in exile after his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt;. Tirion knew of the Ashbringer's legacy, and he was distraught to see how it had been corrupted. Yet there was no easy means to cleanse it. According to him, the only way to break the curse and free the soul trapped within was to perform an act of compassion greater than the treachery that had defiled the weapon.\nLater, during the first battle for &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, as the tide of battle soon turned against the Argent Dawn, Darion finally understood Tirion's words, as his father had died due to betrayal, the only act that could free him was to make the ultimate sacrifice. Darion took the Corrupted Ashbringer and impaled himself upon it. This selfless act did more than free his father, all the souls interred beneath the chapel were also awakened, and alongside Alexandros, their vengeful fury laid waste to the invading Scourge. The Argent Dawn and Light's Hope Chapel were saved. However, Darion's corpse was recovered by the Scourge and resurrected as a death knight by Kel'Thuzad. With the Corrupted Ashbringer, he became the Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", it was stated that Alexandros was one of the founders of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The later depicted the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; occurring after Alexandros's death, in which case he would have never been a member.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nClassic.\nLaunch to &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.10.0\"&gt;patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt;.\nAshbringer was the subject of intense rumors during the early years of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". It was one of the first legendary-quality items to be datamined from the game's files, and &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20Alen\"&gt;Caretaker Alen&lt;/a&gt; also mentioned Ashbringer by name in-game. This created speculation among players that there was a secret quest to obtain Ashbringer. Blizzard did not comment on whether it could be obtained or not.\nAt the launch of \"World of Warcraft\", Caretaker Alen was the only NPC to mention Ashbringer. Rumors were fueled further with the addition of more NPCs (and one item) that mentioned the weapon: &lt;a href=\"Alexia%20Ironknife\"&gt;Alexia Ironknife&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bardu%20Sharpeye\"&gt;Bardu Sharpeye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Narain%20Soothfancy\"&gt;Narain Soothfancy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Commander Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar Zealots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle%27s%20Guide%20to%20Extreme%20Anglin%27\"&gt;Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin'&lt;/a&gt;. Information from these sources suggested that Asbhringer was somehow lost, and that &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; knew the location; however, neither shared their knowledge. Players continued to search feverishly for a secret quest that would reward Ashbringer.\nIn February 2006, the official Chinese \"World of Warcraft\" website published a promotional image for the then-upcoming &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11.0\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a character wielding Ashbringer. This immediately drew player speculation that Ashbringer would finally be obtainable, until a European &lt;a href=\"CM\"&gt;CM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eyonix\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt; clarified it would not be:\nThis was the first official statement that Ashbringer was not obtainable by players, and quashed rumors. The caster legendary item Eyonix hinted at was &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, added in patch 1.11.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%201.11.0\"&gt;Patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;.\n (non-canon)\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt; of the Naxxramas raid, players encountered Highlord Alexandros Mograine as a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; encounter. He wielded &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, which could be looted from the Horsemen. (Corrupted Ashbringer does not drop in the version of Naxxramas, and is no longer obtainable in retail \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\") When Corrupted Ashbringer is equipped by a player, Scarlet Crusade NPCs become friendly, Argent Dawn NPCs become hostile, and a &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer/Scarlet%20Monastery%20Event\"&gt;scripted event&lt;/a&gt; will play upon entering &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery%20Cathedral\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the scripted event, &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Mograine\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; welcomes the player as crusaders bow before them. Unexpectedly, the spirit of Highlord Alexandros Mograine (Renault's father), appears in &lt;a href=\"Dreadnaught%27s%20Battlegear\"&gt;Dreadnaught's Battlegear&lt;/a&gt; and slays his son for betraying him. Alexandros' spirit restores &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;High Inquisitor Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; from his undead form, then disappears. Fairbanks tells the player how Renault murdered his father, and that Ashbringer is corrupted beyond redemption. Fairbanks states Alexandros has another son in Outland who can forge a new one.\nThe \"son in Outland\" was apparently retconned in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\": Mograine's second son was revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, who has never been known to reside in Outland. The Ashbringer comic (published several years after the release of patch 1.11) loosely follows the Scarlet Monastery event, with Darion in place of the player, and no mention of any sons other than Renault and Darion.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn his mission to eradicate the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and countless civilians in &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;, Highlord Darion Mograine served as the Lich King's right hand and the wielder of the Corrupted Ashbringer.\nAt the Lich King's command, Darion launched an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle that ensued, the Corrupted Ashbringer began to turn on Darion. When the death knights were forced to surrender, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Lich King knowingly sent Darion and his knights into a trap. Shortly thereafter, the Lich King himself appeared. In an act of rebellion, and to save Tirion's soul from being claimed by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Darion Mograine resisted the Lich King's control just enough to give Tirion the Corrupted Ashbringer. The paladin drew upon the power of the Light and cleansed the blade in a blinding flash of energy. With the restored Ashbringer at his command, Tirion drove the Lich King from the chapel's holy ground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers were sent to retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Artifact\"&gt;Sacred Artifact&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Catacombs\"&gt;Utgarde Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. Upon returning it to &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;, a nearby &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20of%20the%20Crusade\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt; unmasks himself as Tirion Fordring and equips the artifact, which is revealed to be the Ashbringer. The Highlord explained that he was convinced by his advisors to travel to Valgarde in disguise, while &lt;a href=\"Ares%20the%20Oathbound\"&gt;Ares the Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to transport the sword separately to Northrend. This was a security precaution to protect the leader of the Crusade, should the Lich King's forces go after the sword's keeper in an attempt to kill him.\nDuring the final battle against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion Fordring was frozen by Arthas and unable to help his champions against the Dark Lord of the Scourge. The Lich King had won, and while he began to raise his foes into undeath, Tirion refused to give up. He broke free of his icy prison, and with a desperate blow, he destroyed &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with the Ashbringer, releasing the spirits of the Lich King's victims.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;victorious march&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; returned to his old home - &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. There, he began establishing a new &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; base, and the Ashbringer, the sword that shattered the &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; itself, serves as a symbol of a new dawn for everyone.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Ashbringer is the legendary &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; used by retribution &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s in \"\". During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion was captured by the Legion and died after being tortured, though a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero paladin&lt;/a&gt; was able to recover the Ashbringer at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Before he died, Tirion declared them the new Ashbringer and the sword's wielder.\nUpon killing enemies, the Ashbringer &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer%20%28artifact%29%23Quotes\"&gt;may whisper&lt;/a&gt; to its wielder, the voice and quotes being those of Tirion Fordring when he was alive.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; plunged his sword into Azeroth, Ashbringer's power (along with that of all \"Legion\" artifacts) was completely drained to neutralize .\nShadowlands.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros Mograine wields the sword &lt;a href=\"Fatebringer\"&gt;Fatebringer&lt;/a&gt;, which he requested &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt; forge in the likeness of Ashbringer.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Hand of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Azmourne\"&gt;Azmourne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; entered the main timeline through a time rift, they were equipped with &lt;a href=\"Azmourne%27s%20Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Azmourne's Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dreadnaught%27s%20Battlegear\"&gt;Dreadnaught's Battlegear&lt;/a&gt;. After the Hand was defeated, it left behind the variant Corrupted Ashbringer and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sliver\"&gt;Baron Sliver&lt;/a&gt; siphoned the &lt;a href=\"necromantic\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; energy from the variant sword, noting that \"prior to the variant blade's redemption at the Battle of Light's Hope, it emanated more energy than our version.\"\nRumors and speculation.\nOld questline and earlier appearance.\nThe Ashbringer may have been originally intended to be in the game during Classic.

It is the ancestral homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who remain in control of several holdings through the zone, including &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Grove\"&gt;Silverwing Grove&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aessina\"&gt;Shrine of Aessina&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has more recently established a settlement in the eastern part of the woods \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as well as a smaller camp on the western beach \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 along with several Warsong camps situated from &lt;a href=\"Kargathia%20Keep\"&gt;Kargathia Keep&lt;/a&gt; all through the southeast to the &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Rampart\"&gt;Mor'shan Rampart&lt;/a&gt; in the far south, and also captured and deforested &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt;. The zone is heavily populated with &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, and wild creatures such as &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s. The region is quite large, and running from the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; is quite an undertaking.\nSince the zone is &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; there is often a lot of skirmishing going on throughout the woods, and attacks on the faction-based settlements are not uncommon. The zone is also a major travel hub for both &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, even at higher levels.\nHistory.\nWar of the Ancients and its aftermath.\nNot much is known about Ashenvale during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, but it was said that &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; had a tower within the forest.\nAfter the Sundering of the ancient Kalimdor, the night elven civilization was built in and around the forests of Ashenvale. Some time later, Highborne, who defected from Queen Azshara, foolishly attempted to convince the kaldorei race of the power of magic by unleashing a magical storm upon Ashenvale, though it was forbidden. Thus, the Highborne were exiled.\nSome years after the War of the Ancients, the satyrs gathered the few demons that remained and engaged in a war across Ashenvale in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;. \nAfterwards &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; entered the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s continued to patrol Ashenvale.\nThe Third War.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s under &lt;a href=\"Neeloc%20Greedyfingers\"&gt;Neeloc Greedyfingers&lt;/a&gt; had started deforesting the area before the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; arrived, but were prevented from doing much damage by the local &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribe. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s acquired the goblins' aid after ending this threat. The elusive &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s had a settlement here. Powerful artifacts, enclosed in circles of mushrooms, were protected by &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Spirit\"&gt;forest guardians&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; restored the cut trees but was killed by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; tricked by the Burning Legion masters.\nAshenvale was later attacked by the demons. An unnamed village was destroyed, along with the family of &lt;a href=\"Vandel\"&gt;Vandel&lt;/a&gt;, who survived as he was hunting out in the forests.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; were fighting against &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s from Ashenvale to the isles to aid &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAshenvale is an ancient forest, and has been in the caring hands of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years. It was not until more recent years that things changed, with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s lumber harvesting camps, as well as other much more insidious groups. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; have holdings in &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Scar%20Shrine\"&gt;Fire Scar Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felfire%20Hill\"&gt;Felfire Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;Demon Fall Canyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Ridge\"&gt;Demon Fall Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. The vile &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; inhabit ancient elven ruins at &lt;a href=\"Xavian\"&gt;Xavian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Run\"&gt;Night Run&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Satyrnaar\"&gt;Satyrnaar&lt;/a&gt;. Cursed green dragonkin have slipped out from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; portal at &lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, and corruption taints &lt;a href=\"the%20Ruins%20of%20Stardust\"&gt;the Ruins of Stardust&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have seized control of several holdings in the eastern parts of the forest, and beyond their base at &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;, they have harvested the trees for lumber at the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Labor%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Labor Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde clash with the night elves over control of Eastern Ashenvale, with the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; vowing to continue their lumber harvesting operations, and the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; vowing to drive the Outriders from their lands once and for all.\nAshenvale is a vast primordial wilderness long given over to beasts and nature's savage ways. The night elves who settled on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; hunted in Ashenvale's wilds but never settled within its borders. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves ceased even hunting in order to battle the demons. The lack of hunting has allowed many creatures to live and thrive within the vast woodland, creating danger for all who venture into the forest. Ashenvale forest runs in a great arc south of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; directly south. The ruined lands of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; lie across a river to the east. Ashenvale is an old forest, long untouched by any mortal race. The weather is fairly mild, though rain is almost constant. The woods are so old and thickly grown that only trickles of precipitation get through the thick canopy. The forest has become ever wilder since left to its own devices after the start of the Third War. Any roads through are overgrown, some even impassable. In contrast, the game trails see increased traffic as beasts living in the shelter of the massive trees grow in number and boldness. Those traveling through Ashenvale will wisely keep their guard up at all times. In recent years, the demons and satyr have corrupted parts of Ashenvale, and other parts of it are cut down by the Horde to fuel their expansion efforts. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, too, have begun experimenting on sleeping druids within the &lt;a href=\"Dor%27Danil%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Dor'Danil Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt;, unbeknownst to the Horde but not the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\n&lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Ashenvale and helped &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and later found the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and her companions made her way into the forest of Ashenvale and frequently used its portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nTwo attacks happened here during the time before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. Firstly, a horrific attack on night elves Sentinels by orcs, though not from the Horde. The elves were skinned and placed by trees. Secondly, when the [[druids of [[Cenarion Circle]] set up a meeting led by [[Hamuul Runetotem]] and [[Elerethe Renferal]]. The orcs attacked again and slaughtered all the tauren and night elves druids. The only survivor of the massacre was Hamuul. As the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]] was about to start, fires began to burn from lightning strikes.\nWolfheart.\n[[File:Wolfheart Varian and Worgen.jpg|thumb|[[Varian Wrynn|King Varian Wrynn]], the Scion of [[Goldrinn]], leading Gilnean worgen during the [[Ashenvale war]].]]\nWhen [[Garrosh Hellscream]] became the new [[Warchief]] of the Horde in the wake of the [[Cataclysm (event)|Cataclysm]], he unleashed great war in the forests of Ashenvale. He sent orcish warriors and goblins engineers into the heart of forests, where great battles where fought against [[Sentinels]] led by [[Haldrissa Woodshaper]], commander of the night elf forces protecting Ashenvale. In an attempt to get help, she sent her best scout [[Aradria Cloudflyer]] to Darnassus, but she was struck down by orcish archers. Aradria was thought dead but fortunately, a druid [[Parsis]] rescued her and she was able to deliver her message to Darnassus. Moreover, eight [[Magnataur]]s and [[proto-drake]]s were brought from [[Northrend]] and released against defenseless Night elven Sentinels. Garrosh intended to build another city of the Horde in the center of Ashenvale, which would rival [[Orgrimmar]]. Many Night Elven outposts have fallen since the invasion. [[Tyrande Whisperwind]], Shandris Feathermoon with Sentinels, and Alliance troops went to Ashenvale to help relieve Haldrissa's elves, but in the chaos of the battle, Haldrissa was slain and Tyrande was wounded. The battle became bleak. However, [[Varian Wrynn]], [[Genn Greymane]], and the army of [[worgen]] arrived to turn the tide. Varian himself stood against the new Warchief. It was a fierce battle but [[Goldrinn]]'s blessing of unyielding energy gave Varian the advantage over his foe. Before anyone could strike a mortal blow, a dying [[magnataur]] divided the two combatants and Garrosh with the attacking Horde were forced to retreat. Su'ura Swiftarrow took Haldrissa's position and new better-situated outposts were quickly commissioned along the eastern edge of the territory. The Alliance reclaimed and rebuilt [[Silverwing Outpost]] which was made the staging ground for supplying the Alliance's counterattack. Before leaving, Tyrande blessed Silverwing Outpost.\nCataclysm.\nThe [[Horde]] military sent troops to reinforce [[Mor'shan Rampart]], which had fallen victim to a renewed effort by the [[Silverwing Sentinels]] to drive out the Horde from Ashenvale. The Silverwing sentinels weren't just laying siege to the [[Mor'shan Ramparts]], however: they were also launching simultaneous attacks on [[Splintertree Post]] and the [[Warsong Lumber Camp]]. Eventually, the Horde adventurers and military were able to break the siege of the Ramparts. Pushing north from the Ramparts, the Horde took control of Silverwing Outpost, and using Kodo Caravans, they were soon able to break the siege of Splintertree Post. An orcish warlock poisoned the forest heart, which struck a huge blow to the Sentinels. Horde covert operatives killed the commanders leading the siege of Warsong Lumber Camp, thus bringing the alliance offensive to an end. \nAfter the sieges of Splintertree and Warsong Lumber camp were broken, eastern Ashenvale was under complete horde control, save for [[Forest Song]]. The Horde armies pressed westward, taking control of [[Silverwind Refuge]] by using a corrupted form of a water elemental, and also began an attack on Raynewood Tower and [[Raynewood Retreat]], killing many of the druids and [[sentinels]] stationed there. However, the Horde was not able to deliver the finishing blow at Raynewood, as the Druid leader continued to revive the Dryad defenders of the post. The Horde even started firebombing [[Astranaar]], and with victory in sight, they moved in to take Maestra's Post, one of the few remaining Alliance encampments. If Maestra's post fell, all of Darkshore and eventually Teldrassil would be vulnerable to continued Horde attacks. While the siege of Maestra's post was beginning, the Horde engineers at the captured Alliance base of Silverwind Refuge were finishing up a giant bomb, designed to be used on the Night Elves in [[Stonetalon|Stonetalon Mountains]]. Many of the Horde battalions started to move south to reinforce Krom'gar's army in Stonetalon, bringing the bomb south with them.\nThis success was short-lived, however, when the mobilized armies of [[Darnassus]] were able to break the siege of Maestra's post, and pushed the Horde out of [[Astranaar]]. After pushing the Horde out of Astranaar, the Alliance armies reinforced Raynewood retreat, breaking the siege there by taking on the shade of the Ancient spirit of Shadumbra, and killing many horde soldiers and destroying their demolishers in the process. Alliance heroes rebuilt [[artifact|Dartol's Rod]] which allowed them control over the [[furbolg]]s near Silverwind refuge, using them to weaken the Horde army there enough to allow the Sentinel's to retake the camp. The alliance military moved back eastward, cleansing the tainted forest heart and killing the Horde overseer at the Lumber Camp, along with a Sin'dorei Ambassador. At this point, only pockets of horde resistance remained, bringing the war full circle, in favor of the alliance. \nMists of Pandaria.\nNight elves brought several caravans to [[Astranaar]] from [[Northern Barrens]] during the [[Battlefield: Barrens]].\nWith the dismantlement of [[Warchief]] [[Garrosh Hellscream]]'s war machine and the conclusion of the [[Siege of Orgrimmar]] and the [[Alliance-Horde war]], [[Tyrande Whisperwind]] allowed the Horde unimpeded access to [[Azshara]]'s lumber in return for the complete withdrawal of Horde forces from Ashenvale. The results of this were never seen.\nLegion.\nDuring the [[Burning Legion]]'s [[third invasion]] of [[Azeroth]], Ashenvale came under siege by [[satyr]] forces rallied under [[Rethazar the Fallen]]. Druid champions from the [[Dreamgrove]] came to deal with the satyrs.\nBattle for Azeroth and aftermath.\n[[File:War of the Thorns by Sandara Tang.jpg|thumb|[[Night elf|Night elven]] defenders facing [[orc]]ish invaders.]]\nLeading up to the events of [[War of the Thorns]], Ashenvale was considered a peaceful and boring post for a Sentinel. Hostilities between the Alliance and Horde began again in Ashenvale on the Horde's march to [[Darnassus]], and Astranaar's population was killed.\nDuring the course of the [[Fourth War]], Alliance soldiers continued pouring into Ashenvale, reinforcing their holdings, and attacking Horde outposts across the forest. The remaining [[Sentinels]] of Ashenvale were under the command of [[Sentinel Thenysil|Tara Thenysil]].\nEven with its many losses, Ashenvale remains a lush wilderness filled with chittering animals, clear rivers and lakes, and towering trees. The Horde continues its lumber operations at the Warsong Lumber Camp, and the Sentinels attack Splintertree Post and patrol the Ashenvale border.\nGeography.\nAshenvale is a forest full of ancient trees, teeming with life. Though pockets of the forest have become tainted, overall the area is a place of deep magic and spiritual connection with nature. Several lakes are sheltered beneath the forest's boughs. A stretch of beach lines the west edge of the forest, known as the [[Zoram Strand]], where hostile [[naga]] dwell. The forest is bordered by mountains to the south, and more forest to the north. The eastern border is the [[Southfury River]].\nAshenvale contains [[Blackfathom Deeps]], an instanced dungeon located in the northwestern corner of the zone (Ashenvale, The Zoram Strand: 14.0, 15.0). In addition, the micro dungeon [[Bough Shadow]], the site of one of the [[Great Tree]]s, can be found in this zone. The Alliance entrance to the battleground [[Warsong Gulch]] is located in the southern part of the forest. Travel hubs include [[Astranaar]] and [[Forest Song]] for Alliance, and [[Splintertree Post]] and [[Zoram'gar Outpost]] for the Horde.\nMaps and subregions.\n[[File:WorldMap-Ashenvale.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Ashenvale.]]\n[[File:WorldMap-Ashenvale-old2.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Ashenvale prior to \"[[World of Warcraft: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]]\".]]\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D30\"&gt;A pre cataclysm topographic map of Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;\nBattlegrounds.\n[[File:Ashenvale Cata.png|thumb|The Horde has cut down much of the ancient forest.]]\nNotable characters.\n[[File:Satyrnaar.jpg|thumb|Satyrnaar.]]\nAshenvale is home to several characters of note. At Maestra's Post, [[Sentinel Onaeya]] fights tooth and nail against the Horde assault. In Astranaar, [[Raene Wolfrunner]] attempts to cleanse the taint that has affected the local furbolgs. At the Zoram'gar Outpost, [[Je'neu Sancrea]] sends bold adventurers into the dark Blackfathom Deeps in search of mystical items. At Forest Song, the draenei [[Vindicator Vedaar]] oversees the construction of a Draenei outpost.\nQuests.\nMany quests in Ashenvale for both Alliance and Horde require combat with the demons and satyrs of the zone. After the Shattering, the two factions are in direct conflict, and the quests reflect this, pitching the players directly against attackers of the opposite faction.\n[[File:Raynewood Retreat.jpg|thumb|Raynewood Retrea.]]\nPvP.\nAlongside [[Hillsbrad Foothills]] and [[Stranglethorn Vale]], Ashenvale was one of \"the\" places for PvP combat. An Alliance attack on the Crossroads in the Barrens or a Horde attack on Astranaar would result in a back and forth match as players battled across the landscape. Ashenvale was also a prime location for high-level players to gank low-level players as for many (orcs, tauren, trolls, and night elves) this was their first contested zone.\nLike Hillsbrad and Stranglethorn, Ashenvale has quieted down significantly with the advent of Battlegrounds and increased level caps, but Astranaar/Crossroad raids are not entirely atypical.\nDig sites.\nAshenvale has four [[dig site]]s:\n[[File:Warsong Lumber Camp.jpg|thumb|Warsong Lumber Camp.]]\nIn the RPG.\nAshenvale Forest is also the term used for the larger forested region which includes most of western Hyjal including Azshara.\nDescription.\nIn addition to bears and great cats prowling the dense woodlands, hulking beak-faced [[wildkin]] forage throughout Ashenvale. Vicious harpies are known to make massive nests in the tops of the tallest trees. They hunt at dawn and dusk when the light filtering through the canopy throws the forest into a confusion of shifting shadows. [[Ancient]]s - sentient trees who act as wardens of the forest - roam Ashenvale as well. Ashenvale is under the protection of ancients and the night elf sentinels. Neither had established a community as such within the forest, though, preferring to leave the vast woodlands in its natural state. Ashenvale boasted no cities; the old forest's inhabitants are primarily beasts, and there are few humanoid settlements. It is devoid of any notable ruins. Travelers through Ashenvale should treat these forces with respect, especially if they hope to reach their destination. The ancients a Cnd night elf sentinels guard Ashenvale zealously with constant patrols. Any who threaten the forest - cutting down live trees, poaching beasts of the forest, and the like - are met with the ancients' powerful attacks and the sentinels' deadly arrows. The only unified night elf presence dwelling in Ashenvale is a reclusive group of rangers, the Farstriders. They use the terrain and train other inhabitants in their specialized skills. They hold a difference of opinion amongst themselves regarding strangers in Ashenvale. Some believe that their duty is to welcome and protect travelers, as long as they show no threat to the forest. Others see any strangers as unwelcome interlopers who must be \u201cescorted\u201d to the southern border. Still, whatever their opinion on Ashenvale, the Farstriders bow to the wishes of the ancients and the sentinels.

Ashenvale is also the term used for the larger forested region which includes most of western Hyjal including Azshara. It is the ancestral homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who remain in control of several holdings through the zone, including &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Grove\"&gt;Silverwing Grove&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aessina\"&gt;Shrine of Aessina&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has more recently established a settlement in the eastern part of the woods \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as well as a smaller camp on the western beach \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt; - along with several Warsong camps situated from &lt;a href=\"Kargathia%20Keep\"&gt;Kargathia Keep&lt;/a&gt; all through the southeast to the &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Rampart\"&gt;Mor'shan Rampart&lt;/a&gt; in the far south. The zone is heavily populated with &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, and wild creatures such as &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s. The region is quite large, and running from the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; is quite an undertaking.\nSince the zone is &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; there is often a lot of skirmishing going on throughout the woods, and attacks on the faction-based settlements are not uncommon. The zone is also a major travel hub for both &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, even at higher levels.\nHistory.\nAshenvale is an ancient forest, and has been in the caring hands of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years. It was not until more recent years that things changed, with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s lumber harvesting camps, as well as other much more insidious groups. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; have holdings in &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Scar%20Shrine\"&gt;Fire Scar Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felfire%20Hill\"&gt;Felfire Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;Demon Fall Canyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Ridge\"&gt;Demon Fall Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. The vile &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; inhabit ancient elven ruins at &lt;a href=\"Xavian\"&gt;Xavian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Run\"&gt;Night Run&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Satyrnaar\"&gt;Satyrnaar&lt;/a&gt;. The vicious &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; have taken over an ancient shrine near &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, cursed green dragonkin have slipped out from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; portal at &lt;a href=\"Bough%20Shadow\"&gt;Bough Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, and corruption taints the once-clear waters of &lt;a href=\"Iris%20Lake\"&gt;Iris Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Ruins%20of%20Stardust\"&gt;the Ruins of Stardust&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have seized control of several holdings in the eastern parts of the forest, and beyond their base at &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;, they have harvested the trees for lumber at the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Labor%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Labor Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde clash with the Night Elves over control of Eastern Ashenvale, with the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; vowing to continue their lumber harvesting operations, and the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; vowing to drive the Outriders from their lands once and for all.\nAshenvale is a vast primordial wilderness long given over to beasts and nature\u2019s savage ways. The night elves who settled on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; hunted in Ashenvale\u2019s wilds but never settled within its borders. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves ceased even hunting in order to battle the demons. The lack of hunting has allowed many creatures to live and thrive within the vast woodland, creating danger for all who venture into the forest. Ashenvale forest runs in a great arc south of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; directly south. The ruined lands of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; lie across a river to the east. Ashenvale is an old forest, long untouched by any mortal race. The weather is fairly mild, though rain is almost constant. The woods are so old and thickly grown that only trickles of precipitation get through the thick canopy. The forest has become ever wilder since left to its own devices after the start of the Third War. Any roads through are overgrown, some even impassable. In contrast, the game trails see increased traffic as beasts living in the shelter of the massive trees grow in number and boldness. Those traveling through Ashenvale will wisely keep their guard up at all times. In recent years, the demons and satyr have corrupted parts of Ashenvale, and other parts of it are cut down by the Horde to fuel their expansion efforts. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, too, have begun experimenting on sleeping druids within the &lt;a href=\"Dor%27Danil%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Dor'Danil Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt;, unbeknownst to the Horde but not the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to bears and great cats prowling the dense woodlands, hulking beak-faced &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; forage throughout Ashenvale.

The volcano is being controlled by Lord Magmathar and with the help of the other three elements (earth, water, wind), players defeat him.\n&lt;a href=\"Faldreas%20Goeth%27Shael\"&gt;Faldreas Goeth'Shael&lt;/a&gt; sends players to find his friends the Edunes and while doing so, players help prevent a demonic attack on Ashenvale together with the Ancient &lt;a href=\"Big%20Baobob\"&gt;Big Baobob&lt;/a&gt;.\nForest Song.\nThe quests here involve fighting satyr in the two camps west of Forest Song, &lt;a href=\"Satyrnaar\"&gt;Satyrnaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xavian\"&gt;Xavian&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Architect%20Nemos\"&gt;Architect Nemos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kayneth%20Stillwind\"&gt;Kayneth Stillwind&lt;/a&gt; start the Satyrnaar quests, collecting the ancient artifact the Chalice of Elune from there:\n&lt;a href=\"Illiyana\"&gt;Illiyana&lt;/a&gt; starts the Xavian quests, retrieving the Branch of Cenarius and slaying the Satyr present in the area:\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Shameful%20Waste\"&gt;A Shameful Waste&lt;/a&gt; is turned in to &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt;, letting the player proceed there.\nWarsong Lumber Camp.\n&lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Luciel%20Starwhisper\"&gt;Sentinel Luciel Starwhisper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt; start the Horde chain, destroying the Lumber Camp with the help of the Horde's conveniently-placed explosive barrels:\n&lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Vedaar\"&gt;Vindicator Vedaar&lt;/a&gt; and Gnarl start the Legion chain, which then unlocks the Dor'Danil Barrow Den chain. In it, players fight against the forces of the Burning Legion being pulled in through portals in the area. While fighting, they discover the Legion's intention to invade Forest Song and put a stop to those plans. Then players head into the Dor'Danil Barrow Den to retrieve the Forest Heart so Gnarl may purify it of the Horde's corruption.\nReturn to Astranaar to get to the final part of the Ashenvale experience.\nRaynewood Tower.\nPlayers come to Raynewood Tower on &lt;a href=\"He%20Who%20Would%20Be%20Forgiven\"&gt;He Who Would Be Forgiven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20Delivery\"&gt;Dryad Delivery&lt;/a&gt; along larger quest chains. There is also a small self-contained quest chain here, defending the Raynewood Tower from Horde attackers.\nStardust Spire.\nThis chain starts at &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Thenysil\"&gt;Sentinel Thenysil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;. It concludes the Ashenvale storyline for the Alliance and moves on to the next zone, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Velene%20Starstrike\"&gt;Sentinel Velene Starstrike&lt;/a&gt; offers &lt;a href=\"Rebels%20Without%20a%20Clue\"&gt;Rebels Without a Clue&lt;/a&gt;, a breadcrumb to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn%20storyline\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn storyline&lt;/a&gt;, should the player prefer to continue questing in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nThis storyline features players investigating the Goblin Skunkworks and finding a massive bomb, appropriately called &lt;a href=\"The%20Bomb\"&gt;The Bomb&lt;/a&gt;. It is later carried onwards into the Stonetalon Mountains.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Do%20Yourself%20a%20Favor\"&gt;Do Yourself a Favor&lt;/a&gt;, the player briefly enters the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; zone, but with no way down further forward except by jumping down the cliff. The player then \"officially\" proceeds into that zone with &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Legacy\"&gt;Hellscream's Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, and the quest chain continues into the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20storyline\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains storyline&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "424836", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=424836", "title": "Ashenvale war", "text": "The conflict in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was one of the three main fronts of the war (the others being &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, under the new leadership of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, launched many major campaigns into &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient homeland of the night elves, in order to gain more &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde, due to the depletion of resources in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. These campaigns happened in two main stages, both happening after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Ashenvale offensive.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;'s elven defenses weakened, newly-appointed Warchief of the Horde Garrosh Hellscream finally decided to take the night elven forest for the Horde. Garrosh personally led his troops into the neighboring borders of Ashenvale.\nWhile his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; had made considerable progress over the course of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, it is a far cry from the ambitions that Warchief Hellscream desired to achieve. Garrosh planned to create a massive city in the heart of the forest, one with the potential to rival &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in size and power. With rich minerals ripe for the taking, and all of the tools needed to see his people grow, Garrosh surged viciously through the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; ranks and cut a swathe of destruction straight to the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Outpost\"&gt;Silverwing Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Having brought down a number of tamed &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; captives from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; that he domesticated by holding their young hostage and with goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel on his side, Garrosh planned to see his dreams of expansion realized.\nHis attack on the Outpost results in a decisive Horde victory. Garrosh reflects on how the forest that gave &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; such harsh resistance is falling, piece by piece, and wonders what the mighty Grom would have made of this triumph. He concludes that not even Thrall could deny his prowess at this point, and will hail him as the champion of the orcish race and the entire Horde. Garrosh's plan is twofold \u2014 he had gained knowledge of a meeting between the leaders of the Alliance and strikes at this point in order to lure out &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. As he had expected, the priestess \u2014 along with Alliance reinforcements \u2014 arrives on the scene to relieve the waning sentinels, though the Horde unleashes the magnataur upon the Alliance's ranks. In the ensuing chaos, Tyrande is struck down and wounded by orc archers. Confident in a victory, Garrosh himself enters the fray.\nThe battle is interrupted by the arrival of worgen reinforcements led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, who proceed to fight back several magnataur. On several occasions, Garrosh and Varian clashed and did battle; with both leaders matching each other's attack, blow by blow, and killing all who interfered with their duel. Though evenly matched at first, Varian eventually gained an advantage. Varian had been fighting with an in-explicit focus and unyielding vigor. While Garrosh tired, Varian was still full of stamina, which allowed Varian to press on his attack. Garrosh is fought back at this point, and Varian succeeds in wounding him and disarming Gorehowl. A dying magnataur separates the two combatants, and Garrosh composes himself. He prepares to rush at Varian once more, though is held back by several &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;; urging Garrosh to retreat. Garrosh grudgingly complies, though not before swearing to kill Varian himself.\nSince then, General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; has taken advantage of their victory at Ashenvale to commission more fortifications and outposts at Ashenvale's Alliance-controlled borders. Yet the night elves' troubles are far from over, as an enormous volcano has erupted in central Ashenvale. As the night elves struggle to deal with the chaos caused by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde is seizing what it perceives to be a golden opportunity.\nSecond Ashenvale offensive.\nFollowing the Cataclysm, Garrosh took on the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, and as one of his first campaigns, he led the Horde in taking &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde, with the help of his new goblin allies. After a successful attack on &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was able to take control of all of Azshara. As the grip of the Horde tightened in northern Kalimdor, the night elves began to test the defenses of the Horde outposts in Ashenvale, attempting to siege both the &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Ramparts\"&gt;Mor'shan Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;. To counter this move by the Alliance, the Horde sent out a call for able-bodied warriors from the Northern Barrens. The Heroes were quickly put to work at the ramparts by &lt;a href=\"Kadrak\"&gt;Kadrak&lt;/a&gt;, who tasked the adventurers with killing the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Skirmisher\"&gt;Ashenvale Skirmisher&lt;/a&gt;s and Bowmen attacking the post. In the brief lull in battle which followed, the Horde adventurers assisted in gathering resources at the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Labor%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Labor Camp&lt;/a&gt;, bringing supplies back to the Ramparts to help repair. Finally, the adventurers killed the Sentinel Commander at &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Sky%20Lake\"&gt;Fallen Sky Lake&lt;/a&gt;.\nPushing north from the Ramparts, the Horde took control of Silverwing Outpost with a small raiding group, thus capturing the night elves forward command post in the region, and in the process of taking the post, many sentinels were killed along with one of the Silverwing Commanders. Kodo caravans pushed north from the recaptured &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Ramparts\"&gt;Mor'shan Ramparts&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the siege of Splintertree Post. The breaking of the siege was followed by a string of victories, between an &lt;a href=\"Durak%20%28demon%29\"&gt;orcish warlock&lt;/a&gt; poisoning the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Heart\"&gt;Forest Heart&lt;/a&gt; with the blood of fallen sentinels, and the usage of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic to kill off the remains of the night elven besiegers.\nAlthough the adventurers who assisted the warlock were sent to Hellscream for judgment, they were pardoned from their crimes, on the condition that the &lt;a href=\"Durak%20%28demon%29\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; who tasked them with using fel magic would be killed. The adventurers complied, and the warlock (Who turned out to be a demon), was killed. However, the forest heart remained poisoned until much later in the war, which sapped the energy and the spirit of the night elves and their &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; allies. Next, the Horde adventurers were tasked with helping Horde covert operatives in dismantling the siege of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the death of the sin'dorei ambassador stationed in the keep, the Horde was successful in breaking the siege. With the successful defense of Splintertree and the Lumber Camp, the Horde was free to continue the push west.\nAfter the sieges of Splintertree and &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; were broken, eastern Ashenvale was under complete Horde control, save for &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Song\"&gt;Forest Song&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde armies pressed westward, taking control of &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt; by using a corrupted form of a water elemental, and also began an attack on &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Retreat\"&gt;Raynewood Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing the defenses of &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Tower\"&gt;Raynewood Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and killing many of the druids and &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt; stationed at the Retreat. However, the Horde was not able to deliver the finishing blow at Raynewood, as the Druid leader continued to revive the Dryad defenders of the post. The Horde even started firebombing &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, and with victory in sight, they moved in to take &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few remaining Alliance encampments. If Maestra's Post fell, all of Darkshore and eventually Teldrassil would be vulnerable to continued Horde attacks. While the siege of Maestra's Post was beginning, the goblin engineers at the captured Alliance base of Silverwind Refuge were finishing up a giant bomb, engineered with the same new type of blasting powder used in the firebombing of Astranaar. This bomb was designed to be used on the night elves in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, who were defending the mountains from the invading armies of &lt;a href=\"Krom%27gar%20Fortress\"&gt;Krom'gar Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the Horde battalions started to move south to reinforce Krom'gar's army in Stonetalon, bringing the bomb south with them.\nThis success was short-lived, however, as the mobilized armies of the &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; were able to break the siege of Maestra's Post, and pushed the Horde out of &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, also setting out the fires that the Horde had started. By pushing the Horde out of the city of Astranaar, the Alliance armies were able to free up enough resources to reinforce Raynewood retreat. The Alliance adventurers and sentinels took on the form of the Ancient spirit of Shadumbra to break the siege, killing almost all of the Horde forces attacking in a brutal display of druidic magic. Shortly after the siege of Rayneewood was broken, Alliance heroes rebuilt &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;Dartol's Rod&lt;/a&gt; which allowed them control over the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s that the Horde had imprisoned near Silverwind refuge. The Alliance heroes commanded the controlled furbolgs to weaken the Horde army there enough to allow the Sentinel's to retake the camp. The Alliance military moved back eastward, cleansing the tainted forest heart, reinforcing Forest Song, and even renewing the siege of the Warsong Lumber Camp. At this point, only pockets of Horde resistance remained, bringing the war full circle, in favor of the Alliance.\nDuring the siege of Orgrimmar, the night elven sentinels were probably able to push through eastern Ashenvale as they reached Orgrimmar, bringing the gates of the city down with Glaive throwers. The treaty that followed Azshara remains firmly in the hands of the Horde after the battle of &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt;, and the treaty of Orgrimmar also re-affirmed the Horde's claims on Azshara, in return for the relinquishment of Horde outposts in Ashenvale."}

In time, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; fled to Auchindoun to take shelter from the pursuing &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armies. They had been unaware of the presence of other orcs here, but Vorpil and Blackheart welcomed them. When presented with news of the betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, Vorpil pledged himself to Ner'zhul. When Danath broke into Auchindoun to rescue &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt;, Vorpil and Blackheart fought to stop them, but were beset by ghosts of dead &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. In the confusion, Danath slew Kilrogg Deadeye in single combat. Ner'zhul and Gorefiend teleported themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and Vorpil and Blackheart fled back into the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Shadow Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;. Till this day they remain there, tampering with cosmic forces such as &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;. Their followers form what is known as the Cabal.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When the orcish Horde first invaded Azeroth through the Dark Portal, two Shadow Council members instead turned their attentions to the ancient draenei burial grounds of Auchindoun. The unquiet spirits in the area proved to be excellent subjects for the warlock Blackheart to perfect his mind control abilities.\"\nStrategy.\nRoom clearing.\nAll of the mobs in the room will aggro when you start combat with him so the room must be fully cleared. In addition to the Instructors and the nasty four and five-pulls, there are one to several wandering stealthed Assassins that must be dealt with before you start the fight.\nGeneral strategy.\nThis boss does rather low amounts of melee damage (in Normal mode) and as long as the Tank has aggro he can be nuked down fairly quickly. During the fight, along with the Incite Chaos party MC, he will also periodically do a War Stomp/AoE Knockback that will kick anyone near him back a significant distance and reduce their aggro significantly. This often happens in combination with a Charge ability, making it extremely difficult at times for the Tank to hold the boss. It is a good idea to position the boss in a corner so the Tank isn't knocked completely out of range by the stomp and can more easily reestablish aggro. Popular spots for this include the left mound behind him and the doorway behind him. The Knockback also does a fair amount of damage, so it is best for anyone who does not need to be in melee range to be well away from him.\nA lot of his abilities during this fight reduce or erase the aggro table. Incite Chaos will completely reset the table, while his Knockback and Charge abilities cause significant aggro reductions. After these abilities are used, it is critical for the party to step back and let the Tank reestablish his hold on the Inciter. Stop attacks and heals and run towards the Tank so he can pick up Inciter. In normal mode there is some leeway because he does not hit all that hard, groups running Shadow Labs in Heroic mode need to get this down pat because he can two or three shot clothies if he is left on them too long. Keeping the Tank topped off with HoT's can help a lot with this so that healers do not draw aggro during this time. Lifebloom is particularly useful as the ending tick dumps some aggro onto the Tank.\nThe standard strategy is to have the tank hold him against the wall on top of the left mound behind him. The rest of the party stands on the right mound and does damage. When the tank loses aggro, this arrangement makes it easy to pick Inciter back up, especially if the tank is a Warrior who can Intervene to grab him very quickly.\nIncite Chaos.\nThe main ability of this boss is a 15-second Party Mind Control called Incite Chaos in which he stands back and laughs at you while you merrily beat each other to death. The ability not only causes your party to turn against one another, it also completely wipes the aggro table. This turns the fight into more of an endurance test and test of your healers than a brute force fight, as high-DPS parties are apt to kill one another very quickly during Incite Chaos. Some general tips for surviving it:\nAfter the MC the party will need to pause for a bit and let the Tank re-establish aggro on Inciter. There are only 40 seconds between each Incite Chaos, so once the Tank has some hate built up, it is important for the party to start slowly ramping up damage on the boss as soon as possible.\nAlternate strategies.\nCubby hole.\nDrag him to the cubby hole area on the right side of the room. Place the group with their backs to the pillar and the tank on the outer wall. This positioning allows all party members to dps (particularly those who need to stand at his back), prevents line of sight issues, and tends to limit the scattering caused by the group mind control. It is still a long fight, but positioning the boss in this way is much easier on the tank.\nAnother approach is to fight him at the back of the room (at the exit door). When he walks to the right side of the platform, the party can run to the back on the left side. If you stand at the exit door, he will not aggro until you are ready to fight. This positioning works extremely well to mitigate knock backs and scattering, although it does not allow players to fight him from behind. The Cubby Hole strategy is excellent, but difficult to get a PUG to do. Telling everyone to follow you around to the back of the room has the advantage of simplicity for even the most lackluster players.\nHigh DPS.\nThe logic to this strategy is twofold. One is that Blackheart doesn't hit hard at all. This allows any DPS class, even clothies, to absorb hits without getting two shotted. The second point is that Blackheart wastes the healer's mana already on mana intensive spells like &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt;. It is better to waste your mana healing than doing damage to your friends, right?\nFor this strategy, you still need to blow short cooldowns that last less than 10 seconds like &lt;a href=\"Adrenaline%20Rush\"&gt;Adrenaline Rush&lt;/a&gt;. However, cooldowns that last longer, like &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;, should not be wasted. Healers should not be afraid to use their top heal per second heals.\nWhen you engage Blackheart, give your tank 2 seconds to get one sunder, or whatever aggro holding move on Blackheart. Then go all out, using all your short cooldowns. Don't worry about pulling aggro. Blackheart hits like a chump. Just lay it all at him. Blackheart will randomly mind control you after a few seconds of beatings. \nAfter the first mind control, wait one second for the tank to try to hold aggro. If the tank doesn't, don't worry. Just lay it on Blackheart. Again, if you pull aggro, the healer should not worry about wasting mana. Its going to be wasted anyways. \nAt the 3rd mind control, you should have Blackheart at less than 60%. If you don't, then you either don't have enough DPS, or you are waiting too long to DPS. After the 3rd mind control, the healer needs to use his/her mana regaining ability. If it's a priest, shadow fiend. If it's a druid, innervate. If it's a shaman, mana pot (or mana tide). If it's a Paladin, pot. At this stage, your DPS again needs to go all out. Don't worry about heals. They will keep coming. \nAfter he gets his 4th mind control off, it's do or die. The healer is probably out of mana at this point. If he isn't a resto shaman, paladin, druid, or priest, he probably wasted his potion cooldown timer. If the healer can use something like wardrums, or dark runes, or any alternative mana regaining ability, use it now. All DPS needs to bandage, and then DPS Blackheart down. If you don't down him this try, or get him down to at least 2-5%, it's a wipe.\nRogue Garrotte.\nA properly timed rogue garrotte may be able to delay or reset the timer on Incite Chaos.\nSpeculation.\nBefore joining the Shadow Council, he may have been a part of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "13921", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13921", "title": "Blackrock Depths", "text": "Blackrock Depths is the deepest part of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; who were led by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. Several minions of the Firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; also make their home in these lava-lined depths.\nThe depths have many sections, including a prison, &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;, a vast capital of the Dark Iron dwarves, and the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt; tavern. Much of the depths was built by &lt;a href=\"Franclorn%20Forgewright\"&gt;Franclorn Forgewright&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nBlackrock Depths is currently the largest 5-man instance in the game, and is likely to remain so, making it a true wonder of the World of Warcraft. The average time to complete the entire instance is 4\u20136 hours due to its complexity: a large amount of mobs and bosses, several scripts, and many quests. The enemy level range is 48-56, and the minimum level requirement to enter is level 42. Although the minimum requirement is level 42, it generally is not a good idea to enter BRD before around level 53, since a player's pull circle will likely be too wide for the mobs within the instance. The Anvilrage Military are not to be underestimated either, particularly the Officers (who have Divine Shield) and the Medics who can heal their troops.\nBRD is not visited as often these days as it used to be, since most players choose to level to 58 as fast as possible, and then go to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The rewards for Outland's initial quests also render any of BRD's gear obsolete, so the drops here are only of interest to twinks. Farming for &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Weapon\"&gt;Fiery Weapon&lt;/a&gt; enchanting recipe may still be useful, since it is commonly used with low level twinks. In &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Blackrock Depths attracted more interest, mainly because of the instance clearing achievement. Also, the schematic for &lt;a href=\"Field%20Repair%20Bot%2074A\"&gt;Field Repair Bot 74A&lt;/a&gt; is wanted, since the famous 4th generation repair bot &lt;a href=\"Jeeves\"&gt;Jeeves&lt;/a&gt; requires 2 of them.\nThe instance is almost entirely soloable (for Rogues or Hunters, at least, and probably most melee classes) by about tier 5 (level 70), although it is not economically efficient to do so. While there is money to be made here (especially for miners), the sheer size of the instance and the comparatively low level of the mobs mean that there are better instances for farming (notably &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;). By level 80, the instance is easily soloable. BRD (and the rest of the Blackrock Mountain complex) is well worth at least one visit. These instances represented the original game's endgame content, and were made with a high level of quality.\nHistory.\nThe volcanic Blackrock Depths are immense tunnels beneath Blackrock Mountain, the home of the Dark Iron dwarves, and the site of the black forge they use to smelt their namesake ore. The Dark Iron dwarves have claimed the depths under the banner of their emperor, Dagran Thaurissan. Thaurissan is the latest in a line of dwarven sorcerer-thanes to serve in the shadow of the demigod Ragnaros, foolishly summoned to Azeroth by Thaurissan's ancestors hundreds of years ago. Though the dwarves dominate Blackrock Depths, they worship and labor for Ragnaros's mighty fire elementals, who guide the already ill-tempered and maligned Dark Irons towards increasingly dangerous and apocalyptic acts.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The smoldering Blackrock Depths are home to the Dark Iron dwarves and their emperor, Dagran Thaurissan. Like his predecessors, he serves under the iron rule of Ragnaros the Firelord, a merciless being summoned into the world centuries ago. The presence of chaotic elementals has attracted Twilight's Hammer cultists to the mountain domain. Along with Ragnaros' servants, they have pushed the dwarves toward increasingly destructive ends that could soon spell doom for all of Azeroth.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; was killed here, when &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; team to assassinate him and retrieve his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;, who had been captured. She, however, initially refused to leave.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; informed King Magni that &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; was captured by Dark Iron dwarves in the depths. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; and his allies rode to Blackrock Depths and rescued Windsor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the cavern was entered by the Alliance and Horde to kill &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ambassador%20Flamelash\"&gt;Grand Ambassador Flamelash&lt;/a&gt;.\nMoira later did return to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and after the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron clan joined the Alliance.\nHowever, as Moira's grip on the Dark Irons was tenuous, more of her people were falling away from her rule with each day, joining the Twilight's Hammer whose emissaries continued to operate in the Depths. Adventurers sent from Stormwind and Orgrimmar were tasked with thwarting the Twilight's Hammer and Dark Iron alliance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, several parts of the depths were invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, and a group known as &lt;a href=\"Shadowy%20Figures\"&gt;Shadowy Figures&lt;/a&gt; also appeared in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Law\"&gt;Ring of the Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nBlackrock Depths is located inside the lowest part of Blackrock Mountain. To reach it, you will need to cross the chain to the central island, then follow the path downward to a ledge just above the lava. Follow the ledge into and through the &lt;a href=\"Grinding%20Quarry\"&gt;Grinding Quarry&lt;/a&gt; to find the instance portal.\nDungeon Finder tips.\nIf you encounter BRD when you enter it through the Dungeon Finder, you can be dropped into 2 parts: The Lower City and the Upper City. There is no sure way of knowing which you have entered but killing the end-bosses of the parts. Clues to the part you are on can be found inside the Dungeon Finder\u2014if Blackrock Depths - Upper City shows a lock in the Specific Dungeons part, then you are definitely in the Blackrock Depths - Detention Block. Additionally, if there are no players less than level 54, then you are definitely on Blackrock Depths - Upper City.\nLower City.\nTo complete the Lower City, go straight forward from the entrance portal into the cellblocks and take to the right and kill &lt;a href=\"High%20Interrogator%20Gerstahn\"&gt;High Interrogator Gerstahn&lt;/a&gt;. She is the Boss who drops the Satchel. This part is normally chosen while still at the lower level range for the dungeon.\nUpper City.\nTo complete the Upper City, players must kill &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014this may be an ideal time to use the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Mole%20Machine\"&gt;Abandoned Mole Machine&lt;/a&gt; near the portal entrance, to shorten the length of time clearing the dungeon.\nNote: Players will not receive a Satchel for killing the \"wrong\" boss\u2014it will be one or the other depending on which one the dungeon finder selected.\nDungeon denizens.\nThe depths are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, their demonic &lt;a href=\"bloodhound\"&gt;bloodhound&lt;/a&gt; pets, their &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt; creations, and their fire elemental allies. There is also a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; ambassadors inside the city and the detention block area. The dwarves in the Depths consist primarily of warrior and priest types with a handful of paladins. Outside Shadowforge City, the dwarves are all elite. Inside the city, one can find groups of two to three elite dwarves and Twilight cultists surrounded by a cadre of non-elite citizens. Some other humanoid races appear in the city and in the Ring of Law event.\nThe demonic bloodhounds in the Depths are renowned for their ability to sniff out stealthed rogues and druids. They will sometimes appear as a separate pack of three, and sometimes included in a group patrolling alongside a dwarf. All of the dogs are non-elite, but their damage capability in large numbers is not to be underestimated. The golems and fire elementals in the Depths generally fit the stereotypes of their types. The golems are strong and well-armored melee attackers, though some exceptional specimens have the ability to release single-target or area-of-effect fire spells. The fire elementals dish out large amounts of fire damage with melee attacks and ranged fire spells.\nProfessions.\nDark Iron.\nBlackrock Depths is one of the two where &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Ore\"&gt;Dark Iron Ore&lt;/a&gt; can be mined reliably, the other location being &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. Blackrock Depths is also the location of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Forge\"&gt;Black Forge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Forge, located at the far back of the dungeon near a portal to Molten Core, is the only place where dark iron ore can be smelted into bars. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the center of the dungeon, where &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; patrols. It is required for most crafting recipes that use dark iron bars. As such, a run in BRD is essential to most &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; work which uses that rare metal. Since these recipes are principally armor with heavy fire resistance values, they are not frequently crafted anymore except for novelty.\nBlacksmithing.\nScattered around Blackrock Depths are &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing%20Plans%20%28object%29\"&gt;Blacksmithing Plans&lt;/a&gt; which appear as scrolls that can be clicked on with a gear icon. Only a high level Blacksmith should click on these plans, if anyone without high level blacksmithing attempts to use them \"the plans will be destroyed\". Opening the scroll will teach you one of the following BoP plans:\nPlaces to find different plans:\nEngineering.\nSeveral engineering schematics are available only in the Depths.\nTailoring.\n&lt;a href=\"Overmaster%20Pyron\"&gt;Overmaster Pyron&lt;/a&gt;, who patrols in the &lt;a href=\"Masonary\"&gt;Masonary&lt;/a&gt; in front of the instance, drops .\nBrewfest.\nCelebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, the Brewfest is a time to enjoy the fermented fruits of the harvest. Players can venture to Blackrock Depths and defeat &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt; to get epic loot. The &lt;a href=\"Keg-Shaped%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt; is gained when defeating him the first time every day, which can contain an epic mount. The mount is not a guaranteed drop, but the mounts are \"not\" faction-specific. Players from either side stand a chance at looting the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brewfest%20Kodo\"&gt;Great Brewfest Kodo&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Swift Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBlackrock Deeps is a dungeon located under the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; fortress. One of the more talented masons of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Franclorn%20Forgewright\"&gt;Franclorn Forgewright&lt;/a&gt;, created this dungeon after &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; was summoned. Rumor has it that Ragnaros dwells here with the remaining &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; who do his bidding. No one can get inside, though any who try and manage to survive babble about armies made of &lt;a href=\"War%20golem\"&gt;moving stone&lt;/a&gt;. One wonders what Ragnaros plans to do with this army once he retakes the fortress from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;draconic forces&lt;/a&gt; that control the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;upper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Their cell doors can be opened with lockpicking or its alternatives, or with the &lt;a href=\"Prison%20Cell%20Key\"&gt;Prison Cell Key&lt;/a&gt; which can be obtained from , at the center of this area. The key is a white item which is always dropped, and can be picked up by any player with loot rights. It persists beyond the instance, so there is no need to kill Gerstahn for the key on subsequent trips, though she does drop decent loot. Note that the key is placed automatically in your keyring rather than in your bags.\nIf the players' goal is to free Marshal Windsor for his escort quest &lt;a href=\"Jail%20Break%21\"&gt;Jail Break!&lt;/a&gt;, they should first clear the entire detention block of enemies. Once the quest begins he will walk through nearly every part of this area on his way out, leaving the players little time to heal and buff between encounters. In particular, clear out the locked store room on the west side of the detention block loop where Windsor's belongings are kept before starting the escort quest, as the event will spawn additional mobs in that area, making it a very difficult pull. Once Windsor steps out of his cell, he walks clockwise through the Detention Block halls, then across the large entry room, then walks clockwise through the tunnel that is outside the Ring of the Law.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Law\"&gt;Ring of the Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you have the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt; (or lockpicking (skill 250) or its alternatives), you can bypass the Ring of Law event via the west garrison side door. Otherwise, you must run this event to advance in the instance.\nWhen a player stands on the mesh circle at the center of this area, it starts a plot event. The entrance to the ring is closed, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Justice%20Grimstone\"&gt;High Justice Grimstone&lt;/a&gt; appears in the ring. This &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; is flagged red, but cannot be attacked; his purpose is to explain what is about to happen.\nHe releases three waves of non-elite monsters, and then an elite mini-boss. The type of monsters and specific mini-boss which appear vary randomly between several alternatives.\nMonsters: varies. Bats, scorpions, and slimes are all possible.\nMini-Bosses: &lt;a href=\"Anub%27shiah\"&gt;Anub'shiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eviscerator\"&gt;Eviscerator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gorosh%20the%20Dervish\"&gt;Gorosh the Dervish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grizzle\"&gt;Grizzle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hedrum%20the%20Creeper\"&gt;Hedrum the Creeper&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Ok%27thor%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Ok'thor the Breaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the players are victorious in the ring, the ring's entrance reopens, and a second gate also opens, leading to the ring's upper levels and the rest of the instance. The arena spectators on the upper level are normally hostile, but become neutral when the ring event is won.\nAlternate Ring of the Law battle (0.5 upgrade quest chain).\nThis is the Dungeon 2 set upgrade task to kill Theldren's Army and retrieve the Top Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet. To do this, just go in the arena, use the banner while the dwarf is \"sentencing\" you, and destroy all the mobs that come out of the gates.\nNOTE: Do not forget to get the Top Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet from Theldren.\nThese mobs behave like a pvp group with a mage, healer, warrior, rogue, and sometimes a dynamite tossing goblin. Can't taunt them so they go for healers. Not too hard if done with a mage. Every enemy who fights with theldren is immune to a warrior's taunt, so crowd control is a must.\nThe completion of the event spawns a box of loot and you get to keep the banner in case you want to get the loot again in the future.\nLoot of note.\nIf Theldren is killed, an &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Spoils\"&gt;Arena Spoils&lt;/a&gt; chest appears. Rare loot includes:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Highway\"&gt;Dark Iron Highway&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis long stretch of wide pavement is located directly north of the entrance (behind a gate requiring the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt;), and is guarded by patrols of dwarves, dogs, and the occasional fire elemental. At its western end, we find the giant &lt;a href=\"Bael%27Gar\"&gt;Bael'Gar&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern end of the road leads to the Black Anvil.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Vault\"&gt;The Black Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Black Vault houses the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Coffer\"&gt;Dark Coffer&lt;/a&gt; as well as 12 &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Coffer%20Door\"&gt;Relic Coffers&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by &lt;a href=\"Warder%20Stilgiss\"&gt;Warder Stilgiss&lt;/a&gt; and his pet demon hound. Each Relic Coffer can be opened using a &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Coffer%20Key\"&gt;Relic Coffer Key&lt;/a&gt;. If all the Relic Coffers are opened, the 4 golems in the room will come to life and the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Safe\"&gt;Secret Safe&lt;/a&gt; will be revealed, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Heart%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;The Heart of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Coffer\"&gt;Dark Coffer&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis large metal structure stands at the eastern end of the Dark Iron Highway, with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; patrolling around it. This Anvil is required for all &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; recipes involving Dark Iron and for the &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; recipe for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Rifle\"&gt;Dark Iron Rifle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20Forge\"&gt;Black Forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20Forge\"&gt;Black Forge&lt;/a&gt; is used to smelt &lt;a href=\"Dark%20iron\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; into Dark Iron Bars, which are used in several high end &lt;a href=\"Smith\"&gt;Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; recipes. The forge is also required by enchanters to create the &lt;a href=\"Smoking%20Heart%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Smoking Heart of the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; trinket.\nThe forge is located just before the bridge leading into &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, and just after the room of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;. After exiting the room of the seven, turn right, and then immediately left. there will be a small bridge leading to a single fire elemental. The Forge is directly behind him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Crafting\"&gt;Hall of Crafting&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis rocky region is populated with groups of one elite golem and 3 non-elite dwarves. The area is a square staircase leading upward from the Black Anvil to the Shadowforge City. &lt;a href=\"Fineous%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fineous Darkvire&lt;/a&gt; patrols from one end of this area to the other. He is the NPC that drops &lt;a href=\"Ironfel\"&gt;Ironfel&lt;/a&gt;, which is required for a quest to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis area overlooks the Black Anvil, and is divided into two parts. The eastern half connects the Hall of Crafting, Vault and the upper levels of the Ring of the Law. The western half is accessible from the Grim Guzzler back door, and leads to the Chamber of Enchantment.\nThe Shadowforge Lock.\nThe East Garrison, which can be accessed directly from the instance entrance (with the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt;) or from the upper levels of the Ring of the Law, contains the Shadowforge Lock. The lock is not really a lock but a mechanism controlling a movable bridge which connects the upper levels of the Ring of the Law to the Manufactory. This bridge is the only way into the manufactory, and thus the only way to reach the back areas (and final boss) of this instance. Releasing the lock will form the bridge by closing the gates on the Dark Iron Highway, making it impossible to reach the Black Anvil via the Highway (you can still get there via the Shadowforge City east or west halves).\nA player capable of stealth, or any player with an invisibility potion, can release the lock without being detected at level 60 by standing directly in front of the lock while activating it. Prior to level 60, characters may &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; the nearby &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s using this technique depending on their level and care of positioning. The lock can be reached unmolested by jumping off the stairs leading up to the Ring of the Law, but getting back will require stealth or invisibility, or defeating one 3-pack of elite guards.\nPrior to patch 1.11, the Shadowforge Lock was not pickable, nor could it be defeated with blacksmithing keys or seaforium charges.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Manufactory\"&gt;The Manufactory&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis area is full of golems and weapon technicians. At the back stands &lt;a href=\"Golem%20Lord%20Argelmach\"&gt;Golem Lord Argelmach&lt;/a&gt;, flanked by a pair of special golems. Players are advised to clear the Manufactory before fighting him, since the first thing the golem lord does is run through the factory, searching for allies to help him.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Guzzler\"&gt;Grim Guzzler&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Grim Guzzler is a marginally safe haven in the depths. The only way to reach the end of the instance is through its back door on the second level, which DOES NOT use the Shadowforge Key and cannot be picked. The Guzzler is filled with non-hostile non-elite drunken dwarves, with a scattering of named special NPCs, a variety of plot events, and a quest. There are many special circumstances surrounding this area:\nOpening the back door of the bar.\nThe bar's rear exit is on the second level, and blocked with an unpickable door. There are four ways to open it:\nWhen the players leave the bar through the back door, they will find themselves in the second half of the Shadowforged City.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Enchantment\"&gt;Chamber of Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis large platform is entirely empty, except for Ambassador Flamelash standing in the middle. Once he is defeated, players can pass on to the Mold Foundry.\nHave all party members through the doorway, if anyone is standing outside you get elite fire elemental adds instead of the one-shotters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mold%20Foundry\"&gt;Mold Foundry&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis area is small and insignificant, filled with small groups of elite golems and non-elite dwarves. Its only notable feature is its chance to spawn &lt;a href=\"Panzor%20the%20Invincible\"&gt;Panzor the Invincible&lt;/a&gt;. This area leads to the Summoner's Tomb.\n&lt;a href=\"Summoners%27%20Tomb\"&gt;Summoners' Tomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis room is another area which is safe to begin with. It is populated by seven ghostly dwarves, the patriarchs of the Dark Iron nation - and the dwarves who summoned Ragnaros into the world. These dwarves must be killed to pass on to the later areas, but before the attack any miners in the group should speak with &lt;a href=\"Gloom%27rel\"&gt;Gloom'rel&lt;/a&gt; and do his quest, to gain the ability to smelt &lt;a href=\"Dark%20iron\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; ore. When the group is ready, speak to Doom'rel and challenge him.\nOnce the dwarves are defeated, the &lt;a href=\"Chest%20of%20The%20Seven\"&gt;Chest of The Seven&lt;/a&gt; will spawn and the doors will open, allowing access to the Lyceum and the bridge to Molten Core.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Bridge\"&gt;Molten Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo groups of fire elementals stand on this bridge - on the far side, the swirling portal to Molten Core. This is where the &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20to%20the%20Core\"&gt;Attunement to the Core&lt;/a&gt; quest can be completed - the core fragment is on the far side of the bridge, next to the portal. Note that you do not need to enter the core to finish this quest; in fact, if you enter the core by mistake, when you exit the core you will appear outside of the depths, next to the quest giver for the attunement quest. You will then need to run all the way back through the depths to rejoin your group.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lyceum\"&gt;The Lyceum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis room is filled with vast numbers of non-elite, low hp dwarves, linked in groups of 10 or so. These dwarves are on a fast respawn cycle, with a number of patrols wandering through the area. On the far side, the doors to the Iron Hall stand locked and unpickable. Two braziers flank the doors, each guarded by a Flame elemental. Two flamekeepers are within the room at any one time, with about 8 possible spawn points spread around the room. \nTo enter the Iron hall, you must loot a torch from a flamekeeper, and use it to light a brazier. These are five-minute duration, unique, BoP items, that are consumed on use. Once both braziers are lit, the doors open, and the NPCs of the Lyceum stop respawning.\nThe key to this room is to stay together and keep moving, to avoid undue aggro and the (approx) 30second respawns. Even low-level aoe is very useful here, such as a paladin's consecration. Have loot set to free for all, to make torch looting easier.\nSome parties will send a single rogue or druid to kill each flamekeeper and loot the torches, while the rest of the group works their way to the braziers. This is risky because if the stealth class aggroes extra mobs, they will often die, leaving four players to do the work of five. The risk is not worth the lack of reward.\nA better tactic is for the party to stay together, staying to the right wall, until they reach the right brazier on the other side of the room. Rogues are useful here: be on the lookout for the patrols, ready to distract them. There is a safe area on the braziers' platform where approximately lvl 55+ players are safe from the constant respawns and patrols, where the party can rest. From here they work around to the left brazier, where there is a similar safe spot.\nAt this point you will have covered nearly half the spawns of the flamekeepers, and will have otherwise located them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Hall\"&gt;Iron Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis room is lined on both sides with massive statues, and guarded at its end by &lt;a href=\"Magmus\"&gt;Magmus&lt;/a&gt;. Once Magmus aggros, the statues begin to breathe fire about every 10 seconds; players should be careful to stand in the areas between statues to avoid fire damage.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Imperial%20Seat\"&gt;The Imperial Seat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis large room has many mixed groups of dwarves, with &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Princess Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; sitting at the end. The room must be cleared before engaging the emperor, as he will call them all to his aid when he aggros. The princess is a dedicated healer; if the players are attempting the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Royal%20Rescue\"&gt;The Royal Rescue&lt;/a&gt;\" then she must be alive when the emperor is killed.\nShortcuts.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Shadowforge Key is required to access the Manufactory and following areas. A high-level rogue or druid with this key can actually sneak all the way to the Grim Guzzler without fighting anyone or needing to brave the stealth-sniffing dogs. This is useful for rogues who want to farm Plugger for his &lt;a href=\"Barman%20Shanker\"&gt;Barman Shanker&lt;/a&gt;. A hunter can also reach the bar solo through creative use of &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; and his pet. \nThe lava path.\nIf you are aiming for The Emperor, Black Forge or the entrance to MC, you might consider taking the lava path. It begins below the Black Anvil, and ends at the Black Forge, bypassing much of the instance.\nJumping left from the Anvil into the lava is a short swim to a small path that winds around until you come to a ledge under the Chamber of Enhancement (an alternate entrance to the path). Lower-level players may need to deal with incidental elementals that flank this route. There's a long stretch of lava, patrolled by an elemental, that you have to cross to reach an island in the center of the lava, which also has 4 elementals on it. It's best to pull the patrolling elemental and deal with it before crossing. It is possible to avoid all four elementals on the island, or to deal with them individually or in pairs. After that island, it's a short swim until you come up underneath the bridge. Beware of aggroing the 1st 3 elementals on the left.\nThe lava path allows for nice quick runs to 3 of the main objectives in BRD, but it can be dangerous for the inexperienced, or soloing characters. If you are aiming for the Emperor, you will come up before the Lyceum, needing the Shadowforge key to continue, and you cannot move backwards into the room of 7. As described, it is possible currently for the 1st mob you fight in the instance to be the elemental patrolling the lava before the island."}

This zone is deceptively small and appears empty when first entered - however, it was at one point, without doubt, among the most dangerous places in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It was hotly contested between the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; servants on one side and the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; minions on the other. Within these black stones, there are numerous inhabited areas. Inside this unnaturally created volcano is some of the greatest work ever wrought by the dwarves.\nDuring the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, it was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;. While it is unknown whether or not the orcs remain in the spire, the Dark Iron dwarves of Shadowforge City fully aligned themselves with the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;; bringing the lower half of the mountain into Alliance control as the Dark Iron capitol. This is one of the most important areas in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt contains 7 high-level instances:\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe mountain is actually a volcano that was created at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; when the Dark Iron lord, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, accidentally summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; the Firelord from his prison in the Firelands. The power unleashed by his \"rebirth\" was so massive it shattered a large section of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; creating the areas now known as the Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes, creating Blackrock Mountain. Ragnaros enslaved the Dark Iron dwarf clan. They have built a giant city made of tunnels throughout the mountain. The name Blackrock Mountain and Blackrock Spire predates the coming of the orcs.\nThe First and Second Wars.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; was the headquarter of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. When the Shadow Council moved into Blackrock Mountain, they were confronted by the fire elemental and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; minions of Ragnaros. &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; used his fledgling connection to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s to convince the dwarves and Ragnaros's lieutenants, who also served the Old Gods, to let the Shadow Council stay in the upper reaches of the mountain, Blackrock Spire. If the warlocks remained there, they would not be disturbed by Ragnaros or his followers. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was angered that he could not have the whole mountain, but was pleased by Cho'gall's effective diplomacy. However, he was unaware of the true reason it had worked. Once &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; fell, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; led his &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s against the warlocks, killing most of them and capturing Gul'dan.\nAfter learning from &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; about Blackrock Spire, Doomhammer led a large &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; force to storm the volcano. No fire elemental or Dark Iron dwarf barred their way. Soon, the Horde defeated majority of the Shadow Council, while Ragnaros and his minions kept their presence hidden. One of the warlocks to survive was Cho'gall who swore his allegiance to Orgrim. The ogre also introduced Orgrim to the dwarves, who, under Ragnaros' secret command, allowed the Horde to use the spire as its base. The &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; felt it was a good omen that the place bore the same name as his own clan. The spire became the domain of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and the headquarter of the Horde for the Second War.\nBefore the Horde went further north for its assault against the dwarves and humans, Doomhammer made a speech at the foot of Blackrock Spire. Here were introduced Gul'dan's new &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and a hundred &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s had come for the occasion, and the volcano started erupting right as Doomhammer was talking, which was taken by the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; as a sign that the spirits within the mountain were pleased.\nWhen this war was ending, one of the fiercest battles in the history of Azeroth took place here, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde had been defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; following their defeat at the siege, many orcs were caught and put into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, who served as dual chieftains of the defeated &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;, were hunted for two years, and slowly rebuilt their forces with whatever orcs had survived and could make their way to the Steppes, leading to the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; with Rend as its warchief.\nThe Blackrock orcs struck a bargain with the Dark Irons. The dwarves descended even deeper into the mountain, while the orcs occupied the higher levels. However, the bargain was never intended to be kept.\nTwo years later after the Second War, when the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; reopened the Dark Portal, an expedition made up of &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaz%20Soulripper\"&gt;Gaz Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; and several of their finest warriors reached Blackrock to parlay with Rend and Maim, trying to get them back under &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership. The expedition was mostly interested in the Dark Horde's &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, but any help was refused by Warchief Rend, who wanted the Horde of Draenor to fail so that he could gather all its survivors to him and start another war of conquest on the Alliance. The &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; then offered the help of his own flight to Gorefiend, and the Aspect then ordered his son &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; to make his home in the upper reaches of Blackrock Mountain and make this Dark Horde his personal army, in addition to the other black dragons he brought and the experiments he later created.\nAfter the Second War.\nRagnaros and Nefarian waged a brutal war for supremacy and control of the mountain. Ragnaros controlled his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and their various machines and &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as an army of elementals, beasts, and powerful lieutenants such as &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Harbinger\"&gt;Sulfuron&lt;/a&gt;. As an &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;, he also gained the favor of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Nefarian controlled (and still does, in terms of game mechanics) the Dark Horde which consisted of the Blackrock and Black Tooth Grin tribes of orcs, a small army of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his dragon lieutenants and his invention, the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Nefarian himself could be found in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, overlooking the mountain, while Ragnaros lead his own army from the mountain's &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;volcanic core&lt;/a&gt;. The two rivals both hoped to raise a powerful army that could take over Azeroth.\nEven under Nefarian's rule, it was common for the leadership of the Spire to change hands, and before the rise of &lt;a href=\"General%20Drakkisath\"&gt;General Drakkisath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt; ruled it instead.\nThe potent energy of &lt;a href=\"Pyroguard%20Emberseer\"&gt;Pyroguard Emberseer&lt;/a&gt; was being siphoned for use in accelerating the incubation of Nefarian's black dragon eggs.\nThe war was ended with both sides being destroyed by heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; who were able to banish Ragnaros back to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; and kill Rend and Nefarian.\nCataclysm.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s return to Azeroth after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing, the Black Aspect, managed to convince Ragnaros, who was still in the Firelands, to join him in an alliance in order to destroy the mortal races of Azeroth. The Twilight's Hammer clan had set up a base in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Caverns\"&gt;caverns of Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; from where they sought to create a main supply route to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and send the remaining fire elementals to the war zone. Meanwhile, Deathwing's son Nefarian - who after being killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s was raised as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; by Deathwing to continue creating minions - had been plotting his revenge after his shameful defeat. As such, he began creating even more twisted and horrific experiments deep within the halls of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nGiven how Ragnaros and Nefarian served the same master, it's likely that they stopped fighting each other and sought to aid Deathwing in destroying Azeroth instead. While &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28Firelands%20tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; made it his goal to burn &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian was more content with creating &lt;a href=\"Maloriak\"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chimaeron\"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Atramedes\"&gt;creative monstrosities&lt;/a&gt; to further Deathwing's plans. Nefarian eventually &lt;a href=\"Nefarian%27s%20End\"&gt;met his end&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the Alliance and Horde, ending his twisted machinations and experiments permanently. &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; was later permanently destroyed within his fortress, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt; within the Firelands, ending the evils that once occupied the mountain.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Tharbek\"&gt;Commander Tharbek&lt;/a&gt;, leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; took over Blackrock Spire under commands from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. A weapon was set up to destroy &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and most of the surrounding area. The Ironmarch was eventually stopped with the death of their leaders.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Blackrock Depths are claimed by the Alliance as &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; unites the Dark Iron dwarves who had yet to join the Alliance under her.\nSome areas of the mountain were spied on by the Blacktalon operatives serving &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThere are five dungeons in Blackrock Mountain, suitable for players starting level 50 and increasing in difficulty. &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; is a 5-man instance recommended for players level 48-60. &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; is usually divided into two parts: &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; which is a 5-man instance recommended for players level 52-60; &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; is a 10-man raid instance recommended for players level 52-60. &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; is the first 40-man raid instance recommended for players level 60+. &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; is a 40-man raid instance recommended for players level 60+ (after &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; in difficulty). \"\" introduced two more Blackrock dungeons. &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Caverns\"&gt;Blackrock Caverns&lt;/a&gt; is an introductory 5-man dungeon for level 80-81 players and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt; is a 10/25-man raid inspired by Blackwing Lair, and features &lt;a href=\"Nefarian%27s%20End\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; as a boss.\nNotable characters.\nBlackrock Mountain is home to three characters of note:\nQuests.\nFor the most part, no quests occur in Blackrock Mountain itself, though it is a gateway for 4 instances. However, there are a few quests that are categorized as Blackrock Mountains quests, in particular, some of the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%202\"&gt;Dungeon Set 2&lt;/a&gt; quests. These quests are primarily given by &lt;a href=\"Bodley\"&gt;Bodley&lt;/a&gt;, the ghost of a gnome located in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayer versus Player.\nBefore the Burning Crusade expansion was released, Blackrock Mountain was a PvP hotspot (even more intense before Ahn'Qiraj) because Upper Blackrock Spire, Lower Blackrock Spire, Blackrock Depths, Molten Core and Blackwing Lair were (and still are) ALL in Blackrock Mountain. Since these were the most popular instances, many players of both factions would clash here on their route to their instance. Many PvP videos feature extended segments of Blackrock Mountain PvP, or what was known as BRM PvP. If one was going to Blackrock Mountain, one could expect to encounter resistance on the way there. However, with the release of The Burning Crusade, BRM PvP has \"died\" to say the least.\nA more complete explanation of Blackrock Mountain (from Paxton's \"The Death of PvP\"):\n\"Some called this the gauntlet...\"\n\"Everyone from 50-somethings to the fully geared raider frequented this warzone cleverly disguised as a mountain. Some in hopes of acquiring powerful epic item, others to ensure that didn't happen.\"\n\"There were more dangers lurking around every corner in this mountain than to possibly list. Even the most experienced raider couldn't anticipate rogues hidden in these corridors, or the priest hiding in the shadows helplessly tossing mind-controlled opponents into the fiery lava pits below.\"\n\"As with most Pre-TBC content, the objectives and rewards found in this mountain have been trivialized to the extent that there is no motivation for players to come here. Blackrock Mountain may only be remembered for what it was, the destination for end game PvE and high-stakes PvP.\"\nIn the RPG.\nIn Dark Factions.\nBlackrock Mountain is located in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Many people in Khaz Modan and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; will pay adventurers to hunt the monsters in the hills of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, either for pelts, meat or to protect the road. Those braver or stupider may even explore the depths of Blackrock Spire.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s maintain a lasting settlement around the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire%20Foothills\"&gt;Blackrock Spire Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, staying hidden from the road but always keeping watch for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attacks. These orcs are more typical of those during the First and Second wars. Bloodthirsty and savage, they mine the mountains around Blackrock Spire for metals with which to make weapons and armor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; fortress was built in the upper section of the mountain and was intended to be new &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; capital, but the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nefarion\"&gt;Nefarion&lt;/a&gt; drove the dwarves to the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;depths&lt;/a&gt; of the volcano in his attempt to seize the fortress.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"thane\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, summoned the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;war against&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros' arrival melted several mountains in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and forged a great volcano known as Blackrock Spire in the blast's epicenter. Tales circulate of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; living as puppets to Ragnaros, who dwells under the volcano.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s also came here after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and maintain settlements around and within the volcano, the climate being to their liking as it seems. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; conquered Blackrock Spire and used it as a base of operations during the campaign against &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the Second War. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; slew the human hero &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; by the foot of the volcano at the war's end, though Lothar's death turned the tide and spurred the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on to crush the failing Horde.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Blackrock Spire and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;surrounding area&lt;/a&gt; made an appearance as being the lair of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon lived in the upper spire, and the great gates of the &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; were blocked by thorny vines, which &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; destroyed with the &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt; spell. &lt;a href=\"Cow\"&gt;Cow&lt;/a&gt;s were kept nearby in order to feed the black dragon by his &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; servants.\nIn Hearthstone.\nBlackrock Mountain is the titular setting of the of \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". The adventure features a focus on &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;-themed cards and five wings: &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Hidden Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. It ushered in a slur of dragon synergy decks. It focuses on the battle between Ragnaros the Firelord and Nefarian, the son of Deathwing. In the adventure, Nefarian tricks the player into killing Ragnaros, destroying his only competition but alas, Ragnaros would not be so easily defeated, He assists players in the final battle against Nefarian and, in the end, the player wins.\nFilm universe.\nBlackrock Mountain is used as a landmark by when arranging a meeting with the humans of , asking them to meet the \"where the black rock touches the sky\". The black mountain towered over the rocky switchback in which the two parties met, and were ambushed by the other orcs of the .\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They opposed the undead, led by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, claiming to be the true servants of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Their base was located on the eastern part of the map.\nThe Blackrock Slavers, as every subgroup of the Blackrock, had a leader: &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer\"&gt;Far Seer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mazrigos\"&gt;Mazrigos&lt;/a&gt;. They practiced &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlavers and mission objectives.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;archlich&lt;/a&gt; Kel'Thuzad sought a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Gate\"&gt;Demon Gate&lt;/a&gt; which the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Warlocks\"&gt;Blackrock Warlocks&lt;/a&gt; protected. Since the Blackrock Slavers guarded the south entrance of the Warlocks' base, while the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Raiders\"&gt;Blackrock Raiders&lt;/a&gt; guarded the east entrance, the main player (who controlled Arthas, Kel'Thuzad and their undead minions) would have to defeat one of these bases. The most likely thing to happen, though, was that the player would defeat all of the orc bases, since the Slavers, just like all the other Blackrock bases, would constantly send attacks on the undead base, thus making it hard for him to focus on his main objective.\nAttack force.\nLike the majority of the Blackrock subgroups, the Blackrock Slavers had a special unit available for training: the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sapper%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Goblin Sapper&lt;/a&gt; (see the screenshot). Their attacks would consist of those Sappers, as well as &lt;a href=\"Grunt\"&gt;Grunts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20headhunter\"&gt;Troll Headhunters&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally &lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Sappers' only attack was a suicidal blow on a target (causing high damage), they would have to be targeted by spells or air units in order to minimize the damage done."}

It is also a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; hub divided in two large sections, &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. The lower spire is inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; led once by the son of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;. The upper spire comprises members from the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The uppermost sections of the Spire lead into &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe mighty fortress carved within the fiery bowels of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; was designed by the master dwarf-mason, &lt;a href=\"Franclorn%20Forgewright\"&gt;Franclorn Forgewright&lt;/a&gt;. Intended to be the symbol of Dark Iron power, the &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; was held by the sinister dwarves for centuries. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; built its secret refuge in Blackrock Spire. When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; stormed the mountain and defeated the Shadow Council, the Dark Iron dwarves under Ragnaros allowed the Horde to claim the spire as its new headquarters.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; - the cunning son of the Dragon Aspect &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; - had other plans for the great keep. Nefarian and his draconic minions took control of the upper spire and made war on the dwarves' holdings in the mountain's volcanic depths. The dragon has carved out a swath of the spire and set the generals of his increasingly large army - including &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, the warchief of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; - to defend the peak while he continued his sinister experiments. The spawn of Nefarian continued to creep from Blackrock Spire - and did so until the keep was broken.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions sent by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Spire and killed Dal'rend, after which they proceeded to &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; where they killed Nefarian.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe upper spire was claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, an orcish union from a parallel , as a vanguard keep and a site of a terrible scheme to unleash an &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt; upon the mountain and erupt it in order to destroy surrounding areas, including the human &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; as an act of revenge by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. His ally, &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, Warlord of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, is overseeing the operation alongside &lt;a href=\"Tharbek\"&gt;Tharbek&lt;/a&gt;, commander of the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; expeditionary forces. Some of the black dragonflight's underlings have also remained inside, such as &lt;a href=\"Kyrak\"&gt;Kyrak&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBlackrock Spire was built by &lt;a href=\"Franclorn%20Forgewright\"&gt;Franclorn Forgewright&lt;/a&gt; with the intend on making this grand fortress as the new home of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; after the summoning of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; destroyed much of the mountain range. &lt;a href=\"Nefarion\"&gt;Nefarion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; lieutenant, had other plans, and drove the dwarves to the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in his attempt to seize the fortress. He and his forces cannot take the lower depths of the complex, as Ragnaros still wields power there.\nThe Dark Irons shaped cooling lava to form the foundation for this fortress, and it is a wonder. Barely visible from the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Span\"&gt;Molten Span&lt;/a&gt;, it stands black and foreboding. Dragon sentries man the walls, and the black &lt;a href=\"obsidian\"&gt;obsidian&lt;/a&gt; seems to suck the light in from all surrounding areas. The dragons delight in attacking travelers, so leaving the road may be a bad idea in this area."}

Players should stay at the southern end of the stadium until everyone is inside. If someone moves to the center of the room, the Rend event will start and the southern gate will shut. Anyone outside the gate will not be able to help during the fights.\nIt's also possible to enter the arena by dropping down from the western balcony. Player should drop down to the southern end in order to prevent the event from start prematurely. Once the event starts, orcs will appear on the balcony to cheer. Any players caught on the balcony when the orcs appear will be attacked. Anyone with a pet should dismiss the pet before dropping down. If they don't, the pet could run around and try to enter the arena from the southern gate and drag lots of enemies along the way.\nRend Event.\nOnce a player moves to the center of the stadium, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Victor%20Nefarius\"&gt;Lord Victor Nefarius&lt;/a&gt; (aka &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; will appear on the eastern balcony while many cheering orcs will appear on the western balcony. Nefarian will taunt the players and start sending waves of creatures from the northern gate. You will have a few waves of 1 elite/multiple non-elites, then a few waves of 2 elites/multiple non-elites, and finally a few waves of 3 elites/multiple non-elites. \nIf the players defeat all the waves, Nefarious will get furious and send Rend and his personal dragon &lt;a href=\"Gyth\"&gt;Gyth&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the players. More information on strategies can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; page. \nOnce Rend is defeated, Lord Victor Nefarius will withdraw back to &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; and the southern gate will reopen so the players can leave the arena."}
