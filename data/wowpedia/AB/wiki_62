{"id": "12649", "revid": "30741107", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12649", "title": "Rogue", "text": "The rogue is a lightly armored &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; that specializes in &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;. Their role in the world is that of an elite assassin, sneaky pickpocket, waylaying bandit and more. Some aren't magic users but use magic items. Others utilize the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; to attain relative invisibility, with some being able to instantly become completely invisible even in broad daylight.\nRogues often initiate combat with a surprise attack from the shadows, leading with vicious melee strikes. When in protracted battles, they utilize a successive combination of carefully chosen attacks to soften the enemy up for a killing blow. They must take special care when selecting targets so that their combo attacks are not wasted, and they must be conscious of when to hide or flee if a battle turns against them. By skillfully wielding dual-wielded weapons, rogues can deliver catastrophic damage to their targets. They sneak about the battlefield, hiding from enemies and delivering surprise attacks to the unwary when opportunity arises. Rogues coat their weapons in poison, allowing them to quickly dispatch weakened foes. By planning and combining successive melee attacks, they can build up combo points that allow them to deliver devastating finishing blows in combat.\nRogue talents can strengthen their ability to hide in shadows, kill foes with quick, deadly strikes, and survive in extended slugfests:\nClass overview.\n\"Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They\u2019re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike\u2014then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there\u2019s an unparalleled art to what they do.\"\nGame guide.\n\"For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing into the shadows before the victim hits the ground. Rogues can dip their weapons in paralyzing toxins that render foes unable to defend themselves. These silent stalkers wear leather armor so they can move unencumbered, ensuring that they land the first strike.\"\n\"With the rogue\u2019s poisons and speed, the first strike is often the last step before the killing blow.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\"Rogues are most successful when their deeds never come to light. Fond of poisons and silent projectile weapons, rogues rely on a blend of stealth and minor mysticism. Usually in the employ of rich nobles or local governments, the rogue redistributes wealth or eliminates designated targets. A rogue's allegiance lasts only as long as the latest contract.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"Fans of knives and poisons, Rogues stalk their foes from the silent dark, always ready to slit throats and pick the pockets of the unwary.\"\nBackground.\nFor as long as there were dark alleys and needs for dark services, there have been rogues, and thus they are one of the oldest professions in Azeroth. Rogues are a diverse class, and they are typically made up from the dregs of society \u2014 cutthroats, pirates, robbers, and low-lifes. The only code rogues live by is the contract, and their word is only as good as the money their services are bought for. The diverse aspects of their trade require rogues to be well-versed in lockpicking, toxicology, rudimentary alchemy and brawling. In combat, rogues rely on the element of surprise, and tactics which are regarded by most as vile and cowardly. They are rarely seen entering a fight without weapons laced in poisons and ample supplies of everything from bombs to elixirs in their backpacks. Their attacks concentrate on weak points in the body in an attempt to finish fights brutally and quickly. Rogues play prominent roles in every aspect of society \u2014 albeit they will rarely be written in history books because their involvements will be largely unknown to the common person, but they are always there, greatly affecting the flow of events from the shadows.\nFrom the high-contract assassin hired in secret by respected noblemen to the lowly street mugger, rogues are the ones called upon when maintaining the status quo requires a questionable solution \u2014 and by fulfilling it, are branded as outcasts by the very society that calls upon their service.\nRogues are best known for being sneaky and very sharp in the slit-your-throat kind of way.\nRaces.\nThe following races can play the rogue class:\nAttributes.\nRogues depend on the following primary attributes:\nRogues also desire the following secondary attributes:\n&lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Intelligence\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt; and related caster stats give no benefits for rogues.\nEquipment.\nRogues can use five types of melee weapons: &lt;a href=\"daggers\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, one-handed &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s, one-handed &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s, and one-handed &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt;s. They &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;, which means they can equip a weapon in each hand when most classes can equip only one; the trade-off, however, is an increased chance to miss with each weapon and reduced damage from the off-hand. Rogues cannot equip two-handed weapons or &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s. A rogue's choice of weapon typically reflects their talent specialization: the &lt;a href=\"rogue%20talents%23Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"rogue%20talents%23Subtlety\"&gt;Subtlety&lt;/a&gt; trees favor the use of daggers, while the Outlaw tree favors the use of swords, axes, maces, and fist weapons. In order to optimize damage, rogues must pay attention to the &lt;a href=\"weapon%20speed\"&gt;weapon speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt; of the weapon in each hand.\nRogues wear &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; armor. Leather is weaker than the &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt; worn by other melee classes, making rogues more \"&lt;a href=\"squishy\"&gt;squishy&lt;/a&gt;\". To compensate for this, rogues have an array of defensive abilities to improve their survivability, including &lt;a href=\"Evasion\"&gt;Evasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. Rogues can also wear cloth, but this is not recommended, as virtually all cloth items are intended for casters. Rogues also benefit from &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Specialization%20%28rogue%29\"&gt;Leather Specialization (rogue)&lt;/a&gt; when wearing only leather.\nAbilities.\nRogue combat centers around using &lt;a href=\"instant\"&gt;instant&lt;/a&gt; attacks to build &lt;a href=\"combo%20point\"&gt;combo point&lt;/a&gt;s, which are used to unleash more powerful &lt;a href=\"finishing%20move\"&gt;finishing move&lt;/a&gt;s on the target. Many of the rogue's abilities depend on their ever-replenishing pool of &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;.\nMelee combat.\nRogues specialize in &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; combat. A large portion of a rogue's damage comes from &lt;a href=\"auto-attack\"&gt;auto-attack&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, but they can increase their damage using a variety of offensive abilities. Many abilities require &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"resource\"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; with a fixed capacity that is spent quickly and regenerates quickly. Certain abilities are &lt;a href=\"instant\"&gt;instant&lt;/a&gt; attacks that add up to five &lt;a href=\"combo%20point\"&gt;combo point&lt;/a&gt;s to the target (\"builders\"); these combo points can then be used to execute &lt;a href=\"finishing%20move\"&gt;finishing move&lt;/a&gt;s that last longer or are more powerful per combo point (\"finishers\"). Rogues also have powerful opening moves that can only be used from &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; (\"openers\"), as well as &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt;-restricted abilities that greatly increase damage for a short period of time (\"cooldowns\"). The following are examples of offensive rogue abilities categorized according to this terminology:\nStealth.\nRogues have the ability to enter &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;, which makes them essentially invisible to enemies their level and lower. Stealthed rogues are detectable at close range, though will remain stealthed and appear translucent. Many rogue abilities require stealth, and others require being behind the target, which is often achievable only in stealth. Some abilities, notably &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Distract\"&gt;Distract&lt;/a&gt;, interact well with stealth, but normally using any ability or performing any action will break stealth.\nStealth opens up a range of tactics and roles for rogues. Groups may rely on a rogue's stealth ability to &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; dungeons, and to use &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt; for added &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;. In PvP, stealth combined with disables and burst damage gives an element of surprise that can be especially effective against cloth-wearers. Stealth also enables rogues to bypass mobs that other classes would be forced to engage, which is useful for solo play.\nIn addition to stealth, rogues have a number of other \"sneaky\" abilities, such as the ability to &lt;a href=\"Pick%20Pocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; mobs and &lt;a href=\"Pick%20Lock\"&gt;pick locks&lt;/a&gt; (breaks stealth).\nRogues no longer have access to &lt;a href=\"Disarm%20Trap\"&gt;Disarm Trap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Traps\"&gt;Detect Traps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Detection\"&gt;Glyph of Detection&lt;/a&gt; still exists, but does not work on traps.\nMajor glyphs have been removed, but the cooldown for &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; has been reduced for the entire class, mimicking the effect that was provided by &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Stealth\"&gt;Glyph of Stealth&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Pick%20Lock\"&gt;Pick Lock&lt;/a&gt; is now faster and mimics the effect from &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Pick%20Lock\"&gt;Glyph of Pick Lock&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoisons.\nRogues are the only class that can coat their weapons with &lt;a href=\"poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;. Poisons generally either cause damage to the target (either instantly or as &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;) or other hindering effects (slowing the target, reducing the effectiveness of healing on the target). They are applied as a buff to the player, lasting for one hour before they need to be reapplied; one Lethal and one Non-Lethal poison can be applied at the same time, and faster attacks (through faster weapon speed and attack speed, higher haste, and greater energy regeneration) will cause the poison to &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt; more often. Poisons are a core component of the Assassination spec and should always be used.\nPoisons are now no longer items, but individual &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s that can be applied to the weapons by the rogue. Also &lt;a href=\"poison%20vendor\"&gt;poison vendor&lt;/a&gt;s no longer sell poisons.\nPoisons are no longer available to all three specs and can now only be used by Assassination rogues.\nDisabling effects.\nRogues have a number of ways to harm their enemies aside from raw damage. Note that &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; apply to all effects that cause players to lose control of their character (stun, incapacitate, fear, etc.), as well as to status effects applied to NPCs.\n&lt;a href=\"Dismantle\"&gt;Dismantle&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; abilities have been completely removed.\nMobility, elusiveness and survivability.\nRogues are characterized by their high mobility as well as their adeptness at quickly engaging, disengaging or outright escaping from a skirmish. These two elements form a significant part of the rogue's core playstyle across all three specs, enabling them to use the battleground to their advantage, strike at an opportune moment and utilize their speed and abilities not only to attack from an advantageous position and stick to their targets, but also to evade pursuers, dodge targeted attacks, and mitigate ground effects and area of effect damage.\nThe rogue's use of stealth and their ability to vanish in the middle of combat aid in their ability to stay alive and oftentimes escape from a dire situation, but they also open up a number of offensive tools: for example, attacks that are only usable from &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Ambush\"&gt;Ambush&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shadowstrike%20%28rogue%20ability%29\"&gt;Shadowstrike (rogue ability)&lt;/a&gt; deal high damage, which can be increased further by adding the talent &lt;a href=\"Nightstalker\"&gt;Nightstalker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; is also utilized as a means of increasing damage output in the middle of a fight, most notably for Assassination and Subtlety rogues, as this enables them to use their stealth-only abilities and proc the damage increase from &lt;a href=\"Nightstalker\"&gt;Nightstalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nMobility and elusiveness are among the rogue's most important tools, as vital as their ability to deal heavy damage in a small window of time and quickly dispatch their targets. Numerous talents and abilities fall under one or the other of these traits; they are listed as follows:\nSpecializations.\nAt level 10 rogues may choose a &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;. All rogue specializations are themed around a certain type of historical scoundrel and primarily fulfill a &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; role:\nAssassination.\n A deadly master of poisons who dispatches victims with vicious dagger strikes.\nMuch of an Assassination rogue's toolkit is based on heavy damage over time through poison effects, rapid auto-attacks (Assassination rogues require daggers in both hands to utilize many of their abilities), and abilities that cause &lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; damage. Combat centers upon maintaining and managing bleed effects on your targets, focusing on the amount of time left on each bleed and maximizing your damage output by ensuring that they are constantly in effect. The use of poisons is exclusive and central to the assassination spec, forming a significant part of its damage output in unison with &lt;a href=\"Envenom\"&gt;Envenom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venomous%20Wounds\"&gt;Venomous Wounds&lt;/a&gt; and .\nAs their name suggests, Assassination rogues are themed around assassins: \"One of the favorite tools of the assassin is a pair of daggers coated with vicious poisons. The damage they inflict is deceiving at first\u2014the initial wounds often seem survivable, even superficial. Then the toxins set about their business. Wounds don\u2019t close, and blood loss continues unabated. Assassins begin their work stealthily, choosing their targets and methods of engagement carefully\u2014but once committed to a course of action, they stick to their target until the job is done rather than disappearing into the shadows to avoid their quarry\u2019s blows.\"\nSignature Abilities &amp; Talents\nOutlaw.\n A swashbuckler who uses agility and guile to stand toe-to-toe with enemies.\nOutlaw rogues focus on consistent weapon (auto-attack) damage and cleave damage in multi-target situations via &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Flurry\"&gt;Blade Flurry&lt;/a&gt; to provide sustained DPS. Rather than requiring stealth and relying on powerful openers, you can simply run up to most targets and quickly hack away at them, building combo points with &lt;a href=\"Saber%20Slash\"&gt;Saber Slash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pistol%20Shot\"&gt;Pistol Shot&lt;/a&gt; while maintaining personal buffs through the use of &lt;a href=\"Roll%20the%20Bones\"&gt;Roll the Bones&lt;/a&gt;; these enhancements are random and will either augment the characteristics of some of your abilities, reduce your cooldown times, or boost your secondary stats. As such, Outlaw tends to be the best spec for fast leveling, since you can move quickly from one enemy to the next with very little downtime instead of trying to sneak up on enemies.\nOutlaw rogues are mainly themed around pirates: \"Outlaw rogues are the unscrupulous scoundrels of Azeroth. Operating outside the law, they bend the rules and distort the truth to get what they need. While they share plenty in common with other rogues, these outlaws have little use for tact or discretion, happy to engage in a tavern brawl or spontaneous duel, rarely patient enough to wait in stealth for the opportune time to engage. To survive in such a world, outlaws must become master swordsmen in toe-to-toe combat\u2014and they can\u2019t shy away from fighting dirty. If blade fails to cut too deeply, the outlaw takes advantage of a concealed pistol, catching the enemy by surprise with a quick blast.\"\nSignature Abilities &amp; Talents\nSubtlety.\n A dark stalker who leaps from the shadows to ambush his or her unsuspecting prey.\nSubtlety rogues like to stay in the shadows. This spec is based on moving quickly and staying hidden, choosing to strike at the most advantageous moment. Once they have initiated their attack, a subtlety rogue focuses on accumulating as many combo points as possible in a short amount of time, relying on high burst damage at the beginning of combat and pooling &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; to maximize damage during phases of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dance\"&gt;Shadow Dance&lt;/a&gt; as a fight progresses.\nSubtlety is the archetypal (and infamous) PvP rogue spec, appearing from nowhere to overwhelm and defeat a player in a matter of seconds using a combination of incapacitating abilities and deadly damage. Subtlety rogues try to avoid a straight fight: their greatest strength is centered on their ability to catch their prey by surprise, and if they are unable to defeat the opponent in their initial burst, then they will often slip back into the shadows before their opponent is able to rally.\nSubtlety rogues are mainly themed around ninjas: \"Subtlety rogues are the masters of the shadows, and they strike unseen. They don\u2019t have the lethal poison-tipped daggers of the assassin or the brawling prowess of the outlaw, but their acumen on the battlefield and ability to hide in plain sight are unrivaled. Some claim the art of subtlety looks like malevolent shadow magic\u2014but no matter from where their power is derived, these rogues are capable of performing devastating assaults on their enemies, slipping away unharmed to strike again without detection. Most rogues train their entire lives to learn how to walk in the shadows\u2014subtlety rogues were born there.\"\nSignature Abilities &amp; Talents\nGeneral role in raids and dungeons.\nAs with all damage-dealers, the rogue's main priority in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ing and PvE group settings is to maximize &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; while staying alive. In dungeons, rogues may be asked to preemptively disable certain enemies with &lt;a href=\"Sap\"&gt;Sap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blind\"&gt;Blind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Parley\"&gt;Parley&lt;/a&gt; before the party enters combat. More frequently, rogues may also be tasked with &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ing important spells during some encounters, notably against bosses such as &lt;a href=\"Xhul%27horac\"&gt;Xhul'horac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Vezax\"&gt;General Vezax&lt;/a&gt;. General raid etiquette will also require you to handle any other responsibilities that your raid leader may ask you, as well as to provide your own &lt;a href=\"flask\"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt;s, food, &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and other supplies to maximize your buffs.\nIn general, rogues should not expect to be healed on a regular basis, meaning that you must oftentimes fend for yourself and rely on your mobility, positioning, and prudent use of abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowstep\"&gt;Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grappling%20Hook\"&gt;Grappling Hook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt; to quickly move away from targeted attacks and ground effects and to minimize incoming damage. Utilize &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Vial\"&gt;Crimson Vial&lt;/a&gt;, potions and &lt;a href=\"healthstones\"&gt;healthstones&lt;/a&gt; as needed, and especially in encounters with a large number of enemies, be sure to use &lt;a href=\"Tricks%20of%20the%20Trade\"&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/a&gt; to transfer &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; to one of your &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s and reduce the chances of taking &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;. If you come under attack, drop aggro with &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, or mitigate damage by using &lt;a href=\"Riposte%20%28rogue%20ability%29\"&gt;Riposte (rogue ability)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Evasion\"&gt;Evasion&lt;/a&gt;. As a melee class, rogues will almost always find themselves in the middle of the action, usually alongside tanks, and will need to be wary of area of effect attacks and damaging auras; you can expect to come under fire from multiple directions, and must strike a balance between avoiding attacks while maintaining your own attacks and remaining close enough to your targets to deal as much damage as possible.\nIn the RPG.\nRogues are Azeroth's legerdemains. They possess a wide range of skills that allow them to accomplish feats from disarming traps to finding secret doors to smacking a magic item until it works. They are decent in a fight, and if they can strike quickly or unseen \u2014 or are flanking an enemy with the help of a thoughtful ally \u2014 they can be truly deadly. Of course, they also excel at stealth.\nThe rogues of Azeroth are the masters of subterfuge, skilled and cunning adversaries of those who dare not look into the shadows to see what lurks there. Roguery is a profession for those who seek the adventures of stalking and silent forests, dimly lit halls and heavily guarded strongholds. Using trickery in combat and able to vanish at the slightest distraction, the rogue is a welcome addition to any group of adventurers. Ideal spies, deadly to those they can catch unaware, rogues have no problem finding a place in the world. Deadly masters of stealth, rogues are the whispers in shadowy corners and the hooded figures crossing dark fields. Skilled with daggers and the art of silent death, these vagabonds and bandits skulk about Azeroth seeking targets and profit. A member of almost any race can learn the tricks necessary to become a skilled rogue. Still, for the Tauren and Draenei, such a profession is an alien concept and therefore rare (if not non-existent) among those peoples. Rogues can be found among all races on Azeroth. Whether they are diplomats, spies, thieves, scoundrels, entertainers, or simply adventurers, you can find them plying just about any trade from Mount Hyjal to Ratchet.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "83240", "revid": "40332393", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=83240", "title": "Rogue ganking", "text": "Often a flagged player in the non-Battleground world will find themselves the &lt;a href=\"ganking\"&gt;ganking&lt;/a&gt; victim of a surprise attack by a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;. Although all classes gank at all level differences, people take exceptional note of Rogues due to their stealth, high damage output and escape abilities.\nA Rogue's Perspective on Ganking.\nFor 80 levels of the game, a Rogue learns to strike at the most opportune time. This often entails waiting for enemies to path away from a desired mob, or tediously tiptoeing through a cave of elites to assassinate a heavily guarded target and sap their bodyguards. Against players who attack and succeed at killing a Rogue, the same mentality will come into play. Be wary of performing an excessive act in PvP - repeated emoting, corpse-camping or reinforcement overkill will only serve to help the Rogue remember who you are and what you did to them.\nThough this emotional response is not unique to a Rogue, however, they have a strong advantage with their class mechanics to lie in wait and prepare an ambush unaided.\nMethodology.\nThere is much satisfaction in harbouring a grudge and patiently waiting for an enemy to become vulnerable, killing them, then repeating, after waiting sufficient time for them to let their guard down again. In many situations, a Rogue can wait for you and escape from you if they suspect a trap. Stealth allows a Rogue to enter and exit most safe refuges of their enemies (capital cities, towns and groups) while remaining undetected and where others would require an entire raid to assault. Deterrents, such as class abilities or the size of your defense can often be negated by patient observation.\nFor example, some common class-specific wisdom is:\nKeep in mind that what may anger you in a fight depends heavily upon the class that you play. A Warlock may detest being stunned or kicked, but fail to realize that a Rogue loathes being Deathcoiled out of stealth just as much, since stealth is as major component in most Rogues' PvP playstyles as fear is in a Warlock's.\nTo this effect, a Rogue (or any class for that matter) may expect you to cast certain abilities or play in a certain style based on your emotions. An angry hunter might immediately activate The Beast Within or line up for an Aimed Shot, the latter being vulnerable to a long cast time. An angry paladin may blow Divine Protection and Hammer of Justice at the same, leaving them vulnerable to heal interrupts and Evasion after the effects have worn off, and so on.\nWhy am I being camped?\nSome people will find themselves being camped for an inordinate amount of time, or in some manner of perceived injustice. The victims often post threads on the offical Blizzard forums, detailing the encounter; the core question often being \"Why me? And why in excess?\".\nPlayers on a PvP server should expect to be killed at any time.\nPlaying on a PvP server entails that most leveling spots will leave you flagged and open to combat. Choosing the most heavily populated areas, such as Stranglethorn Vale and the Western Plaguelands, will almost certainly result in someone higher level killing you. A player who creates and levels a Rogue on a PvP server mostly like does so for a reason: they wish to kill the opposite faction at any time they please. Isolated low-level players should especially be wary.\nAn unprepared Rogue is the most vulnerable player in the game."}

{"id": "301083", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=301083", "title": "Rogue professions", "text": "This article discusses the pros and cons of each profession for &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLeatherworking and Skinning.\n&lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt; are a decent choice. &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Anatomy\"&gt;Master of Anatomy&lt;/a&gt; raises your critical strike rating in accordance with your skinning skill level, and although crit is not a particularly strong stat for rogues, it still provides a DPS boost. Leatherworking provides several BoE epics to use or sell, in addition to a &lt;a href=\"Draconic%20Embossment%20-%20Agility\"&gt;bracer enchant&lt;/a&gt; and cheaper leg enchants. This is a very balanced profession choice for performance and money.\nHerbalism and Alchemy.\n&lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; are a pretty viable option. The Alchemy profession allows the rogue to manufacture powerful potions, elixirs, and flasks. Healing potions are the Endless Rage.\nEngineering and Mining.\n&lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; is arguably the best (and most fun) profession for a rogue (with &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt; being the most beneficial complementary profession). It allows for a very distinct edge in combat. It can, however, be expensive, for while you usually only have to craft items once in engineering, the items tend to be a bit expensive at times. There are a few engineering items that require components crafted by other professions, from blacksmiths to tailors to alchemists. Picking up mining with Engineering will save you a lot of money indeed, however, still be prepared to spend a solid amount of gold. Also, don't expect to be able to compensate your money with this profession, as Engineers make little to no money from their profession and still spend large amounts of money on items they still use at end game.\nSome very notable items would be:\nWith the release of WotLK, some engineering item enhancements were added, all of which can stack with normal item enchantments (These are only usable by engineers):\nJewelcrafting and Mining.\n&lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; is a very good profession for a rogue. \nEnchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; is a very profitable profession if you know how to use it. As a rogue it's possible to solo run some lower level dungeons and head straight for the boss of each then disenchant their loot. At level 70 &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"UBRS\"&gt;UBRS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; are very doable and most certainly profitable. Enchanting provides no utility or combat usage for PvP or PvE whatsoever other than the self-only invaluable ring enchants.\nInscription.\n&lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; is a new profession introduced with the 3.0.2 Patch. This profession is easy to learn, quick to level, and can be very profitable. It utilizes Pigments from milled herbs and allows the rogue to make Glyphs for themselves and others. See &lt;a href=\"rogue%20glyphs\"&gt;rogue glyphs&lt;/a&gt; for a list of glyphs the Scribe could make for themselves. One notable benefit of Inscription is the ability to craft and apply &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Inscription%20of%20the%20Axe\"&gt;Master's Inscription of the Axe&lt;/a&gt; to your shoulders once you reach &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; level 400. This enhancement can be purchased with a &lt;a href=\"Snowfall%20Ink\"&gt;Snowfall Ink&lt;/a&gt; and provides 120 attack power and 15 critical strike rating (a substantial increase in stats when compared with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; shoulder enchant.) &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt; complements this profession. Inscription, much like Enchanting, is mainly only picked up for money; this is because Glyphs are not replaced or changed often if at all, once you have you're glyphs thats usually set and done, so it is preferred by many to just buy the Glyphs. The money making aspect such as making cards and glyphs for others though is quite appealing to the rogue who doesn't want any extra combat utility that other profession could offer.\nBlacksmithing.\n&lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; is a viable choice for rogues looking to min/max as much as possible. At the blacksmithing skill of 400, you can use &lt;a href=\"Socket%20Gloves\"&gt;Socket Gloves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Socket%20Bracer\"&gt;Socket Bracer&lt;/a&gt; to add an extra socket to your gloves and bracers respectively. Weaponsmiths can make the and , both decent weapons for the 78-80 push and the early part of your time at 80. Other rogue friendly weapons include the and . As leveling blacksmithing to it's highest is an expensive and time consuming task, you may be better served to level mining and ask someone else to make the Titansteel items for you. Finally, Blacksmith's can make for themselves and others.\nSummary.\nIn short, each profession has different benefits. You have to decide what you want. Would you prefer making some decent cash over combat and survivability utilities in PvP and PvE that is offered by Engineering and Alchemy? Or would you prefer to have some profits coming out of your profession with less personal combat benefits such as Enchanting, Inscription, and possibly blacksmithing? (Note: not reccomended for rogues as they cannot use ANY of the gear made, and there are no WotLK weapons out there for any of the specializations.)\nWhile some people personally like engineering, be prepared to drop a lot of money on the profession, as it's not a strong money-making profession.\nNone of this makes any one profession the \"right answer.\" Experiment with the different professions to find the one you enjoy, it's a compromise between what you want (profit or utility) and your budget. Play around with your choices and try to find where that line is and how fine it is."}

Your first class quest, at level 2, no matter which race you are, will consist of \"Take an encrypted (message, the colorful descriptive word for message depends on your race)\" to the nearby rogue trainer. The quest-giver will give you a general location, such as a town name or area, and it's up to you to find it, but the trainer is close by, within the starting area. Once finished, you will receive 5-40 experience depending on your race and be able to train new abilities as long as you are the proper level and have enough money, a few available immediately at level 2. This initial trainer can train you in rogue skills up to level 6.\nAt level 10, each race that has a rogue class has a quest chain that gives them a , a good dagger. (It is possible to do these quests for each race of your faction (except races that share the same area, trainers, and quests), but because the reward is &lt;a href=\"unique\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;, and you have to be able to receive the reward before you can turn in the completion (the WoW mechanics require it), you have to sell or otherwise destroy your Blade of Cunning from the previous turn-in before you can complete the next turn-in.)\nAt level 16, each race that has a rogue class has a quest chain that funnels them to a shared faction level 16 quest giver. Even though these funneling quests have different names, you can do only one. You do not have to do the one that is nominally for your race. "}
{"id": "130516", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=130516", "title": "Rogue races", "text": "This article lists &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s that are able to become rogues, along with the lore behind each. As of patch 10.0 (Dragonflight), every playable race, with the notable exception of the &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, may follow the path of the rogue.\nAlliance.\nHuman rogues.\nHuman rogues can find respectable employment by working for &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s organization. These rogues primarily work as spies and field operatives, working to keep the &lt;a href=\"Wrynn%20Dynasty\"&gt;Wrynn Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; safe and protecting the kingdom from potential harm. There are a considerable number of human rogues who find employment within the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; instead, and work to undermine the very things their brethren in SI:7 try to preserve. Some rogues are also affiliated with the Syndicate's archenemies, the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran humans&lt;/a&gt; typically view such outlaws with disdain. Organized crime is a serious problem in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, with many criminals and pickpockets populating the harbor-town's poor districts, such as &lt;a href=\"Hook%20Point\"&gt;Hook Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dampwick%20Ward\"&gt;Dampwick Ward&lt;/a&gt;. However, as a primarily seafaring culture, the rogues of the Kul Tiran people primarily tend towards &lt;a href=\"Pirate\"&gt;piracy&lt;/a&gt;. Many such outlaws can be found among the pirate crews of the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacktooth%20Brawlers\"&gt;Blacktooth Brawlers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cutwater%20Corsairs\"&gt;Cutwater Corsairs&lt;/a&gt;, often seen wielding swords and &lt;a href=\"Gun\"&gt;pistols&lt;/a&gt; in tandem. Piracy is seen as a capital offense in Boralus. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; backed these outlaws to their own ends, but there are many who &lt;a href=\"independent\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; or likely became such after Ashvane's fall. &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt; is a pirate town where the rogues of Kul Tiras congregate in great numbers. &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; is a notable Kul Tiran rogue and former pirate under the Alliance's employ. \nGnome rogues.\nGnomish rogues are known to take advantage of their small stature to make excellent thieves, assassins, and anything else with a focus on subtlety. Their naturally expansive intellect tends to make them clever and quick-witted, but what's most attributed to their race is their engineering prowess. Gnome rogues often use their racial teachings to make gadgets of malice to help aid in escape or taking enemies by surprise. Because &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; is overrun, the majority of them take their work from the dwarves, most notably &lt;a href=\"Hulfdan%20Blackbeard\"&gt;Hulfdan Blackbeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwarven rogues.\nStocky and impeccable, the dwarves of Ironforge are known for their love of loot and treasure, and perhaps not quite as well known for their proficiency in planting a blade through the lower spine of an unfortunate victim. The condemned tunnels and half-razed sections of Ironforge are home to countless brigands, fortune-seekers, grave robbers and similar vermin. Dwarves also have the amazing ability to temporarily turn their skin into stone, which purifies the body and removes any unwanted diseases or poisons - as well as sealing up any cuts and bruises made. Coupled with their naturally strong body and muscles they make excellent rogues.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have some rogues as well, though not often seen. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Agent\"&gt;Dark Iron Agent&lt;/a&gt;s inflitrating &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Kidnapper\"&gt;Dark Iron Kidnapper&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dope%27rel\"&gt;Dope'rel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt; all appear to be rogues. \nNight elf rogues.\nDue to their agile nature, nocturnal behavior and inborn ability to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmeld\"&gt;Shadowmeld&lt;/a&gt;, many night elves are drawn to the path of the rogue. Furthermore, night elves of all kinds fight in ways that would not seem out of place in a rogue's repertoire - ambush, rapid attacks, focusing upon the swift dealing of deadly force before vanishing into the shadows. Consequently, rogues are not viewed with the same disdain among the kaldorei as they are within other societies. Some night elven rogues have chosen to become the arbiters of stern night elven justice - the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s - while others seem content to act as scouts, assassins or spies in the employ of the main &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; army. Though night elven rogues are based within the barrow deeps beneath the Cenarion Terrace in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, they show little allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, save in working with the Circle to preserve &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; from corruption.\nWorgen rogues.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt; were once human, they are an obvious choice for rogues. Since their transformation they have become quite vicious and even more secretive. Gilneans were also trapped in such a gloomy &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; behind their &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt; for so long that shadows have become a second nature, and their new abilities as a Worgen only heightened their prowess as a rogue.\nDraenei rogues.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; employ rogues in their ranks.\n&lt;a href=\"Star%20Captain%20Barabos\"&gt;Star Captain Barabos&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Star%20Sailor\"&gt;crew&lt;/a&gt; are implied to be space &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s. \nHorde.\nOrc rogues.\n&lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; aren't exactly known for their agility or subtlety, but orc rogues are among the strongest and most enduring enemies any fool with a price on his head could possibly have. Cunningness and stamina makes for a deadly combination together with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s nimbler races. Orcs are extremely resilient, have incredible willpower and will stop at nothing until their chosen target lies dead. Although many members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; view the orcs as brutish creatures their method of combat holds a certain beauty; while other more agile races dodge and weave through enemy blows, orc rogues simply use their massive strength to punch through their opponent's defences, while their carefully honed blades strike at the very heart of the enemy with incredible efficiency. Even though underappreciated in their culture, many orcs choose this darker path as their way of life and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; knows full well their incredible value.\nMany orc rogues base themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, where many of the city's less well-to-do denizens reside. Almost all orc rogues belong to the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;, which has reformed itself as the main &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; clan in the Cleft of Shadow in Orgrimmar. Using the Cleft of Shadow as a base of operations the orc and troll assassins make their checks across the vast continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, they are ultimately tasked with 'policing' and 'tracking' any traitors to the Horde and bringing them to justice. Orc assassins work tirelessly to keep the Horde strong, though they are no longer the heartless killers from the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Now, they track down and dispatch those who would threaten the security of the Horde.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the alternate timeline &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; also have rogues among their ranks. The are master poison-users and assassins. Their assassins tend to leave their personal mark on their prey, using poison-coated weapons. Orcs like &lt;a href=\"Poisonmaster%20Bortusk\"&gt;Poisonmaster Bortusk&lt;/a&gt; seem to be able to produce entire &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Cask\"&gt;casks&lt;/a&gt; of such poison. \nTroll rogues.\nAs long as there have been troll &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, so has there been troll enemies of said tribe. With a racial history full of assassination and subterfuge and a physique well lent to sneaking and killing, combined with astonishing physical resilience in the forms of healing grievous physical injuries and regenerating lost limbs (an ability inherent to all trolls), the rogue profession isn't an uncommon choice for the opportunistic troll.\nTroll rogues operate out of the same city as their orc brethren. They also receive similar training and contacts. Orc and troll rogues can often be seen working in tandem on the battlefield - employed under the same assassin clans.\nUndead rogues.\n&lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; are feared not only for their phenomenal skills of infiltration and murder, but also because they are assassins who have no need for sleep, air, food, water or physical rest. Deathstalkers can remain submerged in water or inside a casket indefinitely. They can also pose as corpses in a battlefield or a graveyard, since by all means, that is exactly what they are. Deathstalkers are a prized asset to both the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde, and those who incur &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' wrath can expect a swift and sure death by their hands.\nBlood elf rogues.\nThe natural agility of any &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt;, combined with a racial control over and thirst for magical energy, ensures that blood elf rogues are the most impeccable mage-slayers in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The dark alleys of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; crawl with shadowy figures representing the dark side of the blood elf psyche. Before the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; did not have a full-fledged group of &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s as they were deemed dishonorable and an unworthy asset, however when the Sunwell was destroyed, this attitude changed dramatically. The blood elves decided to create a small force of rogues that would prevent any more security threats which could disestablish the recovering blood elf race. Because of this most rogues are members of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; organization which are tasked with protecting and securing the blood elf race from any potential threats from within and from without. It is without a doubt that the blood elf assassin population is increasing rapidly and although not as famous as the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt;, they are slowly making their presence felt in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; through their ruthless tactics and incredible skills.\nGoblin rogues.\nAs goblins love their money, there has been many of them who have taken up the art of thievery. Just as well they may hire other goblins to steal for them. As with gnomes, goblins also take advantage of their short stature.\nTauren rogues.\nKalimdor and &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; rogues alike have seemed to leave the shadows around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;' discovery by mortal races.\nOther rogue races.\nPandaren rogues.\nMost Pandaren rogues that have been seen are in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, using their skills of stealth and combat to protect &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to other races who may see rogues as outlaws and criminals, pandaren rogues seem to enjoy a uniquely respected position as disciplined protectors in pandaren culture. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Sho\"&gt;Sho&lt;/a&gt; is seen as an equal by her fellow &lt;a href=\"Tillers\"&gt;Tillers&lt;/a&gt; due to being a protector of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt; and their harvests despite not being a real farmer. Being a part of the Shado-Pan is seen as an honored position. &lt;a href=\"Tenwu%20of%20the%20Red%20Smoke\"&gt;Tenwu of the Red Smoke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"He%20Softfoot\"&gt;He Softfoot&lt;/a&gt; are other examples of skilled pandaren rogues, while &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; is the second in command to Lord &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh elf.\nSome high elf &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt; had a few high elven &lt;a href=\"infiltrator\"&gt;infiltrator&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSatyrs.\nSatyr groups have rogues in their ranks.\nIn the RPG.\nHigh elf rogues.\nFor the high elves, such a profession is an alien concept and therefore rare (if not-existent) among their people. In the pen-and-paper RPG, infiltrators are a special prestige class, and are like a multi-classed rogue.\nSatyr rogues.\nMany &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s become rogues, and this disparity is one reason they prefer ambushes and guerilla tactics \u2014 hopefully, satyr rogues can incapacitate enemy warriors soon after combat is joined, thereby leaving them free to strike at vulnerable spellcasters and war machine crews.\nSatyr rogues who distinguish themselves \u2014 or show a certain penchant for painful traps and ambushes \u2014 are called satyr tricksters. Satyr ranged support usually comes from magic. A few satyrs become &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s or warlocks; some become dark spellcasters called soulstealers or &lt;a href=\"hellcaller\"&gt;hellcaller&lt;/a&gt;s. Satyr rogues are fairly common. Some rogues take a few levels in &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; in order to add some curses to their repertoire; these individuals are called shadowdancers."}

Interested in the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic artifacts once hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;, he ordered the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Sunveil%20Excursion\"&gt;Sunveil Excursion&lt;/a&gt; and led his subordinates to practice an archaeological study in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where they focused their work in the acquisition, cataloging, and preservation of any and all magical artifacts. However, because of a corrupted &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; of substantial power named &lt;a href=\"Marl%20Wormthorn\"&gt;Marl Wormthorn&lt;/a&gt;, the unnatural forest threatened his excursion's progress, as its trees' roots broke their picks, its moss grew over their excavation sites, and its animals attacked their men. Annoyed by the situation, he contacted &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Dar%27toon\"&gt;Warlord Dar'toon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and asked him to send &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who would be interested in working for him with compensation.\nIn order to halt the corruption, and to finally be able to continue their archaeological study, Rohan asked the adventurers to reduce the number of demons in the area. After he received a report from his scouts on the source of &lt;a href=\"Maldraz\"&gt;Maldraz&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption, he sent the adventurers to meet &lt;a href=\"Elijah%20Dawnflight\"&gt;Elijah Dawnflight&lt;/a&gt;, in order to find a way to stop the mad druid and his creation. Once ready, he ordered the elimination of Marl Wormthorn, and later thanks the heroes for their achievement, allowing them to continue to dig and search for magical artifacts in the area.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; entered &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that he has deserted the camp with the other members of the excursion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he could be found with &lt;a href=\"Clarya%20Sunveil\"&gt;Clarya Sunveil&lt;/a&gt; in another camp of the Reliquary in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;."}

After the death of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, he was considered a potential public face for the Darkspear trolls, though they had not found a new leader yet.\nRokhan became instrumental to the winning over of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; to ally with the Horde, becoming close friends with the princess, and later queen, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horde became divided between &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s loyalists, Rokhan stood by Saurfang's side. Following Saurfang's death and abandonment of the Horde by Sylvanas, the Horde reunited and elected to form a council-style leadership over choosing a new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his private doubts Rokhan, with his tribe's faith and the encouragement of the Horde leaders, became the new Chieftain of the Darkspear tribe and their representative on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nOld Hatreds.\nFormerly led by &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan joined &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; when he saved them from the &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt; and led them to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; settled on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, but Rokhan remained in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; as a scout for Thrall. When &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; came to Orgrimmar with &lt;a href=\"Mogrin\"&gt;Mogrin&lt;/a&gt;'s report, Thrall asked Rokhan to accompany the &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;'s trek through the wilds.\nRokhan and Rexxar found &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s on the coast of Durotar after they got to the observatory in &lt;a href=\"Gar%27thok\"&gt;Gar'thok&lt;/a&gt;'s outpost, and when they reported to Thrall, he sent them back to find the outpost ruined, and the humans quite hostile.\nRokhan began to worry about his own people on the Echo Isles and thought that perhaps they should come to the mainland to avoid any danger. Thrall agreed and sent Rokhan and his band to the Echo Isles to warn &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and see them off the island.\nAfter destroying the battleships that blocked their path and lighting signal fires for the outlying village, Rokhan and Rexxar were sent to a summit in Thrall's place. When they were ambushed, Thrall, hoping to finish things peacefully, sent Rokhan and his friends to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Island\"&gt;Theramore Island&lt;/a&gt; to secretly parlay with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Jaina's aid, they discovered the invaders were led by Jaina's own father Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who was determined to wipe out the Horde in Durotar. Rokhan battled alongside Rexxar as they hastily traveled around the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; enlisting aid from their allies. Finally, the human and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; forces clashed in a titanic battle at &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt;, and when the orcs emerged victorious, they chased the humans back to Theramore. Rokhan helped to lead the &lt;a href=\"A%20Blaze%20of%20Glory%23Theramore%20City\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; on Theramore and battled Daelin Proudmoore's elite forces beside Rexxar.\nCycle of Hatred.\nTensions remained high between the orcs of Durotar and the humans of Theramore. War nearly broke out once again, due to the scheming of a minor demon &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cultists. Rokhan was still in Thrall's service as a scout - his finest - and made a sudden appearance to warn the Warchief of reinforcements to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; on the border between human and orc territory.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan could be found in a small camp named &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Dragon's Fall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was raising frostwyrms to send against Horde forces at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan and his &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Dragon%20Hunter\"&gt;dragon hunters&lt;/a&gt; were tasked with destroying them. Though most of the frostwyrms were easily dealt with the undead dragon &lt;a href=\"Sarathstra\"&gt;Sarathstra&lt;/a&gt; was proving to be problematic. After &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;receiving reinforcements&lt;/a&gt;, Rohkan was able to call Sarathstra down and the Horde was quick to kill frostwyrm.\nStormrage.\nHaving returned to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan was forced to lead a band of his people trapped outside of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to safety during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. He was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to do battle against the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; but the troll was more focusing on safeguarding his people.\nThe Iron Tide.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; turned red, Rokhan helped stop the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; and was located in the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Landing\"&gt;Shattered Landing&lt;/a&gt; along with the remnants of the now-occupied &lt;a href=\"Okril%27lon%20Hold\"&gt;Okril'lon Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde soldiers. He sent the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Pazaztick\"&gt;Scout Pazaztick&lt;/a&gt; to scout the Dark Portal but Pazaztick was killed in the act. Rokhan also sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill some &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; executioners and free their prisoners.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nRokhan appears in &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; commander's garrison in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the Azerothian expedition to where he oversees various actions and events throughout the continent. He was present in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the fall of Warlord &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka Bladefury&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe put together a plan for striking at the heart of &lt;a href=\"Everbloom%20Wilds\"&gt;Everbloom Wilds&lt;/a&gt; in order to draw the &lt;a href=\"Botani\"&gt;Botani&lt;/a&gt; back into the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, giving the Horde room to maneuver around them. He requested the rescue of friendly troops that have been taken prisoner in the main Bloodmaul compound at &lt;a href=\"Stonefury%20Cliffs\"&gt;Stonefury Cliffs&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. He was concerned at the 's proximity to key choke points leading into , and put out a request to thin their forces. When some of Horde's best &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s went missing in the vicinity of the lost &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Veil%20Anzu\"&gt;ruins of Veil Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan requested any available resources be dispatched to identify the threat and see if any of the men yet remain alive within the ruins.\nLegion.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Rokhan can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nFollowing the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, Rohkan could be found within the building, seemingly representing the Darkspear tribe. During the speech of Sylvanas Windrunner about recruiting new allies, she referred to the people present as the \"leaders of the Horde\".\nBattle for Azeroth.\nRokhan was part of the Horde's strike team to free &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. While on the mission they also encountered &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently been captured at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. While Varok refused to go with them, they did accomplish their mission to free Zul and Talanji before fleeing the city.\nLater, he joined &lt;a href=\"Talanji%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Talanji's Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. He personally led the efforts in converting the nearby &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt; into the expedition's main outpost within Nazmir and then joined the fight against the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s within the region. He conferred with Talanji in determining the best way to attack the blood trolls and agreed with her plan to call upon the local &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; for aid. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, who was corrupted by &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, and a bargain being reached with &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan would arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Zo%27bal%20Ruins\"&gt;Zo'bal Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and be informed of the recent events. While Talanji joined with the local &lt;a href=\"Tortollan%20Seekers\"&gt;Tortollan Seekers&lt;/a&gt; in seeking out &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan journeyed on ahead and established a base within &lt;a href=\"Gloom%20Hollow\"&gt;Gloom Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen he received word that his reinforcements, the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt;, were captured he called for heroes of the Horde to rescue them. Once the Expedition and Horde forces were secured, Rokhan led his forces back to Zul'jan Ruins in preparation for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Nazman\"&gt;Zul'Nazman&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently participated in the assault on the blood troll capital that saw to the death of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taloc\"&gt;Taloc&lt;/a&gt; being blasted into &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; itself. With the battle finished, Rokhan journeyed to discover where &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Keeper%20Hezrel\"&gt;Titan Keeper Hezrel&lt;/a&gt; was. After finding the Titan Keeper, Rokhan learned about the &lt;a href=\"Underrot\"&gt;Underrot&lt;/a&gt; and upon deciding to return to the Zul'jan Ruins, Rohkan would request adventurers to inform &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of the events within Nazmir and aid Titan Keeper Hezrel in his mission. During the battles within the Underrot, Hezrel would be killed but his mission in destroying the &lt;a href=\"Unbound%20Abomination\"&gt;Unbound Abomination&lt;/a&gt; would be completed. Upon learning of the events within the Underrot, Rohkan remarked that the abomination's death was a good thing, but was saddened by the death of Hezrel. He expressed his fears that despite that the conflict wasn't over due to the fact Taloc still needed to be taken down and expressed his hope that &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; would remain sealed.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt; came under attack by the blood trolls, Rokhan led a strike team from Nazmir into &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; to cut off the blood trolls. However, during the fighting, he became trapped behind enemy lines and was subsequently rescued by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Working together the pair were able to breach the lines and secure the pathway for Talanji's own attack on the blood trolls attacking the Blood Gate.\nWhen the Echo Isles came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; who had returned as a &lt;a href=\"Troll%20lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan returned home to aid in the defense and Talanji accompanied him. It was eventually discovered that Vol'jin's spirit was lost, which deeply concerned Bwonsamdi. He tasked Rokhan, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; with performing a seance to find the lost Warchief. With the presence of his old teacher and friend, Vol'jin appeared, not to reveal what happened to him, but to say that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; were in turmoil: G'huun's influence was spreading without the Grand Seal, and trolls of the past and present alike cried out for justice against the Blood God. The time to end G'huun was nigh and Vol'jin requested they use &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;his glaive&lt;/a&gt; to stab G'huun's corpse to draw his blood and show all of Zandalar that the old god is dead. Talanji then accompanied a team of Horde adventurers into the Underrot and Uldir to defeat G'huun and Rokhan was present when Talanji presented their victory over G'huun to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is one of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; commanders during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Rokhan's forces are supplemented by fellow &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRokhan participated in a meeting with Talanji and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Dreven\"&gt;Blood Prince Dreven&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Zo%27bal%20Ruins\"&gt;Zo'bal Ruins&lt;/a&gt; about the status of the Alliance and Horde. He reported the progress made by &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt;. Upon learning that the Alliance killed her, Rokhan ordered Dreven to use his power to move rocks in a collapsed tunnel between Nazmir and Vol'dun in order to attack the Alliance forces there. After Dreven left, the Darkspear champion explained Talanji the deal with the san'layn and Sylvanas, and they subsequently left as well. Unbeknownst to them, the meeting was spied on by an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurer.\nTides of Vengeance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Faction Assault on Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan helped defend &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; against the Alliance alongside &lt;a href=\"Usha%20Eyegouge\"&gt;Usha Eyegouge&lt;/a&gt; and his old friend &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;. He also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Faction Assault on Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, where he conducted a ritual with &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Madam%20Konawla\"&gt;Madam Konawla&lt;/a&gt; to imbue adventurers with the ancient powers of trolls in order to fight against the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; forces. As the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Nazmir\"&gt;Faction Assault on Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; neared its end, he ordered the death of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Beamwind\"&gt;Captain Beamwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn preparation for their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance tricked the Horde into thinking that they were moving to attack through Nazmir by creating an unnatural fog with the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;'s hope that with the Zandalari focused on Nazmir, the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; would be open for an attack by the Alliance fleet. As the Alliance attacked the Blood Gate, Rokhan, in a heroic stand, held off the Alliance and their champions before being captured. Determined to rescue the shadow hunter, the Horde struck against the Alliance and succeed in freeing Rokhan from his imprisonment by &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his liberation, Rokhan joined the Horde and Zandalari in striking back against the Alliance. He united with Talanji and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; in heading towards &lt;a href=\"Zalamar\"&gt;Zalamar&lt;/a&gt; to do battle against the Alliance. Amidst the fighting, Rokhan was tasked with discovering the exact location of the Alliance general, who is revealed to be none other than his former captor Blademaster Telaamon. After determining his exact location Rokhan reunited with his allies and aided them in killing Telaamon. With the blademaster dead, Rokhan and the Speaker regrouped with Talanji and &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;Rakera&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to Alliance operations. Following the destruction of the Abyssal Scepter, Rokhan and his allies learned that Telaamon and his forces were a bait to lure them away from Dazar'alor in order to weaken the city's defenses. Realizing that the city was in danger, the combined Zandalari and Horde army rushed back to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;defend the city&lt;/a&gt;, with Rohkan among them.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan revealed to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; that after everything the Horde and Zandalari have been through together, the Zandalari belonged in the Horde and that Talanji has invited them to witness her coronation. Rokhan and the Speaker of the Horde were granted a special honor as part of her personal entourage, escorting her to the temple of the Loa. When &lt;a href=\"Mutinous%20Zanchuli%20Devout\"&gt;Mutinous Zanchuli Devout&lt;/a&gt;s attacked, he was seen speaking with Gadrin, &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Narez\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Narez&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Mutumba\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Mutumba&lt;/a&gt;. Riding with Talanji in special garb atop a Zandalari Direhorn, he later attended Talanji's coronation standing alongside the leaders of the Horde.\nAfter the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan took part in the ritual to contact Vol'jin at Baine's request, as the tauren chieftain sought to learn who urged Vol'jin to name &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; Warchief of the Horde. He later accompanied Talanji, Baine, and the Horde champion to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;. When Baine was arrested, and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing Derek from Horde captivity, Rokhan knew Sylvanas' actions would only throw more fuel onto the fire of the Horde's disunity even though they needed to stick together against the Alliance.\nRise of Azshara.\nIn order to help &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; save &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; from execution, he gave them a totem of stealth feeling that they would be needing it and promised to keep an eye out for them. As &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and Varok Saurfang called their loyalists for battle, Rokhan answered Saurfang's call and met with the Horde's leadership in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Following Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's betrayal of the Horde, Rokhan was among the Horde heroes who attended Saurfang's funeral. The shadow hunter reflected that he never had a good feeling about the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; and simply tried to make the best of a bad situation. He also admitted that he was wrong to have thought that Sylvanas had the Horde's best interest at heart and expressed his belief that he should have done more for Saurfang.\nVisions of N'zoth.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Rokhan and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created. Knowing that the Darkspear were looking at Rokhan for guidance, the other leaders of the Horde approached him to lead his people. However, Rokhan was uncertain, though Baine was able to convince the troll that he had proved himself in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, and that as the Darkspear had faith in him, so did Baine. Recognizing Baine's words as true, Rokhan took his place as the new Chieftain of the Darkspear tribe and their representative the council.\nRemarking that the Darkspear tribe has always stood with the Horde, Rokhan stated the Horde was their home, the place where they belong. Thus, he declared that whatever the future brings, it came for both the Horde and the Darkspear.\nShadows Rising.\nIn light of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s call for the Horde to respond to the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;wounds&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting, Rokhan voted in her favor. The friction in the meeting forced Thrall to call the meeting adjourned, and an assassination attempt was made on Talanji soon after. Unaware of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;'s role in the event, Rokhan solely praised &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; for saving Talanji, declaring that he had the reflexes of &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to help Talanji, Rokhan and the rest of the council empowered Zekhan, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.\nAfter Zekhan sent word that another assassination attempt was made by a war party, Rokhan journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; provided by &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; to personally help Talanji, joining the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the city to inform Talanji that the Widow's Bite were working with the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, they were attacked by the Widow's Bite, and Rokhan aided them in fending off their attackers. Sometime after, Rokhan joined the Horde and Zandalari forces in striking against the Widow's Bite and the Banshee loyalists assaulting &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;his Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Horde Council decided to send &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to look over the Horde holdings within &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to assess the needs and statuses of the people, how the wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; were healing, and where there were still aches within the Horde, Rokhan personally sent a letter to Rexxar in which he formally requested his aid, acknowledging that no one can order Rexxar to do anything, and revealed that Zekhan was the son of &lt;a href=\"Hekazi\"&gt;Hekazi&lt;/a&gt;, who they had saved together and was remembered as being one of Rokhan's bravest hunters.\nDeath Rising.\nRokhan came to reside within Grommash Hold, where he took up leadership of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nRokhan alongside his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;fellow council members&lt;/a&gt; convened atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; where they informed Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. They also learned from &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who neutralized her attackers. These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the returning enemy. Rokhan acknowledged this as a perilous time for the Horde, stating that if they weren't careful then Death would take hold of Azeroth, and that they had to stay vigilant. He then declared that the Horde had to remain strong, no matter what rises from the shadow.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, the champions returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to inform the council about the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark powers&lt;/a&gt; that Sylvanas had allied with.\nShadowlands.\nFrom within &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; Rokhan acknowledged the many trials and dangers the Horde faces, he then voiced pride on being on the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt; that will lead the Horde forward. He further declared that &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; was the finest &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; the Horde had ever known and hoped to honor his memory by never letting the Horde forget the sacrifices Vol'jin made for them.\nRokhan was among the Horde leaders to convene with the leaders of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. While desiring to rescue his friends Rokhan knew that he couldn't risk the stability of the Horde and send their fellow leaders on what might well be a suicide mission. In light of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s hostility when &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; encouraged the Alliance to do the same, he prepared himself for battle but stood down when Bolvar called for it. He then witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and watched as &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and even Tyrande enter to rescue their comrades and seek out Sylvanas. He subsequently left Icecrown.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nRohkan was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, where he stood with &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; during the ceremony.\nDragonflight.\nRokhan received word from &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of the death of &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him. After arriving at &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt;, he also reunited with &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who had also traveled to the village after hearing of their old friend's passing. After the trio decided to help with the restoration of the village, Rokhan reflected on how it had been some time since he had reflected on &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hatreds%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;those old days&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, he found himself recalling how Baine's capture had hit Cairne hard, wearing it as a weight wrapped around his neck as it choked the life out of his eyes. He then admitted that as soon he heard of Bovan's death, he knew that Baine's heart was dying too, and arrived to help ensure that Baine didn't let it weigh him down. He further reflected that while Bovan may be gone, he would be happy to see them all reunited once more.\nQuotes.\nDragonblight.\nMon, da west wastes of dis place be full o' baddies. Stay away from dis here area if ya want to live!\nDragonflight.\nBeen some time since I be thinkin' about dem days of old.\nI remember when we found old Cairne Bloodhoof in Mulgore. \"Return to your warchief,\" he say. \"Tell him I be dead... just as my heart be dead.\"\nBaine's capture hit him hard. He wore it like a weight around his neck, chokin' de life from his eyes.\nLike father, like son. When Baine sent word of Bovan... I knew his heart be dyin' too.\nAin't gonna let it weigh him down alone.\nOld Bovan may be gone, but I think he be happy, knowin' we be together again.\nAppearance.\nRokhan is described as having massive tusks and beady black eyes, which look kind. His face is surprisingly gentle for a troll.\nIn the game, he has three different appearances. His typical appearance is that of his armor he was given in \"Wrath of the Lich King\". During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and inconsistently during the defense of Zuldazar from the blood troll invasions, Rokhan was given a similar but new appearance that wore a full set of armor, boasting an &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Tabard\"&gt;Orgrimmar Tabard&lt;/a&gt; and unique belt. His final unique appearance only shows up during the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Zandalari allied race&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race%20recruitment%20quests%23Zandalari%20trolls\"&gt;recruitment questline&lt;/a&gt; and in the cutscene during &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20of%20the%20Horde%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, where he wears an entirely unique set of armor with the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt; tabard."}

{"id": "60831", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=60831", "title": "Rokmar the Crackler", "text": "Rokmar the Crackler, lord of the &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lobstrok\"&gt;lobstrok&lt;/a&gt; resides in &lt;a href=\"The%20Slave%20Pens\"&gt;The Slave Pens&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow, Rokmar has grown to insane proportions for a lobstrok. The naga have somehow subjugated him into protecting their subterranean domain, or perhaps they have simply allowed him to remain and sate his notorious rage on intruders. If threatened, he will engage and kill any creature that does not belong in his domain by using his tearing claws and water blasting abilities.\nHistory.\nRokmar the Crackler, along with &lt;a href=\"Quagmirran\"&gt;Quagmirran&lt;/a&gt; and their brethren made their home in the &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s long before the Naga arrived. Upon their arrival, Rokmar and Quagmirran were targeted by the naga and enslaved. They were both used by the naga to subjugate other natural inhabitant races to the naga's will, eventually this caused their own wills to break, leading them to be too far gone to save. Adventurers are sent to put down Rokmar and Quagmirran by &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Jhang\"&gt;Watcher Jhang&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Following Draenor's destruction, Rokmar fled into the depths of Zangarmarsh. The energies that had torn the world apart enveloped the behemoth, bolstering its strength and size at the price of constant agony. The naga were awed by Rokmar's ferocity when they first arrived in the region. Rather than kill the beast, they enslaved it and used the creature to subjugate much of Zangarmarsh's indigenous life.\"\nStrategies.\nTanking\nTake your time, and this is easy. If the tank loses aggro, you will be in trouble. When he enrages you must lay down heavy heals. Any class with heals spells should be healing the tank; Rockmar hits hard.\nTo save everyone's life if the tank is dead \u2014 and Rokmar is nowhere near dying \u2014 all the remaining group members can jump into the pools of water. It appears that, although Rokmar is a gigantic Lobstrok/prawn, he cannot swim! When you jump into the water you will exit combat mode in a moment and Rokmar will go back to patrolling. Be sure that you do get out of range of his Water Spit. If you make it near the ramp it will be far enough. Note that if you jump into the Western pool, you will have to walk the long way around to return to Rockmar. Try to jump into the southeastern pool.\nWater Spit Attack\nRockmar occasionally attacks with Water Spit. The attack is an AoE frost-based attack, so frost resist of any kind is good. Paladins should put up Frost Resistance Aura. There is, however, a way for the healers to escape this attack. If the tank positions himself so that he is between Rokmar and the healers, the 40 yard range of the healers will place them just outside the 40 yard range of the Water Spit. This saves mana that the healers would otherwise use on themselves. Everyone else should hang in fairly close to the tank so they can be in range of the healers. Don't be afraid! Interrupts such as &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shock\"&gt;Earth Shock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20Stomp\"&gt;War Stomp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; also do not work. Heal yourself with &lt;a href=\"bandage\"&gt;bandage&lt;/a&gt;s to save your healer some mana.\nGrievous Wound Attack\nHis most devastating attack is a bleed effect, which will increase the already tremendous amount of damage per second over time. The only way to remove this is to heal the afflicted member to their maximum hit points. When this is done, the bleed is removed. This fight is a cakewalk with two good healers (a shaman and a druid/priest works very well) who can keep the tank from bleeding out. With a single healing class, it is easy to run out of mana trying to keep up with the bleed; for this reason, Rokmar is one of the most difficult fights to heal. Keeping the tank's health high and immediately healing to full when the bleed hits is advisable though not always possible. Notes On Soloing: If, for example, you're an 80 who's running through a low level friend who isn't a healer, you'll notice that Grievous Wound can and will eventually kill you. Luckily, unlike other dots, Grievous Wound's damage does not prevent you from eating (though it does prevent bandaging), so bring food, and after the kill, just eat up to full health, and the dot will disappear as intended.\nDwarven Stoneform\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; can activate &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt; to remove the bleed effect Rockmar inflicts the tank with. This can be a useful maneuver, but keep in mind that Stoneform's 2 minute cooldown means you can only get rid of one bleed effect, so use it well.\nHeroic Mode.\nWater Spit hits for about 1.5k, easily outhealable by a shadow priest's &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Embrace\"&gt;Vampiric Embrace&lt;/a&gt; or lower rank HoTs. A warrior's Spell Reflect does not work against his Water Spit, so healers will need to time their heals to hit either right before, or space out their mana as to not be drained before the fight can be over. Frost resist gear, frost protection potions, or any healing potions or stones will be helpful.\nHis 20% enrage isn't that bad but will test your healer's gear if combined with an active Grievous Wound. It is very helpful to save cooldowns such as &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;s for this.\nGrievous Wound ticks for around 1.1k every 2 seconds.\nHe is often considered relatively easier than he is on normal mode at the appropriate level. This is likely due to the additional tools available to healers at level 70 \u2014 such as Prayer of Mending for priests \u2014 which make it easier to get the tank back to full health quickly when the bleed hits."}

Players may also participate in roleplay outside the game by posting on blogs, wikis, or forums (official or otherwise). Roleplaying has similarities to improvisational theater, with the participants acting out characters in unscripted situations. Underlying this social play style is the perspective players have on their characters, as fully-fledged fictional beings that are more than just avatars of themselves. The character's personality, goals, morals, and quirks may resemble that of the player or be completely different. Thus, even a player who doesn't appear to be role playing to an outsider may enjoy elements of role playing by appreciating the in-universe context of her gameplay in relation to his character. Regardless, roleplayers recognize a boundary between what is &lt;a href=\"in%20character\"&gt;in character&lt;/a&gt; and what is &lt;a href=\"out%20of%20character\"&gt;out of character&lt;/a&gt;.\nRP also refers to RP &lt;a href=\"Realm\"&gt;Realm&lt;/a&gt;s. There are several available to Warcraft roleplayers. RP servers are functionally the same as , with added social rules and stricter naming enforcement.\nThe same is true for and . Both sets of rules apply. RP-PvP is commonly misunderstood to mean that the roleplaying part is optional. In fact, these servers were started in response to petitioning from roleplayers, who felt that the ability to engage in PvP added realism.\nBasic expectations on RP servers.\nIn addition to Blizzard's normal &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/support/en/article/policy\"&gt;In-Game Policies&lt;/a&gt;, players on Roleplaying servers are expected to abide by the rules outlined in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//us.battle.net/support/en/article/135764\"&gt;Roleplaying Policy&lt;/a&gt;. A policy that has changed a lot from its &lt;a href=\"Roleplaying%20policy\"&gt;original layout&lt;/a&gt;. In summary, players should:\nPlease note that rules about the General chat channel state that is required to be on-topic, not in-character. Traditionally, General is used on roleplaying servers in much the same way as it is on any other server type. However, many people on roleplaying servers enjoy maintaining the same character persona across all channels. Roleplaying on the General channel is uncommon but not unheard of.\nSupporting roleplay on RP servers.\nRoleplayers are sometimes disappointed at the amount of out-of-character chat, inappropriate character names, or anti-roleplaying behavior seen on the official RP servers. Forum threads lamenting the state of enforcement are frequently seen on the official forums.\nBlizzard Customer Service Representative &lt;a href=\"Pavonum\"&gt;Pavonum&lt;/a&gt; clarified how Blizzard handles RP server violations: \n...we work reactively in response to players' reports. Thus, if you observe players attempting to disrupt roleplaying events through the use of verbal, physical, or visual harassment, I would encourage you to submit an in-game petition...\n...it is contrary to our stance of not \"policing\" realms in search of policy violations\u2014which is, again, in line with the reactive nature of our investigation\u2014and partly because it is simply not logistically feasible to offer such a service, given the resources it would require. We urge you, however, to report any wrongdoing you observe...\n\"-(Emphasis added)\"\n&lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;Blizzard GMs&lt;/a&gt; do not go looking for RP violations. They address these issues \"entirely in response to player requests\". It is up to the community on each RP server to establish the degree of policy enforcement they wish to see. Whereas one server's community may take a very strict approach to naming, another may be relatively lax. Rather than Blizzard GMs deciding how far to take it, it's up to the players themselves to \"set the barometer\" and determine what is acceptable or not. The GMs can then compare the infraction to the policy as worded, and apply disciplinary measures as required. Thus, it is up to players on RP servers to proactively support the enforcement of the official RP server policies by &lt;a href=\"Help%20Request\"&gt;reporting infractions&lt;/a&gt; to GMs.\nRoleplaying terms.\nDouble Brackets are a function used by roleplayers to give \"Out of character\" messages to other players. Though it is an untidy method to give OOC messages it appears to be universally recognised by Roleplayers on every server and is relatively effective. However, players still should try to avoid cluttering the IC channels with such OOC messages and use OOC channels (such as whispers) instead whenever possible.\nErotic role play or (ERP) is any role-playing activity which involves sexual themes and language. In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", players can use &lt;a href=\"emote\"&gt;emote&lt;/a&gt;s, text chat, and character positions in any combination, to role-play erotically. &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; is notorious in the community for being a locale of choice for ERP. ERP has caused issues with below-legal age players and their parents. Blizzard has provided options to protect from obscene content such as profanity and obscenity filters, the ability to report players breaking rules, and the \"Ignore\" functionality.\nIn character, shortened \"IC\", is a roleplaying term. Whenever players are roleplaying, they are \"in character\", meaning they act as their character would in that situation.\nObservation is a recounting of in-game events happening in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" that do not reflect official &lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; history or &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;, but may be retold in a similar fashion. Unlike most fan fiction, some of the events described may have actually occurred as told which makes it partial non-fiction.\nAn open roleplaying event, story, or thread (sometimes called \"Open RP\" or \"Open-RP\") means it's open to anyone. Also an open invitation to join a crafted series of events or roleplay usually on roleplaying forums. Some other events have auditioning or other requirements to participate.\nOut of character (OOC) indicates something said or done by the person playing a character, not the character itself. OOC speech is often interjected when explanations are required that cannot be provided in character. It is often denoted by the use of the emote system.\nPermadeath, for role playing purposes, refers to a &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; being killed in a role-play in-character sense. This death of a character, if the &lt;a href=\"Real%20Life\"&gt;Real Life&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; chooses, can be permanent, hence \"perma\"death. The player should not log on as the character if they have declared this for that character. This can also mean that the RL player deleted their character off of the server and wrote up an RP story to explain it.\nPower-emoting (or god-emoting) is an act of forcing the result of one's actions on another character, typically without the other player's consent and not giving the other character a chance to do anything about the emote. Power-emoting is heavily frowned upon in most roleplaying communities, since it takes the freedom of action away from the player being emoted on. The typical solution for this issue is to emote attempts instead of finished actions. Some standard in-game emotes, such as /spit or /slap, can be considered power-emotes."}

They are enormous warriors, scarred by loose stitchings and putrid, open sores. They love to carve flesh and tear their enemies apart. The slow-moving and dull-witted abominations constantly drip blood and smell like disease-ridden slaughterhouses. They carry large cleavers into combat and wield various sickle-bladed hooks on their disproportionate limbs.\nAlmost all abominations lack any real intelligence, having an I.Q. closest to that of an ogre on average. Abominations outwardly appear strangely joyful due to their absent-minded expressions and mannerisms, though this is most likely due to their low level of mental capacity. Like their undead cousins, abominations lust for flesh and are known to eat not only the living but the dead as well.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the abominations were created by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, and as such are mainly found in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; ranks. While for the Forsaken the abominations are primarily kept as guards, some have become highly regarded Forsaken representatives in the military such as &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Murp\"&gt;Lieutenant Murp&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, which later moved to &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the places where abominations are known to have been built are &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fleshwerks\"&gt;Fleshwerks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Plagueworks\"&gt;Plagueworks&lt;/a&gt;. Although abominations were once guards in Undercity, they have been replaced with the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Guard\"&gt;Kor'kron Guard&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, before making their return following the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, abominations can be found in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;. These abominations tend to be dark- to pale-green and can feature bone-spikes and metal weaponry fused to their bodies. They are crafted by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stitchmasters\"&gt;Stitchmasters&lt;/a&gt; to serve as physical bodies for the &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; of the mighty warriors who come to Maldraxxus. &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt; players can create abominations of their own with the &lt;a href=\"Abominable%20Stitching\"&gt;Abominable Stitching&lt;/a&gt; covenant feature.\nConstruction.\nAbominations are built out of multiple corpses of the dead, requiring blood and embalming fluids to preserve the parts and keep them functioning. According to &lt;a href=\"Calder%20Gray\"&gt;Calder Gray&lt;/a&gt;, the \"abomification process\" causes significant brain damage so it's best to start with someone smart when selecting a brain for the construct. The secret is to leave the reptilian nervous systems intact while removing the higher cognitive functions to avoid the abomination developing a conscience or remembering the allegiances of the brain's original owner. An abomination also requires a heart strong enough to pump sludge through its rat's nest of veins.\nThe first abominations were created in the catacombs of &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; from unearthed corpses that were hacked apart and pieced together. The abominations of the Third War were usually assembled in &lt;a href=\"slaughterhouse\"&gt;slaughterhouse&lt;/a&gt;s which can still be found in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Opposing the Scourge, however, the Forsaken abominations are made in the &lt;a href=\"Apothecarium\"&gt;Apothecarium&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and are possibly composed of the parts of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s that are in the captivity of the Forsaken.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, the corpses of the slain are brought to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, where the finest pieces of flesh and bone are skillfully assembled into a new form. These reanimated monstrosities are given new purpose in a body that is greater than the sum of its once separate parts. Constructs have formed the backbone of Maldraxxi armies in more wars than anyone can count. A well-constructed body can turn any &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; into a potent frontline weapon. These abominations are far more advanced than those of the Scourge, being fully sealed, sometimes possessing extra mouths, and, most notably, being capable of far greater intelligence. Indeed the leader of the House of Constructs is an abomination, with intelligence fully suited to match its station.\nNotable.\nImportant &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; abominations include &lt;a href=\"Glutton\"&gt;Glutton&lt;/a&gt; (a constantly hungry abomination found in &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Ramstein\"&gt;Ramstein&lt;/a&gt; (the ruthless guardian of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare's&lt;/a&gt; slaughterhouse in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;) and the titanic &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt; (whom &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; uses as his \"Avatar of War\").\nIn the RPG.\nAbominations are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;-like creatures, mounds of corpses cobbled together. The stomach-churning reek is choking, and a green-brown haze surrounds them. Their guts spill from a jagged gap in their stomach, and flies buzz about it, feasting. Three disproportionate, arm-like limbs emerge from their bloated body, two bearing bloody cleavers, and the other a thick chain with a hook on the end. Their tongues are thick and round and dangle from between crooked, yellow teeth.\nAbominations are large created creatures, similar to &lt;a href=\"flesh%20golem\"&gt;flesh golem&lt;/a&gt;s. Mutilated bodies and limbs from many creatures combine into a single twisted, hideous form. A viscous trail of blood leaks from it with each laborious step, and the ripe decay of the slaughterhouse wafts from its body. These magically created automatons are incredibly powerful, possessing (literally) the strength of ten human men. Constructing one requires a great understanding of necromancy and science and the capacity to both animate undead and cause magical healing to living flesh. They are difficult to create, but once made they are fanatically loyal servants and tremendously powerful warriors. The twisted, mutilated bodies of abominations are comprised of multiple dead limbs and body parts from various corpses. These enormous warriors love to carve flesh and tear apart their enemies. They carry large cleavers into combat and wield various sicklebladed hooks on their disproportionate limbs. The animating force of an abomination is a blasphemous conglomeration of the souls incorporated into the corpses that make up the abomination's unliving flesh. This creature is a singular entity with a united soul and, because of this unique makeup, is considered both an undead creature and a construct. It is certain that the abomination remembers nothing concrete of its previous lives, although snatches of memory occasionally plague the beast at times of great stress or unusual pressure.\nThey are slow of body and mind, but tough and strong \u2014 excellent troops for the Scourge and the Forsaken. Disease spreads about them in visible clouds, but their enchantments ensure that, while they rot, they remain horribly alive. Abominations are some of the most powerful undead creatures in Azeroth. The Forsaken use them to guard Undercity and the Scourge employs them in a similar role. While not speedy, they are excellent at staying in one area and pounding anyone who gets close. Abominations understand Common and speak it\u2026sort of.\nAbominations are fearless, tenacious, and resilient, capable of pressing their advantage in combat for hours at a time without growing weary or weak. Their strength and ability are based on their unusual construction \u2014 they truly are more powerful than ten ordinary human men. Although mostly mindless creatures, they do occasionally show a flash of insight, modifying their orders to be more advantageous (such as attacking the most powerful opponent first when commanded into a battle). They are not particularly intelligent in most cases, however, and relying on an abomination's sense of tactics is an exceptionally poor idea. Abominations' dim brains don't allow much room for tactics. They follow their master's orders, trundling to where they are supposed to trundle and then hacking and ripping until their opponents are no longer recognizable.\nHistory.\nAbominations are large, strong, virtually brainless amalgams of animated corpses. The Scourge created them from bits and pieces of various corpses, and they served as powerful troops in the Third War. When the Forsaken split from the Lich King's control, they took a number of abominations with them \u2014 and, so some say, the ability to create more. Forsaken abominations guard Undercity and perform various tasks for their masters. Abominations love ripping and tearing apart living creatures. They also are breeding grounds for disease, and clouds of flies and putrid sick surround them. Their rotting guts hang from gashes in their stomachs. All of these traits make them poor traveling companions, and most who must deal with abominations make sure they do it from a distance. Abominations are also exceedingly dumb, but they possess enough intelligence for rudimentary problem solving and task resolution. They don't possess much in the way of emotion, though. They have four basic states: pleasantly standing around and waiting for orders; being impatient that they aren't killing things; feeling happy because they're on their way to kill things; and being ecstatic when they're actually killing things. If asked to do anything more \u2014 for example, to run an errand for its master \u2014 an abomination becomes confused. It wants to please its master \u2014 that's why necromancers originally created them, after all \u2014 but tasks that don't involve ripping take brainpower that most abominations don't possess. \"&lt;a href=\"Gordo%27s%20Task\"&gt;Gordo's Task&lt;/a&gt; is an example of this.\"\nFor all these reasons, few abominations are adventurers. An abomination on an adventure is probably a guard or servant for another adventurer \u2014 and it serves well (if a guard) or middling (if a servant) in that capacity. An abomination adventuring without a master is unheard of, but not unbelievable. If an abomination takes it into its head to go exploring, few are going to stand in its way. Such creatures likely strike out on their own, or perhaps with Forsaken allies who tag along. An abomination's disease cloud means that any living creatures who attempt to venture with it have to remain far away, or be possessed of remarkably hearty constitutions.\nCharacteristics.\nAn abomination is created from the mutilated and disease-ridden corpses brought from the battlefield. It stands over 8 feet tall and weighs well over 500 pounds. The skin of an abomination is a sickly green and yellow, obviously covered with disease and twisted with horrible magics. It has no possessions and carries only the items given to it by its creator. It includes the dissection of more than 10 bodies to be used as the abomination's flesh and organs. Each of these bodies must be infected with the Lich King's plague, so that they will properly mutate when affected with the rituals to create the abomination proper.\nA golems creator, any necromancer of Ner'zhul, or any death knight can command an abomination if it is within 60 feet and can hear and see its creator. If left to its own devices, the abomination will make the best of its situation, carrying out its last order to the letter until it is no longer capable of following that directive. The creator can also give the abomination a simple directive to govern its actions while the creator is not in the area, such as: \u201cAttack all who enter here\u201d or \u201cRemain here, and do not allow the chest or its contents to leave this room.\u201d Because abominations do not need to breathe and are immune to most attack forms, they can continue to fight even when the terrain is exceptionally dangerous (underwater, for example) or difficult."}

The slow moving and slow-witted Abominations constantly drip blood behind them and smell like a disease ridden slaughterhouse. They carry large cleavers into combat and wield various sickle-bladed hooks on their disproportionate limbs.\nInformation.\nAbominations are very powerful ground melee troops with lots of hit points. You should build two Slaughterhouses so that you can build two Abominations at once. Be sure to upgrade the Abominations as much as possible. Abominations are a good progression after Ghouls. \nUse Abominations with Necromancers. Cast Unholy Frenzy on Abominations to make them even more powerful.

Cannibalize and Raise Dead will automatically use corpses in a &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Wagon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Meat Wagon&lt;/a&gt; as if the corpses were on the ground. So bring Meat Wagons with Exhume Corpses. When units Cannibalize, the most injured units do so first. Group orders won't apply to Ghouls (and &lt;a href=\"Abomination%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s) that are busy Cannibalizing corpses. This is because it would prevent them from healing (Cannibalizing) before the process is complete.\nDisease Cloud.\nThough the negative regeneration means almost nothing against most units (especially when the enemy has increased natural regeneration), the disease cloud acts as a pseudo-wall when the Abomination dies."}

Their daughter was among those who vocally spoke out against Elisande's decision, and as punishment she was exiled from the city.

He left the area to find shelter, but eventually ended up returning after devolving into a &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; and was invited into Shal'Aran by Thalyssra. Inspired by the kindness of the adventurer, he decided to join the rebellion his daughter supported and help take back the city. He also asked the adventurer to deliver a letter to Noressa, in which Absolon laments his failure to find their daughter, promised there was still hope for them and they would be reunited soon.\nInsurrection.\nThe elven armies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and Nightfallen congregate outside the gates of Suramar, rising tensions came to the city and the Grand Promenade, where Absolon's home was located, had been turned into a landing point for summoning demonic troops. Absolon asks the adventurers to find Noressa in their home and rescue her, after rescuing her from a Felborne guard, Noressa is finally reunited with a now-healthy Absolon in Shal'Aran.\nQuote.\nI miss my wife, and moreso our daughter.\nHere, at least, I can remember them in peace."}

A wise and powerful being, Neptulon keeps many secrets, for reasons only a creature of water can truly understand.\nThe surface of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;'s ocean is dotted with a few small islands of rock that yet resist &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;'s endless assault on the land. At the point farthest from &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;'s domain there floats a mile-wide shelf of solid ice known as the &lt;a href=\"Frostland\"&gt;Frostland&lt;/a&gt;. Like an immense iceberg, the &lt;a href=\"Frostland\"&gt;Frostland&lt;/a&gt; extends far underneath the surface, almost to the ocean floor. Smaller chunks of ice break free occasionally and drift across the seas, slowly melting as they come nearer to &lt;a href=\"Deephome\"&gt;Deephome&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these bergs are occupied by &lt;a href=\"ice%20elemental\"&gt;ice elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20conglomerate\"&gt;conglomerates&lt;/a&gt; or other creatures.\nTraveling beneath the waves, within the Abyssal Maw itself, can be troublesome, and not just because of the need to breathe underwater. Vortices occasionally form of their own accord, creating tremendous tidal forces that threaten to tear apart their victims. Violent temperature shifts also move upward through the waters like bubbles rising from the ocean floor, subjecting travelers to bone-numbing cold. Parts of the Abyssal Maw are thousands of feet deep \u2014 so far down that even light doesn't reach the ocean floor. Traveling beneath the surface in these areas subjects travelers to intense pressure.\nTraveling on the surface of the Abyssal Maw can be very dangerous. Visitors rarely have cover, and Neptulon will have no trouble spotting unwelcome travelers. Furthermore, both Neptulon and &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; contest the border between the Maw and the Skywall, so anyone floating upon the waves can be subjected to the attacks of either realm."}

The unused entrance hallway exists next to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally planned as a launch dungeon, it was first pushed back to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2\"&gt;patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt; to release alongside the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, then scrapped altogether to focus patch 4.2 entirely on the Firelands. The reasoning given at the time was that Throne of the Tides was a good ending to the Vashj'ir storyline.\nHowever, fans have noted that it ends on a vague (and hard to see) cliffhanger where &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; kidnaps &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;. In regards to this at the BlizzCon 2011 World of Warcraft Lore and Story Q&amp;A panel, Metzen proceeded to dodge the question with jokes about \"Neptulon's tryst with Ozumat\" and said that it was a hard question and that a \"damn mess is what it was.\"\nThe fights would have taken place inside a third &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir%20ancient\"&gt;shelled demigod&lt;/a&gt; that had been corrupted by the naga. Ghostcrawler says that \"It was three bosses inside Nespirah, with no unique art,\" though earlier previews described the dungeon as multiple raised underwater plateaus above a chasm.\nThe Abyssal maw dungeon was scrapped because the storyline and setting was not convincing and fitting.\nWhile it was originally announced as a 5-man, later statements suggested it may have been changed to a raid before getting scrapped.\nGhostcrawler about the instance.\nGreg \"Ghostcrawler\" Street, WoW's lead systems designer (at the time), talked about the Abyssal Maw during Blizzard's Cataclysm post-mortem blog series."}

They have a severe dislike of the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Southsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;, from which they most likely branched off. The Northsea Freebooters are making up for being fewer in number by being worse criminals and murderers. \nHistory.\nAt some point just prior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Jonah%20Sterling\"&gt;Jonah Sterling&lt;/a&gt;, the Northsea Freebooters stole artifacts from several graves - those from the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;'s burial ground in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Hill\"&gt;Shield Hill&lt;/a&gt;, which brought the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;'s shores, as they disturbed the spirits of the dead.\nFor a time, they've been hiding out and dealing with troubles of their own, as the artifacts they've stolen have proven to be far more trouble than their apparent worth. According to &lt;a href=\"%22Silvermoon%22%20Harry\"&gt;\"Silvermoon\" Harry&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Scalawag%20Point\"&gt;Scalawag Point&lt;/a&gt;, everyone among the Northsea Freebooters who had come into touch with these artifacts has ended up dead, missing or both. &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Frozen%20Heart%20of%20Isuldof\"&gt;:The Frozen Heart of Isuldof&lt;/a&gt; drove their captain Jonah Sterling insane, and the latter hid in a &lt;a href=\"Garvan%27s%20Reef\"&gt;cavern&lt;/a&gt; near the pirate cove, having assigned a bear named &lt;a href=\"Hozzer\"&gt;Hozzer&lt;/a&gt; to guard the artifact. &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Staff%20of%20Storm%27s%20Fury\"&gt;:The Staff of Storm's Fury&lt;/a&gt; had much the same effect on a crew member named &lt;a href=\"Abdul%20the%20Insane\"&gt;Abdul the Insane&lt;/a&gt;, who held it on a ship at &lt;a href=\"Iskaal\"&gt;Iskaal&lt;/a&gt;. The giant &lt;a href=\"Sorlof\"&gt;Sorlof&lt;/a&gt; was holding &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Shield%20of%20the%20Aesirites\"&gt;:The Shield of the Aesirites&lt;/a&gt;, and the only way to retrieve it was to gain the trust of the now-undead crew of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sister%20Mercy\"&gt;Sister Mercy&lt;/a&gt;\", once members of the Northsea Freebooters prior to their death, and help them defeat the giant. As for &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Ancient%20Armor%20of%20the%20Kvaldir\"&gt;:the Ancient Armor of the Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;, the armor was to be brought to Scalawag Point when the pirate ship was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken killed everyone aboard, looting everything of value, until they were killed in turn by the kvaldir.\nLater, the Northsea Freebooters were ordered by their captain to fight both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; expeditions whilst at the same time waging a war against the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; to sell as slaves to other lands (even though they died just days after leaving their climate). None of the tuskarr survived their captivity long enough to be rescued due to the brutality they suffered. With both Alliance and Horde breathing down the necks of the freebooters, another pirate, &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Bonn\"&gt;Annie Bonn&lt;/a&gt;, arranged to have Sterling killed by enlisting the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. After his death, she took over the operation.\nThe pirates were recruited by &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. A tauren pirate fought against King Varian Wrynn but was killed by a warlock's felguard and three attacked &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; but were also killed. Zaela abandoned them, and they were quickly rounded up and turned over to the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the pirates at Scalawag Point were still a criminal &lt;a href=\"cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; under Annie, but noted they'd gone from monstrous to merely annoying."}

In the shadows of the &lt;a href=\"stable\"&gt;stable&lt;/a&gt;s one can find the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; trainer and the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; trainer can be found beside the horse pickets.\nHistory.\nLong ago before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, devout &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s from the emergent &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had ventured south of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to spread their faith in the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;continent of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, these pious established the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt; and the abbey that served as their home. Since, the clerics become a critical component of the kingdom, as a source of wisdom and comfort in hard times, while they used the powers of the Light to soothe the hearts and minds of Stormwind's citizens, and even helped the army of their kingdom fight through its life. It was notably the location where &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; was cared for during the years he was in a coma.\nFirst War.\nDuring the course of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; aided the armies of Stormwind in their fight against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; was captured and brought to Northshire to be held prisoner, the abbey was destroyed in an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;onslaught&lt;/a&gt;. In the Human campaign of Warcraft I, it is a band of human warriors, convinced by enemy agents to fight against the crown, who are the ones to initially &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; Northshire Abbey. The abbey is shown as having some underground side tunnels. These were used as prisons for some orcs (some orcs were held in nicer-looking rooms) and a few &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. The ogres would attack the orcs if seen, yet somehow were not hostile to the humans. Also in the tunnels were &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;slime&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. None of them were hostile to the humans. &lt;a href=\"Archer\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"brigand\"&gt;brigand&lt;/a&gt;s defended the abbey against the orcs. Also, Garona was in a room with a &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; who, after a certain amount of time, went crazy and broke out of Garona's prison to attack the orcs. It is not known who brought forth this elemental.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; left their country toward &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they rescued sacred tomes from the debris of Northshire Abbey which would later be used by the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to learn the &lt;a href=\"%3AInvisibility\"&gt;:Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the site of the abbey was the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, allied to &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; aided in rebuilding Northshire Abbey and helped in the creation of a new clerical order, comprised of &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, which was dubbed the Brotherhood of Northshire.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn contemporary times, Northshire Abbey is being used as a recruitment and training center for any &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; brave enough to help keep the kingdom's peace. The area, however, has been suffering a &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt; infestation, increasing numbers of &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and the growing presence of bandits known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Powers%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Powers of the Void&lt;/a&gt; tome was held in a protected wing of the library. One of the novices studying at the abbey stole it, and later joined the Defias Brotherhood.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt; was invaded by orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Assassin\"&gt;Goblin Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s. Young &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to repel them.\nQuests.\nThere are a number of beginner quests available in here:\nAlso see the &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Elwynn Forest questing guide&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrimary security threats.\nDefias Brotherhood.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; have set up a base of operations within the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Vineyards\"&gt;Northshire Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; to the east of Northshire Abbey, led by &lt;a href=\"Garrick%20Padfoot\"&gt;Garrick Padfoot&lt;/a&gt;. They are forcing the local workers, including &lt;a href=\"Milly%20Osworth\"&gt;Milly Osworth&lt;/a&gt;, out of the vineyard. The brotherhood uses the base as a staging ground for raiding the local farmers and merchants.\nKobolds.\nA clan of &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s has infested &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Ridge%20Mine\"&gt;Echo Ridge Mine&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest of Northshire Abbey, forcing the workers out of the mine. Although the kobolds don't pose a significant threat to Northshire Abbey, their foothold in &lt;a href=\"Northshire\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt; will only grow stronger if they are ignored.\nWolves.\nA large number of wolves have appeared in the valley, presumably searching for new prey after being driven from &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; out of fear and despair. Although they rarely hunt humans, there have been incidents with farmers and missing livestock.\nHorde.\nWhile deep within Alliance territory and strongly fortified, the occupants of Northshire Abbey are always concerned with the potential threat of another &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attack.\nIn the RPG.\nNorthshire Abbey sits in the &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;'s northeastern corner, in the middle of the woods. Beyond their holy duties, the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s hunt the dangerous animals in the forest and will lead any lost traveler back to the monastery for a hot meal, a bed, flawless directions out of the woods and healing, if necessary. These holy folk maintain an outpost of the grand &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nFilm universe.\nNorthshire Abbey is only depicted on several maps and doesn't appear otherwise."}

Enemies approaching from the east side should be given free reign to attack your Farms while you re-position and hit them as hard as you can. \nRebuild your &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Lumber Mill&lt;/a&gt; when you can and train a few additional forces to hold down the two sides the enemy approaches from (On rare occasion, the enemy may hug around the western riverside and attack from the west). Try to get out a couple Clerics to start healing your battered forces. When you have a good cache of lumber, start training a couple Catapults. They will help to deal with larger waves of incoming enemies.\nWhen you have a good 20 units with a couple Catapults, being moving north. Like in previous missions, set up a kill zone with Archers and Catapults and lure the enemy to you with a Knight. After you mop up the enemies, advance and repeat.\nWhen you arrive at the enemy base, you will to decide what you want to do. The Catapults are great with larger buildings, but it has trouble doing full damage to smaller ones and are likely to kill your melee units if they get too close., so you can either pelt the base from a distance (with Archer support) or you can leave the Catapults behind and bring your melee units forward to crush the buildings.\nThe Easy Way.\nProbably more like the hard way, but this should reduce how long it takes to finish the mission. Ride your Knights to the forces to your base and focus on the Knight and Footman that are attacking the &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, since they are a lot closer. Leave the Archers for your Footmen and Archers, pulling away Knights that are close to death, then engage the remaining forces. If this is done right, you will only lose the Lumber Mill and all your forces will still be alive.\nSend an Archer to the middle to the map and another to the middle-right where the Gold Mines are for scouting. Do not scout beyond those points since there is a large concentration of enemy forces near there. After unveiling a good chunk of the map, return to base.\nGet your economy started with a couple Peasants and when money allows, start training Clerics so they can heal up your forces and bring them back to full strength. Two of them should be enough to (gradually) handle this. You will want at least 6 Peasants for your Gold Mine and another 4 or 5 for lumber. You will require a lot of lumber for the attack.\nWhen you economy is in good shape, rebuild your Lumber Mill and train 4 Catapults (There will be no need to train anything else if your forces are still alive). Do not waste your time with any upgrades. Regroup your army and return to the Gold Mine by the middle of the map (while occasionally going back to your Barracks and training reinforcements). Send a Knight to lure the enemy forces to your position , then return once he comes under attack. The Catapults will deal serious damage to the enemy forces while your other forces mop up the rest. If you find yourself getting overwhelmed with Knights, fire a Catapult shot at the enemy Knights. They may cost you a unit of your own, but it will stop the Knights from doing far worse damage. \nMove to where they were positioned and eventually leapfrog your way up to the base and clean up the enemy forces."}

Members of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; are also present due to the excavations.\nAt some point, when the Alliance soldiers were seemingly fighting elsewhere, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; lured &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; into the base camp. A great battle ensued here between the Hidden and Aram's friends, with Malus killing &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ssarbik\"&gt;Ssarbik&lt;/a&gt; opened a portal and the Hidden left with Aram, but not before kicking &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; off the camp down to the valley. The camp was left battle-torn, and Makasa took its remaining weapons. Almost a year later, Aram returned here but did not stay long in the camp. He came to see the &lt;a href=\"Forever%20Tree\"&gt;Forever Tree&lt;/a&gt; below. According to the base's soldiers, the tree blooms year-round."}

Then, in the heart of the night, they force-marched southward, leaving their campfires burning behind in order to surprise attack &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; at dawn's first light. After the Cataclysm a small group called the Northwatch Expeditionary Force attempted to gain a foothold in Durotar, while Northwatch's forces expanded to the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to help Theramore open up a supply line to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have also begun preventing vessels flying Horde colors access to the nearby neutral port, &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral years later, the surviving forces of the Northwatch Expeditionary Unit have taken part in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Honor's Stand is still under their control, and was defended by &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Lawson\"&gt;Quartermaster Lawson&lt;/a&gt; against a Horde siege. Northwatch Hold was rebuilt between the wars, and &lt;a href=\"Cannoneer%20Whessan\"&gt;Cannoneer Whessan&lt;/a&gt; led a large army from the Hold to capture &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; and thus disrupt the Horde movements in Kalimdor. &lt;a href=\"Dockmaster%20Lewis\"&gt;Dockmaster Lewis&lt;/a&gt; was leading raids against the Horde port of &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, setting fire to their ships and damaging their ability to supply the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; warfront. &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Watcher%20Kerry\"&gt;Keep Watcher Kerry&lt;/a&gt; was attempting to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in Durotar and was attacked by the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Norbin\"&gt;Norbin Nimblesprocket&lt;/a&gt; was commanding the Alliance cannons at Northwatch Hold, defending it against a naval blockade by the &lt;a href=\"Rageroar%20clan\"&gt;Rageroar&lt;/a&gt; Battleships. The Horde has installed goblin Azerite cannons on the northern shore of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Divide\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt; to counter his firepower. &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Paxton\"&gt;Thomas Paxton&lt;/a&gt; was leading a navy force to the &lt;a href=\"Scuttle%20Coast\"&gt;Scuttle Coast&lt;/a&gt; to salvage it. The dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;, close allies of the Unit, have also survived in some form, and the fortress was used as a staging point against Mulgore. &lt;a href=\"Logan%20Talonstrike\"&gt;Logan Talonstrike&lt;/a&gt; led their forces to prevent the Horde from salvaging the &lt;a href=\"Battlescar\"&gt;Battlescar&lt;/a&gt;. Bael Modan was also attacked by a tauren warband in an attempt to purge it. It was defended by &lt;a href=\"Borim%20Goldhammer\"&gt;Borim Goldhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde's attack on Kerry was unsuccessful, and even after the Fourth War the Northwatch Expeditionary Unit was guarding and rebuilding Tiragarde Keep.\nCommand structure.\nNorthwatch Expeditionary Force.\nIt wasn't until the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that members of Northwatch proved a menace to the citizens of Durotar. Believing the Cataclysm had distracted the Horde, the Northwatch Expeditionary Unit dispatched in two prime locations, &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Foothold\"&gt;Northwatch Foothold&lt;/a&gt; (previously known as &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20Crag\"&gt;Kolkar Crag&lt;/a&gt;).

Following years of destructive warfare, it is one of the most important Alliance bases left in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthwatch's location is strategic, blocking the coastal approaches to Dustwallow from the north, forcing any &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; assault to travel south and navigate the marshes if they wanted to reach &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; before its destruction. Nowadays, Northwatch is still important as a human foothold inside Horde territory. The large &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;naval base&lt;/a&gt; is known for its massive walls, gates and its various facilities, such as an archery range, &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;, tents, and two &lt;a href=\"scout%20tower\"&gt;scout tower&lt;/a&gt;s at the top of the mountain which the fort is located upon. The Hold had its own scrying stone for quick communication with Theramore.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nNorthwatch Hold was built right after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; by Alliance survivors. Because of its position inside what was then considered neutral territory, it turned into a source of mistrust between orcs and humans, despite the temporary peace after Hyjal. That distrust turned to bloodshed soon enough, when &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and used the keep as his stronghold to further his mission to root out the Horde. The orcs fought and defeated his &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; forces there.\nAfter Daelin's death in &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Northwatch Hold was retaken by the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt; and became once again an essential part of their defenses. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; wasn't pleased by the Hold's continued presence but was under considerable pressure to keep it manned despite her stance on war and her personal friendship with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nCycle of Hatred.\nFor the next three years, the Hold stayed under command of &lt;a href=\"Davin\"&gt;Major Davin&lt;/a&gt;. It harbored a convoy ship helmed by &lt;a href=\"Avinal\"&gt;Captain Avinal&lt;/a&gt; and who patrolled the waters between there and &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. Tensions were then still running high with the orcs about Northwatch being so close to the borders of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade cult&lt;/a&gt;'s manipulations worsened things even further, and at some point Northwatch &lt;a href=\"Footman\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; started escorting even civilian ships such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Passion%27s%20Reward\"&gt;Passion's Reward&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Joq\"&gt;Captain Joq&lt;/a&gt;'s arrest by the &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s of Ratchet led Major Davin to think an orcish invasion was imminent and to request more reinforcements. His request was heard by &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Chamberlain Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;, who sent him more than twenty boats and than four hundred soldiers, including Theramore's &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt;, all under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lorena\"&gt;Colonel Lorena&lt;/a&gt; and her senior staff. The Horde, on its side, sent more than six hundred footsoldiers and a fleet of dozens of boats carrying more orcs and trolls to battle.\nThis all led to &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt;'s orcs and Davin's human armies clashing here after Burx tried to force the humans out. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; ended the battle by revealing Burx's secret allegiance to the Burning Blade and then ending his life. Shortly after that, Major Davin handed his letter of resignation, ending his tenure as commandant of Northwatch Hold.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe inhabitants of Northwatch were friendly towards the Alliance but the area had no civilian amenities there, featuring no vendors, trainers, or quests for &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe eastern tower was then home of &lt;a href=\"Cannoneer%20Smythe\"&gt;Cannoneer Smythe&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Cannoneer%20Whessan\"&gt;Cannoneer Whessan&lt;/a&gt; resided in the western tower. There was also a captured &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilthares%20Firebough\"&gt;Gilthares Firebough&lt;/a&gt;, chained to an iron ball in the central tower, seeking help and rescue from his crew. At the top of this tower resided &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Fairmount\"&gt;Captain Fairmount&lt;/a&gt;, new leader of Northwatch Hold.\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Thalo%27thas%20Brightsun\"&gt;Captain Thalo'thas Brightsun&lt;/a&gt; hired Horde adventurers to kill Fairmount and some of her crew for attacking &lt;a href=\"Thalo%27dan%20Privateers\"&gt;his fleet&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe day before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Alliance forces&lt;/a&gt; streamed out of Northwatch and marched up the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, besieging &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; as dusk fell. Then, in the heart of the night, they force-marched southward, leaving their campfires burning behind in order to surprise attack &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; at dawn's first light. After the Cataclysm, Northwatch expeditionary forces reached as far as &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually the Horde forces of the &lt;a href=\"Rageroar%20clan\"&gt;Rageroar clan&lt;/a&gt; attacked back and besieged the hold itself.\nDespite now boasting a variety of facilities to be used by Alliance adventurers, including vendors, an inn, and other such aids, the hold itself has actually been hit rather hard. The lower reaches of the base have been destroyed and are contested by the orcs, who have set up their own base not too far away, and are attacking from the sea as well. The central tower has been damaged heavily, with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Fairmount\"&gt;Captain Fairmount&lt;/a&gt; gone missing and leaving command under &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Aubrey\"&gt;Admiral Aubrey&lt;/a&gt;'s hands.\nIn addition to the danger posed by &lt;a href=\"Karga%20Rageroar\"&gt;Karga Rageroar&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, the supply lines of the fort are not safe as its &lt;a href=\"Mangled%20Body\"&gt;couriers&lt;/a&gt; and caravans are also attacked by the local wildlife. Despite this, &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Gaines\"&gt;Ambassador Gaines&lt;/a&gt; briefly stopped at Northwatch after his unfortunate experience in the &lt;a href=\"Overgrowth\"&gt;Overgrowth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Taurajo%20Looter\"&gt;Taurajo Looter&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to the Northwatch brig by &lt;a href=\"General%20Hawthorne\"&gt;General Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, Northwatch Hold was utterly destroyed in a surprise attack by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their subjugated &lt;a href=\"molten%20giant\"&gt;molten giant&lt;/a&gt;s. The event came to be known as the \"Razing of Northwatch Hold\". &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; observed the orcs building up their armies there for a push on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; noted that any human survivors would likely have fled to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;. Later on the Alliance fleet, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, attacked the Horde presence in the area. After their victory, the King of Stormwind announced that the standard of the Alliance would fly once more over Northwatch Hold.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Caravan%20Leader\"&gt;Northwatch Caravan Leader&lt;/a&gt;s were seen exporting supplies from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nHaving now been rebuilt, Northwatch came under attack once again by the &lt;a href=\"Rageroar%20clan\"&gt;Rageroar clan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, this time using &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s. Consequently, Northwatch Hold turned their cannons against them to remove the blockade. In order to counter the Northwatch Hold's firepower, the Horde installed &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s on the northern shore of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Divide\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nNorthwatch Hold is one of two &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; positions held in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, the other being &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Grim forces \u2014 soldiers loyal to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s father &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 man the Hold, much like &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the events following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and Jaina's decision to forge an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, which eventually resulted in Admiral Proudmoore's death, the soldiers here harbor a hatred of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and attack its people and outposts often. It is important to note that Jaina Proudmoore openly opposes their actions, which causes strife in the area's Alliance politics."}

Norushen will then aid the players against the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Some say that the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; race was created in the image of this titanic construct, left deep beneath Pandaria to watch over and guard the continent's darkest and most dangerous secret.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Observant Scenario-runners will recognize Norushen from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Dark Heart of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; Scenario. We decided early on in the development process that we wanted to have this Titanic watcher guarding the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%E2%80%99Shaarj\"&gt;Vault of Y\u2019Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, and prioritized his model and the chamber for use in the Scenario in order to better foreshadow the upcoming raid encounter.\"\nOverview.\nNorushen seals all players inside a Quarantine Zone and extracts a portion of each player's corruption to form an Amalgam of Corruption. The object of the encounter is to destroy this creature. Players must reduce their personal level of Corruption in order to inflict full damage to the Amalgam. Players can accomplish this by interacting with the nodes of &lt;a href=\"Purifying%20Light\"&gt;Purifying Light&lt;/a&gt; that active around the room, which will pull them into another phase where they must face a role-specific challenge. Overcoming this challenge will Purify the player and allow them to inflict full damage to the Amalgam.\nStrategy.\nWhen a player speaks to Norushen to begin the encounter, Norushen will seal the entire raid within a Quarantine Zone. Shortly afterwards, an Amalgram of Corruption will spawn, and the objective of the encounter is to defeat the Amalgram. If it is not defeated within 7 minutes, Norushen will activate the zone's Safety Measures, which will instantly wipe the raid.\nAll raid members start within the \"Normal Realm\", and have 75 out of 100 points of \"Corruption\". Having Corruption translates into less damage done to the Amalgram of Corruption. Raid members will regularly need to port into a \"Test Realm\" to remove their Corruption and do full damage to the Amalgamation.\nNormal Realm.\nThe Amalgram of Corruption itself has relatively few abilities. Unleashed Anger is purely a tank concern, which can be handled through active mitigation, while Self Doubt is a stacking debuff handled through standard tank switching. Icy Fear is an unavoidable raid-wide AoE that increases in damage as the Amalgram loses health, and simply requires that the raid stack up whenever feasible to benefit from AoE healing.\nBlind Hatred is the primary danger, and works exactly the same way as &lt;a href=\"Immerseus\"&gt;Immerseus&lt;/a&gt;' Swirl water beam, but with the potency of the Disintegration Beam from &lt;a href=\"Durumu\"&gt;Durumu&lt;/a&gt;. The raid will simply need to rotate ahead of the beam, or run through the boss and around the beam to return to the designated stack point.\nWhenever DPS that are in the Test Realm kill one of the adds in their Tests (more on the Tests themselves later), the adds will be sent to the Normal Realm for the rest of the raid to deal with. Unleashed Manifestations of Corruptions are top priority for the raid, as they spam an AoE raid-damaging ability (Burst of Anger). When killed, they leave behind a Residual Corruption void zone that should be soaked as soon as possible (ignoring or forgetting it will quickly lead to a raid wipe due to high AoE damage). The void zones can only be soaked by players with 75 or less Corruption, and will give the soaker 25 Corruption, so this task should be left to tanks and healers, although a DPS player who is just about to enter the Test Realm can also soak without too much of a DPS loss. The second type of add, Unleased Essences of Corruption simply spam Expel Corruption at the Amalgram, which causes the Amalgram to gain a stacking damage buff. Expel Corruption can be intercepted (with the penalty for interception being considerable Shadow damage on the interceptor), and intercepting all Expel Corruption casts is the requirement for the achievement &lt;a href=\"None%20Shall%20Pass\"&gt;None Shall Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, when the Amalgram reaches 50%, it gains the Frayed ability. This causes the boss to spawn an additional Unleashed Manifestation of Corruption at 50% health and at every 10% health thereafter.\nAdds that spawn as a result of DPS players completing their tests have the Foul Link ability, which causes damage done to them to be copied to the Amalgram. It is however important to note that adds that spawn due to Frayed do \"not\" have Foul Link, so if the enrage is tight, it may be worth assigning some players (preferably melee) to permanently focus on the boss and have less damage on the adds.\nAssigning players to the Test Realm.\nThe Quarantine Zone will contain various Purifying Light orbs: 2 in 10-man groups, scaling to 4 in 25-man groups. A player will need to run to an orb and click it to port over to the Test Realm. The orb will despawn once clicked on, and will respawn once the player returns to the Normal Realm.\nThe raid will want to get as many DPS players in the Test Realm for as much damage on the Amalgram as possible, but should be wary of sending too many DPS in at once to prevent the remainder of the raid from being overwhelmed with adds. Ideally, DPS should only take half of the available orbs, with the remainder of the orbs being taken by tanks or healers (tanks are generally preferred over healers). Sending tanks and healers over allows them to soak the Residual Corruption void zones.\nTherefore, it will be necessary for the raid leader to assign a tank/healer rotation and a separate DPS rotation on the orbs. The exact composition will vary between raid groups, but the raid should aim to have at least a minimum number of players purified that will be necessary to beat the enrage timer before the boss gets Frayed. Once the boss gains Frayed and all players have returned to the Normal Realm, pop &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; and kill the Amalgram as soon as possible.\nOn Raid Finder difficulty, assigning players to the Test Realm is not necessary, as players will be automatically ported into the Test Realm at random. Selected players will be marked with a debuff for several seconds before being teleported, giving them the opportunity to prepare to face their challenge.\nTest Realm.\nThe test realm differs based on the player's role (tank, healer or DPS).\nTank Test Realm.\nThe tank Test Realm pits the tank against a Titanic Corruption, and the tank must simply survive for 60 seconds, at which point the tank will be fully purified and will return to the Normal Realm.\nThe Titanic Corruption has two main abilities: Hurl Corruption must be interrupted, and Burst of Corruption requires the tank to move to avoid the ground attack. None of the other abilities are particularly problematic, and cooldowns can be used when necessary.\nThe test will end early if the tank manages to kill the Titanic Corruption before the 60 second timer expires. This is extremely desirable, as it means that the next player in the tank/healer rotation can get purified earlier, which may allow extra players to become purified.\nHealer Test Realm.\nHealers in the Test Realm are faced with a Greater Corruption and three NPCs that attack it. The healer must keep both himself and the friendly NPCs alive for 60 seconds to become fully purified and return to the Normal Realm.\nThe key to this test is to dispel Lingering Corruption within 10 seconds to prevent high Shadow damage on either the healer or one of the NPCs. The only other abilities are a void zone (to be avoided, as with all void zones), and unavoidable damage (Disheartening Laugh) that must simply be healed through.\nAs with the tank test, the test will end early if the healer is able to do extra damage on the Greater Corruption that results in it being killed before the 60 second timer runs out. This is extremely desirable for the same reasons as for tanks.\nDPS Test Realm.\nDPS will always have to deal with a Manifestation of Corruption and multiple Essences of Corruption. These are the same adds present in the Normal Realm, but with different abilities. The Manifestations have a frontal cone attack that should simply be avoided, and the Essences have a line of fire attack and a frontal shield (so, the Essences should be attacked from behind).\nUnlike tanks and healers (who loses all Corruption at the end of their test), DPS loses Corruption based on how many adds they defeat. Defeating the Manifestation removes 40 Corruption, and defeating Essences removes 15 Corruption per Essence. There will always be one Manifestation, while the number of Essences to defeat depends on the player's initial Corruption when entering the Test Realm.\nThe DPS player will return to the Normal Realm after either 60 seconds or defeating all adds. However, the DPS player \"must\" attempt to kill all adds within the time limit, as failure to do so will return the player to the Normal Realm with Corruption remaining, which is undesirable.\nAchievement: None Shall Pass.\nEarning &lt;a href=\"None%20Shall%20Pass\"&gt;None Shall Pass&lt;/a&gt; requires that every Expel Corruption cast by an Essence of Corruption while in the Normal Realm be intercepted before reaching the Amalgram. This simply requires that each Essence of Corruption must have a player between it and the boss, and that they be killed with extreme urgency, as Blind Hatred will cause issues with interception.\nThe achievement can be cheesed by never sending any DPS into the Test Realm -- if no DPS ever goes in, no Essence of Corruption will ever spawn and thus, there will never be any Expel Corruption casts. This, however, will make the already-tight enrage timer even tighter (or indeed impossible), and should only be attempted by a well-geared raid purposefully attempting the encounter in Flexible difficulty."}

Seemingly a by-product of the mutated Galakrond, the not-living quickly attacked any living proto-dragon who adventured too close. It was noticed that proto-dragons that were bitten by them would develop a hunger that would cause them to act like Galakrond and try to devour their living companions.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa&lt;/a&gt; led a proto-dragon army to kill Galakrond, it was discovered that the not-living were in fact commanded by the monstrous fiend. While the proto-dragon was able to kill a great deal of not-living present, the not-living served their purpose in battle by bringing the army to Galakrond who emerged from beneath the earth and shattered the army as they scattered; many, including Talonixa, were killed.\nFollowing an attack by &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Watcher Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and the future &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, Galakrond sent his minions to hunt them down. At the same time, though, his ever-growing hunger caused Galakrond to devour the not-living as they were the only ones that didn't hide from the great behemoth. Galakrond's hunt came to an end when the future aspects engaged him again, and he unleashed his remaining not-living minions against them. Over the course of the battle, Malygos and Neltharion were noticed by the not-living while delivering a huge jagged stone into Galakrond's mouth. Determined to ensure that the plan's success, Neltharion broke off and engaged the not-living in battle.\nAs Galakrond struggled to dislodge the rock from his throat, his control over the not-living was broken and they began to attack one another. In the end, Galakrond perished when Neltharion blasted one of the not-living down his mouth in order to push the boulder further into his body. The remaining not-living were presumably also destroyed one way or another during the battle."}

Why? Simply because in these areas and for these quests either the rewards are really big, the quests are really easy, the quests are really close together, or you can get several quests done by killing the same group of &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Certain areas are also really good for a specific professions, or rare drops. \nThis article is intended as a leveling guide. This article is not intended as a &lt;a href=\"Places%20to%20Farm\"&gt;Places to Farm&lt;/a&gt; list to get certain materials however when certain creatures listed in these quests give notable items, for example the elemental earth in badlands, it is helpful for some players to have it included. This article is not intended as a list of places to &lt;a href=\"grind\"&gt;grind&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, If you ever thought something like \"wow, i wish i knew beforehand that i could do 'this,this and that' &lt;here&gt; together\" you probably found a notable area and you're encouraged to expand the list.\n1 to 10.\nThe beginning areas are rather simple and well-defined. The Night Elves have Teldrassil (the big tree), the Humans have Elwynn Forest, the Draenai have Azuremyst Isle and the Dwarves/Gnomes have Dun Morogh. The questlines are very straightforward, beginning with the person right in front of the newly created character and continuing with a few added quest lines from there. Levels 1-5 can be finished in under an hour even by the most inexperienced player and should involve few, if any, deaths. It is highly advisable to do these quests as well since they give basic money and the opportunities to both a) learn the game and b) the chance to gain slightly better armor than the starting gear. One note, however, while the starting gear is enough to level to about level 5 it is quickly replaced. Most toons are very poorly equipped to begin with (although the creatures they are fighting are equally as weak to reflect this) and the gear that they pick up along the way - even such basic gear as grey \"vendor trash\" - is an upgrade (albeit not fantastic).\nFor starting players: grey gear is called vendor trash because it is generally sold to a vendor right after it outlives its usefulness (or in some cases is never used because it has inferior statistics, but is worth cash to vendors and can help the players pay for repairs and other things). White gear is better than grey gear because it (usually) has better statistics. Green gear is known as uncommon gear and some green gear is fabulous, while other green gear is not very good. Typically it depends on the toon's level, with each toon getting better greens (and blues etc below) as they gain levels. Blue gear is rare gear and generally has either a) some kind of rare quality that makes it exceptionally good (such as very high statistics, a lot of damage or healing or occasionally the ability to do something special) or b) it sells for a lot of gold. The first pieces of blue gear are available in dungeons known as \"instances\" and are available for use around level 12-13 or so. Purple gear is called \"epic\" gear and is generally only available to really high level toons. It is considered the highest quality gear and often is the best in the game, but requires quite a bit of time to be able to get. Also, occasionally a toon has \"gold\" gear which is a Bind to Account item, which means that they have a high level toon (usually maxed out) feeding them. This gold gear is the equivalent of a blue item and it levels as the toon does.\n10 to 20.\nThere are a couple of areas that are for levels 10-20. The Draenei can continue in Azuremyst Isle/Bloodmyst Isle (they are connected) up to level 24 or so, or they can go to Darkshore (a zone they share with the Night Elves). There is also a boat for the Alliance to take to Stormwind if they should choose to go to the human zone of Westfall (where some very powerful Alliance only items can be obtained through a series of quests). The dwarves can continue to Loch Modan, or they can catch the tram connecting Stormwind to Ironforge and go to Westfall as well.\nAlso, The Redridge Mountains are connected to Elwynn Forest on their eastern side. This zone is for players level 15-25 and can supplement those toons who are questing in Westfall. \nNotable Westfall quest items: The Tunic of Westfall, The Staff of Westfall or The Chausses of Westfall"}

Basically, If you ever thought something along the lines of \"man, if only I had known beforehand that such a large number of quests were implemented into this zone to be completed simultaneously and with little effort,\" we encourage you expand this list with your findings.\n1 to 10.\nUnless you have a strong dislike for the aesthetic in your starting zone, or have done it several times before with different characters, you're probably better off leveling from 1-10 in your race's territory: (&lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;). \nIncidentally, tolerating the said zone for your race until at least the level of 4+ is a wise decision, as traveling on single-digit levels throughout adjacent areas tends to throw more difficulties and hinders your voyage to 80.\nIf you desire to change zones, all Horde starter areas are connected to provide easy travel between them while avoiding ?? areas. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; may walk to &lt;a href=\"the%20Undercity\"&gt;the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; easily; &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s may leave the Valley of Trials south through the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Path\"&gt;Hidden Path&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and then fly to &lt;a href=\"the%20Undercity\"&gt;the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; (if flight path is acquired); otherwise, a long trek to the zeppelin stations outside the gates of Orgrimmar can provide transportation to Tirisfal Glades or Mulgore; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; may travel to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;; Silvermoon and the Undercity are connected via the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt;. \n10 to 20.\nIf you have you may want to level from 10 to 20 in the area called &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; for several reasons:\n1. If you pick up the quest chain that starts with &lt;a href=\"The%20Farstrider%20Enclave\"&gt;The Farstrider Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and ends with &lt;a href=\"The%20Traitor%27s%20Destruction\"&gt;The Traitor's Destruction&lt;/a&gt; you will find that the quest reward for the final quest is an excellent &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; weapon (&lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Staff of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%27s%20Longbow\"&gt;Farstrider's Longbow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade\"&gt;Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sin%27dorei%20Warblade\"&gt;Sin'dorei Warblade&lt;/a&gt;).\n2. Afterwards, you should be &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; and you may purchase &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien%20Champion%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Tranquillien Champion's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; for about .\nAlso, 4 quests are notably close together in the troll area southeast &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Zeb%27Tela\"&gt;Attack on Zeb'Tela&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=\"Shadowpine%20Weaponry\"&gt;Shadowpine Weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%20Little%20Dash%20of%20Seasoning\"&gt;A Little Dash of Seasoning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bring%20Me%20Kel%27gash%27s%20Head%21\"&gt;Bring Me Kel'gash's Head!&lt;/a&gt;.\n20 to 30.\n&lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; is the most obvious zone for leveling, but be careful on PvP servers ( &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; is an alternative). There is a nice &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad (quest)&lt;/a&gt; quest chain and some other quests available in &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;. The main two areas you'll find yourself fighting is the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt; including the &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding area for the bears, spiders, and lions; the other zone of focus is &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\n30 to 40.\nYou may now wish to venture onto the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; because this area is not only excellent for grinding but for every creature here a quest is also available at the racetrack.\nWhen you picked up all the car parts first you're send to ratchet and booty bay (don't forget to pick up the fp). when in booty bay it is recommended to drop the quest of hemmingway in Stranglethorn Vale (pick up the fp at grom'gol) and continue to &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; (obviously pick up the fp there too). In swamp of sorrows you can also pick up a quest that will get you send to &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt;. Fly back to &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; and go to &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; by zeppelin and make your way down to badlands for the early level 40's. Bring along 1 &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Oil\"&gt;Frost Oil&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Coolant%20Heads%20Prevail\"&gt;Coolant Heads Prevail&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Gyrochronatom\"&gt;Gyrochronatom&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Gyro...%20What%3F\"&gt;Gyro... What?&lt;/a&gt; and 1 &lt;a href=\"Patterned%20Bronze%20Bracers\"&gt;Patterned Bronze Bracers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Is%20Better%20than%20Cloth\"&gt;Stone Is Better than Cloth&lt;/a&gt;. you can let friends make these or buy these items from the auction. The quest &lt;a href=\"Gyro...%20What%3F\"&gt;Gyro... What?&lt;/a&gt; will continue with another quest where the reward is &lt;a href=\"Nifty%20Stopwatch\"&gt;Nifty Stopwatch&lt;/a&gt;\n40 to 50.\n40 to 45.\nAs noted at the end of 30-40 and questing in thousand needles you will have two quests to complete in badlands after visiting swamp of sorrows. Additionally badlands is quitte a nice place for a few levels. after &lt;a href=\"Martek%20the%20Exiled\"&gt;Martek the Exiled&lt;/a&gt; you will probably like to continue with , &lt;a href=\"Barbecued%20Buzzard%20Wings\"&gt;Barbecued Buzzard Wings&lt;/a&gt; ,&lt;a href=\"Coyote%20Thieves\"&gt;Coyote Thieves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Badlands%20Reagent%20Run%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Badlands Reagent Run (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; , they are all pretty close to eachother and close to inn. Additionally the elementals are a good place for getting &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Earth\"&gt;Elemental Earth&lt;/a&gt;, the coyote and such are really good sources for skinning, also the coyote have a good drop rate for the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; related &lt;a href=\"Soft%20Bushy%20Tail\"&gt;Soft Bushy Tail&lt;/a&gt;. the quests named above all share creatures needed to kill (elementals for study and reagent, buzzards for reagents and cooking quest, coyote for reagents and thiefes). additionally this is a good place for herbing and mining but also for grinding. \n&lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Jordan\"&gt;Staff of Jordan&lt;/a&gt; is a world drop in badlands, so if you're extremely lucky you might get one of those as well.\nAlso, be careful to avoid the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fnpc%3D293\"&gt;level 55 buzzard&lt;/a&gt; and the patrolling &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Tho%27grun\"&gt;ogre boss&lt;/a&gt; that travels with an escort of ogres and you'll be fine.\n45 to 50.\nThe area &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; has many &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; for the level range of 45 to 55.\n50 to 60.\nThe area &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; is a easy place to level , it's full of quests and easy mobs. But it's a PvP-zone, so if you don't like PvPing you should do &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;."}

Also driven by power, he accepted the summons to serve the needs of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; with his skills in necromancy and curse-weaving. However, when Noth saw that the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; was taking numerous innocent lives, he began second-guessing his decision to join Kel'Thuzad. Kel'Thuzad swiftly dealt with Noth's growing compassion by freezing the living heart in Noth's chest.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nNoth is also a quest giver in the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s' instanced starting area, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, down in the &lt;a href=\"Havenshire%20Farms\"&gt;Havenshire Farms&lt;/a&gt; where he is involved in the following quests:\nAfter players complete &lt;a href=\"An%20End%20To%20All%20Things...\"&gt;An End To All Things...&lt;/a&gt;, starting phase 4: the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, he can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Cauldron\"&gt;Plague Cauldron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Noxious%20Glade\"&gt;The Noxious Glade&lt;/a&gt;. He has since then returned to Naxxramas above the Dragonblight.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Noth was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fleshwerks\"&gt;Fleshwerks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\n25-man abilities.\nNoth the Plaguebringer has approximately 8,440,000 hit points.\nPhase Two.\nEvery 110 seconds of combat Noth will teleport away to a balcony and become invulnerable while waves of skeletons attack the raid. Phase two lasts 70 seconds after which Noth will commence phase one again.\n10-man abilities.\nNoth the Plaguebringer has ~2.5 million hit points.\nPhase Two.\nEvery 110 seconds of combat Noth will teleport away to a balcony and become invulnerable while waves of skeletons attack the raid. Phase two lasts 70 seconds after which Noth will commence phase one again.\n25-man strategy.\nA relatively simple fight to start the Plague Quarter. You will need 2-3 decursing classes and 2-3 tanks. The skeletons in the encounter will spawn from the bone piles in the room.\nNoth hits quite lightly on the tank but will blink fairly often and reset threat. This is not terribly dangerous though DPS should slow and cripple should be dispelled to allow the tank to reestablish threat. Noth will use Curse of the Plaguebringer every ~50 seconds which is the crux of the encounter. Failure to decurse this generally results in a wipe. The offtanks should pick up the Plagued Warrior spawns but DPS should focus on Noth while he is in Phase One in order to kill him before two skeleton phases.\nWhen Noth teleports, the Plagued Warriors can be AoE'd along with the spawning Plagued Champions. The main tank should help pick up the Champions. Due to Shadow Shock, healers and ranged DPS should try to maintain the maximum range from the Plagued Champions to avoid unnecessary raid damage. \nWhen Noth returns, he will almost immediately cast Curse of the Plaguebringer, if this is decursed properly it should be a kill.\n10-man strategy.\nAs with the 25-man encounter, prompt removal of the Curse of the Plaguebringer is critical. Cripple should also be dispelled as soon as possible, especially on the tank. It is possible to heal through one missed curse/wrath, but the total damage to the raid can be as much as 100,000 per application and this should be viewed as a last resort.\nIf no decursing is available, those targeted with the curse need to run to three separate locations more than 30 yards from the raid, so that Wrath only hits them.\nEasiest for entry-level raids is to pursue a slow and steady strategy, where some dps is devoted to keeping the skeleton adds down to a reasonable number, and it is accepted that Noth will reach phase 2. This is most reliable if the raid has good healing endurance but overall dps is less than 14000. Assigning two dps (as well as a tank) to adds should be enough.\nA quicker strategy, for raids with good dps (14000 or greater) and a suitable tank, is to tank all of the skeleton adds and just burn down Noth. In this case the goal is to kill Noth before he enters Phase 2, avoiding the Plagued Warriors entirely. If dps comes up short it is not necessarily a wipe, but as many as eight adds will be up at the beginning of Phase 2. Alternatively, this strategy can be done intentionally and the adds can be aoe'd down as a group at the start of phase 2. This tactic can be used for a group with two solid tanks and two heals focuses on each, as well as suitable aoe damage dealers.\nIn either case, two tanks are needed \u2014 one to pick up the adds as they spawn on the bone piles, and one for Noth. The better geared tank should be assigned to add-tanking as the damage output of the skeletons will be greater than that of Noth once five or more of them are being held.\nQuotes.\nDuring the Death Knight storyline.\nIt might look like an ordinary pumpkin patch now, but once the plague cauldron is placed it will become a source of disease, rot and plague!\nIt's only a matter of time before the plague overtakes New Avalon.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Krosh has a Spell Shield that reduces magic damage taken by 75%. Mages must &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; this shield to remove it from Krosh and use it to protect themselves from Krosh's fireballs while still maintaining aggro with modest DPS. The only exception to this maintained aggro is that it is a common strategy for Warlocks who are &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;Enslaving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Olm%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Olm's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Fel%20Stalker\"&gt;Wild Fel Stalker&lt;/a&gt;s to place them on Krosh to have them disposed of. These Stalker adds may attack the mage tank's healer and need to be controlled. The mage (and the entire raid for that matter) should be running a threat meter (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/wiki/Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;) and you'll find that it doesn't take that much DPS to maintain aggro even with DPS-impaired gear. This is an important detail for mana management so the mage need not be casting full-time until such time as the raid focuses on Krosh to down him.\nBefore the pull, the mage tanking Krosh Firehand should stand completely to the right of the room and at maximum range from Krosh. Just in front of Krosh Firehand is a slight \"clip\" where the mage is to stand before the pull takes place. Do not move too close to the \"clip\" or you will aggro the room. A good reference point is just before the clip, where there is a portion of the wall to the right that makes a \"corner\" (with a little steam vent) that is a safe reference point stay at when preparing for the pull. \nAs High King Maulgar gets pulled, hit Krosh with any ranged instant-cast spell you have (&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Blast\"&gt;Fire Blast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PoM\"&gt;PoM&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt;) or if you time it correctly coinciding with the raid's pulling countdown, a &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast\"&gt;Arcane Blast&lt;/a&gt;. Positioning Krosh is easy since when you aggro him, he casts his Spell Shield and will run straight to you until he is right in front of you, then he will stay at that point and repeatedly fireball you stopping only to recast Spell Shield. As he runs toward you, spam Spellsteal. Once he stops and you see the have stolen his Spell Shield, you may want to turn 180\u00b0, blink, turn 180\u00b0 again, and commence your cycle. It is possible to back-up with-out blinking though. You should throw a few spells at him while doing so to build threat and protect your healer who is just as important as the mage tank. It in normal to be slowed while backing up. You are putting distance between him and yourself so that you avoid his Blast Wave attack. Make sure that you position him far enough to the right so the rest of the raid does not have to worry about his Blast Wave ability. If you are fortunate enough to get a &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Hunter Misdirect&lt;/a&gt; make sure the hunter knows NOT to use &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt; as this will dispel the Spell Shield and you will die, and the raid will likely wipe. Hunters should never hit Krosh with Arcane Shot, since the mage must continue tanking even after DPS commences on Krosh by the raid.\nYou are going to need a dedicated healer, or at least one that maintains focus on you along with the ability to get a big heal off rapidly. Krosh will only recast Spell Shield when he isn't casting a Greater &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; (3 second cast). This means that the tanking mage's Spell Shield can fade, and they must be able to take one full damage fireball so they can steal another shield. You are very likely to take several of these during the fight so your healer must be attentive. Greater Fireball hits for 8500\u20139500 damage but can be mitigated by casting &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Barrier\"&gt;Ice Barrier&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Mana%20Shield%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Mana Shield (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; just before Greater Fireball hits the tanking mage\u2014the shield(s) will absorb their designated damage whether the stolen Spell Shield is up or not, so time it wisely. A healing or mana+healing potion can be taken afterwards and you should wait for those moments to take one. A warlock &lt;a href=\"healthstone\"&gt;healthstone&lt;/a&gt; can help too and there are items such as , that can help but these share the cooldown with your which you will likely need.\nAll mages taking on the task should have high amounts of health. The mage tanking Krosh should have upwards of 12,000 HP when buffed, a good amount of spell hit, and a decent mana pool. The tanking mage should gear for stamina until he reaches a minimum of 10,500 health unbuffed (13k is more ideal). Spell Hit is critical and the mage should be near the full +16% &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;spell hit&lt;/a&gt; (202 rating) to minimize the chance of having Spellsteal resisted. With 5 points in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Focus\"&gt;Arcane Focus&lt;/a&gt; talent you would need just +6% spell hit (75 rating) from gear. Mana should not be disregarded, as repeated Spellstealing is costly (20% of your base mana). Spell Damage and Crit are good too but are lower priority, as again, it doesn't take that much dps to maintain aggro.\nYou should stop casting when the Spell Shield has around 5 seconds left, cast another shield spell at 3 seconds left, and then Spellsteal when his shield is reactivated. This way, you don't have &lt;a href=\"GCD\"&gt;GCD&lt;/a&gt; to worry about when you need to cast your shield spells and the subsequent Spellsteal. You can spam Spellsteal as this does nothing if 'There is nothing to steal'. Save your shield spells to help absorb the damage when your Spell Shield is about to fade to reduce the damage from the full Greater Fireball. Raid timer mods such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.deadlybossmods.com/\"&gt;Deadly Boss Mods&lt;/a&gt; and mods which show highly visible buff timers such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/details/3416/\"&gt;XPerl&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//ctmod.net/\"&gt;CTBuffMod&lt;/a&gt; are indispensable for this fight.\nDuring this time, your focus is on Krosh while the raid is downing the other members of the council. When they are finished they will turn to Krosh, and only then should you DPS at full speed. Another &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Hunter Misdirect&lt;/a&gt; is a good thing to have on you so have one assigned to you even if you didn't have one for the pull. After he dies, you can relax and casually DPS until Maulgar is downed.\nTheoretical.\nWhen doing this fight, depending on your timing, it is possible for the tanking mage to never take a full damage fireball. This does seem to be the luck of the draw but with skill, nerve, and low latency it is possible. Here's the math: 3 seconds per fireball and a 30 second shield. His cooldown is 30 seconds. He will cast 10 fireballs for a total casting time of 30 secs. After he casts spell shield, wait and watch his casting bar as he casts greater fireball and cast &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; when it is between 33% and 90% (1-2.5 secs). Therefore his cooldown will expire as he casts his last fireball and just before your shield expires. Rinse and repeat. If your timing is off, he will cast another fireball without a spell shield on either of you and in these cases, a mage should put up his shield(s) and then mash the &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; key. \n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowace.com/wiki/Quartz\"&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt; is another useful addon for this kind of timing and includes an integrated casting latency timer. The time it takes between when you hit Spellsteal and when the server actually registers it needs to be taken into account while doing this. If you're in the yellow, I wouldn't try it and just go for the key mashing approach."}

The biggest hurdle to a level 50 player attempting this feat is the level difference lowering your &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;spell hit&lt;/a&gt; rating, so many players will prefer to wait before attempting. Despite being an &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;, Kroshius is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, fire damage and &lt;a href=\"Enslave%20Demon\"&gt;enslavement&lt;/a&gt;, all of which you can use to your advantage. One effective strategy is to:\nIt is still possible for Kroshius to break free early, leaving both mobs for you to contend.\nNotes.\nSince infernals are usually summoned, and have rarely displayed sentience and rarely show signs of personality, it's odd that an infernal would have a name and be acting independently. However, Kroshius is not unique in this - the infernal &lt;a href=\"Raze\"&gt;Raze&lt;/a&gt;, while under the control of a human by the name of &lt;a href=\"Nilith%20Lokrav\"&gt;Nilith Lokrav&lt;/a&gt;, also is sentient and speaks, showing a similar simplistic \"smash!\" worldview as Kroshius."}

Specifically, the houses of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; separately sought to overthrow Proudmoore power and take the nation for their own ends.\nMostly localized to the regions of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the fighting would eventually threaten to topple the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Admiralty\"&gt;Proudmoore Admiralty&lt;/a&gt;, particularly during the climactic &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;Siege of Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, however, Proudmoore forces were able to gain the upper hand across the board, and emerged triumphant.\nThe civil war in Kul Tiras was an important event during the wider &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;war in Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Blood War. In its aftermath, the rank of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; was passed to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from her mother; at the same time, Kul Tiras finally reentered the Alliance and committed itself fully to the ongoing war against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nThe civil war in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; took place at a time of great change for the island nation and its people. The &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; continued to rage across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, with the Alliance venturing to Kul Tiras to seek their aid in the fight. The &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Admiralty\"&gt;Proudmoore Admiralty&lt;/a&gt; which ruled the kingdom had also become increasingly ineffective, with Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; mostly unaware of the troubles brewing close at hand.\nLady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; long nurtured a desire to seize control of Kul Tiras for herself, believing the Proudmoores to be unfit for leadership. She kept these motives hidden, however, and pretended to remain a close friend and confidant to the Lord Admiral, both women having lost their husbands at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Behind the scenes, Priscilla used the wealth and power of the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Company&lt;/a&gt; to undermine Proudmoore authority, going as far as to form a secret alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weaponry and other products manufactured by the company were sent to arm the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, in preparation for an eventual coup.\nMeanwhile, to the north in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, dark forces plotted to ruin the land and its people. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s, long having maintained a close connection to the sea, would fall to corruption at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;malicious whispers&lt;/a&gt; from the depths. Now aligned with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, House Stormsong abandoned its responsibilities to the people of the Valley, instead focusing entirely on preparations to conquer Kul Tiras for their dark masters.\nThese troubling events took place before the backdrop of a mystery involving the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;, which had been missing at sea for some time. The fleet's absence left the kingdom compromised and vulnerable, and eventually paved the way for a full-scale civil war. At the same time as the civil war, &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;other conflicts&lt;/a&gt; across Kul Tiras also threatened to overwhelm the nation.\nCivil war.\nAshvane treachery.\nLady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;'s plans to take power from &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; continued for some time unopposed, Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; remaining totally unaware of the plot and still believing Priscilla to be a loyal friend. When &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; to seek the kingdom's aid, Katherine would disown her daughter and hand her over to &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance forces, narrowly avoiding the same fate, began to work with &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; and sympathetic &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt;s to salvage the situation.\n&lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance emissary&lt;/a&gt; worked to uncover the true scope of House Ashvane's plans: from the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Foundry\"&gt;Ashvane Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, manufactured &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons were being sent to &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt;. In a deal made with &lt;a href=\"Harlan%20Sweete\"&gt;Harlan Sweete&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Ashvane hoped that the chaos caused by the newly-equipped pirate fleet would undermine the authority of House Proudmoore, enough for her to rise to power. Those loyal to the Proudmoores eventually infiltrated Freehold itself and recovered proof of the conspiracy.\nShortly after, the Irontide struck at &lt;a href=\"Daelin%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Daelin's Gate&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, which long protected access to the inner bay. With the Ashvane Company's weapons, they were able to demolish the sea gate and much of its defenses. The intervention of Proudmoore forces at &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Hill\"&gt;Vigil Hill&lt;/a&gt; managed to prevent a breakthrough and drive off the pirate fleet, but news of the attack quickly spread throughout the region.\nIn Boralus's &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Square\"&gt;Unity Square&lt;/a&gt;, Katherine Proudmoore subsequently addressed a crowd of gathered citizens, with Lady Ashvane in attendance. The Lord Admiral revealed her intention to step down in favor of Ashvane, but the ceremony was interrupted by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; and others. With the evidence they had gathered, they revealed the Ashvane plot in front of those gathered. In response, Priscilla detonated a sack of Azerite before attempting to flee. Simultaneously, Ashvane forces in attendance turned on the Proudmoore Guard present. The attempted coup was eventually crushed, though Priscilla herself escaped the scene. Katherine Proudmoore, shaken by these revelations, agreed to meet with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and discuss some form of cooperation.\nLady Priscilla and the Ashvane Company did not cease their ambitions after the setback in Boralus; they continued to work against House Proudmoore and build up their forces for another attempt at seizing power. Across Tiragarde Sound, the Proudmoore Admiralty dispatched forces to disrupt Ashvane and pirate efforts. At the time, the Ashvane Trading Company was ordered to stop all weapons manufacturing, though this was ignored.\nWhispers of Stormsong.\nWith &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; distracted by events in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, the dark plans of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; continued with little resistance. Unbeknownst to all, the House Stormsong &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s were responsible for the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, they kept up a ritual that trapped the wayward ships in a dark storm. Stormsong and his followers ultimately hoped to deliver the fleet to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and aid her in reclaiming Kul Tiras for the sea. Publicly, the loss of the fleet was ignored, with a focus being placed on building new ships instead.\nOn the other side of the Valley, &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27jir\"&gt;Zeth'jir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; launched their own invasion near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Daelin\"&gt;Fort Daelin&lt;/a&gt;, garrisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Battalion\"&gt;Proudmoore Battalion&lt;/a&gt;. Coming close to overwhelming the defenses, the naga also attempted to breach the nearby &lt;a href=\"Eventide%20Delta\"&gt;Eventide Delta&lt;/a&gt; to flood the area. With the aid of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, the Proudmoore soldiers defended Fort Daelin and &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; from attack, while defeating a major assault on the sea wall.\nThe fall of House Stormsong to corruption meant that the job of protecting the Valley now fell vacant. Growing threats across the region caused more and more damage, while those trying to enter Stormsong Valley were turned away at the border. The local populace, with the aid of uncorrupted tidesages and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt; of House Proudmoore, would form the &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt; to fight back the encroaching danger. &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; would lead the investigation into the darkness gripping House Stormsong; as they did so, the Storm's Wake fought Stormsong loyalists and freed many being forced to work against their will.\nMore militia and \"awakened\" members of House Stormsong eventually joined the cause as Brother Pike and his allies pushed closer to the Shrine of the Storm and the heart of the corruption. The discovery of &lt;a href=\"k%27thir\"&gt;k'thir&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;monstrosities&lt;/a&gt; reinforced the need to defeat Lord Stormsong. After much fighting, a party opened the way to the Shrine of the Storm itself, and confronted Stormsong outside the bastion. They would eventually pursue him into the Shrine and engage his legions of followers. The &lt;a href=\"Tidesage%20Council\"&gt;Tidesage Council&lt;/a&gt; and Lord Stormsong himself, were killed to prevent the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27zith%20the%20Whisperer\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the site was also purged.\nAfter the victory, Brother Pike performed a ritual to free the Kul Tiran fleet from its imprisonment. Although successful, he was not able to actually call the fleet home, believing this task to be in the hands of the Proudmoores themselves. Though a major blow had been dealt against House Stormsong, fighting continued throughout Stormsong Valley. The Storm's Wake remained active in meeting any persistent threats.\nSiege of Boralus.\nAfter House Ashvane's treachery was revealed, and threats in Stormsong Valley and &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; were dealt with, Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; focused on locating a rescuing her exiled daughter. With the help of Alliance champions, she discovered that Jaina had been sent to the &lt;a href=\"Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. While the Lord Admiral traveled in person to recover Jaina, Lady Ashvane gathered her forces for a major attack on the capital of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nKatherine and Jaina would return to the city just as the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;Siege of Boralus&lt;/a&gt; began. With both a &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; fleet and &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Company&lt;/a&gt; forces, Ashvane's army managed to breach the walls and invade the city proper. The &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Guard\"&gt;Proudmoore Guard&lt;/a&gt; grappled with the invaders in the streets, while members of the Alliance tried to crush the attack. Katherine Proudmoore fortified her position in &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which narrowly avoided being reduced by &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; artillery. Eventually, Proudmoore forces pushed through the city and slowly turned the tide. The defeat of &lt;a href=\"Viq%27Goth\"&gt;Viq'Goth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; unleashed by Ashvane, signaled victory over the Ashvane forces currently investing Boralus.\nSoon after, another fleet led personally by Priscilla Ashvane prepared to descend on the city, whose defenses were no longer able to resist. From the battlements of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate%20%28Boralus%29\"&gt;Great Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Katherine and Jaina watched the approaching force. In one last effort, Katherine gave Jaina &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;her father's&lt;/a&gt; pendant, which possessed great value for generations of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Through the trinket, Jaina was subsequently able to locate the missing &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; and call them to Boralus's defense. Emerging from the mists, the fleet (led by &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;) immediately set to work surrounding the enemy vessels. Outmaneuvered and outgunned, Lady Ashvane and her forces quickly surrendered, ending hostilities.\nThe defeat of Lady Ashvane during the Siege of Boralus and the return of the fleet marked a decisive end to the civil war. Shortly afterwards, the various houses of Kul Tiras convened in &lt;a href=\"Unity%20Square\"&gt;Unity Square&lt;/a&gt;, where Katherine officially stepped down as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; in favor of Jaina. Those gathered pledged their loyalty to the new Lord Admiral and House Proudmoore. With King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance also in attendance, Jaina also officially committed Kul Tiras to the Alliance cause, and the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

It specifically refers to the main body of the modern-day Kul Tiran navy, which forms much of the nation's offensive and defensive power. The fleet is a highly formidable force and is central to the legendary reputation of Kul Tiras as a maritime power. It is also the latest in a long line of Kul Tiran fleets, such as the doomed &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;Stormsongs&lt;/a&gt; build every ship of the fleet, the &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt; bless every last Kul Tiran vessel, which is what really sets them apart from the ships visiting Kul Tiras. The nation's largest ships always carry a tidesage to navigate through storms, withstand heavy seas, and put wind in their sails.\nOnly a few &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s are selected to be sea scouts operating from flagships in the fleet. Their long-range reconnaissance is an integral part of Kul Tiran sea dominance.\nThe Kul Tiran naval force is crewed by sailors descended from centuries of seafaring traditions.\nThe fleet proudly stands as one of the finest of its kind in the entire world, and at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; described Kul Tiras as possessing the greatest naval power in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond War.\nAfter its foundation as a nation, Kul Tiras built up a mighty fleet of merchant vessels that sailed throughout the known lands in search of exotic goods to trade and sell. As of the start of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, these far-ranging merchant ships made it the most prosperous nation in the known world. When the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s began to raid the coastal settlements of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; took it upon himself to construct an armada of warships in order to pledge the assistance of the merchant-nation to the burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kul Tiran fleet was then joined with the other fleets of the Alliance, under the leadership of the new &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; Proudmoore. Under his control, the Alliance navy intercepted the Horde fleet near the island of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Proudmoore's vessels finding the crude Horde ships was akin to a wolf crossing paths with an injured lamb. Proudmoore's seasoned maritime fleet was able to easily outmaneuver the less sea experienced orc navy sooner than he anticipated.\nHowever, the Horde fleet was not alone. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who had been wary of the humans' naval superiority, had ordered the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to supply the newly enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; as support. Though reluctant to do so as battle mount training had not yet been completed, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; sent three red dragons to protect the Horde fleet as it crossed to Lordaeron. Reluctantly following the orcs from behind, the enslaved red dragons appeared after Proudmoore's navy attacked and had bathed several of the Alliance vessels in fire. Though the dragons were few in number, Proudmoore had no means to combat them at the time and was forced to call a retreat. As the Alliance fleet scattered, the Horde ships continued their advance toward &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater in the conflict, after the Horde was completely driven from Lordaeron and Khaz Modan was liberated, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde fleet had been sailing towards the Horde-controlled Stormwind when they were &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Crestfall\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; by the Alliance navy under the command of Grand Admiral Proudmoore. The battle had begun similar to the one near Zul'Dare, Proudmoore outmaneuvered his foes and hammered them with &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; fire. And just as before, the Horde had dragons. The beasts swooped down from the skies and engulfed the Alliance ships in sheets of fire.\nAdmiral Proudmoore's ships were able to easily outflank the lumbering and crude orc vessels, wracking them with cannon fire and inflicting casualties. The Horde ships were guarded by red dragon riders, which dove from the sky and burned Alliance vessels. This time, however, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fleet was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The gryphon riders had learned from their battles against the dragons across the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to use their mobility against their larger adversaries.\nEventually, the majority of the Horde fleet was left in ruins by Proudmoore's superior forces. Only a handful of vessels escaped being sunk, including &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim's&lt;/a&gt; ship. Above, the dwarves' fearless efforts were enough to ultimately drive the dragon riders to flight, and they subsequently scattered in all directions. Among the losses suffered by Proudmoore's navy was the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet&lt;/a&gt; to the dragon-riders of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs, taking with it &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, eldest son of the Grand Admiral.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nA portion of the Kul Tiran fleet patrolled &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the times before the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; reported an orcish raid on its docks, the Kul Tirans intervened in minutes, but were repelled by &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and a flight of &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who destroyed three of their large ships.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the splintering of the Alliance, Kul Tiras was one of the nations that remained an ally with King Terenas. Admiral Proudmoore's mighty fleets patrolled the trade lanes hunting &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"marauder\"&gt;marauder&lt;/a&gt;s, maintaining order on the high seas. Several &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ships reported that they had escaped a band of pirates whose leader carried &lt;a href=\"Fate\"&gt;glowing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;blades&lt;/a&gt; oozing black smoke, and soon it became clear that those ships were the lucky ones. A newly empowered crew of pirates was preying on Alliance vessels, and when the raiders captured a ship, they left no survivors. Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led the search for the rogues, and after weeks of hunting, his small fleet cornered their ship a few miles off the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;' shores. The pirate crew seemed to be possessed, barely &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, but after a coordinated &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; barrage, Proudmoore sent the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellwether\"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;\", to the bottom of the ocean. The admiral sailed away, believing he had killed them all.\nThe Third War.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Daelin Proudmoore, had been convinced by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; that sailing west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with refugees from Lordaeron was the only course to save humanity. She commandeered the Kul Tiras fleet and took them immediately across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, where she saved the world by allying with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe founding of Durotar.\nAdmiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet eventually reached &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; after some time to reestablish contact with the missing &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; that escaped the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and search for his missing daughter. Yet when they discovered the fugitive orcs and Darkspear trolls had established a foothold on the land, Admiral Proudmoore launched an invasion on the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Durotar%20%28nation%29\"&gt;new kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Preparing himself for landfall, Daelin made &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt; second in command in his absence, giving him full authority on domestic Kul Tiras military matters. &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Alverold\"&gt;Lieutenant Alverold&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet was dispatched to scout the whole coastline of Kalimdor, while Proudmoore ordered various forces to head inland. The Kul Tiras fleet began attacking the Horde settlements on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; to relocate to the mainland. Unable to agree with her father's decisions, Jaina started helping &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his champion &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrall and his armies marched towards &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; where he was advised by Jaina to hire goblin shipbuilders to construct warships capable of breaking the Kul Tiran blockade of Theramore. The Horde forces eventually landed in Theramore City and managed to defeat the Kul Tiran sailors and marines, with Daelin himself being killed by the orcish heroes along the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;fleet's flagship&lt;/a&gt;.\nA year later, as ordered by Daelin before disembarking, Lieutenant Benedict launched a second wave of Kul Tiras sailors and marines, retaking &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; while awaiting Lieutenant Alverold's return. By the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, most of the other survivors of Daelin's fleet had already sailed back to the Eastern Kingdoms. The fate of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Alverold\"&gt;Lieutenant Alverold&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition around Kalimdor is still unknown, thought he might have been one of those.\nModern times.\nAfter the massive loss of ships and men in the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the navy was once again gradually rebuilt under the new Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The following years marked a time of self-imposed isolation for Kul Tiras, and so the fleet took part in little to no engagements outside the kingdom.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMonths before the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the fleet mysteriously disappeared at sea, along with its commander &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to most of the nation, the ships were being held captive in a massive artificial storm by Kul Tiras's very own &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt;, normally sworn to protect the fleet. &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and the Tidesages came under the dark influence of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and sought to deliver the fleet to their new mistress regardless of the cost.\nThe absence of the fleet left all of Kul Tiras vulnerable to many threats. In particular, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt; set their sights on the capital of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; amid the turmoil. Meanwhile, in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of House Stormsong spread across the land. Though supposedly trying to call the fleet home, the Tidesages' true desires were eventually uncovered. A force of &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt; militia and their &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, preventing a ritual intended to deliver the fleet to Azshara. After defeating &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and his corruption, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; performed his own ritual at the heart of the Shrine, ensuring the temporary safety of the fleet, though it still remained lost at sea.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;Siege of Boralus&lt;/a&gt; led by Lady Ashvane, the city stood on the brink of falling. As Ashvane's final attack arrived, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was given her father's pendant by her mother as a last hope. Using the trinket, which Daelin Proudmoore had used to call the fleet in times past, Jaina was able to both locate the lost fleet and bring it home. Before the harbor gates, the Kul Tiran fleet cut through the mists in its full glory, with Captain &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; at the helm. The fleet quickly surrounded Ashvane's &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; forces, who surrendered. This signaled the restoration of Kul Tiras's naval power once more, as the nation proceeded to officially join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed the body of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, several ships were sent to &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Harbor\"&gt;Plunder Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve it. As the Horde agents get a hold of the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, they used its power against the ships, setting them on fire.\nTides of Vengance.\nAfter receiving reports of the Alliance invading northern &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and conquering the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt; not far from &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; decided to combine their forces and drive them out with a counteroffensive. With the Kul Tiran fleet said to be just off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, Princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; sent the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to get the Golden Fleet to attack them. Once a majority of the Horde's forces were lured to Nazmir, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the assault on Nazmir was a ruse and began their true objective: the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;assault on Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. The Golden Fleet sought to impede the Alliance navy's path, which was spearheaded by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20ship\"&gt;Jaina's ship&lt;/a&gt;, and so the Zandalari harried them with &lt;a href=\"ballistae\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt;s, but the Alliance had secretly planted explosives on their ships beforehand. Just as &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; was about to remotely detonate the explosives with his remote detonator machine, Gelbin's floor collapsed from the impact of one of the Golden Fleet's ballistae missiles. Gelbin fell below the deck of Jaina's ship and pulled himself out of the rubble so he could rush to re-position his remote detonator. Once the remote detonator was upright again, Gelbin pushed the detonator button and blew up the entirety of the Golden Fleet stationed there, allowing the Alliance navy to invade &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; with little resistance.\nRise of Azshara.\nA great portion of the Kul Tiran fleet chased after &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;'s across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, the seas opened due to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s usage of the &lt;a href=\"%3ATidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;:Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, and all of the vessels present were wrecked in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, presumably weakening the Kul Tiran fleet considerably afterwards.\nVisions of N'zoth.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; and the escape of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Kul Tiran fleet scoured the seas of Azeroth on the command of Lady Jaina Proudmoore, hoping to find the Banshee Queen to put her to justice.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lord Admiral Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and her fleet were reported to be in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, it was the largest naval force in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and a major contributor to the war effort against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, and with the eventual disintegration of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Kul Tiras became significantly more isolated and less involved on the world stage.\nKul Tiras would once again return to prominence during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; dispatched envoys to the islands to enlist the aid of the potent Kul Tiran navy in their latest conflict against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThere is archaeological evidence demonstrating that the islands were once part of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; makes mention that the area currently known as the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; is a place of ancient power with countless names over the ages.\n2,700 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; traveled to various regions. Some human sailors left &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and found a large island full of metal ores and other resources. Following their arrival in Kul Tiras, the human colonists were attacked by the native &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. The war that ensued led the large and hardy race, who lived in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, to extinction.\nThe sailors then founded a mighty maritime outpost named Kul Tiras and in time it became a city-state that developed a thriving economy based on fishing and exports. Over the years, mighty fleets of merchant vessels were built and they sailed throughout the seas in search of exotic goods to trade and sell.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSometime after the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance came to the island seeking the powerful &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; to aid in their &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; against the Horde.\nThe Alliance untangled a web of betrayal and dark magic as they encountered &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;power-hungry pirates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es wielding death magic, mystical &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; of Kul Tiras and the nation rejoined the Alliance. Kul Tiras took part in the faction war with the Horde, including rooting out &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Horde outposts&lt;/a&gt; on its territory and fighting off Horde &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nKul Tiras is located west of &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, and southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. It is cold, mountainous, and rich with metal ores and other valuable natural resources. Its inner bay is protected by three great &lt;a href=\"seagate\"&gt;seagate&lt;/a&gt;s, each reinforced with sea walls, bunkers, cannons, fortifications, and a garrison.\nZones.\nKul Tiras is separated into four zones, three of which are scaled to the player's level up to 50.\nIn the RPG.\nKul Tiras is a large island off &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s west coast, between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, though is considered a land of this last continent. The unsettled areas are covered with rolling hills and sparse evergreen woods. Kul Tiras is temperate, though subject to sudden ocean storms. The nation is also very windy, which makes &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; rides perilous. Kul Tiras' greatest asset is also its greatest danger. Murlocs and naga crawl from the sea to torment sailors and fishermen. Pirates roam the waters preying on merchant vessels.\nThe nearby islands of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, immediately off the northeast coast, and farther &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, in the same direction, are also parts of Kul Tiras.

The first of them became the &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt;, and they guided others to the island soon after. Some of them stayed on this island and founded a mighty maritime outpost named Kul Tiras. Over the decades, these new cities continued to grow and develop their own unique customs.\nFollowing their arrival in Kul Tiras, the human colonists encountered the native &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the humans' intention of living in harmony with them, the large and hardy race did not welcome them amicably and would raid the human settlers for generations. Thus was born the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt;, an organization dedicated to counter these attacks. &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Drust that had kept to their druidic heritage, broke off from the rest and some eventually integrated into Kul Tiran society.\nMany years later, &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Colonel Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; decided the time had come to end the bloodshed. He organized a final assault against the Drust and their city of &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt;, assisted by both Ulfar's Thornspeakers and &lt;a href=\"Athair\"&gt;Athair&lt;/a&gt;. Arom faced their leader &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; himself and valiantly gave him the final blow. The Drust King's armies and constructs all faltered at once. From this victory, Arom was promoted to Lord and became the patriarch and founder of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;. He would eventually pass on, but his descendants would live in fame and power for a thousand years to come.\nRise as a nation.\n1,200 years BDP, the kingdom of Arathor disintegrated. Its once-small trading outposts and cities had grown into independent city-states, which over generations became increasingly distant and insular. The island bastion of Kul Tiras continued its traditions of trading and shipping. The city-state boasted a massive navy - the greatest in all of Arathor. Its mighty fleets of merchant vessels sailed throughout the seas, its most daring captains exploring the coasts of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and returning with exotic goods and tales of strange lands in the remote corners of the continent. Kul Tiras's shipping and fishing economy eclipsed the maritime power of its northern neighbor, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to compete with Kul Tiras' burgeoning navy, Gilneas instead focused on bolstering its land-based armies and mercantile capabilities.\nThe Second War.\nKul Tiras was among the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt; and its leader Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who was a long-time friend of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, believed that vengeance on behalf of a destroyed nation was the correct course of action and was in favor of joining into an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of human nations&lt;/a&gt;, that would eradicate the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and reclaim Stormwind for its survivors.\nUnder the control of the new Grand Admiral, the Alliance navy intercepted the Horde fleet near the island of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Proudmoore's vessels finding the crude Horde ships was akin to a wolf crossing paths with an injured lamb. Proudmoore's seasoned maritime fleet was able to easily outmaneuver the less sea experienced orc navy sooner than he anticipated. Orcish ships were blown to pieces by Alliance cannon volley, and the crews of sunken transports were swallowed by the waves. Proudmoore soon realized that he could destroy the entire Horde army at sea and bring a quick end to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the Horde fleet was not alone. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who had been wary of the humans' naval superiority, had ordered the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to supply the newly enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; as support. Though reluctant to do so as battle mount training had not yet been completed, &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; sent three red dragons to protect the Horde fleet as it crossed to Lordaeron. He threatened to torture their mother &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; if they disobeyed.\nReluctantly following the orcs from behind, the enslaved red dragons appeared after Proudmoore's navy attacked and had bathed several of the Alliance vessels in fire. Though the dragons were few in number, Proudmoore had no means to combat them at the time and was forced to call a retreat. As the Alliance fleet scattered, the Horde ships continued their advance toward &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nKul Tiras forces were later stationed along the northern border of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, fighting to keep the orcs from advancing into southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Horde was completely driven from Lordaeron and Khaz Modan was liberated, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde fleet had been sailing towards the Horde-controlled Stormwind when they were &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Crestfall\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; by the Alliance navy under the command of Grand Admiral Proudmoore. The battle had begun similar to the one near Zul'Dare, Proudmoore outmaneuvered his foes and hammered them with &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; fire. And just as before, the Horde had dragons. The beasts swooped down from the skies and engulfed the Alliance ships in sheets of fire. \nAdmiral Proudmoore's ships were able to easily outflank the lumbering and crude orc vessels, wracking them with cannon fire and inflicting casualties. The Horde ships were guarded by red dragon riders, which dove from the sky and burned Alliance vessels. This time, however, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fleet was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The gryphon riders had learned from their battles against the dragons across the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to use their mobility against their larger adversaries. They attacked the dragons in a flurry of movement, drawing their attention away from the ships below. The lightning-infused &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s of gryphon riders were wielded with deadly efficiency against the formidable flames of their scaled enemies. Without the dragons, the Horde fleet stood little chance and continued to suffer disastrous losses at the hands of the Alliance navy. The sea itself was painted red with the blood of the countless individuals drowning or being killed outright in the struggle.\nEventually, the majority of the Horde fleet was left in ruins by Proudmoore's superior forces. Only a handful of vessels escaped being sunk, including &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim's&lt;/a&gt; ship. Above, the dwarves' fearless efforts were enough to ultimately drive the dragon riders to flight, and they subsequently scattered in all directions. Among the losses suffered by Proudmoore's navy was the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet&lt;/a&gt; to the dragon-riders of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs, taking with it &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, eldest son of the Grand Admiral.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nAs a member of the Alliance Kul Tiras reported the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s movements. A portion of their fleet was attacked by black dragons in or near &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the splintering of the Alliance, Kul Tiras was one of the nations that remained an ally with King Terenas. Admiral Proudmoore, whose mighty fleets patrolled the trade lanes hunting pirates and marauders, maintained order on the high seas.\nThe Third War.\nThe base of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marines\"&gt;Kul Tiras Marines&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20islands\"&gt;Darkspear islands&lt;/a&gt;, which were hostile to the trolls, was destroyed by Thrall's &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; as it made its way across the Great Sea to Kalimdor, coinciding with an attack by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; minions.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful sorceress of Dalaran and the dear daughter of Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, had been convinced by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; that sailing west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with refugees from Lordaeron was the only course to save humanity. She commandeered the Kul Tiras fleet and took them immediately across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, in her haste apparently leaving her father uninformed. This \"&lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt;\" comprised members of most Alliance-aligned nations and races as well as many of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Elite%20Corps\"&gt;Kul Tiras' finest soldiers&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina's goal was to reach the Oracle at &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; also sought. The two factions warred across the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; until the two leaders simultaneously stumbled upon the Prophet who had sent them both to Kalimdor, imploring them to unite against the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The two unlikely allies ultimately agreed to put aside their history of conflict, and worked together to defeat the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Barrens\"&gt;the Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Moving their forces into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the humans and orcs battled with the invading Legion's &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; and their Scourge minions, as well as the xenophobic night elf &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina was able to help in the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;defeat at Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; with another desperate alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually decided to stay in Kalimdor with the people that had traveled with her, founding &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Her unlikely treaty with Thrall and the orcs, who settled in nearby &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, remained inviolate.\nThe founding of Durotar.\nAdmiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet eventually reached &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; after some time to reestablish contact with the missing &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; that escaped the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and search for his missing daughter. Yet when they discovered the fugitive orcs and Darkspear trolls had established a foothold on the land, Admiral Proudmoore launched an invasion on the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Durotar%20%28nation%29\"&gt;new kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Preparing himself for landfall, Daelin made &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt; second in command in his absence, giving him full authority on domestic Kul Tiras military matters.\nAt first, the location of Jaina and the survivors of Lordaeron was unknown - &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Alverold\"&gt;Lieutenant Alverold&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched to scout the whole coastline of Kalimdor, while Proudmoore ordered various forces to head inland (such as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Thornby\"&gt;Captain Thornby&lt;/a&gt;). Camps and fortifications soon sprung up across the eastern coast of Kalimdor, including &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Unwilling to even parlay with the orcs that were his daughter's allies, the Grand Admiral relentlessly attacked the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall ultimately ordered retaliation against the humans responsible, although he was unable to conclude them a separate force from Jaina's &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. The Kul Tiras fleet began attacking the Horde settlements on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; to relocate to the mainland. Kul Tiras forces even attempted to assassinate Thrall by trying to lure him to a parlay. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his companions were sent by Thrall to Theramore to deliver a personal plea to explain the spate of human aggression, bypassing a Kul Tiran &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Base\"&gt;coastal base&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina met with Thrall's emissaries and was bewildered by their accusations. Demanding to see proof, they journeyed back to the mainland to discover the coastal base destroyed by &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Finding survivors, Jaina recognized them as her countrymen. Teleporting back to Theramore Isle, Jaina was helpless to explain as her father arrived dramatically. Initially overjoyed, Admiral Proudmoore was incensed by his daughter's alliance with the Horde and ordered her and the emissaries to be seized, taking over Theramore's military and defenses. He then returned to the mainland at his new stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar managed to rouse the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s to the Horde's banner, and the two factions fought over Northwatch.\nAfter their victory, Thrall and his armies marched towards Theramore where he was advised by a renegade Jaina Proudmoore to hire goblin shipbuilders to construct warships capable of breaking the blockade of Theramore, on the condition that Thrall attempt to spare the lives of her soldiers. After a long and climactic battle within Theramore itself, Daelin Proudmoore lay dead. The remaining humans stood down, and a devastated Jaina ran to her father's side. Thrall left the city intact, and understanding this had been an incident out of Jaina's control, he maintained his treaty with Theramore Isle.\nA year later, as ordered by Daelin before disembarking, Lieutenant Benedict launched a second wave of Kul Tiras sailors and marines, retaking Tiragarde Keep while awaiting Lieutenant Alverold's return. Even though the Horde was unable to expel them for many years, the Keep and its sailors were finally destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. By then most of the other survivors of Daelin's fleet had already sailed back to the Eastern Kingdoms. The fate of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Alverold\"&gt;Lieutenant Alverold&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition around Kalimdor is still unknown, thought he might have been one of those.\nWhen the people of Kul Tiras learned of their Lord Admiral's fate, they cried out for vengeance for his death, but the rest of the Alliance did not seek it. The plague of undeath in Lordaeron had already left the Alliance reeling, and its other leaders had little pity for Daelin Proudmoore, who had launched a war of aggression on his own authority. In fury, the people of Kul Tiras isolated themselves from the Alliance. But their anger was not focused on King Varian Wrynn or any of the other Alliance leaders. Instead, they grew to hate Jaina Proudmoore, the &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;daughter who had betrayed her family&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs the Horde made allies of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance reached out to Kul Tiras in order to gain their support and access to their powerful navy. However, they first needed to prove their worth to the nation's ruling houses. Kul Tiras has degenerated severely in contemporary times; it is plagued with crime, piracy, corruption, a missing &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drust%20incursion\"&gt;Drust incursion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; radicalization of the &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt;s, a burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, and to compound further their problems, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had recently raided &lt;a href=\"Brennadam\"&gt;Brennadam&lt;/a&gt; and invaded &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reconciling the estranged &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoore family&lt;/a&gt; and stabilizing Kul Tiras' troubled territories, the Alliance had once again regained the Kul Tirans' trust and unified the maritime nation. &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; secretly plotted to usurp &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s rule over the island kingdom, but her attempt was ultimately thwarted by Alliance adventurers. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s success in foiling &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;'s coup d'\u00e9tat and recovering Kul Tiras' missing fleet had also restored faith in Proudmoore leadership and she was subsequently named &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; for her accomplishments. Faced with the threat of the Horde, Kul Tiras rejoined the Alliance. The Kul Tirans then retaliated against the Horde by joining the Alliance during their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;invasion of Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople and culture.\nKul Tiras is ruled by four houses: &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Ashvane\"&gt;House Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. Each house has a seat on a council that rules the nation. The strength of each seat varies in terms of political power, which leads to political intrigue between the houses. Though each house flies its own colors, the Kul Tiran &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;national color&lt;/a&gt; is green.\nSomething originating from Kul Tiras is known as \"Tirasian\", a term sometimes spelled as \"Tirassian\". In \"Battle for Azeroth\", the term \"Kul Tiran\" is used.\nThe humans of Kul Tiras often have a more robust and rugged look than their continental brethren. Their clothing is made for harsh weather, with high collars. They have a pride and connection with ships, and as such their buildings are inspired by them. While the crews of Tirasian ships are known to be easily amused, the nation's merchant lords are notorious for their bald pates. The Kul Tiran &lt;a href=\"Outriggers\"&gt;Outriggers&lt;/a&gt; fight and hunt the monsters of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; around their island.\nThey have a specific accent, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; stated she lost her accent on purpose after arriving in Dalaran, in order to fit in better. An expression of shock for Kul Tirans is \"For tides' sake.\"\nAnimal husbandry and &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;manship are important disciplines to the Kul Tirans, many of whom are skilled riders and &lt;a href=\"falcon\"&gt;falcon&lt;/a&gt;ers. Horses in the Kul Tiras military are bred from an early age not to fear the sea, and revel in galloping along the shoreline and through the spray. Combat prowess is an important requirement for Kul Tiran riders. The &lt;a href=\"Norwington%20Equestrian%20and%20Hunt%20Festival\"&gt;Norwington Equestrian and Hunt Festival&lt;/a&gt; draws equestrian riders and hunters from all over Kul Tiras for their competitions.\nBecause &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Silver%20Ore\"&gt;storm silver&lt;/a&gt; is lightweight and resists corrosion, Kul Tirans use it in their ships. They also use it for armor for their marines and even pirates, so that they can swim without sinking. Once this sacred material is blessed by a sea priest for use in shipbuilding, it is buried under water for a year.\nPiracy is considered one of the most vile of crimes under Kul Tiran law. Those caught and charged with piracy are sentenced to death and publicly executed, the task being accomplished by an &lt;a href=\"executioner\"&gt;executioner&lt;/a&gt;. The death penalty by hanging can also be applied for thieves, it was notably the case of &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;'s mother, &lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Fairwind\"&gt;Lyra Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; narrowly escaped being hanged at &lt;a href=\"Hangman%27s%20Point\"&gt;Hangman's Point&lt;/a&gt;, after being falsely accused of being a witch.\nThe Kul Tirans created &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore%23Daughter%20of%20the%20Seas\"&gt;a song&lt;/a&gt; about Jaina and her role in &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin&lt;/a&gt;'s death.\nKul Tiras exports a type of wine known as Kul Tiras red.\nFaith.\nThe Kul Tirans worship a goddess called the &lt;a href=\"Tidemother\"&gt;Tidemother&lt;/a&gt;, and most people on Kul Tiras look to the seas for guidance the same way others look to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The Kul Tirans have always survived primarily on their wits and bravery, for while the Light rewards conviction, the ocean demands activity. The order called &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt; have a much deeper connection with the water. All seaworthy Kul Tiran vessels are blessed by the tidesages, who commune with the sea to guide the nation's legendary fleet.\nFor the most part, the people of Kul Tiras do not bury their dead, but rather send them to the sea. The tidesages use an ornate bell named a Dead Ringer that calls the souls of the recently deceased to them, and release them through the Ritual of Release. The souls of the fallen are released into rivers that flow through the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; and out into the open sea. Despite this, there is a &lt;a href=\"Barrowknoll%20Cemetery\"&gt;large cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the region has a different tradition and does bury their dead.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; spread its faith in Kul Tiras, and consequently the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; in particular worship the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Among their priests, &lt;a href=\"Mercy%20Fairwater\"&gt;Mercy Fairwater&lt;/a&gt; was one of the champions known as the &lt;a href=\"Defenders%20of%20Drustvar\"&gt;Defenders of Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Third Fleet of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; had at least two holy &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Eye%20of%20Paleth\"&gt;Eye of Paleth&lt;/a&gt; on board before being sunk. During the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the Kul Tiras navy deployed Light-wielding &lt;a href=\"Chaplain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;chaplains&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Chaplain\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of a &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Chaplains\"&gt;superior officer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Petty%20Officer\"&gt;Chief Petty Officer&lt;/a&gt; was a mighty Kul Tiran paladin of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and one of Admiral Daelin Proudmoore's most loyal officers. At least &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Erik\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20Loriette\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; also wield the Light, and some Kul Tirans can be found among the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; that defend Drustvar during &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nKul Tirans have a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic order known as the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt;. Most people seem to be wary of them.\nFolklore and traditions.\nKul Tiran folklore claims that beings called &lt;a href=\"mermaid\"&gt;mermaid&lt;/a&gt;s lived near Boralus early in its history. The humans viewed them as accursed creatures who portended storms and drowned sailors for amusement, until the mermaid &lt;a href=\"Halia\"&gt;Halia&lt;/a&gt;, her love, the tidesage &lt;a href=\"Ery\"&gt;Ery&lt;/a&gt;, and all of the other mermaids in the region helped save Boralus from a great storm by constructing the city's great seawall. Ery nearly died in the process, but Halia subsequently slit open the tidesage's feet and jumped with her into the harbor, prompting the mermaids' &lt;a href=\"Mother%20%28mermaids%29\"&gt;Mother&lt;/a&gt; to transform Ery into a mermaid as well. As long as Boralus' seawall has stood, its people now swear on mermaids as symbols of highest honor and good luck, as well as sacrifice, for no mermaids were ever seen in the harbor again after the storm. All of Kul Tiras knows Ery's story, and on certain calm sunsets when the red is deeply reflected in the surface of Boralus Harbor, old sailors call it \"Ery's blood\", which presages good weather, in remembrance of the dutiful tidesage and the mermaid who loved her.\nKul Tirans have a tradition where during a celebration, be it a funeral, wedding, or birthday, they incorporate &lt;a href=\"Star%20Moss\"&gt;Star Moss&lt;/a&gt; into the decorations. They do it so that those who are no longer among the living can be there in spirit. Star moss is magically sensitive to emotions: feelings of loss, reverence, and joy keep the blooms from wilting. Sailors will give their loved ones a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Stalk\"&gt;Sea Stalk&lt;/a&gt; flower and keep the stalk itself on themselves. Because sea stalk has the magical ability to keep its flower watered even if they are disconnected, if the sailor falls overboard and the saltwater kills the stalk, the flower will also die. The flower wilting therefore signifies that your lover has died. Some sailors consider them bad luck, almost tempting fate. Others want their loved ones to not have to wait for bad news. Sea stalks are seen as not just a stick, but as a family member's life.\nIt is customary to place swords on the grave or locations of the brave, fallen warriors of the nation. The swords are sometimes adorned with trinkets or jewelry. Some Kul Tirans speak of a boatman that calls them after death. Jaina Proudmoore once saw and paid the obol with one of these trinkets to a &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;hooded figure&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a Kul Tiran becomes captain of their own vessel, they are gifted a spyglass worked with precious gems.\nRuling houses of Kul Tiras.\nThe four houses that rule Kul Tiras used to be unified under Daelin Proudmoore's leadership, but that gradually changed after his death.\nMilitary.\nThe Admiralty of Kul Tiras possibly possesses the world's &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;largest navy&lt;/a&gt;, rivaled only by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a number of named military organizations:\nAlong with the standard human, dwarven, gnomish and historically high elven soldiery of the Alliance, Kul Tiras has employed:\nKul Tiran soldiers introduced before \"Battle for Azeroth\" bearing the Kul Tiran &lt;a href=\"tabard\"&gt;tabard&lt;/a&gt; include: &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watch%20Commander%20Zalaphil\"&gt;Watch Commander Zalaphil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marine\"&gt;Kul Tiras Marine&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Sailor\"&gt;Kul Tiras Sailor&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Shipwrecked%20Captive\"&gt;Shipwrecked Captive&lt;/a&gt;s. Except the last that were added in \"Legion\", these are tagged with the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Stormwind faction&lt;/a&gt;, but its story affiliation is unclear although it may be for gameplay purposes.\nThe Kul Tiran military prides itself on mastery of both sea, through a vast navy, and land, with armed cavalry.\nSoldiers of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; have a badge for identifying individuals under certain circumstances. The badge is a small &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; anchor.\nTerritories.\nTiragarde Keep.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; was the former citadel of Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; during his &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the ruined fort was subsequently held by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Benedict\"&gt;Lieutenant Benedict&lt;/a&gt; who wished to continue Daelin's campaign to vanquish the orcs from Durotar.\nTiragarde Keep and all its inhabitants were drowned by the tidal waves caused by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Palliter\"&gt;Lieutenant Palliter&lt;/a&gt; then occupied the ruins of the keep.\nIts &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Treasure\"&gt;treasures&lt;/a&gt; ended up in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Gail%20Nozzywig\"&gt;Gail Nozzywig&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthwatch Hold.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Proudmoore took over the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Guard\"&gt;Theramore Guard&lt;/a&gt; keep of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and made it his main stronghold. Northwatch was retaken in a bitter battle by forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Champion of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"\" originally said that the battle happened at &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove%23In%20Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nDarkspear Islands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marines\"&gt;Kul Tiras Marines&lt;/a&gt; had a base on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Led by an &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;, they frequently attacked the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the help of Thrall and the Horde to stop the settlement from attacking them. Near the end of the fight, Horde soldiers and Tirasian marines were captured by the &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Minions\"&gt;Underworld Minions&lt;/a&gt; in order to be used as sacrifices to the sea witch &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;. Despite sharing a common foe, the marines continued to attack the Horde. Unlike the Horde members, none appeared to make it out alive - many died in an attempt to break out, and the rest presumably drowned in the destruction of the islands.\n\"Coastal Base\".\nSettlers from Kul Tiras founded this unnamed &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Base\"&gt;coastal base&lt;/a&gt; on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Although defended by veteran soldiers, it fell to a surprise attack from the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; during Admiral Proudmoore's invasion of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nTol Barad.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, what remained of the blackened, derelict battlements in &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; was left to languish until the wizards of Kul Tiras claimed the isle for a new purpose. Towering walls were again stacked high from the war-scarred stones, but in their cleverness, the &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s turned the citadel's defenses inward, designing a mystical prison to hold the most powerful criminals. Serving the Tirasian magi, the &lt;a href=\"Stromic\"&gt;Stromic&lt;/a&gt; population formed the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;: charged with ensuring that the deadly prisoners locked away in the mystic &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt; never again walk free on Azeroth.\nThe prison, and indeed the island in general, became a major site of conflict between the Alliance and the Horde after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrestfall.\n&lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; is an island off Kul Tiras' northeastern coast and was part of the nation's territory. Currently, the island is abandoned.\nPurgation Isle.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt; was a territory of Kul Tiras.\nPresence in World of Warcraft.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nEven before the kingdom's debut in \"\", there were Tirasian settlements scattered across the eastern coast of Kalimdor, most notably at &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. The forces of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; wear the anchor of Kul Tiras on a white field instead of green, reflecting &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;'s semi-autonomy from Kul Tiras under &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s rule. &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marines\"&gt;Kul Tiras Marines&lt;/a&gt; are briefly mentioned in part of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Diplomat%20%2813%29\"&gt;Missing Diplomat&lt;/a&gt; quest chain. &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Wine\"&gt;Kul Tiras Wine&lt;/a&gt; appears in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"In%20Wine%2C%20Truth\"&gt;In Wine, Truth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Fleet\"&gt;Lost Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; is the remnant of the Tirasian fleet destroyed by Horde-controlled red dragons in the Second War.\nCataclysm.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt;, Kul Tiras \"will not be visible at the start of Cataclysm \u2013 something about tectonic plates shifting it out to sea... We may yet get to experience Kul Tiras in later patches\". At Blizzcon 2010, &lt;a href=\"Alex%20Afrasiabi\"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi&lt;/a&gt; responded to a questioner, \"We have to save something for the future patches, not now. We will deal with Kul Tiras in the future.\"\nThe isle of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, however, which used to belong to Kul Tiras, was added in \"\". &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance faction on Tol Barad, were known to wear Kul Tiran tabards in an early beta screenshot of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;, though it was changed. Later released info regarding Baradin's Wardens stated that many of them do indeed hail from Kul Tiras, suggesting the kingdom's continued involvement in Alliance affairs.\nDespite what was said, the idea of including Kul Tiras during \"Cataclysm\" did not come to fruition.\nLegion.\nA &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20Marine%20%28Azsuna%29\"&gt;number of humans&lt;/a&gt; wearing Kul Tiras tabards appear among the &lt;a href=\"Shipwrecked%20Captive\"&gt;shipwrecked captives&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oceanus%20Cove\"&gt;Oceanus Cove&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and other sea-faring species.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; is one of two continents revealed in the \"\" expansion and it is a major questing continent for the Alliance.\nIn Warcraft II.\nWarcraft II: Tides of Darkness.\nLeader: \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNation Color: \"Green\"\nBackground: \"Before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the far ranging merchant ships of Kul Tiras made it the most prosperous nation in the known world. When the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s began to raid the coastal settlements of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Proudmoore took it upon himself to construct an armada of warships. At the behest of his long time friend &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, Proudmoore has pledged the assistance of his merchant-nation to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWarcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.\nThe Alliance claimed victory over the Orcish Horde in the Second War, and the Dark Portal was destroyed. With Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s death at the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Proudmoore pulled his nation from the Alliance, which had descended into chaotic bickering, especially on what should be done to the orcish clans taken prisoner in the war. Proudmoore objected to King Terenas II of Lordaeron's decision to inter the orcs in camps across Stromgarde and Lordaeron, as many other nations did, as they would all have to share the cost of keeping their former enemies alive, including &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief of the Horde. Kul Tiras left the Alliance of Lordaeron sometime afterwards.\nThe island nation enjoyed a fleeting peace. With the reopening of the Dark Portal, Kul Tiras itself was attacked by a renewed Orcish offensive on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, spiritual leader of the orcs on their homeland of Draenor. Its fleet was assaulted both at sea and in port by the Shadowmoon clan, who laid waste at the very least to its harbor, ships and what armies were rallied against them in a pre-emptive strike in order to allow safe passage to Lordaeron. The carnage wrought upon his homeland left an indelible mark on Admiral Proudmoore's conscience. Kul Tiras rejoined the Alliance.\nIn the RPG.\nKul Tiras has always been a merchant nation. Historically, it has retained a powerful navy, and its fleets were invaluable in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, Kul Tiras has lost both Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; although their fates are not known. The only remaining Proudmoore, &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred&lt;/a&gt;, now rules this realm.\nKul Tiras has remained inviolate from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, due mostly to its strategic positioning. An island nation between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Kul Tiras still possesses powerful warships that patrol the waters. Pirates, murlocs, and naga pose a serious threat to the nation.\nThe islands of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; are part of the nation.\nHistory.\nThe nation-island of Kul Tiras was instrumental in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. As one of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s staunchest supporters, Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; constructed a huge armada to battle the approaching &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Alliance fleets triumphed, the Horde ships devastated the fleet and it never recovered.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; erupted, Kul Tiras sent its ships against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; but could do little. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful sorceress and Grand Admiral Daelin's daughter, took half of the remaining fleet alongside refugees from Lordaeron and sailed west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Several months later, Admiral Daelin, seeing that he could not prevent &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s fall and reasoning that his daughter might need help in the western lands, took the remaining ships and sailed to meet her. Neither has returned. &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; now does his best to lead the nation with the few men and fewer allies he has left. With help from his lady friend Captain &lt;a href=\"Mishan%20Waycrest\"&gt;Mishan Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; they do their best to destroy the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and pirates that threaten the coasts and vessels of Kul Tiras.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"Dannol%20Scurvgrin\"&gt;Dannol Scurvgrin&lt;/a&gt;, a truly vile pirate lord, has ties to the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Pirates\"&gt;Bloodsail Pirates&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt; and sees Kul Tiras as his next big prize.\nAt some point the naga attacked the prison located in &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; and even though the wizards fought them off, &lt;a href=\"Zae%27Rathis%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Zae'Rathis the Mad&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous blood elf evoker prisoner, escaped amid the confusion. Zae'Rathis is now at large and Kul Tiras' citizens are afraid. The wizards suspect that the naga attack was intended to free the blood elf and he may have joined them. Together they would make a powerful force so the wizards are in need of someone to track down Zae'Rathis and destroy him.\nPeople and culture.\nKul Tiras' people are wealthy, especially compared to the ravaged northern lands, and proud of their nation. They wear traditional green and fly flags with the Kul Tiras' anchor emblem. Like &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;'s citizens, Kul Tiras' people celebrate &lt;a href=\"Hordefall\"&gt;Hordefall&lt;/a&gt; every year.\nThey hate the Scourge for wiping out the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; continent and also hate naga, murlocs, and pirates for sinking their ships and stealing their resources, as well as the orcs for decimating their fleets in the Second War. They are staunch members of the Alliance and friends of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their resolve and experience, Kul Tiras' citizens possess a deep-seated anxiety. Their eyes dart about. Often looking to the west, where their greatest leaders and many of their warriors vanished, wondering if they will ever see their missing families again. They are glad to have a Proudmoore as their leader, but all know that Tandred is not the man his father was.\nKalimdor.\nForces loyal to &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; continued to man &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Being opposed by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; but still being accepted by the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, these soldiers continued their crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nFilm universe.\nKul Tiras is a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; situated on the island with the same name located north of Dun Morogh. The city of Boralus is also located on the island.\nKul Tiras participated in the council that would eventually lead to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. They had two male and a &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20Delegate\"&gt;female&lt;/a&gt; representatives sitting between the elven and Gilnean ambassadors. The people of Kul Tiras tasted the fury of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, when they burned their ships at the harbor of the port city of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tirin\"&gt;Kul Tirin&lt;/a&gt;, and the representative was not about to let &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt; forget it. He was also wondering where the &lt;a href=\"Medivh%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; was. Ultimately, the representatives were seen in the funeral ceremony for the deceased Llane."}

{"id": "19395", "revid": "51752209", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19395", "title": "Light", "text": "The Light (also known as the Holy Light, Holy Light of Creation and light of Creation) is an endless, shimmering sea of energy situated outside the barriers of reality and one of the two most fundamental forces in the \"Warcraft\" universe along with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, which was born from the absence of the former. The two cannot exist without the other. The Light is the source of all life in the cosmos, but not necessarily \"good\"; it is a primal force with its morality characterized by how it is wielded. The Light cannot fully see destiny, though neither can the Void, for neither are singularly responsible for creation. The Light seeks one path and shuns all others as lies.\nPure Light cannot exist within the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;physical universe&lt;/a&gt; but shades of it manifest as Holy magic (also called Light magic, holy energy, holy arts, and sometimes referred to as divine power or Divine magic). Summoned by emotions, willpower or faith in one's ability to do so, the powers of the Light can be harnessed to heal, cleanse, protect, or harm. Most of its practitioners are called &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, devoted to cleansing the universe of &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt;. Learning to wield this healing force takes years of discipline, as it is necessary to learn to abnegate oneself through meditation, in order to become conduits for the Light.\nIts positive energies, residing in every living being, in every heart and &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;, is everywhere, binding all sentient beings together as one, as it pervades and shines through everything, resonating within all things in the universe. The &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, enigmatic beings composed of shards of fractured Light, may be the purest expression of the Light in the physical universe. They taught the use of the Light to the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and other enlightened races, such as the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, but others have come into the study and practice of Light-based magic of their own accord, such as the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who revere &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; god that gives them their holy powers.\nOrigins and characteristics.\nBefore life began and before even the universe existed, there was only the Light. The Light existed as a boundless sea of living energy, swelling across all of existence, unfettered by time and space. Yet as the ever-shifting sea expanded, pockets of cold nothingness appeared, giving birth to a second, opposite force: the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. The growing tension between the two opposing energies eventually ignited a series of cosmic explosions that gave birth to the physical universe, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. The cataclysmic birth of the cosmos sent shards of fractured Light flying through the cosmos, suffusing the newly formed planets of the universe with the spark of life and giving birth to countless life forms, the most common of which were the primordial &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. Occasionally, these shards of Light would gather and form clouds of Light from which powerful beings would emerge, among which the benevolent &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. The most unstable energies created by the cosmic explosions coalesced into an astral dimension known as the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Void and the Light, being opposite counterparts, have been locked in perpetual conflict since before &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; itself began, waging their massive battle across countless worlds and planets and affecting millions of lives, with the Light regarding the Void as \"horrors to be resisted\", while some of the Void's servants apparently regard the naaru as \"beloved brethren that lost the true path\" which will eventually return to their embrace. The forces of the Light have also been locked in a cosmic power struggle with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, with the &lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt; described as the Light's largest remaining refuge, and the only one capable of waging war against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Sargeras allegedly believed he had already defeated the Light, instead focusing his efforts on the Void, although it was ironically the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; which ultimately helped end his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the time, the Light manifests itself as a golden, shining light, though it has also appeared as a glowing white, silver light, especially when coming from &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt;. Not all wielders of the Light follow the same path. For example, humans and dwarves follow the path and faith of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, while the tauren &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; revere &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, whose power can appear either as red flames or as golden magic similar to other divine magic. Among the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; embraced the renewed &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and through it they ask for the Light's blessing to wield their holy powers. It is a harmonious relationship, no longer one of discord caused by the blood elves' attempts to bend the Light to their will by draining the energy of the naaru &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, which will likely have a positive effect on blood elf society in the long run. In the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelates&lt;/a&gt; once received their holy powers from the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; of Kings &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, but since his death, it is their faith in his ideals that give them their powers, in order to stand as a beacon of light against the darkness.\nMoonlight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; is a type of holy magic that can be used by the followers of the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, notably the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; (who revere her as Mu'sha in their &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; are dedicated to the worship of the mother moon, and can be found throughout the world, ready to heal the war-weary &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with her light.\nDuring a visit to Darnassus, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; explained that the kaldorei's description of Elune, as well as the demonstrated powers of the goddess, matched his experiences with powerful naaru. However, while Tyrande thanked him for his opinion, she cordially requested that he refrain from making such outlandish claims when in Darnassus or in the presence of Elune's priesthood.\nSapiency.\nThe Light is a fundamental force, but it has been personified many times by its followers and others, &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;believing&lt;/a&gt; that it had a \"will\", or that it made deliberate choices, or that it was \"good\", while the Void was \"evil\", but such concepts do not apply to the Light and the Void, they are simply primal forces with their morality characterized by how they are wielded.\nRaces of the Light.\nThough rarely seen, the creatures of the Light have been observed to be naturally orderly. They are a necessary part of the universe, much like their counterparts of the Void. And as the Light must keep the Void in check, it would follow that they must also be kept in check by the Void for there to be balance.\nSimilar to other cosmic forces, beings of the Light can normally only be permanently killed in the realm of Light. If killed in the mortal realm, their essence returns to the Light to reconstitute, though some exceptionally powerful forces can intervene in the process.\nNaaru.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; are a race of living, sentient energy beings made up of scintillating holy energies from clouds of fractured Light gathered. Though born in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, not within the Light, they are its purest known expression, and have vowed to bring peace and hope to all mortal civilizations and waylay the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to travel through dimensions, and are the sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. However, the naaru themselves have different objectives; for example, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; sought Illidan's death, while &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; apparently wanted to forge him into a Lightforged soldier capable of destroying the Legion and the Void. Some of them, such as Xe'ra and the have even displayed blatant disregard for mortal creatures' free will, and despite likely doing what they believe is correct, have demonstrated borderline fanaticism, apparently believing the ends justify the means.\nIt is exceedingly rare for a naaru to fall into a void state, and even rarer for a fallen naaru to be brought back into the Light. A naaru's fall into the void represents a catastrophic loss for the naaru and for the forces of the Light, and it is the saddest, most heart-wrenching event for the naaru to witness. Conversely, a naaru being reborn into the Light brings renewed hope and sense of purpose to every naaru.\nLightspawn.\nEncountered only recently, &lt;a href=\"Lightspawn\"&gt;Lightspawn&lt;/a&gt; appears to be the Light's counterpart to &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s, and can always be found amongst the battlefields of the Light. At least one was seen to have acted on its own to attempt to stop a &lt;a href=\"necromantic\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; ritual on &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, but it was captured instead, until he was freed by an adventurer and left Azeroth. A handful of others can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the order hall of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, at the service of the naaru &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them are also at the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, at the site of the Light's assault upon the realm in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nEffects.\nOn living beings.\nThe Light is often said to bring about feelings of positive emotion\u2014hope, courage, comfort\u2014coming from the \"heart\", and brings a sense of peace and calmness whenever its blessings are placed on someone. The Light can cure sickness, remove aches, pains, and stiffness. It can also mend broken bones. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; believes that restoring an old man's youth is not beyond the Light's power, but it is not in the healer's hands.\nDuring the ritual that empowers the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the Light shines down on them and through them with blinding radiance. It warms at first, then sears. The person feels scoured; emptied, scrubbed clean, then filled again. The Light swells inside and then fades away to a tolerable level. When &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;excommunicated&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, he was stripped of his light-given powers but not his connection with the Light.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; used the Light to shield himself from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, he described holy magic as similar to shamanic magic, but different, as it wraps around him like \"a warm blanket\".\nRecent events have shown the Light can be just as dangerous as the Void to those who delve too deeply into it. Due to the Light's tendency towards only one path, it can lead the overly devout to closed-mindedness, adamantly refusing to acknowledge any other power or lifestyle other than the Light, such as the fanatical &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, the Light did not forsake the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;. It is in fact the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies that infused them, and degraded their bodies, that caused a break in their ability to be heard and to hear the Light.\nOn undead.\nThe Light is agonizingly painful and destructive to the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be used to heal undead, and while this is an efficient process, it is also very painful.\nThe souls of the undead (&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, etc.) are imperfectly attached to their bodies; the dark magic that sustains them is a buffer that prevents their souls from properly joining with their bodies. This is why undead feel only faint sensations of pain or discomfort from most physical stimuli, and why the Light is so painful to their existence. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; for example used the Light for interrogating the death knight &lt;a href=\"Gaz%20Soulripper\"&gt;Gaz Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;, causing him excruciating pain.\nWhen undead channel the Light, they do not disintegrate or explode from channeling the Light, though they may wish they would. Instead, it feels to them as if their entire bodies are being consumed in righteous fire. Forsaken healed by the Light (whether the healer is Forsaken or not) are effectively cauterized by the effect: the wound is healed, but the healing effect is cripplingly painful. Thus, Forsaken priests are beings of unwavering willpower. Forsaken and death knight tanks suffer nobly when they have priest or paladin healers in the group, and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Zeliek\"&gt;Sir Zeliek&lt;/a&gt; really hates himself.\nThere are reports that some Forsaken have slowly experienced a sharpening of their dulled senses of touch, smell, etc., as well as an increase in the flashes of positive emotions that have otherwise become so rare since their fall into undeath. Unfortunately, this may be the cause of the Forsaken priesthood's increased attempts at self-destruction; regaining these senses would force the priests to smell their own rotting flesh, taste the decay in their mouths and throats, and even feel the maggots burrowing within their bodies.\nDespite all this, there exists at least one account of someone becoming undead through the power of the Light: &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nOthers.\nThe Light is seen in the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt; in Revendreth, where their army retaliated against &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; long ago for unknown experiments. They entered from &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt;, among them the naaru &lt;a href=\"Z%27rali\"&gt;Z'rali&lt;/a&gt;. The presence of the Light in Revendreth cause &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; to turn into &lt;a href=\"ash%20ghoul\"&gt;ash ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, and until the successful rebellion by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;, this was used as punishment for any venthyr who went against Denathrius.\nThe Light can notably deal damage to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, and in the case of &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, can even alter them by infuse them with holy magic.\nUses.\nThe powers of the Light allow its practitioners to heal wounds, mend broken bones, dispel mind control, and even &lt;a href=\"Resurrect\"&gt;restore life to the dead&lt;/a&gt;. Priest can smite their enemies, shield from damage, &lt;a href=\"%3Alevitate\"&gt;:levitate&lt;/a&gt; themselves off the ground, cure ills and magical curses, and remove beneficial magical effects from their enemies. Paladins can augment their own martial prowess and those of their allies with their &lt;a href=\"blessing\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20auras\"&gt;auras&lt;/a&gt;, but also stun, debilitate, and silence their foes. They can use holy magic to shield themselves mentally from the whispers of the Old Gods and their minions, although it takes energy and practice, especially through meditation. They can also help someone resist the whispers by channeling their holy powers through them, in order to calm and protect their spirit.\n&lt;a href=\"Power%20Word\"&gt;Power Word&lt;/a&gt;s are holy spells used by priests to protect and strengthen allies, they have to say their names aloud to use them. Specific &lt;a href=\"reagent\"&gt;reagent&lt;/a&gt;s may be used or needed by priest and paladins to cast certain holy spells.\nThe Light is used to empower its practitioners. If they succeed in the trial of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Aeons\"&gt;Forge of Aeons&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; are empowered to become &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt;, immortal protectors of the creation. After their training, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; are empowered by clerics and paladins during their ceremony of induction, immunizing them to disease of any kind. Before the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s rebirth, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; empowered themselves by sapping the energy from the captive &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Battle for Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, they embraced the Light through the Sunwell in a healthier way. Following a sacred ritual of the Light, a &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger\"&gt;Deathcharger&lt;/a&gt; can be redeemed as a &lt;a href=\"Charger\"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt; and serves as a steed for paladins.\nThrough the Light, its practitioners can feel a connection that is sometimes established between them, allowing them to know if they are still alive, to communicate words and thoughts, or to have visions concerning them through their dreams. It was the case between &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt;, between Zabra Hexx and Alexandros Mograine after the latter saved his life, and also between &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her son &lt;a href=\"Arator\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt;. They can also use holy magic to practice divination, through an incantation described by books of priestly magic as a \"holy vision\" that can grant sight of distant objects and far-off locations. A paladin can also develop an empathic ability to sense deep emotions from others, such as sincerity, or the nature of their intentions.\nThe Light can be used for interrogation purposes. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; marked the forehead of an orc prisoner with the Light, leaving a burn on his flesh, and forcing him to say everything he knew without being able to lie. &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; used the Light on the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zabra%20Hexx\"&gt;Zabra Hexx&lt;/a&gt; to know if he was lying. &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; used the Light on a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to force him to tell the truth and answer all his questions. The Light can also be manifested in the form of chains and handcuffs to hinder living and undead. When a nathrezim tried to assassinate him, Anduin used the Light in the form of a web to capture the demon. During their hunt for &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon restrained prisoners with the Light while Alleria used the Void to invade their minds for information. The Light is employed during an exorcism rite to extract a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; or an evil spirit from a possessed body, purifying the body and the soul from corruption.\nThe holy magic is employed in the creation of &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt;, paladin symbols, artifacts, &lt;a href=\"Rune%20magic\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"lightwell\"&gt;lightwell&lt;/a&gt;s, but also to infuse weapons, armors, and &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s with the power of the Light. Holy energy can be focused into the shape of a weapon and used to attack an enemy. The &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s' weapons appear to be kept razor sharp by the holy power contained within it. Prayer beads are crucial to many holy rites, including the rite of exorcism. Anduin enchanted his &lt;a href=\"Varian%27s%20compass\"&gt;father's compass&lt;/a&gt;, imbuing it with a memory of a conversation between him and Sylvanas.\nThe Light is also a source of technological development. On the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; , the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; used the Light's power to create lasers and &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20guardian\"&gt;Apexis guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. The Army of Light uses and develops advanced Light-based technology, including teleportation pylons, &lt;a href=\"warframe\"&gt;warframe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"artillery%20battery\"&gt;artillery battery&lt;/a&gt;, and holograms that Turalyon used to place a message inside the &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Following the retaking of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, some gnomes were interested in the powers of the Light to save and purify irradiated gnomes. Their research led them to radical advances in Light-based technology. With &lt;a href=\"arkonite\"&gt;arkonite&lt;/a&gt; and Light magic, the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuronar\"&gt;Zuronar&lt;/a&gt; created a \"flashbang\" for his work.\nThe Light can be used to put the deceased to rest. The naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Crusader Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt; to the Light itself, bounding his soul to the realm of Light away from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; blessed the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, his features were described as \"relaxed slightly, growing calm, even quietly content\". The &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; draenei, or \"death priests\", and the tauren &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt; can also use the Light to contact the dead to ask for help, to question them, or to help them rest in peace.\nThe Light magnified Turalyon's voice so it carried to several hundred soldiers under his command, and made &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s hammer seem to weigh less in his hands.\nPractitioners.\nThe Light is an important part of several races' cultures on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;s across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Though overlap exists in themes and practices, several of the races have differing viewpoints and methods of wielding the Light. One thing is certain, wielding the Light takes intense focus and a very powerful belief. Chapels, &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es, cathedrals and &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s are places of &lt;a href=\"Religion\"&gt;worship&lt;/a&gt; where the devoted followers of the Holy Light can practice their faith and perform spiritual rituals.\nPriests.\nAfter spending much of their lives in temples studying ancient doctrine, preaching the tenets of their faith, and pledging their full devotion to the divine powers they follow, the &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Holy\"&gt;most adept priests&lt;/a&gt; leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock. There, they use their holy powers to bless allies and mend wounds. And while most stay behind the frontlines to aid their comrades, these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice. They\u2019re also morally opposed to the use of Shadow and Void magic\u2014rather, they are exemplars of the incredible grace and power of the divine and the Light, and even death cannot fully stop their healing capabilities. However, &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Discipline\"&gt;some priests&lt;/a&gt; pride themselves on pragmatism. They understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one\u2019s ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While these priests possess many holy virtues to aid their allies, they also dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies\u2014always exercising immense discipline to keep themselves away from the brink of insanity.\nPaladins.\nLike priests who serve the Light, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s are devout in their faith. To serve as instrument of the Light is to hold an unshakable faith. After spending much of their lives in hallowed halls studying divine doctrine, those who pledge themselves to a holy order become beacons of the Light for their allies in conflict, taking up the heavy armor and weaponry of justice. Stalwart and steadfast, these protectors are ardent defenders of the Light and all that it touches, and are rejuvenated by its radiance in return. So dedicated they are to their cause that they consecrate the very ground upon which they battle corruption. Holding the unwavering belief that any battle waged to eradicate evil in the world is righteous, these paladins stands on the frontlines in service to all others dedicated to the cause. The truth and virtue of the Light imbues these sacred knights with the power to revitalize their comrades. If necessary, they even lay down their own lives to serve as a martyr for the greater good. Oftentimes the most dedicated paladins become fanatical in their devotion, instruments of retribution against those who dare defy the laws of the divine. These vengeful guardians of the weak are crusaders judging and punishing the wicked. Their resolute conviction in the divine order of all things assures them that victory is inevitable\u2014but they will fight to the end to ensure that the Light prevails.\nArakkoa.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Skettis%20Outcasts\"&gt;Skettis Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; who shunned the teachings of the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and embraced the Light taught by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Kirrik%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Kirrik the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; and those like him found a great devotion in the Light, they left &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; and found refuge within &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these arakkoa are affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; worship &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and the sun, similar in ways to how the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; worship &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the tauren, the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; are fanatically devoted to showing how the sun and the Light favor them over all other races and are genocidal supremacists. The &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; are incapable of using the light due to the corruption in their bodies, similar to how draenei cannot wield the Light when they become &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenei.\nThe &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were introduced to the Light by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; while sailing across the cosmos aboard &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;. Fleeing from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; that consumed their original home, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the enigmatic holy beings taught them the ways of the Light, though they already had a certain experience with it through &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"T%27uure\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion, and that one day the naaru would forge them into a single unstoppable &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, a grand Light-based coalition of all manner of races and one of Prophet Velen's ultimate goals. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals.\nThe naaru then blessed the draenei with Light-given knowledge and power, bestowing a blessing named the &lt;a href=\"%3AGift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;:Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; upon them to signify their new connection to the Light. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;'s sigil being visible at all times. And to this day, the power of the Light is embedded in the draenei so deeply that all of them can call upon their gift, using its power to heal themselves and others.\nUnlike the humans and dwarves, whose knowledge of the Light is related to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, and the blood elves, who channel their powers through the Sunwell, the draenei have a more direct link to it through their relationship with the naaru. They serve the \"Holy Light of Creation\" as &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Anchorite\"&gt;Anchorite&lt;/a&gt;s, the most common profession choices for the draenei. The draenei prophet, Velen, is also a staunch practitioner of the Light, and the high vindicator has a seat as an &lt;a href=\"Exarch\"&gt;Exarch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; for example, infuse their bodies with the very essence of the Holy Light.\nThe draenei society has explicit priesthood such as the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order of draenei priests and priestesses once led by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, calling themselves the \"keepers of the Light\" and in charge with the safeguarding of the draenei holy sites and altars. The &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt; is also present in their society, as an organization of draenei &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s that serve as the primary military and police force of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\". The &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; are an elite order of draenei &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s commanded by &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable draenei Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Ishanah\"&gt;High Priestess Ishanah&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwarves.\nAmong the races of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and humans seem to have the most in common in their worship of the Light, with few (if any) notable differences in their approach, by the fact that humans are the ones who introduced the dwarves to the Holy Light. While some Ironforge dwarves worship the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, many follow the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, while dwarves paladins are also inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and can also be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust like the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, a number of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have adopted the values \u200b\u200band philosophy of the Holy Light. Their Queen, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, joined the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Betild%20Deepanvil\"&gt;Betild Deepanvil&lt;/a&gt; and other Dark Iron priests. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, many Dark Iron dwarves were present in the ranks of the Church of the Holy Light as priests, and the ranks of the Silver Hand.\nNotable dwarven Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valgar%20Highforge\"&gt;Valgar Highforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frida%20Ironbellows\"&gt;Frida Ironbellows&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnomes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s have had an interest in the Light since they joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but they were so focused on technology and, later, the retaking of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; that studying the Light didn't feel necessary to them; the dwarven priests and paladins of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; served as the only connection to the Light they needed.\nNow that the gnomes have reclaimed a foothold in Gnomeregan and begun rebuilding their culture outside of Ironforge, however, they've recognized the importance of having followers of the Light in their own ranks. In addition, researching new methods of purifying irradiated gnomes has led to radical advances in Light-based technology.\nNotable gnome Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"%22Doc%22%20Cogspin\"&gt;\"Doc\" Cogspin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Cleric%20Alphus\"&gt;High Cleric Alphus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh/Blood elves.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, despite their race's general seclusion in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; were priests in the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, and some were even part of the original &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. The high elves also had their own priesthood chapters, though these were less prominent than their &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magic-users&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;Vandellor&lt;/a&gt; was known as the &lt;a href=\"High%20priest\"&gt;High priest&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas.\nMany of the Light-wielding elves suffered a mass loss of faith during and after the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, in which 90% of their people were slaughtered and their kingdom was sacked. Renaming themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, many of them swore off the Light, condemning it as a fickle thing that had faltered in the defense of their people during the undead onslaught.\nSome high elven priests and paladins survived the Scourging of Quel'Thalas, or were not present during its destruction, and endure in the Alliance.\nWhen Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his blood elves conquered &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered a lone &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; who had stayed behind to maintain the keep's defenses. With some difficulty, Kael'thas subdued the &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; and sent it to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; so that the magic-addicted blood elves could feed upon it. After long months of study and experimentation, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Magister Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow wizards learned how to manipulate and corrupt the naaru's luminous energies. In the end, the sorcerers devised a process by which the powers of the Light could be transferred to recipients who had not earned such abilities. Instead of feeding upon the naaru's magic, the blood elves would wield the naaru's Light-given powers themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, formerly a priestess who also renounced her vows, volunteered to be the first to bend the powers stolen from M'uru to her will. With her decision, a new order was born: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the Blood Knights were once part of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 proud defenders of high elven society, and saw their appropriation of the captive naaru's powers as well-deserved justice.\nEventually, M'uru was abducted and defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and his heart was used by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; to purify and restore the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; as a fount of both holy and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. The Blood Knights embraced the renewed Sunwell, and through it they ask for the Light's blessing to wield their holy powers. It is a harmonious relationship, no longer one of discord caused by attempting to bend the Light to their will. Although possible to \"steal\" the Light from the Sunwell in the same way they did from M'uru, Lady Liadrin has moved the blood knights away from that type of abuse.\nNotable Thalassian Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Lord Solanar Bloodwrath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHumans.\nIn the early days of humanity and its civilization, many tribes of humans had primitive belief systems that incorporated simple nature magic. However, the rise of organized religion such as the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and the potent arcane magics introduced by the high elves quickly supplanted such traditions. Since this time, the Holy Light is a central part of civilized &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; society. It is the primary human &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; and a staple of worship, respect, and honor in the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, human paladins are members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to do justice across Azeroth, while other humans join the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. The humans were the first race on Azeroth to utilize the Light in an offensive manner through the creation of paladins, employing them against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces and then the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. These paladins must abide by a strict code of moral conduct and face the gradual loss of their powers should they knowingly commit acts of evil.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; is located in the center of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; and is where the Gilnean priests of the clergy are present and officiate. However, due to its relative isolation, the countryside of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; has retained a degree of their ancient culture in the contemporary era, the religious leaders of what was in Gilneas referred to as the \"old ways\" eventually became \"harvest-witches\"; those who used their nature powers to augment Gilneas' agricultural output during and following its period of industrialization.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Admirality of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; also worship the Light. During the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the Kul Tiras navy deployed Light-wielding &lt;a href=\"Chaplain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;chaplains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Chaplain\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of a &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Chaplains\"&gt;superior officer&lt;/a&gt;. At least &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Erik\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20Loriette\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; also wield the Light, and some Kul Tirans can be found among the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; that defend Drustvar during the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nHumans also founded the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, a branch of errant paladins and priests (among others) driven zealous in their war against the undead. Unlike the Silver Hand's emphasis on retribution through clarity and righteousness over vengeance, the Crusade is vicious, brutal, and indiscriminate in its cause: if one does not stand with the Scarlet Crusade, one is seen as a heretic. In spite of their attitude, the Scarlet Crusade genuinely believes that they are doing righteous work, and thus have not lost their connection to the Light.\nNotable human Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable worgen Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Almyra\"&gt;Sister Almyra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Elsington\"&gt;Sister Elsington&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt; priests follow the &lt;a href=\"Lok%27osh\"&gt;Lok'osh&lt;/a&gt;, a path of healing and renewal introduced by &lt;a href=\"Lok%27osh%20Nakha\"&gt;Lok'osh Nakha&lt;/a&gt;.\nTauren.\nDuring a series of theological discussions, &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; talked about the importance of balancing out the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; focus on moon-worship through reverence of light as part of their worship of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they rediscovered the use of the Light through the power of &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun god in &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;. Among the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, the paladins known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; are warriors who wield the power of An'she, while the priests known as the &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt; revere \"the wisdom of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earthmother&lt;/a&gt; as illuminated by the Light\".\nIn their faith, the Light is associated to An'she, which gives them their powers. It is important to note that they don't use &lt;a href=\"solar%20magic\"&gt;solar magic&lt;/a&gt;, since it is associated to &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic rather than holy magic. When they refer to the Light, they use the terms \"An'she's light\", \"the light of the Sun\", and \"Sun's light\".\nNotable tauren Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Shinetotem\"&gt;Seer Shinetotem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt;.\nZandalari trolls.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20prelates\"&gt;Zandalari prelates&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s paladins, also known as &lt;a href=\"prelate\"&gt;prelate&lt;/a&gt;s, who served the Loa of Kings &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;. They are the highest order of holy warriors to serve any loa, taking only those gifted from birth with prowess in battle and gifted by the loa, and crafting champions of light to defend their empire. After Rezan's death, the prelates were cut off from his power except for a handful of his followers.\nHowever, even with the Loa of Kings gone, his ideals remained. The prelates chose to lead those who are lost, and through their faith for the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, to stand as a beacon of light against the darkness. They are now dedicated to the service of &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded the late &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, and was of great help to the holy warriors, reminding them of who they are and what they stand for.\nNotable Zandalari Light-wielders include &lt;a href=\"High%20Prelate%20Rata\"&gt;High Prelate Rata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ra%27wani%20Kanae\"&gt;Ra'wani Kanae&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganizations and worships.\nArmy of the Light.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Grand Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; is an army of enlightened races that the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; said would one day combat the ravages of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After the fall of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s finest warriors followed the prime naaru &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; across the cosmos in an eternal war to bring about the Legion's end.\nThe draenei most committed to their long crusade would undergo a ritual to become Lightforged, infusing their bodies with the very essence of the Holy Light. For untold millennia, these immortal crusaders waged war against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. After finally achieving victory on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; have undertaken a new mission: protecting &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from rising threats, and helping their kin from the Alliance push back against &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; aggression.\nLightbound.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; are an army from led by &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;High Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt; in service of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. Compelled by the , so that one day they would march across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and bring order to countless troubled worlds, they waged war against the unified &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clan\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; known as the for the safety of Draenor, and to convert them into servitors of the Light. They seem to be analogous, or related, to the main universe's Army of the Light, and the &lt;a href=\"Sermon%20of%20the%20High%20Exarch\"&gt;High Exarch's sermon&lt;/a&gt; also mentions the \"Army of the Light\" by name.\nLight-Bearers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Light-Bearers\"&gt;Light-Bearers&lt;/a&gt; were an order of beings from the &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fanlin%27Deskor\"&gt;Fanlin'Deskor&lt;/a&gt;. They were practitioners of the Light like the paladins of Azeroth, and were dedicated to service and duty.\nChurch of the Holy Light.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; is the religious institution at the head of the predominant &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;, the worship of the Holy Light. Its clergy is renowned for spreading goodness, as its priests heal and restore in times of peace, protect in times of war, and are guiding the spiritual destiny of their people. They are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"Clerics%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Clerics of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; once claimed their mission was to achieve \"everlasting peace\". They believe that the Light shines on each and every being of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnights of the Silver Hand.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; are the martial branch of the Church of the Holy Light and seek to be an example of the Light's teachings as well as enforce its laws. Powerful holy &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s, these crusaders are called to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. As the general ideology of the Light is to strive to be good in all actions, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s respect its teachings depicted in the &lt;a href=\"%3ATome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;:Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Valor%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tome of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood Knights.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; are an order of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; formed in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them were once members of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;, proud defenders of high elven society, and priests of the Church of the Light. After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the destruction of Quel'Thalas led a great number of elves to lose their faith, believing that the Light had failed them. For a time, they sapped holy energy from the captive &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s rebirth, the Blood Knights have chosen to embrace it and to forge for themselves a new identity as they lead their people into a more promising future.\nDraenei's institutions.\nAs the draenei were introduced to the Light by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; while sailing across the cosmos aboard &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, their society is centered around the \"Holy Light of Creation\".\nBlessed by the naaru with Light-given knowledge and power, one of them being the &lt;a href=\"%3AGift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;:Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; to signify their new connection the Light, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals. As a result, the draenei have their own religious institutions, their own holy places of worship, and explicit priesthoods such as the &lt;a href=\"Omenai\"&gt;Omenai&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient order of draenei priests and priestesses once led by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, calling themselves the \"keepers of the Light\" and in charge with the safeguarding of the draenei holy sites and altars. Thus, the draenei serve the Light as &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Anchorite\"&gt;Anchorite&lt;/a&gt;s, the most common profession choices for the pious draenei.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; are an elite order of draenei paladins serving as personal agents to the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; in his quest to preserve the Light.\nHand of Argus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Hand of Argus&lt;/a&gt; is an organization of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;vindicators&lt;/a&gt; that serve as the primary military and police force of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" draenei. Even if their numbers have yet to fully recover from the &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;slaughter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of bloodlusted orcs, they are considered elite among the draenei, and were once dedicated themselves to protect their people from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; hunters.\nSunwalkers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; are an &lt;a href=\"Horde%20organizations\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, founded by &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; after theological discussions with &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt; about the importance of balancing out the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; focus on moon-worship through reverence of light as part of their worship of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they are warriors who wield the power of &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt;, the sun in &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;, as they did in the past. Although not as numerous as some of the more ancient paladin orders, the Sunwalkers' ways are no less powerful and their members are no less respected.\nSeers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Seers\"&gt;Seers&lt;/a&gt; are an order of tauren &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who revere \"the wisdom of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earthmother&lt;/a&gt; as illuminated by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;\", and exist under the leadership of the Sunwalkers. As such, they rediscovered the use of the Light. The way of the priest is a new one for the tauren, but it draws on the ancient traditions of their &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s, and they are not forging a new path so much as rediscovering old ways that we had forgotten.\nIn the RPG.\nFollowers of the Holy Light do not worship any gods or beings, the power comes from some benevolent force, known simply as the \"Light\".\nDifferent cultures and organizations' reverence for the Light is collectively called the Faith of the Holy Light. Most &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; follow the path of the Holy Light. It is a faith that advocates purity, goodness, kindness, and compassion in the face of adversity. Those who belong to this faith are among the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest foes. Some organizations are &lt;a href=\"heretics%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;heretics of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 while they still follow the holy light, they have altered aspects of the philosophy.\nDomains: Healing, Protection, War. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the Holy Light who serve the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; can gain access to the Crusader, Healing, and War domains (but not Protection).\nChurch of the Holy Light.\nNo one knows how the Church was founded, and no one remembers when people first discovered the Holy Light - or were discovered by it. In a time prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, humans began preaching about the Holy Light; explaining that it is a great and benevolent force that sought out mortal spirits interested in helping others and protecting life. Because the philosophy involves a significant amount of study and contemplation, they likely built libraries before churches. As the organization grew, the places of teaching and study grew as well. Eventually, all of the individual churches began working together and formed the Church of the Holy Light.\nThe Church sends its people all over the world, spreading the wisdom and comfort of the Holy Light. They also do what they can to help people with more practical matters, from building homes to settling family disputes to scaring off enemies. It is all very noble, of course, but that fits with the Holy Light's teachings of making the world a better place and making oneself better by helping other people. The Church has everyone's best interests at heart, and the priest, paladins, and lay members do their best to help everyone. It is a &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; that is all about making people truly happy, not to mention a religion whose practitioners show clear evidence of divine blessing.\nFor a long time, the Church was the dominant human religion. The followers of the Holy Light were everywhere, supporting civilizations, building cities, founding temples, and generally bringing light and hope and help to everyone. Then the First War began. And there were the members of the Church, right in the thick of things, using their Light-given gifts to hold back the Horde. It was impressive \u2014 awe-inspiring, really. Unfortunately (say some), most of the priests focused on defending people rather than taking the fight to the Horde. And there just weren\u2019t enough priests to go around. The leader of the Holy Order of Northshire Clerics during the war was Archbishop Alonsus Faol, and his apprentice was a devout lad named Uther. After the First War, Uther knew that the Church needed to do more when the orcs came again \u2014 its people needed to stand up and fight instead of just healing and defending. They needed to go after the darkness and actively prevent it from harming anyone, rather than waiting for it to come to them. He issued a call to all the bravest knights to join his new order, the Knights of the Silver Hand, and thus the paladins were born. They saw their first battles in the Second War and were instrumental in the Alliance\u2019s victory."}

With many of the Legion's portals and lieutenants neutralized, Velen gave the order for the Light's Chosen to advance a purge any remaining demons from the city.

Located on the slopes of a mountainous area east of the region, it serves as a quest hub for both &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes. Originally a mere chapel, it expanded into a full-fledged fortified outpost after the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnderneath the &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;a catacomb&lt;/a&gt; which houses the remains of the heroes of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the remains were exhumed from around Lordaeron and moved to the chapel so they could not be resurrected in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s reign of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, many humans expanded the nation settling in the &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;northern lands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, formerly ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. These humans populated the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt; some 2,700 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and founded new Arathi settlements.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, with its origins tracing back to the chaos of the Troll Wars, was founded some centuries later in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It became a predominant human religion and the church constructed temples and shrines throughout the human lands. Light's Hope Chapel was among the oldest and most revered of these holy sites and places of worship, located in the verdant Eastweald.\nThird War.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;'s rampage through &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; and a few others were chosen for the secret task of unearthing the bodies of a thousand fallen heroes of the Light and bringing them to Light's Hope Chapel. It is there they were interred once more in sacred ground. This was done to protect the honored dead from being raised as nothing more than cogs in the Lich King's undead army. One of them was &lt;a href=\"Killoren\"&gt;Killoren&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s death, some paladins separated themselves from what would become the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and formed the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. After leaving &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, they went deep into the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and made the Light's Hope Chapel their main base. As a new faction they allowed all races to join, even members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. From there they would fight the undead their own way, even sending most recruits to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt; was their first leader, but when he died &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; took his place.\nAshbringer.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, the lich &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; led a Scourge assault against Light's Hope Chapel, where the Argent Dawn was greatly outnumbered. The Battle for Light's Hope Chapel was a desperate last stand, because if the Argent Dawn failed, the Scourge would claim the consecrated ground and all the righteous souls who had been laid to rest there. At some point during the battle, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; arrived and joined the Argent Dawn's forces, but the tide of battle soon turned against the chapel's defenders, until &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; ran the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; through his own chest as a final act of faith and love to free his father's soul. Alongside Alexandros Mograine, the spirits of the thousand heroes interred below the chapel also awakened and brought forth a reckoning against the Scourge then, decimating the undead with their vengeful fury.\nUnfortunately, while Light's Hope Chapel was saved, many had fallen and some were recovered by the Scourge. Among them, the corpse of Darion Mograine and the Ashbringer fell into the hands of Kel'Thuzad, who made him the Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears later, Light's Hope Chapel still served as headquarters for the Argent Dawn in the Plaguelands. The &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20the%20Sanguine\"&gt;Siege of the Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; was an attack on Light's Hope Chapel by a large army of undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kirkessen%20the%20Zealous\"&gt;Kirkessen the Zealous&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, the attack was quickly repelled and Kirkessen suffered an incurable wound from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; that made Kirkessen unable to serve the Scourge in corporeal form.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and some of his reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; joined the chapel.\nEven though they officially detached themselves from the Scarlet Crusade, the Argent Dawn still allowed negotiations. They used the chapel as their meeting point with the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the Scarlet Crusade during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt; heralded by &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nYears after &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and entered deep slumber, he awoke and rallied his troops to prepare them for a campaign in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, in order to raise powerful soldiers for the Scourge from underneath Light's Hope Chapel.\nWhen the Lich King arrived with the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; , he started a bloody war again the Scarlet Crusade. The Scarlet fell and their death fueled the Scourge war machine for their main objective. Therefore, Light's Hope Chapel was the last bastion of justice in the region, and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Second Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; began.\nWith a superior army, the Scourge the chapel and its defenders. When the Argent Dawn had lost a third of their forces, Tirion Fordring and his paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; emerged to defend Light's Hope Chapel, killing all the undead in the area while the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt; knew defeat. At that moment, the Lich King appeared and revealed that the main reason for the attack was to make Tirion come out of hiding, regardless of how many Scourge forces and death knights would perish. In an act of rebellion, Darion Mograine resisted the Lich King's control just enough to give Tirion the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, who used it to injure the Lich King, forcing him to flee.\nFollowing their victory, Tirion Fordring merged the Argent Dawn the remaining Knights of the Silver Hand in Lordaeron to create the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, in order to bring war to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the Lich King. At the same time, most of the death knights on the field that day had been liberated from Arthas' control, Darion rallied them as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and also declared war on the Scourge.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the death of the Lich King, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; began to rebuild and fortify the area, turning it into a beacon of light in the otherwise eternal gloom of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, they also constructed a statue dedicated to their Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade continued to recruit heavily to their cause, as prospective members must complete a trial in the chapel's cemetery to join their ranks, which involves defeating the spirit of the former leader of the Argent Dawn, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; beneath Light's Hope Chapel became the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;headquarters&lt;/a&gt; for the restored &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, accessible by a trap door in the floor of the chapel itself.\nThe Silver Hand's ongoing offensive within the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; has drawn the interest of many paladins who wished to fight under the leadership of the new Highlord. The Highlord judged the new &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand%20Recruit\"&gt;recruits&lt;/a&gt; themself and revealed that the chapel grounds were infiltrated by the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Volzarak%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Volzarak the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; who had disguised himself as one of the recruits.\nAt some point during the invasion, the chapel was once again &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. The Deathlord raised undead from Chapel's crypt and sent it to attack Argent sentries while Darion and his three horsemen entered the Chapel, captured Tyrosus, and entered the Sanctum.\nThe priest champions of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; also visited the Chapel in order to get &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;pure Light&lt;/a&gt;. They killed &lt;a href=\"Plaguemonger%20Pustulus\"&gt;Plaguemonger Pustulus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blighthound\"&gt;blighthound&lt;/a&gt;s.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in his reports that Light's Hope Chapel still serves as a beacon for travelers in the region, and that the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; continue to meet in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; beneath the chapel."}

Next to Frostmourne's altar also lied Arthas' former hammer as well as Muradin's weapons, frozen in the snow.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; to collect Light's Vengeance in the cavern, in order to create an artifact to rival Frostmourne, believing that only the hammer of Arthas himself would provide a worthy model for the weapon, that would later become &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; had predicted such a plan and tried to kill the adventurers by sending hordes of &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s into the cavern, but they managed to escape by ironically using the sacred hammer of Arthas."}
