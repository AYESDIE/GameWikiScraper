He's sought revenge against all &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, regardless of their nature. Harkyn Grymstone has three odd companions in his team of fellow bounty hunters, &lt;a href=\"Groth\"&gt;Groth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voll\"&gt;Voll&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Snee\"&gt;Snee&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Sunwell Trilogy.\nAt some point, he and his family were attacked by a &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;. While his family was slain, Harkyn's body was torn to ribbons, left to die, but he survived and swore to hunt any dragons, becoming twisted and bitter.\nHarkyn's grudge against dragons is why he took a particular pleasure in his latest bounty: &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as a human prince, hired Harkyn and his crew to hunt the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; some time after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Drathir also gave Harkyn a magical orb. In the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Harkyn and his group managed to catch Kalecgos in a net, but &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt; found him in his visage form and brought him to safety. When the dragon hunters got to the net, they found it empty, finding a blood trail and using his benefactor's orb, they soon arrived at a small cottage that belonged to Anveena and her family. The dwarf demanded to know where the dragon had gone, but Kalec and Anveena escaped. The bounty hunters noticed they escaped and followed them. Kalecgos transformed into his dragon form and tried to get away, but Harkyn shot and injured him.\nHarkyn and his group then traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; and found Kalecgos once again, but at the same time the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invaded the town as well. Harkyn found out that he was merely being used by Dar'Khan to hunt down Kalecgos. He turned on Dar'Khan and helped defend Tarren Mill. He then apologized and advised Kalec and his group to find his cousin &lt;a href=\"Loggi%20Grymstone\"&gt;Loggi&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nHe can be found with his companions south-west of &lt;a href=\"Uktulut%20Pier\"&gt;Uktulut Pier&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;.

Fearful of what would happen if the mogu stole the mallet after already having stolen back the Divine Bell, the Monkey King split the mallet and scattered the two pieces across Pandaria to keep them from falling into mogu hands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mallet%20Handle\"&gt;Mallet Handle&lt;/a&gt; was purposely \"lost in a bet\" to Chief Ingoo Ingoo of &lt;a href=\"Unga%20Ingoo\"&gt;Unga Ingoo&lt;/a&gt; and was passed down through the generations, but has since been used to do harm. The &lt;a href=\"Mallet%20Head\"&gt;Mallet Head&lt;/a&gt; was given to a Kunzen chief on the &lt;a href=\"Skyrange\"&gt;Skyrange&lt;/a&gt;, but was stolen in recent times by the &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skiggit\"&gt;Skiggit&lt;/a&gt;.

The ointment was made during the time the bell and mallet were both made, and none has been created since. What's left is in the hands of &lt;a href=\"The%20Blade\"&gt;The Blade&lt;/a&gt;, an elite mogu warrior found in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; in the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war on Pandaria, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; restored the Harmonic Mallet and Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; used it to counter the Divine Bell used by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;."}

For those who don't know, there is a back way out of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt; that goes over the mountains and straight into the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; - very useful for this quest.\nThe harpies are found in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. There are several quests in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. You'll have to kill or navigate around monsters in this area and will be able to work on those quests in the process.\nThe Bloodfury Harpies and Ambushers can be found throughout, but especially in the northwest corner of the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;, to the right coming down from the north. The Rougefeather and the Slayers are found in the center and west of the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Both of them have red coloring. The Slayers are melee and there isn't a large population of them. "}

{"id": "15383", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15383", "title": "Harpy", "text": "Harpies are vicious, flying creatures that resemble a cross between a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; female and a hunting bird, with long talons for feet and large graceful wings for arms. Despite the similarity, they have little in common with the elves. Harpies employ &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; like night elves, but they destroy the environments in which they settle, killing every creature they encounter and despoiling the land to build nests noted for their noxious odor. Harpies originally hail from the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but have since spread out across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt; island. The harpies in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; only arrived recently, flying in from Kalimdor when the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; awakened.\nThe cackling bird-women are capable of powerful elemental storm magic. Little is known about the source of their power, as they attack invaders on sight, few can discern any meaning behind their shrill cries, and none can tolerate the smell of their nests. They only get more beautiful as they age.\nBackground.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s research, harpies are descended from &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;. Other legends about harpies claim that they are descended from a group of female night elves who betrayed &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and were cursed as punishment, but those have been dismissed as mere stories and they truly come from Aviana.\nAfter the death of Aviana and the destruction of the Mother Tree &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, many mourned it and some succumbed to the temptation of serving dark forces in Aviana's absence. The remaining branch of the tree was hidden away in order to protect it, for many of Aviana's children had been lost to chaos, and they might be driven to claim the remnant of Aviana's legacy for their new masters. These vile, unscrupulous winged women live only to cause mischief and sorrow. In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", harpies are found in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce content to confine themselves to their ancestral home in the peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the feral and vicious harpies of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; have spread their influence across the length and breadth of the continent. The vicious winged women have taken to raiding unsuspecting caravans and savaging any who cross into their territories. Their nests, littered with the gruesome remains of their victims, are now a common sight from the arid mesas of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, to the lush forests of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, to the icy reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nBroken Isles harpies.\nHarpies that dwell on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; are much larger and more powerful than their cousins in Kalimdor. Long ago the harpies of Highmountain lived with respect for the area and its inhabitants, but quickly gave that up to practice their dark rituals no matter who it harmed. The &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; used to keep the harpies at bay with the &lt;a href=\"%3AHammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;:Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014until it was stolen by the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the harpies have been emboldened. The kobolds of Highmountain offer stolen and scavenged trinkets, oftentimes items that would be broken and worthless to anyone else, to the local harpies, and the harpies provide protection for their offerings of obedience.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; stole the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Idol of Aviana&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Shrine of Aviana&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, cutting &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s off from their &lt;a href=\"%3AFlight%20Form\"&gt;:Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;, and used the idol to corrupt harpies with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. The idol was retrieved by &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;, and cleansed by the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Fel-corrupted &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Felcaster\"&gt;Deadwood Felcaster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Featherblade\"&gt;Deadwood Featherblade&lt;/a&gt;s can be found at &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Landing\"&gt;Deadwood Landing&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, not far from &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s crashed airship. They carry a terrible contagion.\nCulture.\nThe road to becoming a queen of a group of harpies is not a simple or easy one. A harpy must be willing to kill, betray and torment countless enemies and allies alike to attain and maintain the title for herself.\nHarpies seem to take interest in rare gems and ore, and actively trade their ear wax with &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt; to attain them. They love anything shiny.\nIf not driven out, they quickly range out attacking anything and everything they can get. Harpies are clearly very intelligent, since they are able to communicate with other races when they wish to. The common echelons of harpy society attack with crude weapons or simply with their razor-sharp talons.\nThe kiss of a harpy is poisonous. There are ones that have lured the unknowing into kissing them. A known side effect is a very high fever.\nHarpies are said to be allies with &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nVicious and predatory by nature, harpies are the bane of all other life in the areas were they take root. They have been raiding &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; settlements since time out of mind, and it can only be assumed that they are as much a plague on the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s and others. The only race rumored to have any peaceful relationship with the harpies are &lt;a href=\"kobolds\"&gt;kobolds&lt;/a&gt;, who trade them scavenged tools and weapons for information and protection. Harpies are an extremely unclean race. Their nests are obvious by the stench on the wind. They are immune to infection and other diseases that stem from rot or contamination. This immunity does not extend to the toxins of plants, animals, or any magical effects.\nNo males have been reported, so (rumor has it) harpies breed with captive males of many species, though they prefer elves, orcs, and humans to either smaller or larger species. The males of another species fills the role for a time, after which they become food for the nest. In lean times, harpies can lay unfertilized eggs that become female copies of the mother.\nHarpies also live in the canyons of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; and north of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\nThe (Anc. Greek: \u1f05\u03c1\u03c0\u03c5\u03b9\u03b1/harpuia, \"snatcher\") are described as vile birds with the chest and head of women in many sources. They are not prominent figures in Greek mythology; they are a minor part of the high-profile tale of Jason and the Argonauts. They were bird-women who worked for the Olympians, and were assigned to punish the seer-King Phineas for revealing too much of the future. Every day, as Phineas would sit down to a great feast, the harpies would fly down and gobble up all the food. When Jason finally arrived, the sons of the North Wind (as a favor to Iris, a goddess who supported Jason) drove the harpies away to Crete, never to bother Phineas again. The physical appearance of Warcraft harpies is quite consistent with the original descriptions put forward by Ovid and Virgil.\nSpeculation.\nWorshiped by quilboars?\nIt is possible that &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s worship harpies as there are rocks with pictures of winged humanoids in quilboar areas. Possibly, there could be some other connection between quilboar and harpies. It is possible that these are just normal pictures. This doodad is found in &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; lands as well.\nMales?\nNo males of this race have ever been seen. \"Manual of Monsters\" blatantly says that there are no male harpies and that harpies breed through rape, while \"Monster Guide\" says that there are no reported males and that the raping is a rumor. Males of the race are not necessarily necessary, though, and \"Manual of Monsters\" does mention parthenogenesis. Both sources, however have been declared non-canon.\nOld God corruption.\nTheir use of shadow and void magic, and mentions of 'new masters' may imply that they've fallen victim to the corruption of the Old Gods since the death of G'Hanir."}

Initially a simple joke character, Jones has become a reoccurring character with added significance, particularly during the &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20quests\"&gt;storyline&lt;/a&gt;. His companions often include &lt;a href=\"Adarrah\"&gt;Adarrah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samir\"&gt;Samir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Budd%20Nedreck\"&gt;Budd Nedreck&lt;/a&gt;. \nBiography.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nJones first appeared inside &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering Zul'Aman, the inner gate into the city was shut; speaking to Jones would cause him to don his hat (another Indy trademark), shout out and run over to the gong near the door. He and five players needed to hit the gong (a channelled effect, like summoning) until it stopped moving; shortly thereafter the gates would open, beginning the 20-minute timed event.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThough previously thought to have been killed by the sudden ambush of Amani trolls, Harrison Jones returned in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. He can be found in the crypt of the &lt;a href=\"Drakil%27jin%20Ruins\"&gt;Drakil'jin Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. He decided to leave the place and asks the adventurer if they wanted to follow him. In the crypt, he freed &lt;a href=\"Adarrah\"&gt;Adarrah&lt;/a&gt; and defeated giant cobra &lt;a href=\"Tecahuna\"&gt;Tecahuna&lt;/a&gt;. Once Harrison saves the adventurer, Jones disappears from sight.\nCataclysm.\nJones plays a larger role in , providing players with a series of quests in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and also appearing in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; as the city's archaeology trainer.\nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Explorer%20Mowi\"&gt;Explorer Mowi&lt;/a&gt; informs him about the &lt;a href=\"Masters%27%20Gate\"&gt;Masters' Gate&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; was trying to use as a weapon. Before deciding to go to Uldum, he sends an Alliance soldier to meet up with Adarrah.\nShortly after this, Harrison finds a mule and travels to Uldum on a &lt;a href=\"Harrison%27s%20Mule\"&gt;Mule&lt;/a&gt; and is encountered at &lt;a href=\"Khartut%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Khartut's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, searching for the &lt;a href=\"Coffer%20of%20the%20Promise\"&gt;Coffer of the Promise&lt;/a&gt;. Moments before arming some explosives, pygmy shoots at Harrison's mule which forces the adventurer to hit a brazier and light the explosive. Terrified, Harrison and the adventurer jump into two nearby chests. After crushing into another pygmy, they ended up at the &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Obelisk of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;. To their luck, they discover titan tablet which tell him that the obelisk are what kept the land hidden. He also discovers that the way to recharge it is by using the &lt;a href=\"Shaft%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Shaft of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;. Going inside the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Chamber of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;, he learns that the statues house four orbs and he decided to topple them.\nHarrison then informs the adventurer to meet him in Ramkahen for the next step of his plan. They entered the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Chamber of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; and activated it, then took flight on a plane. When &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Schnottz\"&gt;Commander Schnottz&lt;/a&gt; told everything about his plan to the adventurer, Harrison came into the scene and tell Schnottz to beat it which meant we haven't seen the last of him. At the &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Obelisk of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, Schnottz's men have already trend into the ruins to defeat the Guardian that protects it, but ultimately fails when the adventurer bombed the camp and killed the remaining men. Harrison arrives at the ruins and activates the obelisk, then he and the adventurer run towards the &lt;a href=\"temple%20of%20Uldum\"&gt;temple of Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Schnottz already won and found the treasure before they even got there. Surrounded by black dragons, Harrison and adventurer had been put in an impossible situation to get out of, until suddenly, the chest spoke. Someone was in there and used a orb of light to obliterate the black dragons and Schnottz himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s \"two steps ahead of everyone as usual\" strikes again and Harrison Jones and adventurer were relived. Harrison then told the adventurer to light up signal flares to be brought to the &lt;a href=\"Coffer%20of%20Promise\"&gt;Coffer of Promise&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nJones can be briefly seen in the &lt;a href=\"Silvershard%20Mines\"&gt;Silvershard Mines&lt;/a&gt; on a mine track heading north.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nJones is mentioned in passing by a Stormshield Guard in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;: \"I hear that Harrison Jones still isn't any closer to finding that artifact.\" &lt;a href=\"Examiner%20Rahm%20Flameheart\"&gt;Examiner Rahm Flameheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illandria%20Belore\"&gt;Illandria Belore&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; also discuss Harrison's mission, hoping to seize the artifact before he does.\nHarrison is found on the main island excavating its ruins. He can be attacked as part of Horde's bonus objective in &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Stronghold\"&gt;Stormshield Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nJones appears in players' &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;s as of &lt;a href=\"patch%206.1.0\"&gt;patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in recovering relics across .

With the exception of the first section, the material presented below is in the order that the player encounters her for ease of reading.\"\nVisage Day.\n\"Note: This section uses male pronouns to refer to Chronormu pre-transition, to match the pronoun usage in the short story \"&lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day%20%28short%20story%29\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt;\". After the events of the short story, she is referred to exclusively as female in both mortal and dragon form.\"\nChronormu was assigned male at birth. In the weeks leading up to his &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the coming-of-age ceremony where dragons decide what their mortal guise will be\u2014he was plagued by indecision. One morning, less than a fortnight before his Visage Day, his dearest friend &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; visited him in his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20roost\"&gt;roost&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to ask what form he'd be choosing and was shocked to learn that he'd still not decided. He told her that he didn't know how he wanted others to see him when he wasn't even sure how he saw himself, and Zidormi suggested that he seek the counsel of their master &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronormu hesitantly circled above the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; for a long while before entering and ramblingly trying to ask Nozdormu if he could reveal what visage the future Chronormu would choose. After getting him to calm down, the Bronze Aspect asked Chronormu what Visage Day meant to him. He replied that it meant the Aspects trusted him to walk among the mortal races and help them understand dragons better, and that it was important to him to pick the right visage since he wanted mortals to see him for who he was. Nozdormu assumed his own mortal guise and stated that just as the dragons' visages allowed them to see the world as the young races do, it informed how the young races perceived the dragons. Since this choice was deeply personal, he would not say anything that might sway Chronormu's decision and instead advised him to seek out other dragons\u2014friends or otherwise\u2014to learn how they made their choices.\nZidormi asked &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to give Chronormu some guidance. The young bronze traveled to the blue flight's stronghold at the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and met with Kalecgos, who surprised him by revealing that his visage was that of a humble &lt;a href=\"half-elf\"&gt;half-elf&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos explained that while many blues chose elaborate forms, he instead wanted to be approachable and walk among mortals as a friend and equal. When Chronormu asked about his visage's blue hair, he replied \"It suits me\". Before the bronze left, Kalecgos suggested that he should think about a nickname to use in his mortal form\u2014like how Kalecgos went by \"Kalec\"\u2014and seek out the advice of someone with a different perspective on dealing with mortals. Chronormu thought about other dragons who'd made an impression on him and settled on the one he thought was as different from Kalecgos as possible: &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"black%20drakonid\"&gt;black drakonid&lt;/a&gt; escorted Chronormu into &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Neltharion\"&gt;the caverns&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; for an audience with the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Onyxia scoffed at Chronormu's view that dragons chose a visage to better relate to the mortal races, instead stating that they chose a visage that allowed them to \"control\" mortals. She assumed her &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; form and continued that no visage could change a dragon's nature as a hunter and killer. Like their other abilities, shapeshifting was a tool to take what they wanted from the young races. She offered to let him stay by her side and teach him everything he needed to know about mortals and allow him to become the greatest member of his flight, great enough that even Nozdormu would kneel before him. The bronze fled from the cave, upset at Onyxia's words, but realized that he now knew what he wanted to be.\nAs was traditional, Chronormu's Visage Day ceremony was held at the summit of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. It was attended by many members of the bronze flight, including Nozdormu and Zidormi, as well as Kalecgos, Onyxia, and other emissaries from the flights. It was officiated by the Dragon Queen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; herself, to Chronormu's initial panic. When the queen arrived, she privately told the bronze that she could postpone the ceremony if he liked, but he replied that he was ready. After the dragons in attendance assumed their own mortal forms, Chronormu began reciting a prepared speech, but decided to forgo it and speak from his heart. He stated that he'd long thought something was wrong with him since the choice of form seemed to come naturally to everyone else.\nHe continued that the counsel he'd received from his fellow dragons had made him realize that a visage was not just about how they wanted the world to see them, but about how they saw themselves, and that he wanted to experience the world as the smallest and most optimistic of mortals working to create a brighter future. He then cast the spell that would define his mortal form and transformed into a female &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;. She introduced herself as \"Chromie\", and the other dragons cheered. Zidormi hugged her, Nozdormu told her she'd made a wise choice, and Onyxia gave a nod of acceptance before leaving. Kalec told Chromie that he felt that she was the one who had taught them all a lesson. When he asked why she'd chosen to become female, Chromie smiled, replied \"It suits me\", and gave him a long hug. After an evening of festivities, Chromie went to bed feeling more whole and joyful than she ever had before.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; was the site of some diabolical experiments by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. But when they started tampering with time, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; sent Chronormu to investigate. Chronormu set up a base of operations in the Andorhal inn, creating a time pocket in a single room. There, operating from another time, free of the Scourge's infestation, Chronormu could investigate without contaminating the timeline.\nUsing her mortal visage, Chromie, the bronze enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to assist, sending them to root out &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Parasite\"&gt;Temporal Parasite&lt;/a&gt;s which were interfering with auguration. To maintain the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket universe&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie needed trinkets of time from the ruins of Andorhal. In return for these, Chromie crafted dampeners attuned to &lt;a href=\"Araj\"&gt;Araj&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; who ruled over the broken city. When activated in his presence, they severely reduced the effectiveness of his spells and played an instrumental role in his downfall.\nThe more time spent with these mortals, the more sympathetic the bronze agent became with their desperate plight and mourned the losses to the Scourge. When &lt;a href=\"Carlin%20Redpath\"&gt;Carlin Redpath&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to undo the curse on the soul of his brother, heard about the strange little gnome, he sent his friends to speak with her, equipped with Joseph's wedding ring. Upon receiving the ring, Chromie immediately knew much of Joseph \u2014 that he was a great man who had suffered an unspeakable tragedy, and knew it was too late to save him in the present, but not in the past. Sending Carlin's agents into the ruins of Andorhal, they uncovered records detailing the fall of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, and the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo help him, relics from that battle were needed. With Carlin's help, relics belonging to the heroes and villains of Darrowshire were assembled. Also needed were remains of many Scourge who participated in the battle, found by the use of a resonating crystal that could discern which of the Scourge in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; had been there. When all these were assembled, they were brought to Chromie, who cast a spell of time upon them and bid Carlin's friends to return to Darrowshire and place the bag of relics in the center of town. Chromie's spell would raise the spirits of &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;The Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, and they would reenact a pantomime of that tragic battle. Chromie could only guide the mortals to their paths, not lead the way for them, and so Chromie bid Carlin's friends good luck, and returned to the investigations of Andorhal.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nChromie also acts as the bronze dragonflight's ambassador at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; as a part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;The Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie sends willing adventurers out into the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the origins of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nChromie gives two quests to divine the true identity of the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. In the first quest, you are assisted by \"Future You\". In the second quest, you are assisted by \"Past You\". Your alternate time-displaced self will make quips about things like how much better/worse your gear is now. \"Future You\" also warns the player not to drink the punch at a party he/she will be attending soon. \nCulling of Stratholme.\nChromie has also been spotted a few years in the past, just prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when she greets players when they zone into the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. She explains that the infinite dragonflight are trying to hide the evidence &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; used to decide to purge Stratholme by casting illusions on the plagued grain. She gives players &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Disruptor\"&gt;Arcane Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;s that allow players to identify the plagued grain crates.\nOnce all the plagued grain has been revealed, she asks players to protect Arthas and make sure he reaches &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition, on Heroic mode, she whispers players at the start of the first leg of the instance to rescue the Bronze Dragonflight agent that is being attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Corruptor\"&gt;Infinite Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. She also gives the group warnings when the timer to complete the rescue mission reaches the five- and one-minute marks.\nCataclysm.\nChromie appears as one of many well-known NPCs in Mount Hyjal during the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, aiding in the fight against Ragnaros' forces. Her flight form in Hyjal is that of a &lt;a href=\"bronze%20whelp\"&gt;bronze whelp&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe later appears in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; instance following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20and%20Varo%27then\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, she asks if she had missed anything and is awed by Mannoroth being pulled into the Well. When spoken to, she asks \"How can I be of aid, stranger?\", implying that from her point of view this is the first time Chromie has met any &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing the final defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie now resides in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20Deathwing%27s%20Jaw\"&gt;Fragment of Deathwing's Jaw&lt;/a&gt;. She will allow members of the Alliance to witness the events that transpired there if spoken to.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nFollowing Deathwing's defeat, Chronormu joined Nozdormu at a meeting of the Wyrmrest Accord. Despite her worry over the stability of the timelines, Nozdormu insisted that protecting history is now a job for the mortal races.\nTimeless Isle.\nChromie as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt; refers adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; and gives them a pocket watch to take them there.\nWar Crimes.\nDuring the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie works with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; while her companion &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; works with &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them use an hourglass created by Kairoz, the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, to show the court points in history without relying solely on the possibly faulty memories of witnesses. Near the end of the trial, however, Kairoz tinkers with the Vision of Time, and Chromie begins to grow suspicious. After confronting him about it, Chromie is locked inside a prison cell and unable to prevent Kairoz from freeing Garrosh and escaping to thirty-five years in the past.\nAfter Chromie is freed from her prison cell, she gathers up the pieces of the now shattered Vision of Time, destroyed during Kairoz's time travel. After aiding in the fight of several alternate timeline counterparts to heroes of Azeroth, an angry and defeated Chromie explains to the assembled leaders at the trial that a growing faction of discontent within the Bronze dragons believes they should change history to make a better future, though Chromie isn't sure herself what a better future even is now that they can no longer see history with clarity following Deathwing's defeat. Kairoz appears to be a part of this faction.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nChromie travels to the &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate&lt;/a&gt; to help hunt down Kairoz. She apparently feels guilty she did not see Kairoz's betrayal coming. She helps &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s follow Kairoz's trail to the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Glade\"&gt;Time-Lost Glade&lt;/a&gt; in , only to find that he has already been slain by Garrosh. Kairoz's spirit, thinking that he is still facing Garrosh, attacks her and her companions in &lt;a href=\"Tarnished%20Bronze\"&gt;Tarnished Bronze&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie attempts to understand Kairoz's actions and he claims that if he were to gain unlimited access to all alternate timelines, he and the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; could truly achieve infinite power, both for themselves and for the coming battle with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Kairoz's spirit is defeated and laid to rest. Chromie tells Khadgar she wishes to help mend the damage Kairoz caused.\nChromie appears as a &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt; in \"Warlords of Draenor\", implying that from her point of view this is after Hyjal (where she is a whelp) but before Culling of Stratholme (where she is a full-grown dragon).\nLegion.\nChromie called for help from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to come to Wyrmrest Temple, where she revealed to an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; that she would die in the near future (though some time before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;). In order to figure out the circumstances of her death, she had asked the adventurer for help. It's not that she did not want to die, it's that this wasn't how she was supposed to die. She had seen her death and knew it happened much later than this attack. Meddling with the timeways for personal reasons goes against everything the bronze dragonflight stands for.\nThe two traveled to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; right before her time of death and approached Chromie's future self, but just as they did so the assassination was carried out, and future Chromie died in the magical assault. Chromie and the adventurer thus traveled this time to several minutes before the attack, and asked &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and future Chromie if they had seen anything odd. They each pointed out a particular issue they were encountering in regard to the various dragonshrines across &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could set out for the shrines, the attack came and her future self died, again.\nUnfortunately for whoever was fixated on Chromie's death, she was \"a fairly skilled master of the timeways\" with the advantage of trying again and again. As Chromie attempted to travel to four hours before the attack for ample time to investigate, she found something blocking her from accessing that particular moment. An hour before her death was likewise blocked, prompting Chromie to comment that whoever was behind the attack had done their homework. The best she could manage was fifteen minutes before the attack.\nChromie and the adventurer faced &lt;a href=\"Zorathides\"&gt;Zorathides&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Icechill\"&gt;Talar Icechill&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalas%20Vylethorn\"&gt;Thalas Vylethorn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Gargantuan\"&gt;Void Gargantuan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Azure Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, all four of which dropped chronoshards. The chronoshards all led to various points that Chromie had been to in her past or future: &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Andorhal, they arrived in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;a battle&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with both sides also trying to kill her. The Chromie of that time was trapped in a building due to a cannon aimed directly at her, and so the adventurer and present Chromie took it out, allowing the past Chromie to leave. At &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; on Mount Hyjal, they found Chromie's past self nearly dead and fended off attacking &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s until she could recover and leave. At the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, demons of the Legion attempted to strike Chromie and the adventurer down as soon as they arrived. The two fought their way to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt; and defeated a &lt;a href=\"terrorguard\"&gt;terrorguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Grolethax\"&gt;Grolethax&lt;/a&gt;. In Stratholme they arrived shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;culling&lt;/a&gt; and helped townsfolk out until &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; arrived and began his attack. At &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Square\"&gt;Crusaders' Square&lt;/a&gt; they battled &lt;a href=\"Nezar%27Azret\"&gt;Nezar'Azret&lt;/a&gt;, who had captured the past Chromie in webbing. She was freed after the battle.\nIn the end, they never learn who was behind the attacks, though the timelines are restored to normal.\nChromie's dragon form in \"Legion\" is a whelp like at Hyjal during \"Cataclysm\", in contrast to a drake in \"Warlords of Draenor\" and a full-grown dragon in \"Wrath of the Lich King\".\nBattle for Azeroth.\nChromie later visited &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the island and allied with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Chromie revealed to adventurers that during her travels to possible futures, she had discovered a place much like &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt;, but different. In this other time and place, very little was left alive, everything was machines. She then ordered them to travel to this other place and scan the memory banks of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Giant\"&gt;Clockwork Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, in order to use their data to ensure that their Rustbolt never becomes like the other place.\nChromie later journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; where she joined with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; in empowering the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown why it was her instead of Nozdormu; the bronze Aspect's absence is not even mentioned.\nShadowlands.\nChromie can be found near the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Embassy\"&gt;Stormwind Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Timewalking%20Campaigns\"&gt;Timewalking Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nChromie's dragon form in \"Dragonflight\" is a drake like in \"Warlords of Draenor\", as opposed to a whelp as in \"Cataclysm\" and \"Legion\" and a full-grown dragon in \"Wrath of the Lich King\".\nHaving been sent to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Temporal Conflux&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie discovered that &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; was seeking to turn Nozdormu into &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. As Eternus attacked the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Oathstone\"&gt;Bronze Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, Chromie interrupted and according to Nozdormu the pair had \"punched a tunnel through time and are tumbling endlessly amongst the infinite possibilities.\" Nozdormu subsequently sent adventures to rescue the pair, were the group ultimately found themselves at the height of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and worked with one another to escape back to the present. Upon their return, Nozdormu allowed Eternus to leave in gratitude for her aid in helping Chromie return to them. However, before departing, Eternus declared that they would bring about his ultimate fate, a statement that Nozdormu met with resignation. Though he was resigned to becoming Murozond, Chromie instead vowed to find another way and promised to search every timeline for a way to save him. With a smile and his confidence restored, Nozdormu tells her how proud he has always been of her.\nFractures in Time.\nNozdormu called upon adventurers to speak with at &lt;a href=\"Eon%27s%20Fringe\"&gt;Eon's Fringe&lt;/a&gt;, where a future version of Chromie claimed that she was there to solve the matter that Nozdormu wished to speak with them about. However, after carrying out her tasks, present Chromie expressed confusion as to why her future self had distorted the timeways. Working together, the pair discovered that this future Chromie was in reality &lt;a href=\"Morchie\"&gt;Morchie&lt;/a&gt;, a Chromie who had become a member of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and sought to bring about the rise of Murozond. As the infinite dragonflight invaded the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Bronze Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu arrived and remarked that it was too late for him, only for Chromie to argue that it was never too late and swore to not give on him. Reflecting on how she was ever the optimist, Nozdormu agreed that they had to try. As Chromie and her allies confronted the infinite dragonflight across the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu tracked them to the moment where he dared not thread, the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;'s death.\nAs he stayed behind, Chromie and adventurers gave chase into the distant past, where they discovered that the bargain between the infinites and Iridikron involved them taking him to the time of Galakrond's demise so he could claim the fallen dragon's essence, while agreeing to act as a distraction to any allies of the bronze dragonflight that sought to stop them. Their plan finally came to pass, as while Chromie and adventures were focused on stopping Iridikron from acquiring Galakrond's essence, &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; did battle with the Proto-Aspects and seemingly corrupted the proto-dragon version of Nozdormu into Murozond. With this single-time alteration, the infinite dragonflight changed the history of Azeroth and created a new timeline. In order to restore Azeroth's timeline, Chromie, and her allies made their way back into the past and aided the Proto-Aspects in stopping Deios, while Iridikron was able to successfully claim Galakrond's essence.\nIn the aftermath, Chromie was relieved to return to present-day Azeroth and see that Nozdormu was himself and not Murozond.\nFury Incarnate.\nAfter confronting the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morchie\"&gt;Morchie&lt;/a&gt; and a great deal of thought, Chromie had arranged for &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of swaying Eternus to their point of view. At this meeting the bronze dragons learned that Eternus had turned to the infinites after she was denied the chance to change the past to save her sister &lt;a href=\"Moraidormi\"&gt;Moraidormi&lt;/a&gt;, who had been slain by the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. After being given the chance to save her, Eternus discovered that Moraidormi had chosen to sacrifice her own life to save a hidden bronze whelping. Eternus subsequently decided to respect her sister's choice and Chromie expressed sympathy for Eternus and hoped that she could find peace. Chromie was overjoyed that Nozdormu and Eternus had reached an understanding, that Eternus planned on speaking with the other infinites to change their points of view, and thanked adventures for their aid.\nAs a gesture of goodwill, Eternus pledged her assistance in finding the disc that contains &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s memories, and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; with Chromie and Nozdormu. While Chromie and Eternus worked together to locate the disc, they tasked the adventurer with aiding &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; in restoring the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. With the Tyr Guard restored, Chromie and Eternus revealed where they needed to travel in order to use the infinite beacons to pinpoint the disc's location. Thus the group discovered that the disc was in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, with Chromie noting that the disc was in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful master of magic who would know the disc's power.\nWorld of Warcraft Anniversary.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2015th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 15th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, the bronze dragonflight threw a celebration, with Chromie among them and had invited adventurers from across Azeroth and beyond. Acknowledging how adventurers have done so much to save Azeroth, Chromie offered them the chance to relive the exciting bits of their adventure. She also offered them the chance to relive the beginning of the conflict in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nChromie friendship reputation.\nReputation with Chromie is gained by playing through &lt;a href=\"The%20Deaths%20of%20Chromie\"&gt;The Deaths of Chromie&lt;/a&gt;, by completing the quests associated with it and killing mobs and bosses. &lt;a href=\"Sands%20of%20Time\"&gt;Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; serve as a good source of reputation as well, with some awarding anywhere between 50 to 200 reputation when used or activating the &lt;a href=\"Favor%20of%20the%20Bronze\"&gt;Favor of the Bronze&lt;/a&gt; buff, which increases all reputation gained with Chromie (including Sands of Time awards) by 25% for the rest of the scenario. Reputation with Chromie is necessary to unlock the ranks of her talent tree, increasing her power in the scenario and making it easier to complete in one sitting:\nThere are no item or quartermaster rewards associated with Chromie's friendship rank. Reaching Timelord friendship (her equivalent of Best Friend) awards the &lt;a href=\"Chromie%20Homie\"&gt;Chromie Homie&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nQuotes.\n\"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nGossip.\nHi, &lt;name&gt;!\nQueen Alexstrasza is calling the dragonflights home to the Dragon Isles.

This was the only place where &lt;a href=\"Cleric%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;clerics&lt;/a&gt; would come together for their ceremonies, and many could be recruited here to assist in ridding the land of the hellspawned &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s. A tithe had to be made to the church for their services in order that new clerics could be trained, and other sites made sacred. A Church had to be built entirely of a rare wood known as &lt;a href=\"Holyoak\"&gt;Holyoak&lt;/a&gt;, hence a &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; had to be active to specially cut and prepare this sacred wood.

Once led by devout &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s, churches now depended on &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; to minister to the masses in this time of war. It was in these places for healing and serenity that the holy warriors gathered to deepen their faith. Through meditating, communing and tithing at these sanctified sites, paladins discovered new ways to channel their healing and spiritual powers.\nThe tradition continued after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; decreed that the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; should serve in the communities that had been devastated by war, helping their ailing populations. &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; notably stayed at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; for several years.\nThird War.\nTheir function was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctum\"&gt;Arcane Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;s, which took over the training of &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s were also a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;hero unit&lt;/a&gt; now and couldn't be trained as normal military units anymore.\nChurches and cathedrals could still be seen as background objects during several missions in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; such as in &lt;a href=\"Vandermar%20Village\"&gt;Vandermar Village&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nChurches or chapels can be found all throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt;. While a few chapels have been abandoned or destroyed, some still remain intact. Most chapels are located in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, with only two located in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The most famous church is &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbbeys are more uncommon, with the most famous of them being &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; and the two others being in &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; territories.\nCathedrals are bigger religious buildings, serving as the central church for major cities. Most cathedrals are situated in human lands but that is not always true - the ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; city that became &lt;a href=\"Sargeron\"&gt;Sargeron&lt;/a&gt; had a cathedral named after &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; had the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; was described as a cathedral city, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Telmor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt; also had a smaller cathedral. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; had its own cathedral, where &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; met for the first time."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Church concentrated its efforts to contain the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and cure the sick, but was &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;wiped out&lt;/a&gt; when Lordaeron was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the clergy reformed itself in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAffiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, its members are dedicated to creating a world of honor and justice, striving to aid others and be good in all actions. By embodying the tenets of their religion, the Church's skilled clergy can wield &lt;a href=\"holy%20magic\"&gt;holy magic&lt;/a&gt; called the Light. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s who heal and restore in times of peace, protecting in times of war, and the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the martial branch who enforce its laws, protecting the weak and vanquishing the evil of the world.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nSacrifice and courage were among the founding principles of the Church of the Holy Light. The Church traced its origins back more than two thousand years ago, all the way to the chaos of the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. A human general, &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt;, selflessly gave his life to hold off an overwhelming force of Amani trolls that threatened to destroy a united human army. One of the people he saved was his sister, a renowned warrior named &lt;a href=\"Mereldar\"&gt;Mereldar&lt;/a&gt;. When the war ended, Mereldar dedicated her life to caring for humanity's wounded veterans. It was she who first spoke to other humans about visions of the Light. In her dreams, Mereldar saw five strange forms not human, thrumming with holy power. They filled her mind with the wisdom of holiness, protection, justice, retribution, and compassion. When she put their wordless teachings into practice, power seemed to flow through her. The patients under her care would see their wounds disappear and their illnesses vanish.\nOther &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s also began having faint dreams and visions of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic beings, geometric forms that thrummed with living light. Mereldar met with them, and together, they codified the radiant wisdom of this higher power into the written word. They did not know it, they had actually managed to commune with the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, and through this connection, the Holy Light was introduced to the early humans for the first time. Popular among the common folk, the movement flourished and sparked widespread faith in the Holy Light, becoming the predominant human religion.\nAs the economy of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; flourished, the nobles of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, seeking lusher lands, purity, and enlightenment, decided to leave the arid surroundings of the imperial capital against the arguments of the royalty. They founded a city-state named &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, which became a mecca for religious travelers and all those who sought inner peace and security. Centuries later, &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s leaders codified the different Light-based traditions and belief systems. From these efforts, the Church of the Holy Light came to be. Lordaeron served as the home of this church and became a popular destination for travelers seeking healing, wisdom, and inner peace. The Church constructed &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s and shrines throughout the far-flung human lands, and it created a hierarchy of religious leaders to oversee its followers. The most important places of worship were located in the verdant &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;. Among the oldest and most revered of these holy sites were &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the decades, devout clerics from the emergent Church of the Holy Light had ventured south from Lordaeron to spread their faith. Upon reaching &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromwind&lt;/a&gt;, these pious individuals founded the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Order%20of%20Northshire%20Clerics\"&gt;Holy Order of Northshire Clerics&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom looked to these clerics as a source of wisdom and comfort in hard times, while the devout clerics used the powers of the Light to soothe the hearts and minds of Stormwind's citizens, and even helped the army of their kingdom fight through its life. They were known to have also healed &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the priests of the Church known as the Clerics of Northshire were one of the great sources of hope on the battlefield. They risked their lives to heal soldiers wounded in combat, and its members accompany every Stormwind patrol and battalion into the fray, just as they had in wars past. They used their Light-given abilities to fight with the armies against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;, while healing and protecting the wounded and citizens of Stormwind.\nHowever, unlike gnolls and trolls, the orcs ruthlessly targeted every cleric they found, knowing that these healers could return a wounded human to battle. Many clerics died, without armor or weapons they could do nothing against the orc's fury, while their numbers were not great enough to change the outcome of the war, as Stormwind fell to the Horde. After the orcs decimated the kingdom, the surviving clerics and priests fled with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the High Clerist of Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Mara%20Fordragon\"&gt;Lady Mara Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, became the patron of the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; of the war who chose to flee to the northern lands of Lordaeron, untouched by the fighting.\nThe Second War.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; was present at the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt; formed by the Regent Lord of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, and the king of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, with the intent of convincing the other kingdoms to band together to repel the invading &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The Archbishop was not a king, but a leader in his own right at the head of the Church of the Holy Light revered by humans everywhere, whose followers included most of the people from all the kingdoms combined. Not interested in the control of the army, he played a moderating influence, keeping the kings focused on the fact that the Horde would come whether an army was ready to face them or not, and reminding the monarchs frequently that an army without a single leader was useless no matter its size, before announcing to Anduin Lothar that the Alliance of Lordaeron could count on the support of the Church of the Light for their war. The Church also pledged itself to Stormwind's help, and started gathering funds to rebuild the southern kingdom when the crisis would have passed.\nAs the human forces amassed for the war, Anduin Lothar was looking for champions to unite all the armies of the human realms under his command. Among them, the armies of Lordaeron were said to be deeply religious. The solution came from the Church of the Holy Light. Seeking to create an order that would suffer less attrition in battle, Alonsus Faol met Anduin Lothar and offered him to create a new order that would represent the best qualities of humanity. An order that would include soldiers gifted not only in wielding the Light, but also in possessing leadership qualities and mastering the arts of traditional warfare, while embodying the qualities of loyalty, bravery, and honor. With Lothar's consent, Alonsus Faol called for a meeting with the Supreme Commander and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to introduce the followers of the Church that became the first &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of a new order: the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. During the months following the start of the war, other knights and priests were also trained by Alonsus Faol to become paladins, and thus, some of them led &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es instead of devout clerics during the war, gathering inside to minister the masses.\nAt the same time, &lt;a href=\"Natalie%20Seline\"&gt;Bishop Natalie Seline&lt;/a&gt; from Lordaeron began to delve into workings of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, as she realized that to defeat the green-skinned orcs, humanity would need to study the strange powers they wielded. She closely examined their magics, and she visited battle sites where their dark arts had befouled the land. By the time of the Second War, Natalie Seline had learned how to wield shadow magic from a &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;powerful shadow artifact&lt;/a&gt;, and had taught her dangerous arts to other worshipers of the Light to rally them against the Horde. They waged their war in secret, hunting down orcs across the human kingdoms, and despite her noble intentions, Seline became more and more obsessed with the blade and the mysteries of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe paladins were instrumental in the defeat of the Horde and were the Alliance's best defense against the Horde's &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. In the aftermath of the Second War, the Alliance set out to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and Archbishop Alonsus Faol was instrumental in reforming the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt;. The Silver Hand also coordinated with the Church to help the Alliance move forward. They healed the sick and granted shelter to the survivors broken by the war, as in times of peace, they were present in chapels and cathedrals to treat the wounded and those in need, applying the teachings of Alonsus Faol on the dichotomy of paladins to serve humbly in devastated communities after wars; as they are both warriors and healers.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20%28Rise%20of%20the%20Lich%20King%29\"&gt;unnamed bishop&lt;/a&gt; from the Church was responsible for holding services and providing blessings for the &lt;a href=\"House%20Menethil\"&gt;House Menethil&lt;/a&gt; in their private &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; made its appearance in Lordaeron and continue to spread, local priests of the Church tried to ease the victims' suffering with holy magic and stop the spread of the disease. However, their efforts were insufficient, as healing salves and potions had little effect, and the light could only treat the infection in its earliest stages.\nDespite the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;' official departure from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the altruistic priests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; refused to abandon their roles as healers and agreed to remain in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; despite the edicts from their reclusive masters in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. The high elven priests used their &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-given powers to heal the wounded and bolster the spirits of Lordaeron's fighting elite. These high elven priests joined with Prince Arthas in investigating the plague with the goal of healing the land of its strange curse.\nWhen Arthas returned to Lordaeron as the champion of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, his soul cursed by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, he began the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the Church's clergy at the same time. Consequently, a group of wretched and &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;heretical&lt;/a&gt; priests appeared during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. They once counted as the most devout amongst the Church of the Holy Light. But, after years of constant war and suffering, they had lost their sense of the Holy Light and decided to spread their frustration and negativity to their fellow men and women.\nIn the meantime, some priests of the Church had joined the &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;Human Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Alliance\"&gt;Kalimdor alliance&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Priest%20%28Hyjal%20Summit%29\"&gt;high elf priests&lt;/a&gt; who survived the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;fall of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the Kul Tiras navy deployed Light-wielding &lt;a href=\"Chaplain%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;chaplains&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Chaplain\"&gt;elites&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of a &lt;a href=\"Chief%20of%20Chaplains\"&gt;superior officer&lt;/a&gt;, to fight the Horde and defend &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the end of the Third War, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Old Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, once a proud bastion of Lordaeron's priesthood and a center for learning and enlightenment, was taken by the newly-created &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Among its members were several original priests of Lordaeron, such as &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Benedictus%20Voss\"&gt;Benedictus Voss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing Faol's death, and the fall of the Church in Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; took charge of the Church as its new leader and swore to continue the work his mentor had begun so many years ago. The &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; now serves as the main spiritual hub for the Church of Light, and as headquarters for the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the city. In order to support the Alliance in its campaigns, and to fight against evil, the Church also called upon &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to send them on missions across Azeroth.\nAs the teachings and philosophies of Light have long since spread to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, their priests and paladins are mainly present in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Hall of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; that serves as a center of arcane and divine practice and study, with the highest-ranking being &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valgar%20Highforge\"&gt;Valgar Highforge&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Petitioner%27s%20Chamber\"&gt;Petitioner's Chamber&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20DeLavey\"&gt;Bishop DeLavey&lt;/a&gt; represented the Church at the King's court and handled several affairs. The Church also accepted the presence of &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Crowley\"&gt;Brother Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, an ambassador of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen they finished teaching everything they know, priest trainers sent their apprentices to &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Laurena\"&gt;High Priestess Laurena&lt;/a&gt; who met these new promising priests who have caught the attention of senior members of the Church of Light with their dedication, and who are worthy to continue their training. In the Cathedral of Light, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt; also met new promising paladins of the Silver Hand, giving them tests to make sure they are worthy, before sending them on missions.\nAs &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were members of the Church. After the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, many of them believed that the Light had abandoned them in their darkest hour. One of the most prominent followers of this mindset was &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who renounced her vows to the Light. A disillusioned Liadrin and many of her followers would later use the Light as a tool, forcibly taking it rather than relying on faith to wield it, thus was born the order of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; in year 25.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, multiple &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es appeared in the skies of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, transmitting communications and other assistance to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s ground forces. While the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; dealt with curing the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;, the Church of the Holy Light pledged itself to destroy the necropolises. Using the concentration of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; energy from the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the shared benedictions from its faithful, the Church created holy artifacts able to strike down the flying structures.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt; began, priests of the Church were present among the Alliance troops in their travel to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Notably &lt;a href=\"Father%20Levariol\"&gt;Father Levariol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Father%20Michaels\"&gt;Father Michaels&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20High%20Priest\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Medic\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; joined the ranks of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s army at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. A few of them fought against the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, but they were captured and placed in blocks of ice in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Stasis\"&gt;Hall of Stasis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. Some of their &lt;a href=\"Skybreaker%20Vicar\"&gt;vicars&lt;/a&gt; were also present to protect the &lt;a href=\"The%20Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;gunship battle&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;'s mist enveloped &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, noises could be heard from the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt;, as the still-standing defenders continued to fight off the nightmarish invaders with their spells around the cathedral, making any attempt to cross the district dangerous.\nPrior to the Cataclysm, Archbishop Benedictus sent &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; to search for the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Cloak of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that protects its wearer from corrupting influences and allows them to see through illusions, that was stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Cathedral of Light hosted a ceremony for the deceased soldiers of the war against the Lich King. The ceremony was led by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; that heralded the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Benedictus and priests of the Church protected the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt; from the raging elements. Once they were defeated, the Archbishop announced that the district was under control.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; descended on Stormwind to burn parts of the city to the ground, but shortly vanished as quickly as he had appeared, many of Stormwind's fearful citizens sought counsel from Archbishop Benedictus at the Cathedral of Light, as for years, Benedictus' wise guidance had been instrumental in seeing humanity through bleak times. Yet beneath his apparent benevolence, he had pledged himself to his &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;dark masters&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;eradication of all life on Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Unaware that he was secretly a member of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Archbishop subtly guided the citizens into the cult's embrace.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the clergy of the kingdom, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Almyra\"&gt;Sister Almyra&lt;/a&gt;, took care of training &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Gilnean priests&lt;/a&gt; to help them protect themselves against the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; in the city.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, High Priestess Laurena sent promising priests on missions, notably to fight the enemies of the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. They had to prevent the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; over the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent them from recruiting more into their ranks, by burning the books that the Twilight's Hammer distributes. At the same tie, Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker also sent promising paladins on missions in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent the deaths of allies at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen Archbishop was finally killed by adventurers in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of Aspects&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; during the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. When they returned to Stormwind after his death and told Bishop Farthing that Benedictus was the Twilight Prophet and betrayed the people of Stormwind, he would not believe it, telling the adventurers that he heard another grim rumor about &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and asked them to spread their lies elsewhere.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, a few of their &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Cleric\"&gt;clerics&lt;/a&gt; were seen in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; among the soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt;, fighting under &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s banner. They were led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Corwin\"&gt;Lieutenant Corwin&lt;/a&gt;, occasionally confronting the &lt;a href=\"Displaced%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Sunreaver mages&lt;/a&gt; present in the city. They were later attacked by an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde agent&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo months following the rediscovery of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Faithful\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; of the Church were present among the main forces who established their main bases of operations in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. During the Alliance assault of &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, the Champion of the Light &lt;a href=\"Disha%20Fearwarden\"&gt;Disha Fearwarden&lt;/a&gt; and a few priests attacked the defenses of the Horde and could be seen resurrecting the fallen soldiers.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Iron%20Horde\"&gt;war against the Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, priests from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; joined the ranks of the Alliance forces in . Among them, &lt;a href=\"Human%20Priest\"&gt;Human Priest&lt;/a&gt;s were attacked in different regions of Draenor by the &lt;a href=\"Follower\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; sent from the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;. Some could also be met and recruited as &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20followers\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, in .\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozaro\"&gt;Nozaro&lt;/a&gt; was the priest leader of the Alliance at the &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Outpost\"&gt;Stormshield Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, while on the battlefield, &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Priest\"&gt;Stormshield Priest&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; were present to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Alliance army, following &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them could be seen healing the wounded on the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion invasions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devoted%20Battle-Priest\"&gt;Devoted Battle-Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Battle-Priest\"&gt;Stormpike Battle-Priest&lt;/a&gt;s were present at the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion%23Areas%20of%20conflict\"&gt;demonic invasion locations&lt;/a&gt;, where they healed and protected the wounded soldiers. They also helped the Alliance adventurers to repel the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing the battle for Broken Shore, many priests of Alliance races - that would be in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; - joined the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; led by Archbishop Alonsus Faol. They were present in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where they could be seen studying or chatting with priests of other races and factions. When &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; launched his assault on the Netherlight Temple, they could be spotted battling hordes of demons alongside their allies of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, the bishop &lt;a href=\"Farthing\"&gt;Farthing&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; under the pretense of investigating the accusations and rumors regarding Benedictus' ties to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. In truth he was a member of the Twilight's Hammer serving as the hand of Benedictus, and who recently claimed leadership of the remaining Twilight's Hammer. Using &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; artifact, Farthing intended to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Zakajz\"&gt;Zakajz&lt;/a&gt; in order to restore the Twilight's Hammer to their pinnacle while also cementing his leadership of the cult. However, his efforts were halted by a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt; adventurer. He was later replaced by &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Arthur\"&gt;Bishop Arthur&lt;/a&gt; at the Cathedral of Light.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, priests of the Church were present to heal and protect their allies of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;, while battling demons on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Laurena\"&gt;High Priestess Laurena&lt;/a&gt; was present at the ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, where she blessed the troubled King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; before giving a speech to the gathered crowd, in the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Once she was finished, King Anduin continued the speech.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the priests wandered Stormwind City, doing what they could to tend to the hungry, exhausted, and frightened refugees coming from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. They were also providing continual blessings to &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; that kept the portals open. The &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Refugee\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; were transported to the Cathedral of Light, overflowing it, where they were treated by &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Priest%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Stormwind priests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Church of the Holy Light mobilized its priests to support the Alliance. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, some of their &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Priest%20%28Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron%29\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; were present in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, notably the &lt;a href=\"High%20priest\"&gt;High priest&lt;/a&gt; of Stormwind &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Gareth\"&gt;Brother Gareth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Melindra%20Quarry\"&gt;Melindra Quarry&lt;/a&gt;, caring for wounded soldiers in the Alliance camp at the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, a large number of priests and &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Priest\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the Church were present in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; among the armies of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Valorcall%20Pass\"&gt;Valorcall Pass&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Valorcall%20Faithful\"&gt;Valorcall Faithful&lt;/a&gt; healed and protected their allies, while &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Priest\"&gt;Veteran Priest&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Horde troops. There were also some &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Priest\"&gt;Stromgarde Priest&lt;/a&gt;s present in the region, indicating that the Church of the Holy Light is once again present in the kingdom after years, with &lt;a href=\"Altarite%20Jesse%20Taylor\"&gt;High Priest Altarite Jesse Taylor&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Altar of Kings&lt;/a&gt; in the capital as the highest-ranking member of the Church present.\nFollowing the war, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; sealed the &lt;a href=\"%3ABook%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;:Book of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous artifact that belonged to the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. The Spymaster made a copy of the runes with ordinary ink, which the Church of the Holy Light put under high magical protection in the Cathedral of Light, in order to be able to recognize the language inside if it were to be seen written elsewhere.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, priest trainers of the Church sent their apprentices to meet &lt;a href=\"Patrice%20Lancaster\"&gt;Patrice Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; in the priest section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. As a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, she sent promising priests on missions, more particularly to fight the enemies of the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; to obtain materials for the creation of weapons at the height of their dedication, as High Priestess Laurena did in the past.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Branven%20Hammerheart\"&gt;Branven Hammerheart&lt;/a&gt; helped young priests of the Church to learn the holy spell of &lt;a href=\"Resurrection\"&gt;Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;, in order to save the souls of the Alliance castaways on the island from being consumed by the &lt;a href=\"necromantic\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; magic of &lt;a href=\"Gor%27groth\"&gt;Gor'groth&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to raise the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20drake\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ravnyr\"&gt;Ravnyr&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Darkmaul%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Darkmaul Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nFrom their tenuous encounters with the naaru, some priests learned to harness the extraordinary healing effects of the Light, and from the teaching in these books, a religious movement formed, founded on the tenets of selflessness, justice, peace, altruistic works, and a belief that the Light dwelled in all things.\nWhen they obtain their steed, members of the Church name them following the tradition of the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, inherited from the informal tradition of the &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s and nobles of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, by a quality they admire.\nTheir members may use prayer beads, while some of the more fringe elements of the priesthood and the paladinhood use scourges, seeking to cleanse their sins and impurities with these instruments of self-flagellation.\nContrary to popular belief, priests and paladins are not subject to the vows of celibacy and chastity. They can freely marry and have children, such as &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhilosophy and belief.\nThrough the centuries, the Holy Light became a central part of all civilized human society, as their primary &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; and a staple of worship, respect, and honor. Sacrifice and courage were among the founding principles of the Church of the Holy Light, and while this religion is more philosophical than theistic, its practitioners do believe their devotion connects them to a greater and mysterious force in the universe. The general ideology of the Light is to strive to be good in all actions, but also seek to be the best of oneself, and thus continue to make the world a better place. They believe that the Light shines on each and every being of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Its teachings are depicted in the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Valor%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tome of Valor (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the martial branch of the Church, the paladins of the Silver Hand embody the qualities of loyalty and honor, while compassion, patience, bravery mean as much to them as strength in battle. Sacrifice is also a key component in what it takes to uphold their duties. Their order was founded on the moral foundation of five core traits, inspired by five holy tomes that were some of the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented what Archbishop Alonsus Faol saw as a core trait of the Order: retribution, holiness, protection, justice, and compassion.\nThe clergy teaches its followers to be virtuous in life, but also to beware of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;unholy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt;, in particular those who practice them: notably the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadows\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. They also preach against the Shadow, which the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were once strongly perceived to be creatures of, while their priests and paladins are known to condemn their foes with such epitaphs as 'shadowspawn' and 'spawn of darkness'. While not barred from the Cathedral of Light, &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; are not welcomed warmly and are even invited to leave as they are not considered appropriate, while the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; are well received.\n&lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;Blasphemy&lt;/a&gt; against the Light has never been shown to be punished by the Church, however, those who utter it attract consequently the animosity of its followers upon them. The &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; embody blasphemy towards the &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; itself and all that is sacred, thus, they are considered to be nothing but body-stealing abominations, and are destroyed by the faithful of the Church in a will of mercy, in order to honor their memory as livings and allow their soul to rest in peace.\nThe Three Virtues.\nThe philosophy of the Holy Light boils down to the three teachings, called the Three Virtues. These virtues\u2014respect, tenacity, and compassion\u2014are each defined into a principle and a lesson. Acting on these three tenets helps make the world a place everyone can appreciate; a world of honor and justice. These virtues are followed and applied by all members of the Church, but also by those of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nRespect is the first virtue taught to those joining the path of the Light. When looking at an enemy, one must look past the hatred that separates. There are qualities to respect and prowess to be acknowledged. Conducting oneself with honor and treating one's opponent as one wishes to be treated shows respect. Respecting one's opponents on the field is acknowledging a connection, which brings one closer to the Light.\nTenacity is the second virtue. This is the virtue of persevering through troubling times and painful experiences. In the face of despair and hatred, one must continue to stand true to their beliefs and fight on.\nCompassion is the last step on the path of the Light. In times of rivalries, it is easy to see differences at every turn. The challenge is in looking beyond appearances and understanding the similarities. Through this understanding, one can feel compassion for the losses others have suffered, even if the victim bears another banner. By feeling and understanding compassion in enemy and ally alike, one reaffirms his or her connection with the world.\nMissions and activities.\nThe Church's clergy is renowned for spreading goodness. They perform many activities on a daily basis, and are mainly present in places of worship, such as &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s, which provide a place where priests and paladins can commune with the people of the land. As the general ideology of the Light is to strive to be good in all actions, the priests and paladins must always show themselves worthy of serving the Light, and never forget the virtues that make them what they are. Its teachings are depicted in the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;Tome of Divinity&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe clergy organize ceremonies, sermons, masses, and offices until the last call of the bells when the sun goes down. They take care of the sick and wounded with their sacred powers, with their knowledge in &lt;a href=\"first%20aid\"&gt;first aid&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes with the help of their &lt;a href=\"%3ALightwell\"&gt;:Lightwell&lt;/a&gt;. They also make sure to support the society by helping and participating in charitable works. In places of worship where the citizens seeked spiritual enlightenment, they act as &lt;a href=\"confessor\"&gt;confessor&lt;/a&gt;s and are dedicated to hearing the confessions of their followers, sometimes using an &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%23Background\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell as a tool to make the confessing of secrets that weighed heavily upon the souls of worshipers easier to speak. Some of them may make speeches by reading books to educate their followers on various subjects, while others can be in charge of libraries where they make copies of collections. The Church also makes sure to send its priests and paladins on missions against those who threaten the peoples of the Alliance and their allies, notably by allowing the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s to rest, either by purging them or by using a holy censer to exorcise them.\nThe vocation of the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; is one of spiritual growth and contemplation. They heal and restore in times of peace, protect in times of war, and guide the spiritual destiny of their people. They are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. They have left their temples and shrines to support their allies in war-torn lands, using the &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;holy light&lt;/a&gt; to protect them, and their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;psychic powers&lt;/a&gt; to harm and terrify their enemies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; are the martial branch of the Church and seek to be an example of the Light's teachings as well as enforce its laws. Powerful holy knights, these crusaders are called to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. In times of peace, some of them exchange their weapons and armor for simple robes, applying the teachings of Alonsus Faol on the dichotomy of paladins to serve humbly in devastated communities after wars; as they are both warriors and healers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; once claimed their mission was to achieve \"everlasting peace\". In recent years, their priests and paladins use &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; as a recruitment and training center for any &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; brave enough to help keep the kingdom's peace, and ensure the training of the paladins of the Silver Hand and the priests of the clergy.\nFollowing the end of wars, the Church organizes ceremonies for the fallen, taking care of preparing the bodies to be buried according to the traditions.\nOrganization.\nAs its followers included most of the people from all the human kingdoms combined, and its sacred teachings managed to spread in the societies of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, the Church of the Holy Light acts as the most important religious institution within the Alliance, and therefore, has its own hierarchical structure to organize its activities and to take care of its followers through &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; serves as the main spiritual hub of the Church, and the home to the most powerful and influential holy leaders in the world. It is a sacred place for all followers of the Light from the four corners of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, having been described as an elegant and peaceful place, inviting for prayer and reflection.\nLeadership.\nThe Church of the Holy Light is led by an &lt;a href=\"Archbishop\"&gt;Archbishop&lt;/a&gt;, who acts as the representative of the institution in the Alliance. They embody the faith of the Light and the power of the Church for all its followers on Azeroth, acting as a symbol of hope during dark and difficult times. Only two archbishops are known so far, &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;, and his predecessor, the well-renowned Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt;s are the high-ranking members of the clergy entrusted with a position of authority in the Church. They do more than advise and assist the Archbishop, they also perform various functions, including the organization of ceremonies and masses, and the training of their apprentices as spiritual advisor and mentor. Some of them may occupy a political role in the court of the kings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"high%20priest\"&gt;high priest&lt;/a&gt;s are high-ranked members and senior priests in the clergy. These church representatives are notably present at &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Altarite%20Jesse%20Taylor\"&gt;High Priest Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, and once in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with the late &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt;. As the highest authority of the Church present in these places, they are mainly concerned with ensuring the activities and organization of the priests under their jurisdiction, in order to support the population and fulfill their spiritual duties.\nFollowing the betrayal of Benedictus, it is unknown who replaced him since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, although the latter's betrayal and death remain unknown to its members despite some accusations and rumors regarding Benedictus' ties to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. At least, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Laurena\"&gt;High Priestess Laurena&lt;/a&gt; appears to be in charge of the cathedral, replacing the late Archbishop in some of his functions.\nMembership.\nAll followers of the Holy Light are welcomed by the Church of the Holy Light. Mainly composed of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the Church has long welcomed dwarves and high elves, and in recent years, have started recruiting &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in its ranks. Although &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; have their own &lt;a href=\"Draenei%23Faith\"&gt;religious institutions&lt;/a&gt; centered on the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, some of their &lt;a href=\"anchorite\"&gt;anchorite&lt;/a&gt;s are present among the priests in the Cathedral of Light. Consequently, realms where the cult of the Light is predominant have their own clergy, notably in the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and once in the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the ranks of the Church, apprentices and novices are called &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s if they wish to become priests, and &lt;a href=\"squire\"&gt;squire&lt;/a&gt;s if they wish to become paladins.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s were mainly trained at the Cathedral of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the former main spiritual hub of the Church, or at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Old Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, a center for learning and enlightenment known as a proud bastion of Lordaeron's priesthood, and which served as a seminary and major training ground for paladins in training. Nowadays, they are mainly trained by their seniors at the &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;, or in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light%23Inhabitants\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, they are trained in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Hall of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;, a center of arcane and divine practice and study.\nDuring their formation, priests and paladins must learn to abnegate themselves through meditation, in order to become conduits for the Light and use its powers.\nDespite the Church's wishes to bolster its ranks, it understands the sacrifices needed to ensure the paladins serving it are worthy, thus requiring long training and several tests that could take their lives. After being deemed worthy, a paladin must go through a &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand%23Induction%20vows\"&gt;ceremony&lt;/a&gt; of induction to integrate the order. Thereafter, they continue to be trained by their master, in order to learn how to use their new &lt;a href=\"Holy\"&gt;holy powers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of their training, priest masters test their apprentices to see if they are worthy of wearing their first robes, as a sign that the Church approves and supports them, thus denoting their place in the clergy. When they become members of the clergy, priests can obtain the title of \"Brother\" and \"Sister\", while senior members may have the title of \"Father\". When they become members of the Silver Hand, paladins consider themselves to be \u201cbrothers\u201d and \u201csisters\u201d.\nRelations.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the influence of the Church was quite significant in the political affairs of the human kingdoms, enough for &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a place among the members of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;seven human nations&lt;/a&gt;. The Archbishop gave the Church's support to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and actively participated in their various meetings, his presence being accepted and respected by all the members of the council.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Church had reformed itself in the capital of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Like in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; before its &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt;, the Church has an important place in the politics of the kingdom, with notably &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20DeLavey\"&gt;Bishop DeLavey&lt;/a&gt; at the King's court to conduct various affairs, involving relations with the . The Church is supported by the population, and has a great popularity which manifests during festivals like the &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, when the crowd were eager to hear a speech from the Archbishop.\nThe Church maintains cordial relations with the other religious institutions in the Alliance, notably with the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, as their priests accepted to train &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; apprentices in the ways of the priesthood. Although they share the same faith, but in different &lt;a href=\"Draenei%23Faith\"&gt;institutions&lt;/a&gt;, the Church still agreed to train the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; paladin apprentices they received. The Church is in contact with all these organizations, so that the latters can contact their apprentices in training.\nAs it is the way of the divine to help those in need, notably the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Church sent them priests and paladins as reinforcements.\nHowever, the Church considered the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s for centuries, as they never have been fond of their methods, but let them continue to exist because they don't practice dark magic and are somewhere necessary. Some knights of the Silver Hand showed hostility for &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and all the others &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and mages, seeing them as damned souls, but also as an occasional and necessary evil, which they would do without at any other time. Despite this complicated relationship, the Church ended up helping the Kirin Tor during the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, hunting down the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; in the city, and during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Church of the Holy Light is a &lt;a href=\"lawful%20good\"&gt;lawful good&lt;/a&gt; organization affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that can be found just about everywhere on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and has approximately 800,000 members.\nHistory.\nNo one knows how the Church was founded, and no one remembers when people first discovered the Holy Light - or were discovered by it. In a time prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, humans began preaching about the Holy Light; explaining that it is a great and benevolent force that sought out mortal spirits interested in helping others and protecting life.\nBecause the philosophy involves a significant amount of study and contemplation, they likely built libraries before churches. As the organization grew, the places of teaching and study grew as well. Eventually, all of the individual churches began working together and formed the Church of the Holy Light.\nThe Church sends its people all over the world, spreading the wisdom and comfort of the Holy Light. They also do what they can to help people with more practical matters, from building homes to settling family disputes to scaring off enemies. It is all very noble, of course, but that fits with the Holy Light's teachings of making the world a better place and making oneself better by helping other people. The Church has everyone's best interests at heart, and the priest, paladins, and lay members do their best to help everyone. It is a &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; that is all about making people truly happy, not to mention a religion whose practitioners show clear evidence of divine blessing.\nEven those determined to doubt are forced to admit that the Light grants its followers impressive powers to combat the darkness. No one knows for sure the origin of the church. For that matter, no one knows when people first discovered the Holy Light \u2014 or were discovered by it \u2014 either. People started preaching the Light at some point, explaining how this great and benevolent force existed and sought out mortal spirits interested in helping others and protecting life in general.\nThe Holy Light is a strange philosophy because it doesn't involve reverence for a person \u2014 the Light is not a god, and virtuous activity in the soul is the sacrifice the Light demands of its followers, not wine or gold or such things that a being needs. There is also study and contemplation involved, particularly on how to make oneself a better person in order to commune with the Light more perfectly. The Church likely had libraries before they had temples, and the one simply grew out of the other. Eventually, all those churches unified and created the Church of the Holy Light.\nFor a long time, the Church was the dominant human religion. The followers of the Holy Light were everywhere, supporting civilizations, building cities, founding temples, and generally bringing light and hope and help to everyone. Then the First War began. And there were the members of the Church, right in the thick of things, using their Light-given gifts to hold back the Horde. It was impressive \u2014 awe-inspiring, really. Unfortunately (say some), most of the priests focused on defending people rather than taking the fight to the Horde. And there just weren\u2019t enough priests to go around. The leader of the Holy Order of Northshire Clerics during the war was Archbishop Alonsus Faol, and his apprentice was a devout lad named Uther. After the First War, Uther knew that that the Church needed to do more when the orcs came again \u2014 its people needed to stand up and fight instead of just healing and defending. They needed to go after the darkness and actively prevent it from harming anyone, rather than waiting for it to come to them. He issued a call to all the bravest knights to join his new order, the Knights of the Silver Hand, and thus the paladins were born. They saw their first battles in the Second War and were instrumental in the Alliance\u2019s victory.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, many remaining paladins who served the Silver Hand and now make their new home in Kalimdor are attempting to form a new Church, but the going is slow. As the study of the Holy Light was more of a philosophical pursuit than a faith, the destroyed Church resembled a library instead of a house of worship. Its texts were destroyed along with the Church, many of them burned, most of them buried in thousands of pounds of rubble. What with the wars, settling a new Alliance stronghold and dealing with frequent skirmishes, the remaining scholars and priests have found little time to work on transcribing old information into new books for initiates. Most young followers of the Holy Light learn by experience at the heel of a more experienced person instead of in libraries surrounded by texts.\nSome self-appointed sages are taking up the mantle of rewriting the pontifications on the Holy Light, but there is no regulation or overseer. There are fresh looks at old ideas, as well as old ideas copied word for word by diligent old priests with perfect memories. As one would expect, sometimes these scholars clash when someone realizes that the texts are beginning to contradict one another. There is tension within the church: Younger priests feel the Third War gave the Holy Light a chance to renew itself just as the Alliance was renewing itself on Kalimdor, while others demand to keep to old traditions.\nSecular citizens care little for the debates but prefer their rituals to remain the same. With everything around them changing, faith represents one of the few constants.\nSome claim that the Third War was the best thing that could have happened to the Church, and suggest that the Church take this opportunity to rebuild itself. They claimed that the Church had strayed from the path of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Virtues\"&gt;Three Virtues&lt;/a&gt; and needed to pare back down to essentials. According to these younger priests, their elders had lost touch with the Light and it was time to reclaim that holy communion.\nIt is said that the Church is finally organizing again and looking at all these texts for consistency and accuracy, but it's unknown if that's true. It is known that the Church is stronger than it's been in centuries. It's rebuilding, regaining ground, and speaking out against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and other evils.\nOrganization.\nThe Church has an archbishop which is in charge, and he has a council of &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt;s to advise him. Usually, the archbishop was a bishop himself before he was selected, and once he's been chosen he's in charge until he dies or chooses to step down. The bishops do more than advise the archbishop, of course. Each bishop has charge of a region, in some cases an entire continent. The regions are based more on population than area, so in some cases a bishop might only be responsible for a large city, while others have an entire countryside. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; has its own bishop, as does &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Priests work for the bishops, and they do most of the actual community work: preaching, tending to the wounded, teaching the children, and so on. They lay priests as well, who aren't ordained and cannot preach, but handle most of the daily chores around the temples and monasteries.\nThe Church of the Holy Light can only get so much through donations. In order to feed the priests, the religious institution has to make money. It has &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; all over the countryside, most of them housing monasteries, and the priests there raise crops and cattle and whatever else the Church needs, and sell the surplus. In some regions, the Church owns land and rents it to &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, or businessmen. They don't keep much of the profit, though \u2014 and the Church is always giving food, clothing and tools to the poor. It also teaches people about prayer, about health and farming, and generally how to be a good person.\nBefore the First War, the Church had three major locations: &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; in Azeroth's western countryside, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Light\"&gt;Temple of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind City. The Horde destroyed Northshire Abbey in the First War, tearing it apart and burning the rubble. The Temple of Light fell with the rest of Stratholme to the Scourge. Only the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; remains, and this has become the Church's headquarters. A grand structure with many wings and spires, the Cathedral houses Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;, the bishop of Stormwind City, and various other priests. It also contains the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Chamber\"&gt;Grand Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, a vast meeting room where the council of bishops meets with the archbishop to discuss issues and plot the Church's actions. The Northshire Abbey was later rebuilt, but is only an outpost of the Cathedral of Light.\nMembership.\nAnyone can follow the path of the Holy Light, and anyone who follows the Holy Light is welcomed by the Church. Most of its members are human, but the Church does not discriminate. &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have long been members.\nThough anyone can become a member of the Church, becoming an actual priest is a long and difficult process. First come various classes, taught by lay priests, all about the Church's history, principles, and activities. If the applicant does well in class he graduates to the next level, taking personal instruction with a priest, learning prayers and other devotions. Most applicants become lay priests, working for the Church while studying. They can spend several years in instruction, until the priest feels they're ready. Then there's an audience with the bishop, and a stay in one of the Church's monasteries \u2014 several months to several years away from everyone except other faithful. During this time many of them experience true communion with the Light for the first time. If the applicant maintains his faith and still seems suitable, the monastery's head priest sponsors him for ordination. Once a priest is ordained, his life belongs to the Church. The council decides where he goes and what he will do, whether that's working a farm or preaching in a city. Most priests stay with the Church until they die, though as they get older they do more studious and clerical work and less physical labor. A few lose faith and break away, forsaking their vows. Those who do stay, and who distinguish themselves spiritually and politically, can rise through the ranks and eventually become a bishop.\nOne might expect from a priest of the Church of the Holy Light that they ensure the role of &lt;a href=\"confessor\"&gt;confessor&lt;/a&gt; and moral support.\nAfter the Second War, the Church of the Holy Light had very few members \u2014 in large part because so many died in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and most temples had a single priest or were actually shut down. People have begun applying again since the Third War, however, and now the temples are all fully staffed again.\nLeadership.\nThe council has many bishops, though naturally not all of them can attend every meeting. Many handle their own regions well but are quiet during meetings, expressing opinions with nods or frowns and voting without a word. Others are more boisterous, more aggressive, and more political. Three of these have formed their own power bases within the council, and they and the archbishop are the true powers of the Church \u2014 some might say the three bishops are the power, and the archbishop dances desperately among them, attempting to prevent a schism.\nThe Three Virtues.\nThe philosophy of the Holy Light boils down to the three teachings, called the Three Virtues. These virtues \u2014 respect, tenacity, and compassion \u2014 are each defined into a principle and a lesson.\nThe first virtue taught is respect. While the Holy Light teaches that awareness of the self and the universe is a goal, one must also see the connection between others and the universe. Destroying other's happiness and severing other's connections with the universe is not serving the world's well being, and therefore not your own. The practitioners of the Holy Light are not naive, however, and understand that trial, conflict, war, and suffering do happen; but they strive to make the universe a better place in spite of these hindrances.\nThe second virtue is tenacity. The adherence to this virtue is, incidentally, the part of training under the Holy Light that weeds out the unfaithful, as true dedication takes years. Fresh-faced acolytes often lose hope and the true meaning of the Holy Light when they realize that it takes a lifetime to serve the philosophy. The world is much bigger than one lone soul; and while the world can change a soul in a day, it takes much more time to change the world. Only through tenacity can a servant of the Holy Light hope to affect the universe. If some young students feel like this is an impossible task, others take heart in the realization that if you truly believe there is a connection between the self and the universe, one cannot help but affect the other, no matter the size. Affecting the world can include anything from teaching and instilling hope in others to joining with other like-minded individuals to work together to create a bigger change.\nAfter the first two concepts are mastered, the student can take on the final virtue: compassion. The connection between the self and the universe is strong, but it still is only one connection. If a follower of the Light serves another to increase his happiness, his bond with the universe grows stronger. The happiness he receives by helping someone also strengthens himself and the universe, and he is able to affect the universe even more.\nCompassion is perhaps the most powerful \u2014 and yet most dangerous \u2014 virtue. \nIf someone is too compassionate, he can give help where none is needed \u2014 or wanted. This oversight can hinder one's growth and happiness. For example, one may help another with a seemingly impossible quest, when such a quest is not actually out of the abilities of the one making the attempt. Thus, Compassion (however well-intentioned) has resulted in that person's inability to grow as the quest was essentially \"done for them\", hindering their growth and happiness.\nSome helpers can be awkward and do more harm than good with their actions, increasing the suffering and unhappiness in the world. A well-meaning follower of the Light may rush to the aid of an adventurer(s) and wind up gaining too much interest of those attacking, and thus force those they try to help to rush to the follower's aid.\nThis is why compassion is taught last; only the wise and those fully understanding compassion may identify who is truly in need and who can grow on their own.\nInspirations.\nThe religion and culture of the Church of the Holy Light and its branches are loosely based on Christianity, especially through the use of specific titles (e.g. ). However, the absence of a \"Pope\" or \"Patriarch\", as the highest rank being Archbishop, and the presence of women clerics lends itself to being based upon the hierarchy of ."}

It was, along with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Ring of Trials&lt;/a&gt; arena, added in \"\" and thus among the first arenas added to the game. Unlike most arenas, Circle of Blood can be accessed in the outdoor world in addition to its instanced version, serving as a &lt;a href=\"PvA\"&gt;PvA&lt;/a&gt; arena. The arena is ogre-styled.\nThe arena received multiple updates, the latest and most substantial one in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.1.5\"&gt;patch 7.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, improving its visuals while mostly retaining the layout.\nArena layout.\nThis arena is rectangular shaped. The starting areas for both sides are on opposite corners. A bridge spans the middle of the arena with ramps on both ends. Under the bridge is a pit and 2 pillars. Deceased players may watch the fight from the pit. In addition, at the middle of the bridge there are two additional ramps.\nLike all arenas, after five minutes, two &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Sight\"&gt;Shadow Sight&lt;/a&gt; power ups appears, on the side of the middle ramps, that let the user see stealthed and invisible characters; however, it also increases the damage taken by 5%.\nLayout history.\nThe arena has received multiple layout updates since its addition to the game.\nPatch 2.0 - Patch 2.4.3.\nThe original version of the arena featured two platforms next on each side of the bridge which could be reached by jumping or running across the ropes leading from the bridge to them. The platforms had a number of spikes positioned upwards from the bottom of them. Moreover, it was also possible to, at ground floor, completely circle a number of the poles at the ends of bridge.\nPatch 3.0 - Patch 5.3.\nThe platforms at the middle of the bridge had a number of spikes removed, making circling them easier. Additionally, the poles supporting the bridge near the ramps were repositioned slightly such that none of them were possible to completely circle around, removing a number of player accessible spots providing line of sight protection from enemies.\nPatch 5.4 - Patch 7.1.\nIn this version of the arena, the platforms and rope at the middle of the ramps were replaced by ramps, similar to the ones already present in previous versions at each side of the bridge. The &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Sight\"&gt;Shadow Sight&lt;/a&gt; spawn locations were moved from the removed platforms to an area at ground level right below the new ramps at the middle of the bridge. \nPatch 7.1.5 - Now.\nThe visuals were changed with the lighting made darker with lanterns emitting a dark orange light. In this version, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt; sits atop a throne overseeing the arena. He will taunt players with special voice lines, encouraging them to kill each other. A &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Drake%20%28Blade%27s%20Edge%20Arena%29\"&gt;Nether Drake&lt;/a&gt; can be seen flying over the arena.\nMoreover, the bridge has been slightly widened and lowered, allowing for less space between the ground floor and the bridge. While still closely resembling the previous version of the arena, most areas are slightly larger or smaller than previously, although no new trick locations, e.g., player accessible areas providing line of sight, were added or removed."}

Considered one of Azeroth's perfect predators, these agile beasts can sprint through dense forests without making a sound. The moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; made them silver and black so they could meld into the shadows on a moonlit night. When a night elf's mount perishes, it is custom for the rider to keep one of the saber's great fangs as a token of remembrance. If the reverse occurs and a nightsaber's rider dies, the cat will spend time in mourning and shed tears for their fallen rider.\nBefore they were domesticated by the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; Army and trained as mounts, Kalimdor's savage nightsaber panthers were considered to be among the continent's most vicious inhabitants. While many of these grand predatory beasts still prowl the dusky shores and forests of the night elves' homeland, the finest pedigrees of the species, recognized by their superior swiftness and agility, now serve a more practical purpose for those skilled enough to ride them. The connection between a nightsaber and its &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"huntress\"&gt;huntress&lt;/a&gt; is nearly inseparable.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; has compared riding one to be similar to a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; on the ground, but with a smoother gait.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostsaber\"&gt;Frostsaber&lt;/a&gt;s are very long-lived. &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande's mount, has lived for over 10,000 years, and &lt;a href=\"Shy-Rotam\"&gt;Shy-Rotam&lt;/a&gt;, the frostsaber queen, for at least 4,000. Whether this applies to nightsabers too is unknown.\nNight elves once believed that seeing the light-colored &lt;a href=\"Striped%20Dawnsaber\"&gt;dawnsaber&lt;/a&gt; breed in the wild was an ill omen. Some historians claim that the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Mistsaber\"&gt;mistsaber's&lt;/a&gt; misty grey coat is the result of ancient &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; experiments conducted on nightsabers. Rumor has it that the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Stormsaber\"&gt;stormsaber breed&lt;/a&gt; was named after the renowned archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Like their distant nightsaber cousins, &lt;a href=\"Black%20War%20Tiger\"&gt;tigers&lt;/a&gt; are renowned for their razor-sharp claws, incredible agility, and love of being scratched behind the ears. &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Moonsaber\"&gt;Moonsabers&lt;/a&gt; come in pearl-bright color and are revered by many night elves because their shimmering coats symbolize Elune.\nIn the RPG.\nNightsabers are the traditional mounts of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and about as common among the elves as a riding &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; might be in a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; city. Also known as a nightsaber cats or nightsaber panthers. In combat, a nightsaber cat is a deadly foe, leaping from the shadows to rend its foes with its fangs and claws."}

The convergence of &lt;a href=\"Ley%20line\"&gt;ley lines&lt;/a&gt; is what feeds its great power. The fount was created and is sustained through the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, it permeates and empowers the elves who dwell in its vicinity. &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt; is the method by which the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; imbibe the Nightwell's energies, and the palace rations it to control the populace. Being unable to feed off the Nightwell's energies causes heavy withdrawal symptoms. Banishment from &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; is thus the harshest punishment in nightborne society, as exiles are cut off from the Nightwell's power and faced with degeneration, first into &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, and in time into a &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; state, a point of no return. According to &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightwell's power rivaled even that of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the defeat of atop the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; was secured by the Kirin Tor. Without it, the well became unstable. Valtrois suggested attempting to stabilize it, even though the nightborne no longer needed it to sustain themselves, so that they could use its power, but &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; believed it was best for the nightborne people to leave it behind them and let it die, a decision met with approval by both &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, who believed that Nightwell's power and allure would fade, with time.\nHistory.\nWhen the city faced starvation, this source of power would become more than a font for magical spells and works, it would become the principal source of nourishment in place of the exhausted food supplies. Crimes in the city were punished by exile, and thus those exiled would suffer the horrible fate. The effects manifest as immense pain and hungering need to feed off Arcane energy. Exile would deny any access to &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt; resulting in starvation, deterioration, and, after a period of time, to the mindless Nightfallen second stage of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nightwell is the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; elves' great source of power, and through it they have been able to meet the majority of their essential needs and maintain a refuge, shielded and hidden from the rest of the world they believed was overrun by demons. The energies of the Nightwell would alter their night elven forms further, becoming more slender and darker toned than previous, and causing the well would to be a necessary source of nourishment.\nThe fruit of the &lt;a href=\"Arcan%27dor\"&gt;Arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; frees the Nightborne of this addiction, even allowing Nightfallen to return to their previous states. After this discovery, Thalyssra begins to hand out the fruit to those she can, freeing her people of their terrible curse. Ultimately, with the Arcan'dor at their disposal, Thalyssra becomes the new leader of the Nightborne after Elisande's defeat in the Nighthold. She uses it to remove the addiction, and allows the Nightwell to burn out, as it had begun to dwindle without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, which had been brought to Dalaran."}

The titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, former friend and student of Sargeras, approached the fallen champion, unarmed, thinking that he could still be reasoned with. But Sargeras was already set in his ways, and nothing the Pantheon said could ever change his mind, and so, with a howl of rage and sorrow, Sargeras struck Aggramar with his ruined blade, the sword nearly cleaving the titan in two. Outraged, the Pantheon launched an all-out assault on Sargeras and his Legion. Stars withered and died as the battle raged across the cosmos, and Nihilam, known thereafter as the \"Doom World\", became twisted and scarred by the apocalyptic conflict.\nThe battle only came to a close once Sargeras had ended the lives of every member of the Pantheon with a gigantic storm of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. Sargeras declared his Burning Legion victorious and set off to find the powerful &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, unaware that the titan &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; had managed to launch the spirits of the Pantheon out through the Great Dark to temporarily escape the destruction of their bodies.\nThe war between the Pantheon and the Legion shook the fabric of creation around the Doom World and infused its metal ores with otherworldly properties. The metals became nearly indestructible, and when viewed in just the right light, the materials reflected brief images of the battle between Sargeras and the Pantheon. Most important of all, the metals also leeched away the essence of any living thing that touched them. The &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; smith &lt;a href=\"Netrezaar\"&gt;Netrezaar&lt;/a&gt; used these metals to create his life's work, the massive axe known as the &lt;a href=\"%3AMaw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;:Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, demons poured out of a portal from Nihilam to Azeroth opened by &lt;a href=\"Balaadur\"&gt;Balaadur&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, implying that the planet is now under Legion control."}

The eggs are a symbol of fertility and an excellent way to bring everyone into the spirit, don't you think?\nNo other holiday matches the feasting and drinking of Brewfest!\nTo celebrate the birth of yet another deadly enemy is an odd thing, to say the least. Still, we will join our allies in their festivities.\nDuring the Day of the Dead, people gather in graveyards to celebrate with and cherish the spirits of those they have lost.\nYou can find the festivities in the cemeteries of any major city, where you'll be able to cook, dance, don costumes, and more.\nThe younger races make a big fuss over Winter Veil.

There you were allowed entry into the Heart of the Forest. With many of Ardenweald's souls in attendance, you received the boon of Soulshape, the first of many gifts granted to those who join the covenant. You then learned that you had an important tradition to uphold: your grand introduction!\nWith the assistance of some friends, and a little bit of magic, you starred in a stage production recreating the dramatic events on Azeroth which led up to your arrival in the Shadowlands. Your performance impressed not only the Court of Night, but the Winter Queen as well. \nYsera, who was in the audience, learned that what she had thought were dreams and nightmares were visions of events on Azeroth. As she bore you to the Heart of the Forest, Ysera confided that she had also dreamed of Tyrande Whisperwind becoming the Night Warrior, and that she was concerned for the futures of both Tyrande and Ardenweald.\nNow properly introduced to the Night Fae, you were formally bound to their covenant in a ceremony presided by the Winter Queen.\nHighlord Bolvar Fordragon sent you into Torghast, Tower of the Damned to rescue Baine Bloodhoof from the clutches of Warden Arkoban.\nWith Baine safe in Oribos, you returned to Torghast with one of the Warden's keys to plunge further into the tower's depths. Your search brought you to a mysterious prisoner known as the Runecarver.\nYou recovered one of the Runecarver's memories from the Maw, then worked with Ve'nari to free one of his bonds. In exchange, the Runecarver has offered to help you craft powerful armor.\nYou returned to the Maw, where you reunited with the broker Ve'nari. By accepting the terms of her agreement, you procured a Soulkeeper crystal that allowed you to bring several lost souls out of the Maw. You also discovered that Baine Bloodhoof is being held prisoner in Torghast, the Tower of the Damned, but that you will need a plan of action before you can attempt to rescue him.\nAfter you brought the rescued souls back to Ardenweald, you learned more about the Heart of the Forest and the powers that lie dormant within its roots. You were also granted the boon of Soulbinding and bound yourself to Niya.\nDaughter of the Night Warrior.\nYsera asked you to meet Shandris Feathermoon in Oribos and help her recover Tyrande Whisperwind from the Maw. You aided Shandris in tracking down Tyrande, whose Night Warrior powers had allowed her to carve a path of destruction through the Jailer's forces but also threatened to tear her apart. \nThe two of you followed Tyrande into Torghast. There, you witnessed the awesome power of the Night Warrior and rescued many captive kaldorei souls. Tyrande refused to return with you and Shandris, saying she would not stop until she had slain Sylvanas.\nYou returned to Ardenweald, where the souls you had freed would find peace. Ysera and Shandris vowed to find a way to save Tyrande from the all-consuming power of the Night Warrior.\nDa Boss.\nYou joined forces with Bwonsamdi to investigate the strange disappearances of several powerful nature spirits within Ardenweald. During your search, you uncovered a secret plot by the death loa Mueh'zala to awaken the evil loa Dambala and Hakkar into his service.\nRealizing that he had no choice but to stand against his master, Bwonsamdi asked you to beseech the Winter Queen for her aid. Upon hearing of Mueh'zala's treachery, the Queen dispatched the Wild Hunt to rid the forest of Mueh'zala's minions. Fighting alongside your fellow huntsmen and huntresses, you defeated Dambala and drove Mueh'zala's followers out of Ardenweald.\nNight Warrior's Curse.\nYsera told you of Thiernax, a mortal soul in Ardenweald who had been his world's Night Warrior in life. You met Thiernax and learned that the tremendous power of the Night Warrior had killed both him and his husband, Qadarin. While fighting malicious spriggan in the Garden of Night, Qadarin was afflicted with a terrible curse.\nMoonberry had you retrieve information on how to counter the curse while Qadarin could still be saved. Following the scroll's instructions, you acquired what was needed--including a token that symbolized the deep love between Ysera and her sister, Alexstrasza--and broke the curse on Qadarin. Grateful for your help, Thiernax pledged his support to help save Tyrande from the tragic fate of the Night Warrior.\nDrust to Drust.\nYou helped Ara'lon rescue Gweyir, a Possessed huntress, and were sent to Drustvar in search of a way to break the curse placed upon her. You returned with a powerful Drust fetish and instructions to seek out Kivarr, an ancient Thornspeaker.\nYour search for Kivarr led you to Eventide Grove, where the Drust had taken her captive. Following her rescue, Kivarr sent you and Ara'lon to find special reagents for a ritual to break the curse. Unfortunately, Ara'lon never returned and you were sent to fulfill the mission in his place.\nThough you and Kivarr performed the ritual, you were unable to break the curse. Gweyir perished, proving that there is no coming back for the fae who fall under the Drust's thrall.\nThe Horned Hunter.\nThiernax shared with you a possible way to save Tyrande from the fate of the Night Warrior: dispersing its power into other former Night Warriors whose souls now rested in the Shadowlands. To find them, Lord Herne of the Wild Hunt suggested you seek the famed Horned Hunter, Huln Highmountain.\nHuln agreed to help you search the Shadowlands for the other Night Warriors, but he first had to finish hunting his assigned quarry. You assisted Huln in tracking down a massive devourer, a worldeater named Voras. You and Huln set a trap for your prey and then vanquished it. True to his word, Huln began his search for others who had once borne the mantle of the Night Warrior.\nDeal for a Loa.\nAt his necropolis in Nazmir, Bwonsamdi revealed to both you and Vol'jin that Mueh'zala was the one who had tricked Vol'jin into naming Sylvanas warchief and that he had cast an ancient nature spirit into the Maw.\nWith Vol'jin's help, you rescued not just the spirit--the wild god Ashamane--but the loa Hir'eek and Shadra as well. You also found Rezan, but were too late to save him. The loa of kings transferred the last of his essence into Vol'jin.\nUpon your return, the Winter Queen was intrigued that Vol'jin's mortal soul held the remnants of a loa. Though she could not guarantee what fate awaited him, the Queen allowed Vol'jin to slumber within a wildseed alongside the other spirits.\nDrust and Ashes.\nAlongside the Wild Hunt, you assaulted the last Drust stronghold in Ardenweald and faced off against their leader, Gorak Zhar. But when the final blow was struck, you learned that you had been fighting a possessed and glamoured Ara'lon. With his last breath, Ara'lon warned you that the stronghold was a diversion and that the Drust's true target was the Grove of Awakening.\nYsera bore you back to the Heart of the Forest as she inflicted everlasting sleep on as much of the Drust army as she could. Moved by the loss of yet another loyal servant, the Winter Queen brought her precious power to bear. Bolstered by the Queen's blessing, you reclaimed the Grove of Awakening and defeated Gorak Zhar, ending her attempts to conquer Ardenweald."}

As the Night Warrior, Elune is said to take the valiant dead from the battlefield and set them riding across the evening sky as stars for their reward.\nIt is also the name given to the person who channels Elune's Night Warrior powers in a ritual to become the avatar of the Night Warrior. This is extremely dangerous, and even witnessing the ritual can be a danger.\nHistory.\nThe oldest known Night Warrior was &lt;a href=\"Thiernax\"&gt;Thiernax&lt;/a&gt;, who lived on the &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fyzandi\"&gt;Fyzandi&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, their planet was attacked by an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;. The Old God and its minions waged war on the people of Fyzandi for generations, starting in the era of Thiernax and his husband &lt;a href=\"Qadarin\"&gt;Qadarin&lt;/a&gt;'s great-grandparents: this conflict became known as the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20War\"&gt;Endless War&lt;/a&gt;. Qadarin's mother attempted to become the Night Warrior to stop it, but the power killed her. Thiernax underwent the ritual as well and managed to obtain the power to defeat the Old God, saving their world. However, the power of the Night Warrior was destroying him; though he attempted to share the power with his husband, Qadarin, the end result was that it killed them both.\nLegend says that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to secure &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. For thousands of years thereafter, none who attempted the ritual survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; became the first night elf known to survive the ritual. The process empowered many other night elves as well, forming the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Black%20Moon\"&gt;Army of the Black Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Elune's power also shrouded &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; in an unnatural, permanent night.\nThough Tyrande held onto the power of the Night Warrior far longer than anyone expected, it was clear that she too would eventually succumb. At the request of &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; gathered together the souls of several former Night Warriors in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;. They performed a ritual to divide the Night Warrior's power between them all, though even that appeared insufficient until the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; herself intervened, prompting Elune to possess Tyrande directly. When asked to relieve Tyrande of her power, Elune replied that as Tyrande invoked it, she must also be the one to give it up. Letting go of her desire for vengeance, Tyrande relinquished the Night Warrior's power and returned to her normal self, becoming the only known mortal to survive becoming the Night Warrior.\nKnown Night Warriors.\nAs the worship of Elune is not limited to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, people from other worlds also became Night Warriors. Having been consumed by the power they wielded, they are now found among the forces of the Shadowlands:\nNight Warrior's Phases.\nNight Warrior's Phases of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Individual members are referred to as Watchers, Night Watchers, or Watchmen. They have their own office in Darkshire.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance, the political manipulations of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to pull all their troops out of Duskwood. Left to fend for themselves, the Night Watch was established to defend against the various threats that plagued the town. Formed and trained entirely by the people of the forest; they had to contend with marauding &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. They were involved in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abercrombie\"&gt;Abercrombie&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt;; as well as the manhunt for the murderer &lt;a href=\"Stalvan%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Stalvan Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kardan\"&gt;Kardan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voldana\"&gt;Voldana&lt;/a&gt; visited a house near the town of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; only to be attacked by &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Dodds\"&gt;Watcher Dodds&lt;/a&gt; and his group of night watchers killed the ghouls and accompanied them to Darkshire in order to get more information about their mother, &lt;a href=\"Adena\"&gt;Adena&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;. The commander told them that Adena was dead and Dodds took them to Adena's grave in Raven Hill. While they were heading there, the group saw undead who were heading to Darkshire. Dodds told the twins what direction they need to continue and he himself returned to warn Althea about the approaching undead. Dodds returned shortly after with his men only to find those undead battling with the twins group.\nDark Riders.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Archmage Karlain&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Darkshire in search of his son &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;. The watchers he questioned revealed that the young man had recently been in the town, questioning everyone he could about the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, until he disappeared once more while investigating his leads. Commander Althea Ebonlocke later led a small group of night watchers in an ambush against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;. When one of the riders teleported the group into &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, they continued the battle with the Riders and &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt; found an amulet and sent the watchers back in time before the ambush.\nCataclysm.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a number of townsfolk were complaining about someone nailing disturbing letters to their doors in the middle of the nights. While the culprit could not be identified, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Council of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult were trying to recruit the citizens with their notes. As such, the mayor was notified of the situation and the Night Watch was placed on high alert by &lt;a href=\"Role%20Dreuger\"&gt;Role Dreuger&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s forces were so taxed by &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;greater evils&lt;/a&gt; that they couldn't spare a single &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footman&lt;/a&gt; to protect Darkshire. However, many &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were later ordered by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to report to &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, as the Night Watch forces were stretched thin defending against marauding wolves and bands of wild &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. Althea also sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Bailiff%20Conacher\"&gt;Bailiff Conacher&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; for more reinforcements.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and some of the Night Watchers in Darkshire betrayed the Alliance and joined the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt; on promises of freedom and respect from &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;the Herald&lt;/a&gt;, placing the town under strict watch while demonic rituals were carried out using the blood and skulls of Darkshire's population. Among the loyal watchers, &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Watcher Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; could be seen protecting several citizens and mentioned that the defection of her comrades was certainly due to dark magic.\nWatchers outside of Darkshire seemingly did not join the cult, as a &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Guard\"&gt;Vigilant Guard&lt;/a&gt; was found dead within &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;, showing that not all elements of the Watch managed to get corrupted. &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Danuser\"&gt;Watcher Danuser&lt;/a&gt; could also be found as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, still calling himself a Night Watchman as well as using the group's title and speaking about his active duty as a watcher.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; became the new commander of the watch.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;human necromancer&lt;/a&gt; stole the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an artifact used to keep Duskwood's undead in check\u2014from &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;Forlorn Rowe&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to overwhelm the region with an undead army. Her minions attacked Commander Ladimore as well as &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;, killing and raising several of the watchers there and forcing the rest to escape to Darkshire. &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Cutford\"&gt;Watcher Cutford&lt;/a&gt; watched over the ailing commander when &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to Duskwood for a treasure hunt, set out to stop the necromancer and steal back the torch. Together they managed to purify the artifact and kill the sorceress before returning the torch to Forlorn Rowe, thereby preventing Duskwood from falling to the undead. Afterward, Shaw told Ladimore that he recommended doubling patrols and keeping a close eye on the artifact. He also promised to send extra guards from Stormwind to help, as the necromancer had hinted that the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;threat was not over&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore he and Flynn left Duskwood, Shaw gave the Night Watch Flynn's treasure map, and the watchers returned with the treasure\u2014a hand mirror\u2014as a gift to the two rogues.\nDragonflight.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Night Watch was still active in Duskwood. After twenty years of service, &lt;a href=\"Korston%20Willard\"&gt;Korston Willard&lt;/a&gt; decided to resign and joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; for the sake of adventure and a bit of sun.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Night Watch Militia (or just the Night Watch) is a &lt;a href=\"militia\"&gt;militia&lt;/a&gt; created by the people of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;. The townsfolk are so desperate to rid themselves of their many woes that crime has relatively ceased. While they may fear theft or murder from those passing through, the community has banded together behind the mayor &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ello%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Lord Ello Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, and the Night Watch. The mayor's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;, runs the militia. This small police force constitutes the town's only defense against the monsters that frequently attack it.\nNight Watch units move deftly and swiftly through &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. The crafty &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s stalk their &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; prey, avoiding direct confrontation with supernatural and mundane opponents. The carefully placed tracks of a member of the Night Watch militia typically lead pursuers into a deadly ambush where eager warriors wait with bows ready. Multiple units often work together under the direction of Commander Althea. She has yet to earn the respect of many of the militia. Well known for her keen and decisive orders in the field, however, she is will on the road to gaining the Night Watch's trust.\nCaptain &lt;a href=\"Helvas%20Grange\"&gt;Helvas Grange&lt;/a&gt; commands a small unit of Night Watch &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s bless the arrows of the militia; thus, improving them when battling undead.\nSpeculation.\nIt is unclear what exactly motivated the change of allegiance that turned the Night Watch into the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Watcher Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; speaks of dark magic being at play, suggesting the Watchers have lost themselves to &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;demonic corruption&lt;/a&gt;. Further to this, Ladimore mentions the Night Watch believed the lies of &lt;a href=\"Melris%20Malagan\"&gt;the Herald&lt;/a&gt;, which according to &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; consisted of promises of freedom and respect, though what these two things entailed is unknown.\nIt can be speculated that due to the years of neglect from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the Herald may have persuaded the Night Watch to take the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in rebelling for their independence from Stormwind."}

These then-immortal beings were among the first to study magic and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The founders of a &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;magical and advanced civilization&lt;/a&gt; which at its peak spanned the breadth of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves came into a horrific conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; but achieved a Pyrrhic victory that ended in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, turning Kalimdor's landmass into the continents of the present age. The devastation wrought by the chain of events birthed in conceit caused a wholesale shift in direction. Until very recently, the night elves abandoned and completely outlawed the use of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, fearing its use would draw the Legion back to their world. \nThe main survivors of the Sundering crafted a radically different society centered around &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;, striving to live in harmony and co-existence with nature and its inhabitants, and essentially becoming \"venerable guardians\" of the natural world as well as the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; instead of ruling most of Azeroth as its foremost superpower, in addition reconnecting with the widespread worship of their moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of their leaders &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves established their newest capital &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; in the boughs of the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; off the coasts of northwestern Kalimdor in recent times, where it stood as a living symbol of the night elves' rich culture and glorious history. \nThe far-reaching and ancient legacy of the night elves shaped them into a race of very self-sufficient and self-conscious individuals, who often display strong streaks of isolationism and eons of accumulated ancient &lt;a href=\"Icon%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves ended a long period of seclusion referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Vigil\"&gt;Long Vigil&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, standing with refugees from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. They then began to associate themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, at least partly in response to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s continued presence in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEmergence of the night elves.\nAround 15,000 years ago a tribe of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s unconcerned by the battles for land and power and longing for a peaceful connection to the world, came to settle near the translucent waters of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the prime source of all magic on the planet. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected this nocturnal and independent tribe, suffusing their flesh and bones, elevating their forms to match their graceful spirits. They transformed into highly intelligent and virtually &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt; beings. Their skin turned various shades of violet, and they grew stronger and taller in stature. The tribe gradually abandoned their ancient heritage and tradition. The mystics began worshiping the moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, who they believed slumbered within the fount's depth during daylight hours. The former trolls also discovered the name \"Kalimdor\" and other titan-forged words from communing with Elune and investigating strange artifacts scattered around the Well's periphery. They adopted the name kaldorei, which meant \"children of the stars\" in their native tongue.\nThe early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity, driven to plumb its untold secrets and power. As their society grew, the night elves explored the breadth of Kalimdor and encountered its myriad denizens. The trees, flowers, and woodland creatures watched the night elves flourish, whispering news of them to the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. In time, the night elves' curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, not the least of which was &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty demigod of the primordial forestlands. The great-hearted Cenarius grew fond of the inquisitive night elves, claiming kinship with their race and spending a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. Cenarius adored the night elves and believed they had the potential to become great caretakers of nature. He befriended the fledgling race and taught them about the natural world. It was Cenarius' hope that the night elves would strive to live in harmony with the wilds. Some night elves were so transformed by the teachings of the demigod that they never left his realm, choosing to remain by Cenarius' side as his defenders. These few would cease to be elves and became woodland guardians physically altered forever.\nThe tranquil kaldorei developed a strong empathy for the living forests of Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature. This grew alongside their curiosity of the Well and their continuous draw to its arcane essence. For many centuries, the night elves lived in harmony and balance with the world and their natural affinity for the arcane. They built a graceful society around the Well of Eternity and the capital of their small nation &lt;a href=\"Elun%27dris\"&gt;Elun'dris&lt;/a&gt; or \"the Eye of Elune\" sat on the shores of the font of power, where they continued uncovering the secrets of the Well and honing their ties with the surrounding woodlands and their myriad inhabitants. The only creatures that gave them pause were the ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Though the great serpentine beasts were often reclusive, they did much to safeguard the known lands from potential threats. The night elves believed that the dragons held themselves to be the protectors of the world, and that they and their secrets were best left alone. Cenarius guided the night elves when necessary, pleased by the wisdom and benevolence that thrummed in their hearts.\nRise of the Kaldorei Empire.\n \nIn time, many of the night elves yearned for a different life, drawn to the arcane, they became obsessed with unlocking the Well of Eternity's secrets. They rigorously studied the fount's arcane energies becoming learned sorcerers. They harnessed the powers of the arcane lake and constructed wondrous temples and roadways around it. Magic became an inseparable part of life as the night elves reveled in the power at their fingertips. Pushing the boundaries of their intellect became the driving force of their culture. It was during this era of unprecedented growth that &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; came to power. She was adored by night elves of every social standing, seemingly immune to the ire the lower castes developed against some of their &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; nobles. The elves were so enamored with her that they renamed their wondrous capital &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, or \"the Glory of Azshara\". Sharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara pushed the educated Highborne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. The Highborne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly.\nThe night elf empire then started their rise to power by defeating the nearby troll tribes. Against their enemies, the kaldorei used overwhelming military power, their armies supported by Elune's blessings. The night elves' greatest soldiers were bestowed the goddess' fury through dangerous rituals, and these Night Warriors secured Kalimdor for the empire.\nThe empire saw the creation of such marvelous wonders that Azeroth would never see its like again, even in the modern age. Expeditionary forces, too, would be sent to explore and spread the empire's borders, bringing back tales of far-away lands and races. \nBut only the openly hostile &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; nations drew the full attention of the elves. Despite their battles with the trolls, the night elves had built up the mighty &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; that expanded rapidly across Kalimdor. Not since the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; in ages past had a territory grown so vast in size and scope. The immense influence Azshara held over the world and its denizens eclipsed even &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s wildest dreams of power. Empowered by the Well and wielding fierce magics never before imagined by the trolls, the night elves soon threatened the two greatest empires on Azeroth: the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elves systematically dismantled the troll's defenses and supply chains. Unable to counter the elves' destructive magics, the trolls buckled under the onslaught. The territories of the Gurubashi and Amani empires fragmented within only a few years. The elves however were not interested in more conquest. In the eyes of Queen Azshara, the trolls were a minor nuisance, their battle lust a symptom of primitive and unenlightened minds. Ultimately, the queen struck an accord with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, which held immense influence over all other trolls. In exchange for ending troll incursions into night elf territory, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; would be allowed to keep the sacred &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Mountains\"&gt;Zandalar Mountains&lt;/a&gt; south of the Well of Eternity. Fully aware they stood no chance against their enemies' arcane powers, the trolls begrudgingly agreed. The night elves' shockingly quick victory and the trolls' shameful acquiescence fostered the trolls' deep resentment and eternal hatred toward night elves, lasting to this very day.\nYet, as the seemingly endless ages passed, the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;night elves' civilization&lt;/a&gt; expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; built an &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;immense, wondrous palace&lt;/a&gt; on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls. There the most powerful nobles, whom she called the Quel'dorei or \"&lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their lower-caste brethren. The leaders of regions in the night elf empire were called prince/princess, such as &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey continued developing the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies to great heights and power not wielded before. Azshara believed the night elves so far had only tapped a small portion of its power. As their reckless experiments progressed, the Highborne found that they could wield the cosmic powers of the universe to either create or destroy with devastating effect at their leisure. Although they agreed that &lt;a href=\"arcane%20magic\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt; was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her Highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon performing increasingly dangerous experiments causing waves of arcane energy cascading into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from such abuse. Cenarius had watched the night elf empire expand with growing unease. Year by year, he became increasingly frustrated with the hubris and thoughtless actions of the sorcerous Highborne. The majority of night elf society continued honoring the old ways of revering the wilds. The fact that these folk still lived in harmony with the land alongside their great magical advancement warmed Cenarius' heart, but he knew that they had no influence over Azshara and her arrogant followers whose regard for living in harmony lessened as their power and arrogance grew. As time passed, the night elves began eschewing diplomacy and largely ignored Azeroth's other cultures. Azshara's dogmatic beliefs regarding racial purity seeped into the night elves' psyche, creating an atmosphere rife with xenophobia. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThus began the &lt;a href=\"Elf%23Racial%20history\"&gt;corruption of the elves&lt;/a&gt;. As their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the Highborne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted Highborne priests. The &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, long-time allies of the night elf people, saw this change overcoming the night elves and decided to sever all ties.\nBefore they left, the pandaren decided to offer the Highborne a gift, a chest of pandaren design, said to contain all the arcane magic they would ever need. The gift was accepted and taken down into a royal vault in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;Temple of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the chest was opened, it was found to contain absolutely nothing. The pandaren's gift was actually a message of advice and wisdom to the Highborne: all the arcane magic they needed was nothing, or in other words, they did not need it at all. The chest and the message it represented continued to exist in the vault even 10,000 years later, but as history would record, the pandaren's wisdom fell on deaf ears.\nPosing as a venerable &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; managed to contact &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Sargeras convinced Azshara, and her most loyal assistant, the Lord Counselor &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, to open a gateway to Azeroth that this mighty \"god\" might come forth and \"bless\" their whole race (meanwhile eradicating all races deemed \"unworthy\"). In their insolence, those born to nobility, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, sought to use and control this source of unimaginable power and unspeakable evil; and for their pride, they were consumed by the magic they so eagerly wished to wield.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; into the mortal world grew larger, Sargeras sent ever more numerous \"emissaries\" to aid with the portal and bring the word of their god from the beyond. These &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were members of Sargeras's immortal army, known as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and they had put to the flame countless worlds throughout the cosmos. As the portal grew close to its completion to allow the dark titan entry to Azeroth, a small band of kaldorei led by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, the high priestess of Elune, and &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; realized the threat posed to their entire world by this nameless evil and the now-crazed Azshara. Realizing his seemingly imminent victory could be threatened by these few elves, Sargeras commanded that his Legion make war upon Azeroth and destroy the unworthy, which included the entirety of the kaldorei race.\nAs war raged across the young world, many protectors of the world emerged to aid the young Malfurion Stormrage in closing this portal to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the malevolence which now stood poised to destroy them all. The &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; clashed head on with the advancing Legion. Having learned much about the power and beauty of nature from his &lt;a href=\"shan%27do\"&gt;shan'do&lt;/a&gt;, Cenarius, Malfurion was able to disrupt the nearly completed portal spell and close his world off from the invincible Sargeras.\nSuramar's rebellion.\n\"\"The city of Suramar became the center of night elf worship and home to the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. This order, composed of female night elves, dedicated itself to venerating the moon goddess. The sisterhood's priestesses had a hand in nearly all aspects of early night elf civilization, from acting as spiritual leaders to helping defend their burgeoning territories from outside threats\".\"\nIn time the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;city of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, jewel of the night elven empire would become its foremost center for magical research and cutting edge advancements surpassing that of the executive and legislative center of the Empire and rival city, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; would host the fabled &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Farondale\"&gt;Farondale&lt;/a&gt; on its most distinguished province of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, and would become the foremost center for magical learning, where night elves and even members of the fabled &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; would ponder together the mysteries of the cosmos and the arcane. Under the wise and strong influence of the sisterhood complexly and totally intertwined with the advanced arcane society, Suramar grew and prospered in excellence, knowledge and discipline alongside faith. The marvels of the arcane alongside the serenity and ethereal beauty of the prayers to Elune that would ascend from its numerous temples such as Falanaar, Faronaar and their headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;. It is this region that would produce the heart of the night elven resistance to Queen Azshara and her new demonic allies. It started with the rebellion of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; who on discovering the nature of the Queen's new allegiance, devised a bold plan to rid the world of the demons in one fell swoop by destroying the means they entered the world: the Well of Eternity. \nHe would have succeeded if he was not betrayed by a young noble &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Vandros\"&gt;Vandros&lt;/a&gt; too enamored with the Queen. Furious at this betrayal, in display of unparalleled power, Queen Azshara unleashed a spell of devastating proportions in retribution against the elves of Farondis' court that doomed the entire Suramar province of Azsuna to an eternal curse of unliving. Azshara meant this to serve as a warning against any dissenters and quell any ideas of rebellion amongst her subjects empire wide. However as the invading forces of the Legion marched across the hapless cities and territories around the world, the seeds of rebellion would blossom amongst the night elven population in the battle for their souls and the very survival of their world. The heart of rebellion was spearheaded in this region of the night elf empire and the fight would be picked up by Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, another province of Suramar. It is to his banner that many citizens of Suramar City and its provinces, including city folk like Malfurion and Illidan Stormrage, Tyrande Whisperwind who would become High Priestess of Elune during the conflict, Jarod Shadowsong and many others from Suramar City itself and surrounding regions would mount a resistance and march towards the capital of Zin-Azshari to stop the Legion and the Highborne of the palace who they at first believed were forcing the hand of the Queen against her will.\nThe Pillars of Creation.\nAs battles raged across central Kalimdor, one group of Azshara's servants grew increasingly concerned for their own future. This small sect of Highborne sorcerers acted as an extension of the queen's will in the city. From their headquarters in Suramar, they engaged in covert activities aimed at securing Azshara's rule and strengthening the empire.\nOf the many duties that these Highborne performed, they excelled at hunting down and acquiring artifacts of great power. Most of these relics were stored in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Antiquities\"&gt;Vault of Antiquities&lt;/a&gt; in Suramar. Amongst them, an extraordinary set of relics that the ancient &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s had used to shape and order Azeroth in ages past. Though Suramar's elite Highborne had pledged their undying loyalty to Azshara, their views on the queen began to shift as the war dragged on. The group's leader, Grand Magistrix &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, feared that the Legion did not have the Highborne's best interests in mind. The monstrous demons had already destroyed much of the night elves' glorious empire and poisoned the surrounding land with their fel magics.\nElisande's distrust of the Legion only deepened when she discovered that demons were planning to transform Suramar into a new staging ground for the war. Legion agents had begun forming a gateway to the Twisting Nether within the city's most prominent structure, the Cathedral of Eternal Night. Once open, this portal would allow the Legion's reinforcements to storm into Azeroth and crush the night elf resistance on a second front.\nYet Elisande thought that such a portal would likely destroy Suramar and everyone who dwelt within. Thus the grand magistrix and her followers formed a plan to sabotage the Legion's efforts. They severed their ties with the other Highborne and moved to seal the demons' new portal. To do so, Elisande and her allies sought out the potent artifacts they had gathered over the years. In particular, they knew that the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; possessed the raw power that they would need to neutralize the Legion's portal. \nWith these artifacts in hand, Elisande and her Highborne led an assault against the demons in Suramar. Just as the Legion's new portal began roaring to life, the sorcerers channeled their magic through the Pillars of Creation. They wove a great spell that closed the howling gateway and locked it with a set of unbreakable seals.\nThough they had thwarted the attempt to create a new portal, the rebellious Highborne had no plans to join the night elf resistance and continue fighting the Legion. Fearing calamity, Elisande and her followers worked to fortify their holdings in Suramar rather than push with the rest of the resistance to Zin-Azshari. They harnessed the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Pillars of Creation, to create an immense fount of arcane magic. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, this source of power would nourish the sorcerers and protect them from future threats. In the millennia to come, the fount would also change Elisande and her allies transforming them into a new race of night elves called the nightborne.\nThe Sundering.\nWith so much power in flux, the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; imploded in a magical cataclysm known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, sending untold numbers to their doom. Many kaldorei were dragged to the bottom of the sea, only to be twisted and transformed into the sea serpents now known as the vile &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The catastrophe tore the continent apart, its remains now separated by a massive ocean, and left a permanent storm known as the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; where the well once stood. With the majority of the Highborne dead, the kaldorei turned away from their arcane legacy and began a new culture focusing on attunement with nature and their surroundings, settling in the sacred glades around &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion's twin brother, seeking to maintain arcane magic in the world even after the destruction of the well of eternity had also traveled to Hyjal. Here, he poured three vials filled with water from the original well of eternity into a lake, imbuing it with great power and turning it into a new well. When Illidan refused to give up his magical powers, he was captured by his brother and imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt; under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, the night elves of Suramar were fully shielded from the effects of the Great Sundering due to the efforts of Elisande's group of Highborne. Elisande would come to lead the night elf society under a shield that would both serve as a refuge and prison. Cut off from all events outside, they apparently at first believed they were the only kaldorei survivors of the breaking of the world and under the eternal shroud of night and an artificial sky, these kaldorei would distinguish themselves as shal'dorei, continuing the legacy of the Kaldorei Empire under the shroud of eternal night produced by the Nightwell rather than the starlit night of before. \nFar away from the center of events on Hyjal and the night elven society that would develop there, another group of Highborne dwelt in the city of &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, which survived the War of the Ancients mostly intact. Although they took a long time to do it, the Highborne of &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;House Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; who had processed the Queen's special projects rebelled against the Queen towards the end of the war when their city was besieged by the demons and it was clear the Highborne would not be exempt from their purge. The wolf god &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; had fought bravely besides the city defenders and though he was ultimately slain, the Highborne were successful in defending their city. Far to the south of Mount Hyjal, the Shen'dralar did not draw the attention of the kaldorei. They powered their city by trapping a demon of immense power, &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt;, and used its energies to fuel their addiction and lifestyle in the absence of the power of the original well. However, despite their clever efforts, the imprisoned demon that they drew power from would come to require increasing amounts of power on its own until the net power gain became a loss. Subtly twisted by the demonic energies he was using, the Shen'dralar Prince would come to sacrifice his subjects to restore the net gain. This tug of war eventually drove this once bastion of arcana into ruin, with only a few survivors remaining, most of which were zealous supporters of the Prince.\nFor many years, the main night elven body atop Mount Hyjal worked tirelessly to restore what they could of their shattered ancient homeland. Leaving their broken temples, cities and roads to be overgrown, they largely chose to live on the land, out in the open or in barrow dens. They constructed very few new homes constantly on the move in patrols, although a small collection of structures were constructed amidst the verdant trees and shadowed hills at Hyjal's base called &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt; and served as the administrative centre from which the High Priestess Tyrande led. In time, the dragons that had survived the great Sundering came forth from their secret abodes. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the red, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; the green, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; the bronze descended upon the druids' tranquil glades and surveyed the fruits of the night elves' labors. Malfurion, who had become an arch-druid of immense power, greeted the mighty Dragons and told them about the creation of the new Well of Eternity. The great Dragons were alarmed to hear the news and speculated that as long as the Well remained, the Legion might use it to find &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; once more.\nFurion and the three dragons made a pact that the night elves would serve as guards of this new well. Alexstrasza brought an enchanted acorn, a remnant of &lt;a href=\"G%27hanir\"&gt;G'hanir&lt;/a&gt;, and placed it in the well, where it grew into &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"world%20tree\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt;. This tree would serve as a means to regulate the power of the new Well masking its energies ingeniously from radiating out into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to serve as another beacon for the Legion. The tree would also mask its power signature from would-be magic users in the hope of preventing any other society from learning arcane secrets and repeating the disastrous error of the elves. The tree would forever serve as a symbol of the connection between the arcane and nature, the night elves and the natural world, and would use the energies from the well to heal the world after the devastation of the Sundering. Partly in reward for their effort in repelling the Legion invasion, Nozdormu then blessed tree, so that, as long as the tree stood, the night elves would never age or fall prey to disease. Ysera also placed an enchantment upon the World Tree by linking the spirits of the night elves to her own realm, the ethereal dimension known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf druids, including Furion himself, were bound to the Dream through the World Tree. As part of the mystical pact, the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time so that their spirits could roam the infinite paths of Ysera's Dreamways and the spirits of the night elves. Though the druids were wary of losing so many years of their lives to hibernation, they agreed to uphold their bargain with Ysera.\nThe Long Vigil.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, high priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, had become the leader of the night elf populace. For thousands of years, she led the night elves in their vigil. Much of this time was spent apart from her love, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who, alongside his fellow druids, upheld the balance of nature from within the Emerald Dream. However, whenever a crisis came, the druids would awaken.\nOne such crisis came from the remaining Highborne. The Highborne that had survived the Sundering and had settled alongside their night elf brethren initially tried to assimilate into the new druidic society, but over time they could not ignore the burning addiction to arcane magic their whole race suffered from. These Highborne, led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar\"&gt;Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt;, declared the druids cowards for refusing to wield the arcane. Malfurion and the druids warned the Highborne that any use of magic would be punishable by death. Yet, in an attempt to protest the druid's law, Dath'Remar and his followers unleashed a terrible magical storm upon Ashenvale. The night elves could not bring themselves to put so many of their kin to death, so they decided to exile the reckless Highborne from their lands. So the Highborne left Kalimdor, sailing across the sea to the other, newly-formed continent. Now calling themselves &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, they established the nation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of the group's departure, the remaining night elves deliberately withdrew from the rest of the world. A veil of mist descended upon their entire continent, shrouding its presence from passing sailors.\nAnother such incident was the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, a devastating war that exacted a heavy toll from the night elves. During this war, the night elves fought against the unified satyr forces of Kalimdor. In desperation, some of the night elf druids even started using the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous druidic transformation that had been forbidden by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. These druids would form the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to use the mystical &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to gain control over their forms. However, this failed, and they became the first &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt;, before being sealed away in a pocket of the Emerald dream. Though losses amongst the night elves were great, the satyr eventually lost and they lost nearly all of their lands, being forced to survive as isolated sects.\nDuring the next several millennia, the night elves were not left entirely isolated. &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; fought alongside the quel'dorei &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; collaborated with &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; several thousand years before current times.\nDuring their long vigil, the biggest conflict the kaldorei fought on was probably the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. In ancient times, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires defeated the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, forcing a group of the latter to retreat into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; facility. Over the centuries, these aqir developed into the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and came to serve &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the facility. The &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt;, another insect race related to the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, also came to serve &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf forces, led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shiromar\"&gt;Shiromar&lt;/a&gt;, fought the armies of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, but retreated after the death of &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, son of Fandral, and the loss of &lt;a href=\"Southwind%20Village\"&gt;Southwind Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt wasn't until the night elves called for the aid of the &lt;a href=\"dragonflights\"&gt;dragonflights&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; were driven back. &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, children of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s, led armies of dragons against the forces of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the night elf and dragon forces were able to force the insect armies back to the gates of Ahn'Qiraj. While the battle seemed to turn against them once more, Merithra, Caelestrasz and Arygos flew into the city to create the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt;, though they were captured as a result. The scarab wall was capable of containing the insectoid armies, trapping them in the city. To one day reopen the gates and truly beat the qiraji, Fandral Staghelm was given a scepter. However, enraged by the death of his son, Fandral shattered the scepter, forever damaging the bond between the night elves and the dragonflights.\nRediscovery and the Third War.\nThe night elves' isolated existence was shattered during the third war, when refugees from the Eastern Kingdoms arrived on the continent in large numbers. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, newly fled from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and seeking resources, had sent the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, unaware of the area's inhabitants. The night elves took great offense to the orcish presence in their lands and attacked. While the orcs had some initial victories, that ended when &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; arrived, mistaking the orcs for demons and destroying most of their outposts. In desperation, the Warsong clan once more consumed demon blood, becoming powerful &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and proceeded to kill Cenarius.\nAt the height of this conflict \u2014 known as the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the Legion and its terrifying undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the night elves' lands. Tyrande rallied the night elf defenders and awoke Malfurion and his druids to combat the resurgent threat. For the vast majority of the third war, the night elves remained hostile to the allied &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Only during the final battle, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, did the night elves join with the mortal races, standing to defend the world tree. In the end, even this alliance didn't manage to stop the invading demons, but it managed to delay them long enough for &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to complete a magic ritual. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the demonic invasion, was torn apart by thousands of &lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, finally being killed by the world tree itself.\nPost-Third War.\nAlthough victorious, the night elves suffered greatly from the battle with Archimonde at Mount Hyjal. Their beloved World Tree Nordrassil, created and blessed by the Dragon Aspects Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu to grant the night elves immortality, had been sacrificed to elicit a massive blast of energy to slay Archimonde. With Nordrassil's destruction, so went the night elves' sole source of protection from aging, disease, and frailty.\nOver time, Nordrassil slowly began to heal its wounds, but a number of druids led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; desired to create another World Tree that would restore the night elves' immortality. Malfurion warned against this act of self-interest, but when he suddenly fell into a coma, his spirit lost within the Dream, Fandral forged ahead with his plans unopposed, becoming the new leader of the druids. The second World Tree, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, was planted off the northern coast of Kalimdor, and eventually it towered among the clouds. Within this tree, the night elves founded the great city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. However, Teldrassil failed. Though it grew, it was corrupted, and the dragon aspects refused to bless this new tree.\nAfter the Third War, the night elf nation also joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, although the exact moment at which they joined is unknown. They were apparently motivated to do so by the continued logging operations of the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the Third War, corruption and madness had taken hold of many of the night elves' former lands and allies, severely weakening the strength of the night elf nation. As members of the Alliance, the night elves partook in multiple conflicts, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;. \nNot all night elves actively joined the Alliance, however, with the druids of the neutral &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and settled in the city of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt;. Though individual druids still have roles in the night elf nation, the druids as an organization remain neutral to this day, even accepting and training members of the Horde. The &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; joined in several conflicts, directing the united Alliance and Horde forces during the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, launching the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Opening%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Opening of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and fighting on the front during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"DEHTA\"&gt;DEHTA&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group within the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; is also active in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to stop the large-scale hunting of the native animals through violent means.\nStormrage.\nAs the corruption of Teldrassil worsened, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; spread further and further. By the time the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; ended, people throughout the world started slipping into comas, their spirits drawn into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. It turns out that the nightmare was led by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient Highborne noble and the first &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, thought to have been forever sealed into a tree form during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in this plot, having been responsible for Malfurion's coma, using &lt;a href=\"Morrowgrain\"&gt;Morrowgrain&lt;/a&gt;, and the corruption of Teldrassil, having grafted a branch from Xavius' tree-body to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the aid of other druids and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;Green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the nightmare was defeated and most of its' corruption cleansed. In the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; blessed &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, restoring nature's ancient bond with the night elves. Malfurion and Tyrande got married, now sharing rulership of the night elf nation.\nCataclysm.\nSince the Shattering of the world, a group of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; successfully appealed to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to be allowed to make a return to kaldorei society. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves had outlawed arcane magic on the pain of death. However, &lt;a href=\"A%20Cautious%20Return\"&gt;some time before the Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; a Highborne archmage named &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; sought an audience with Tyrande and proposed to set aside long-standing differences and to combine resources, skills and numbers to prepare the wider night elven race for the challenges it faces. Despite the doubts of certain &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, this proposal was accepted. The Shen'dralar were allowed a cautious return among their kaldorei brethren, with some young night elves being trained by them to become new night elven mages, and, conversely, some of the Highborne taking up the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic arts or being initiated into &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt;, major societal changes that marked the first steps towards reconciliation between the Highborne and wider night elven society. \nAfter an outbreak spread the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; uncontrollably across the war torn nation of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; also destroyed the reefs which protected this &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdom from naval attacks, causing the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to launch an &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves intervened, assisting the worgen in acquiring the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, helping them to understand and deal with their transformation and holding back the Forsaken's assault, allowing the surviving Gilneans to escape to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. After this, the kaldorei integrated the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gilnean Worgen&lt;/a&gt; into their culture; granting them asylum within &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; itself, allowing several female worgen warriors to join the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; army and bringing worgen druids into the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight elf territory was one of the main fronts during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s joined the Horde and assaulted northern &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, though the night elves were able to fend off the attack. Two separate Horde offensives were launched against &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, both stopped by the night elves with assistance from the rest of The Alliance, and, by the time &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, the Horde had been fully driven from the forest. However, the night elves were not completely successful in their war efforts. Their assault on the new settlements of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; was held off, and a massive Horde-constructed bomb destroyed &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had become the co-ruler of the night elves, his &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; remained a neutral organization, intent on restoring balance following the cataclysm. Malfurion himself halted the slow collapse of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, with aid from &lt;a href=\"Thessera\"&gt;Thessera&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragon\"&gt;Green Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aroom\"&gt;Aroom&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Wildkin\"&gt;Wildkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brownpaw\"&gt;Elder Brownpaw&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; investigated the new out-of-control vegetation. In &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, a large portion of corrupted soil was cleansed to build &lt;a href=\"Whisperwind%20Grove\"&gt;Whisperwind Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Though most of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; turned a blind eye to the goblin wood-cutting going on in the region, the &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Talonbranch%20Glade\"&gt;Talonbranch Glade&lt;/a&gt; refused, and broke away from the neutral organization to fight them. Malfurion's neutrality, in an attempt to unite the factions against the Cataclysm's devastation, would ironically have unfavorable consequences on its other fronts, when &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt;, whose daughter was slain by Horde invaders into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, joined &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; after being overwhelmingly disillusioned by the Archdruid's apparent ongoing passivity.\nHowever, the biggest contribution for the night elves following the cataclysm was at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; invaded to try and destroy &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Green Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; united against him, forming the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The guardians were successful in fighting off the initial &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; invasion, resurrecting several of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. When the fire elementals invaded again, aided by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and his newly formed &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, the guardians were not only successful in fighting them off, but even managed to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and many of his lieutenants, including Staghelm, as well as constructing the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tree\"&gt;Sentinel Tree&lt;/a&gt; to keep watch over the area.\nMists of Pandaria.\nTo restore the immortality of the night elves, &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Vaeldrin\"&gt;Lorekeeper Vaeldrin&lt;/a&gt; was looking for the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Youth\"&gt;Pools of Youth&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;an ancient civilization&lt;/a&gt; that predated even &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Using a series of ancient magical scrolls, he opened a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande Whisperwind, having had a vision of some sort of light, sent a group &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, led by Vaeldrin's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt;, with him. However, the target of the spell had been warded using lost &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt; magic, imprisoning the expedition in a magic bubble that slowly drained their life. Luckily for the expedition, an Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; freed them with the help of &lt;a href=\"Kang%20Bramblestaff\"&gt;Kang Bramblestaff&lt;/a&gt;, and the freed expedition constructed a base camp to search for the pools.\nHowever, it turns out that the pools do not grant their immortality freely. Instead, they are used to transfer life energies from one person to another. During one battle with the mogu, Lyalia is captured and killed. Vaeldrin, using some of the water from the pools, uses his own life energy to save her, resulting in his own death. Despite these setbacks, the expedition is not without achievements, helping the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; fight off the &lt;a href=\"Dojani%20clan\"&gt;Dojani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and aiding in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow\"&gt;Stoneplow&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, being one of the largest Alliance forces on the continent prior to &lt;a href=\"Landfall\"&gt;Landfall&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves gained a strong presence at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the Alliance lands on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; was discovered. The night elves moved it to their capital for study and safekeeping. However, the city was infiltrated and the bell was stolen by the Horde.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande had mustered an army of her people in Ashenvale and began a slow march towards Orgrimmar. After the Alliance and Horde rebel armada landed at Bladefist Bay, Tyrande's forces appeared from the west and, using glaive throwers, managed to destroy the front gate of Orgrimmar. She and her Sentinels then distracted Garrosh's Kor'kron, allowing Alliance forces and Darkspear rebels to invade the city.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Sentinel\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the Alliance into , guarding &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. They also had a small presence in and in &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;. If chosen, they can also guard the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Naron%20Bloomthistle\"&gt;Naron Bloomthistle&lt;/a&gt; tended to Lunarfall's &lt;a href=\"Herb%20Garden\"&gt;Herb Garden&lt;/a&gt;, and some night elves such as &lt;a href=\"Yanas%20Seastrike\"&gt;Yanas Seastrike&lt;/a&gt; also lent their expertise and talents to the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Shipyard\"&gt;Garrison Shipyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nA contingent of &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;, was sent by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; to accompany and protect Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on the . Cordana was, however, corrupted by and joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s side.\nLegion.\nVarious night elves that remained when the Burning Legion began launching their third attempt to take Azeroth, joined the &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; halls to battle the demons.\nNotably, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; aided the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dreamweavers\"&gt;Dreamweavers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; joined other elite rangers and hunters from around the world including &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; to substantially bolster the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Tarelvir\"&gt;Tarelvir&lt;/a&gt; of the Shen'dralar traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to assist the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Priestess%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Grand Priestesses of Elune&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; to help other priests as well, including &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; who later joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; with her uncle &lt;a href=\"Nerus%20Moonfang\"&gt;Nerus Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, making them the only known active paladin night elves and the first to join the order. Overall, the night elves, as a race, had representatives in nine of the twelve &lt;a href=\"Class%20Orders\"&gt;Class Orders&lt;/a&gt; throughout the campaign.\n&lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; herself freed the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunters\"&gt;demon hunters&lt;/a&gt; from their long imprisonment, leading to their joining with the Alliance and the Horde; despite Malfurion's initial misgivings, &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; personally helped save King Anduin's life in Stormwind. &lt;a href=\"The%20Wardens\"&gt;The Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, holding a base off the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, played a crucial role fighting against the subsequent invasion, cooperating with the Illidari on several occasions, and Maiev even fought alongside the returned Illidan himself at the Tomb of Sargeras. She also reconciled with her brother &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; where she was captured, and together the two confronted the shades of some of their old friends such as &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt; although they were unable to recognize them.\nElsewhere in Azsuna, the demon hunters, including &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt;, and several others, also established &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Stand\"&gt;Illidari Stand&lt;/a&gt;. The ten thousand night elves of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; in their ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas\"&gt;Nar'thalas&lt;/a&gt;, also resisted the Legion's invasion as well as the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; assaults sent by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom were interested in the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kallistia%20Starlance\"&gt;Kallistia Starlance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olothil%20Starlance\"&gt;Olothil Starlance&lt;/a&gt;, night elf magi from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; who were apparently born in Azsuna before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, finally reunited with the spirits of their long-deceased parents after over ten thousand years.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; themselves returned to the Broken Isles, specifically the ancient lands of Val'sharah, a verdant region where Malfurion was originally born, and where he first received his druidic instruction from &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; long ago. Although captured by the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Xavius\"&gt;Shade of Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion would later aid adventurers and the Dreamweavers in cleansing the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; from corruption, and rescue his old teacher &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. After successfully defending the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; from the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and mournfully slaying the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande and the other priestesses and druids witnessed &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; cleansing Ysera's spirit and creating a constellation in the sky, in the process purifying the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; (one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; which the night elves had found and protected for thousands of years).\nTyrande, leading kaldorei forces, later returned to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient and much-changed city where she and Malfurion grew up in thousands of years prior, allying with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. Despite her apparent mistrust for her estranged kin, remembering how the Highborne had stood behind Azshara in their ancient war, she nevertheless led the main charge against her former city's ruler, &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, who mocked the night elves as having disgraced their glorious past and becoming as savage as the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s which stalked Kalimdor's forests. Eventually, Tyrande witnessed Thalyssra allowing the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; to perish, expressing her hopes that the nightborne would find a way to survive without its assistance. After the Suramar campaign, she and Malfurion apparently journeyed back to Val'sharah, her to the Sisterhood's Temple, and Malfurion to his home village of &lt;a href=\"Lorlathil\"&gt;Lorlathil&lt;/a&gt;, where they would later receive last messages of farewell and attempted reconciliation from Illidan.\nThe greatest eventual contribution of the kaldorei to the conflict would be ending the Burning Legion which they once helped usher in, with the Illidari repeatedly striking decisive victories against their forces from the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\", and Illidan himself playing a critical role in helping defeat &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, and journeying to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and essentially sacrificing himself to forever imprison &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; raised numerous fallen night elves, turning them into &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s under the lead of &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt;, who acts as their new captain in undeath. They later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Horde forces.\nShadowlands.\nThe souls of many night elves who died in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; were saved from torture in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, an afterlife for servants of nature.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were cleansed of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; by the Forsaken, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; announced that some kaldorei &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s raised by Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; wished to return among their people, and that if Tyrande would have them back, they were free to rejoin them. As some of them ended up joining the Alliance, it seems that Tyrande has indeed decided to accept their return among her people.\nCulture.\nFor more than ten thousand years, the night elves have been bound to nature, shaping their culture into what it is now. Modern night elf society was founded on the very grounds of protecting nature, signified by their connection to the world tree. As one of the longest living races in Azeroth, night elves tend to be slow to change. Slow to anger and slow to cool off, the night elves experience emotions as deeply, or perhaps more so, than the younger races. While generally slow to respond emotionally, their minds have seen much and tend to have a honed wit and sense of humor.\nFaith.\nThe night elves use the word \"god\" in plural (\"Gods help us all\"; \"May the gods have mercy\"), and the Temple of the Moon in Suramar had frescoes and murals depicting &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and many other gods (actual gods, not &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s) shaping the world. This demonstrates that night elf religion is possibly polytheistic, but most of their religion is centered around &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the moon goddess. This is likely confirmed when Tyrande herself &lt;a href=\"Covenants%20Renewed\"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; \"Perhaps we can never truly know the ways of the gods\", even after becoming an &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;avatar of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcing that the night elves are . The priests of the moon goddess, the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, are the leaders of the night elf military, and her high priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; is the official head of the night elf nation, formerly ruling from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s are also deeply revered and commonly used by almost all segments of kaldorei society, primarily for their extraordinary healing and restorative properties. The night elves also worship their ancestors. This worship takes the form of offerings, traditionally rice cakes that are blessed in the Temple of the Moon. While Elune is a goddess of peace, she is not a pacifist. One of her aspects is the Night Warrior, who takes the valiant among the dead and sets them riding across the sky as stars. This is likely the origin of the name \"kaldorei\", as night elf ancestors are thus believed to become stars upon death. Elune considers the night elves her \"favored children\", and manifested herself by channeling her voice and presence through Tyrande Whisperwind.\nThe night elves, especially the druids, also have a close kinship with most of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, as all known living ancient guardians were last seen on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most ancient allies of the night elves, with some night elves believing that he personally created the majestic &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s as a gift to them. &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; is the patron of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt; are the patrons of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt; are also allies, having assisted the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in the protection of the world tree. &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, while still corrupted, lies at the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elves also have close bonds with the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. The great &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, were the ones to create and bless &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the night elf race made their home for thousands of years, and their combined blessings provided them with renewed strength and vitality, easy access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Two of them, Alexstrasza and Ysera, later blessed &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; as well after attending Tyrande and Malfurion's wedding in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, protecting it from corruption forevermore, and the night elves have worked with the Aspects and their dragonflights on many occasions since.\nYsera is particularly important and revered, as all druids assist her dragonflight in guarding the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and even after her death at Tyrande Whisperwind's hands, she has expressed regret at her inability to aid the kaldorei when &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; burned, and has resolved to aid Tyrande however possible. Most green dragons, including Ysera herself, to this day even generally prefer to take on the form of kaldorei, and they have allowed night elves to ride them as mounts into battle in the ancient past, as Ysera did with Malfurion Stormrage during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and as her dragonflight did with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elves revere the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Moonsaber\"&gt;moonsabers&lt;/a&gt; because their shimmering coats symbolize the goddess of the moon, Elune, and they once believed that seeing the &lt;a href=\"Striped%20Dawnsaber\"&gt;dawnsaber&lt;/a&gt; breed in the wild was an ill omen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Owl\"&gt;dark-feathered bird of prey&lt;/a&gt; is often seen as a harbinger of doom amongst the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the tales of the night elves, the first &lt;a href=\"Red-Tailed%20Chipmunk\"&gt;red-tailed chipmunk&lt;/a&gt; was colored so after the theft and consumption of a sacred apple.\nIt is said that the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; holds the power to call the spirits of all night elves.\nThe souls of most deceased night elves are carried across the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, like any other mortal race. However, some linger in the mortal realm as &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s. The reasons for this are not entirely understood. \n\"May Elune light your path\" is a common night elf blessing, uttered as a friendly farewell and well-wish among friends and strangers alike.\nOrigins.\nLong ago, a tribe of nocturnal humanoids came to live on the shores of the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, and the Well's cosmic energies changed them into the night elves.\nCertainly many &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s do believe that the humanoids who developed into the night elf race were trolls. The theory does have some credibility, for there is at least a superficial physical resemblance between trolls and night elves. Furthermore, the troll race dominated much of ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; several millennia before the night elves came into power.\nNevertheless, many night elves find this theory preposterous and abhorrent. They are quick to point out that the first night elves began their rise to power by defeating a number of nearby troll tribes. As a consequence, the trolls came to fear and respect the might of their new rivals. The troll theory of night elf ancestry may have been a direct result of this early conflict. The trolls hated the night elves\u2014a sentiment that persists to this day\u2014and may have wished to marginalize the night elf race and its accomplishments. Also, attributing the night elf race with a troll heritage likely helped the trolls come to terms with their own shocking defeat.\nIt was only after \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" that &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had independent, reliable sources (namely the repaired &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt;, the restored Watcher &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, and the resurrected &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; himself) to explain the truth: that the night elves had evolved from a tribe of &lt;a href=\"dark%20troll\"&gt;dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s who had found and come to live beside the Well of Eternity. Brann notes that this confirmation will be sure to ruffle some feathers.\nGender roles.\nPrior to the conclusion of the Third War, night elf society was sharply divided by gender, with the vast majority of men, including Malfurion himself, originally being spellcasters in ancient times, and then largely becoming druids. Most women serving as warriors, hunters, priestesses, or a combination thereof. These gender roles more or less defined the culture of the kaldorei for ten thousand years. Many years ago, the two genders were even forbidden to take the opposite role. When this was finally lifted, it was a tremendous and tumultuous societal change, with &lt;a href=\"Druid%20and%20Priest%20Statue%20Set\"&gt;a pair of statues&lt;/a&gt; created to commemorate the first male priest and the first female druid. Even so, the gender divisions remain strong, and only at the end of the Third War were female night elf druids welcomed into the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the years since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, this overall gender division has eased considerably in favor of more practical concerns, and many factions have set aside the historical strictures on membership. More women have taken up the mantle of the druids, just as men have begun to choose either the path of priesthood or more widely the path of war and have affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, although male priests and Sentinels remain relatively uncommon, with there only three named male Sentinels, &lt;a href=\"Lylandor\"&gt;Lylandor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xanon\"&gt;Xanon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iyneath\"&gt;Iyneath&lt;/a&gt;, thus far known.\nAging and lifespan.\nMost night elves are, by the standards of other races, ancient. Because of their previous &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;, some night elves are more than ten thousand years old, which is older than the entirety of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; civilization put together. Though the immortality of the night elves has ended, much of its cultural impact remains, and some amongst the night elves sought a way to regain it, although others like Malfurion Stormrage and &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; believe that it was perhaps for the best, and that it was time for their people to actually live and truly be a part of their world.\nAfter the Cataclysm, both Malfurion and Jarod, alive during the War of the Ancients and with more than a thousand years age difference between each other, have been feeling minor, but increasingly consistent aches and pains due to aging, although this has not been mentioned elsewhere. Jarod's wife, also from the same era, passed away due to illness tied to aging. The night elves are now aging normally, rather than at an accelerated rate, and most still retain average lifespans of at least several thousand years comparable with their cousins, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nReunification.\nBefore the War of the Ancients, magic was once as revered as Elune herself.\nFor thousands of years, arcane magic has been outlawed amongst the night elves, with its repeated use punishable by death. Even when the night elves joined the Alliance, they still avoided arcane magic. However, just before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, this changed. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Mordent%20Evershade\"&gt;Archmage Mordent Evershade&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; traveled from &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, seeking an audience with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Sensing a coming change (likely the Cataclysm), the archmage offered his wisdom and knowledge to the high priestess.\nThe night elves emerged from their 10,000-year long isolation in the forests of Northern Kalimdor to discover prolific use of magic without the use of the Well of Eternity, something unknown to them but made possible by the implosion of the Well that had dispersed magic from its concentration in the well to the atmosphere. This, along with the demons already returned and defeated, Tyrande Whisperwind, finding her people in desperate need of reinforcements and power beyond their current means to face the new challenges to their territories by their enemies and the Cataclysm, and the entire reason for the ban on the use of arcane magic which was to hide Azeroth from the Legion in the hopes of preventing a return), was no longer a necessity.\nShe and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; accepted, lifting the millennia-long ban of the use of arcane magic for spell and on the Highborne, and allowing several of the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; to return to night elf society where they entered an alliance that would allow them to train night elves as mages. Although the restriction on magic finally ended, the rift between the people and the Highborne due to the actions of the majority of the Highborne at Azshara's palace that led to the War of the Ancients would take longer. Mordent understood that the gradual reintegration of magic to their society would be a slow process, something the couple likely appreciated. Under the agreement, the Highborne became part of night elf society once more, but were allowed also to maintain their own identity. \nThe millennia have not stripped the people's memories of the final days of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and the role of the Highborne. That has caused some difficulty with the re-integration, and some night elves have been hostile towards the returned Highborne. These few extremists, stirred up and led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, targeted and killed several of them in an attempt to purge night elf society of any remnants of the arcane, but her brother &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, although acknowledging that they had much to atone for, helped save their lives, and such actions were considered crimes against fellow Darnassian citizens. The new night elf mages have shown remarkable promise and made incredible strides in the short period of time they have re-embraced their arcane legacy. Such promise and desperate need forced new trainees to the front lines in the campaigns that immediately followed the Cataclysm, however despite their phenomenal progress were still very inexperienced, and was exploited by enemies of the night elves to devastating effect. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; has since apparently reconciled with Tyrande and Malfurion, as well as Jarod and Mordent Evenshade himself, implying that some night elves' views towards the Highborne have also changed.\nThe region of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; (known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;) is home to a number of night elven societies including the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; who were in isolation for 10,000 years. In the wake of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar, which rebuffed the Legion's first invasion 10,000 years ago, served as the principal staging ground of its final invasion of Azeroth. Many of the surrounding regions have faced invasions from Legion forces, most notable was the city of Suramar which had until that moment been isolated and secluded under their protective shield. The nightborne were strong armed by the Legion into bringing down their shield and forced to re-enter the affairs of the world as their allies or face destruction. Suramar City itself was occupied by the Legion who planned to use the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;'s immense power to herald Sargeras into Illidan's body on Azeroth, in order finally achieve the victory that had twice eluded them.\nThe night elves of the region rose up in defense alongside the heroes of Azeroth, converging on the Broken Isles. Many ancient night elven orders and forces such as the &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalkers or Keepers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt; have all combined their efforts with the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;nightborne resistance&lt;/a&gt; to end the occupation of the Legion, liberate the people of Suramar and ultimately the world, freeing the elves from their addiction to arcane magic and the Nightwell. Most recently, a kaldorei army led by High Priestess Tyrande joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, high elven and blood elven allies to assist the nightborne resistance drive out the Legion overthrow its once brave leader. It is the first time all the divergent groups of elves have worked together.\nGovernment.\nFor thousands of years, the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; held by far the most power; as one of a small handful of kaldorei organizations to survive the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, with membership based upon aptitude and not lineage, high priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; reorganized the order to direct the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. She herself became the sole ruler of the night elf nation, remaining that way for thousands of years.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, before his death still under the direction of Cenarius himself, took no active part in governmental affairs, as their numbers included druids from several other species. Though Archdruid Stormrage did take part in the government on occasion, the druids typically remained aloof, although this has significantly changed in recent years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and Malfurion Stormrage's awakening.\nAfter Elune and her lover &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; conceived &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, he inherited a powerful blend of his mother's unconditional love for Azeroth's living beings, and his father's ancient ties to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The natural world is intimately connected to the moon goddess as a result, and over the past several millennia, the night elves have reflected this by arranging their society according to a harmonious balance between the druids and priestesses, which was embodied in the present age by the union of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of whom became co-ruler of the night elves as well as head of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; he founded, the first change in official leadership in the past ten thousand years.\nFlags and banners.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and joining the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; have generally used a simple purple banner depicting &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; under a crescent &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; to represent their main political faction for nearly a decade, and their other factions and organizations have used a wide assortment of different flags and banners, although usually with similar lunar and nature-themed iconography. The older and traditional &lt;a href=\"Icon%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Icon of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"icon\"&gt;icon&lt;/a&gt; used in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, is far less frequently seen at night elf settlements and bases around Kalimdor.\nHowever, after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and around the time of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, most of the surviving night elves have formally adopted the ancient &lt;a href=\"Pre-War%20Highborne%20Tapestry\"&gt;Pre-War Highborne Tapestry&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, one of their civilization's ancestral banners, previously found in places such as the &lt;a href=\"Crumbled%20Palace\"&gt;Crumbled Palace&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashamane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Ashamane's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ravencrest\"&gt;House of Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, and in ancient settlements around &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt;. This development is likely partly due to reconnection with the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; and other previously isolated &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; groups in recent years (which began reshaping their entire society by slowly introducing the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; back into their life) - as well as the night elves, having lost most of their population at Teldrassil, now actively fighting to preserve not only the memory of a single tree, but both the ancient legacy of their people, and the precarious future of their entire race.\nThe night elves have openly displayed the Kaldorei Empire banner at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; and the entrance of their new base of operations at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; after reclaiming their outposts from the Horde, as well as on the walls and corridors of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Hold\"&gt;Silverwing Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, removing Silverwing's previous flags and banners. A banner is located in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; during the most recent &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%27s%20Anniversary\"&gt;Warcraft's Anniversary&lt;/a&gt; celebrations, opposite the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; flag's &lt;a href=\"Icon%20of%20Torment\"&gt;Icon of Torment&lt;/a&gt;, and several are prominently displayed in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; itself, most notably in the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; near the permanent portal to Azsuna maintained by the &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Mage\"&gt;Nar'thalas Magi&lt;/a&gt;. The remnants of the night elf military have even used the banner in some of their other fronts in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; beyond Kalimdor, such as at the &lt;a href=\"Mangrove%20Shore\"&gt;Mangrove Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarfare.\nBy the time of the Great Sundering, military service for the night elves had become more a matter of bloodline than ability. Almost all high-ranking officers were nobles, and the night elves had lived in peace for so long that very few of those officers, however privileged and well educated, possessed even a basic knowledge of tactics. Joining the army, once a selfless choice to defend the night elf people, had been reduced to a status symbol. The War of the Ancients made the army's deterioration all too clear. After the night elves and their allies had achieved victory, High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind decreed sweeping changes throughout night elf society. As part of these changes, Tyrande disbanded the old army, comprised from the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, most of whom had no desire for further battle, and after the kaldorei slowly expanded from Mount Hyjal to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, she formally established the Sentinels. She forged the predominantly female Sentinels from the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, which had emerged relatively unscathed from the conflict. The Sentinels, composed of devout and highly trained warrior women, became the fledgling night elf nation's primary protectors and guardians, especially after Malfurion Stormrage and most of his druids isolated themselves in centuries of slumber in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and befriended the native creatures of Kalimdor as they patrolled the wilds and forests under Tyrande's leadership.\nAlthough the night elves sacrificed their &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently \"much of their power\" at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elf &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; are still considered great warriors, fighting with savagery and skill that amazed even the greatest of warriors. In the past, Sentinels cared little for melee combat, instead relying on their trusted bows and throwable three-tipped &lt;a href=\"glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt;s, although melee weaponry seem to have become considerably more common in recent years. Swords, scimitars, daggers and the two-tipped glaives more commonly associated with &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are seen only in isolated cases. The founder and current leader of the Sentinels, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; respectively, are themselves highly skilled &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"archers\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt; who prefer the bow and arrow as their primary weapon before all others. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinels were composed of &lt;a href=\"Shadowleaves\"&gt;Shadowleaves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonhunters\"&gt;Moonhunters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Starseekers\"&gt;Starseekers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nightblades\"&gt;Nightblades&lt;/a&gt;, but these units have mostly not been mentioned since, implying they might have been re-organized or absorbed into the broader ranks of the night elf military after &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; was founded. The night elves have also used &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;Sentinel spies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Outrunners\"&gt;outrunners&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate, scout, or patrol unfriendly territories.\nSupporting the Sentinels in battle are the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom bring powerful abilities and resources to aid in battle. While affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, notable druids such as &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Thal%27darah\"&gt;Master Thal'darah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Telaron%20Windflight\"&gt;Telaron Windflight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaivan%20Shadewalker\"&gt;Gaivan Shadewalker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corvine%20Moonrise\"&gt;Corvine Moonrise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talran%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Talran of the Wild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balren%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Balren of the Claw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Qiana%20Moonshadow\"&gt;Qiana Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Janthes%20Shadeleaf\"&gt;Janthes Shadeleaf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Ivyth\"&gt;Lieutenant Ivyth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%20Andrenius\"&gt;Archdruid Andrenius&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"shan%27do\"&gt;shan'do&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself have all fought alongside their kaldorei kin against the Horde in recent years, acting in versatile roles ranging from scouts and warriors to guardians to healers, with most traditionally working separately from the Sentinels but cooperating effectively with them when in need. Several druids including &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Amarassan\"&gt;Sentinel Amarassan&lt;/a&gt; have even joined their ranks, and most of the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20druids%23Alliance\"&gt;Alliance druids&lt;/a&gt; are predominantly night elf or trained by them, with the night elves' powers over &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; described as being second to none. &lt;a href=\"Priestesses%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; have also helped the night elves' military efforts, primarily in support and healing roles, but can also call upon &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power to actively defend themselves and others, such as in the Third War, Ashenvale and the War of the Thorns. In addition, &lt;a href=\"huntress\"&gt;huntress&lt;/a&gt;es are the elite cadre of the Sentinel military, supported by their &lt;a href=\"owl%20scout\"&gt;owl scout&lt;/a&gt;s, and usually serve as mounted warriors on &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, providing support to non-mounted Sentinels in battle, most recently notably serving as &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the Sentinels and druids during the Battle for Darkshore.\nThere are also male and female &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s in night elf society, their people being naturally attuned to the wild outdoors, most distinctly the archers who serve in the Sentinels. These hunters are largely distinct from the predominantly female and more formally militarily integrated huntresses, who typically prefer to engage in close-range melee combat while wielding moonglaives and riding their &lt;a href=\"nightsabers\"&gt;nightsabers&lt;/a&gt;, although some of their roles seem to overlap with each other (for example, &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Kella%20Nightbow\"&gt;Huntress Kella Nightbow&lt;/a&gt; serves as an unmounted &lt;a href=\"hunter%20trainer\"&gt;hunter trainer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Sandrya%20Moonfall\"&gt;Huntress Sandrya Moonfall&lt;/a&gt; is a Sentinel archer riding on a nightsaber, and there are &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Huntress%20%28Ghostlands%29\"&gt;Darnassian Huntress&lt;/a&gt;es part of the Sentinel spies). After the War of the Ancients, &lt;a href=\"Namuria%20Gladesong\"&gt;Namuria Gladesong&lt;/a&gt; herself founded the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; after leaving Hyjal for &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; with her fellow hunters, and after her death, her successor &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; re-established the order in modern times, to be joined by her fellow hunters &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Raene%20Wolfrunner\"&gt;Raene Wolfrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Glynda%20Nal%27Shea\"&gt;Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"way of the hunter\", though seemingly less well-known, is just as ancient and venerable as that of the druid and Sentinel. According to &lt;a href=\"Ayanna%20Everstride\"&gt;Ayanna Everstride&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aldrassil\"&gt;Aldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, training as a night elf hunter involves taming beasts to aid them in battle, using a bow with unerring accuracy, and respecting the lands both at home and beyond, and all hunters are expected to respect nature as not something bent to their will, but a power stronger than their very existence. Night elf hunters such as &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jeen%27ra%20Nightrunner\"&gt;Jeen'ra Nightrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dorion\"&gt;Dorion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kaerbrus\"&gt;Kaerbrus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kamatari%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Kamatari Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; have successfully tamed all forms of animals to assist them in their duties as pets and companions, ranging from &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"riverbeast\"&gt;riverbeast&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThere also exist individual &lt;a href=\"warrior%20trainers\"&gt;warrior trainers&lt;/a&gt; in Teldrassil such as &lt;a href=\"Alyissia\"&gt;Alyissia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sildanair\"&gt;Sildanair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elanaria\"&gt;Elanaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darnath%20Bladesinger\"&gt;Darnath Bladesinger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kyra%20Windblade\"&gt;Kyra Windblade&lt;/a&gt;, as well as individual male warriors such as &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalan%20Nightbreaker\"&gt;Dalan Nightbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protector%20Arminon\"&gt;Protector Arminon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Protector%20Endolar\"&gt;Protector Endolar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Elendilad\"&gt;Captain Elendilad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Lonadin\"&gt;Lieutenant Lonadin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Tanolaar\"&gt;Marius Tanolaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yumanis%20Oakengrip\"&gt;Yumanis Oakengrip&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tell%27machrim%20Stormvigil\"&gt;Tell'machrim Stormvigil&lt;/a&gt;, although it is unclear whether they are directly affiliated with the Sentinels.\n&lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; leads the Sentinels from &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Su%27ura%20Swiftarrow\"&gt;Su'ura Swiftarrow&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, a specialized sub-group, in repelling ongoing Horde incursions into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, most notably seen in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Darnassian City Guard&lt;/a&gt; was previously responsible for the protection of their capital in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding lands, but suffered massive losses in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these different groups collectively comprised the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Army\"&gt;Darnassian Army&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from being &lt;a href=\"Quickness\"&gt;agile and nimble in combat&lt;/a&gt; and able to avoid attacks with greater ease than most, night elves are &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Resistance\"&gt;generally resistant to nature magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Touch%20of%20Elune\"&gt;blessed by Elune's power&lt;/a&gt; during the night and day; their druids and rogues are able to &lt;a href=\"Elusiveness\"&gt;move more quickly than those of other races when stealthed&lt;/a&gt;. They can also frequently &lt;a href=\"Shadowmeld\"&gt;slip into the shadows to hide themselves from enemies&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20Spirit\"&gt;spirits move and travel far more quickly than ordinary ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther forces and allies.\nNight elf technology is apparently somewhat limited, and the only commonly employed technological war equipment seems to be the &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20Thrower\"&gt;Glaive Thrower&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful long-range vehicle capable of cutting through reinforced armor, as seen throughout night elf territory. Rather than rely on technology in battle for the most part, the night elves instead bring their natural allies. Amongst these various allies are &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"saber\"&gt;saber&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nymph\"&gt;nymph&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"storm%20crow\"&gt;storm crow&lt;/a&gt;s are also allies of the night elves, but don't appear to be integrated in their armies. The night elves even befriended a &lt;a href=\"bog%20beast\"&gt;bog beast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rethiel%20the%20Greenwarden\"&gt;Rethiel the Greenwarden&lt;/a&gt;, who is tended to by some of their druids, including &lt;a href=\"Ferilon%20Leafborn\"&gt;Ferilon Leafborn&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Greenwarden%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Greenwarden's Grove&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;s can also be found among the crews of night elven boats, as well as used to gather wood resources and repair broken structures. The night elves summoned wisps at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to successfully destroy demons on several occasions, and Malfurion summoned thousands of them to hold off the Horde in their invasion of Ashenvale and Darkshore. Moonwells are used to create blessings that offer protection against fire, and are used to bless &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Arrow\"&gt;Warden's Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. They are widely revered as shrines to Elune, their mystical powers respected and widely utilized by the Sentinels, druids, and the Highborne alike, for their extraordinary restorative and healing as well as other properties.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt; today are among the closest allies of the night elves, several even joining the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; due to the kaldorei's assistance, and were alone among the Alliance nations who directly aided them in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and his family remaining personally close friends of Tyrande and Malfurion to this day. The &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, whose arrival the night elves first noticed, are their closest neighbors geographically, and their &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; was honored and held in the highest esteem by the night elf rulers. They have also recently sent paladins and other forces to assist them in places such as &lt;a href=\"Battlescar%20Valley\"&gt;Battlescar Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Song\"&gt;Forest Song&lt;/a&gt;, with several ambassadors such as &lt;a href=\"Emissary%20Valustraa\"&gt;Emissary Valustraa&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; itself before its destruction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, have fulfilled their duties as the marshals and jailors of night elf society for millennia, serving occasionally as trained assassins and bounty hunters, and also played a part in bolstering night elf forces in recent times. They were known to have historically kept Kalimdor's greatest threats in their &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, a massive underground prison built off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, and whose entrance is located at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Isle of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. While they apparently were relatively non-aligned and were open to Horde assistance during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; events of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, they have also openly aided the other Darnassian elves and the Alliance on and in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, where Maiev herself served as the Alliance commander, aided by her brother &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and led the kaldorei to successfully reclaim &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev's most prominent wardens, including &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Bladewing\"&gt;Marin Bladewing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mirana%20Starlight\"&gt;Mirana Starlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drelanim%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Drelanim Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malace%20Shade\"&gt;Malace Shade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shalis%20Darkhunter\"&gt;Shalis Darkhunter&lt;/a&gt;, all actively participated in the Battle for Darkshore.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Archmage Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt;, as well as their night elf students, have become fairly integrated into the kaldorei military as of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, and for several years have aided the Alliance operations in Kalimdor, especially in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in Kul Tiras and Zandalar as part of other Alliance groups such as the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them, such as &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Amberwind\"&gt;Lorekeeper Amberwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Estulan\"&gt;Estulan&lt;/a&gt;, have even helped established new outposts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Darnassian Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; in Azshara and the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Estulan\"&gt;Tower of Estulan&lt;/a&gt; in Feralas. Most recently, Highborne night elves such as &lt;a href=\"Sarvonis\"&gt;Sarvonis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ralara\"&gt;Ralara&lt;/a&gt; contributed immensely to the night elves' initial efforts in holding off the Horde advances in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, enabling other night elf magi to portal some of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;'s civilian population to safety in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and saving their people from extinction; several night elf magi were found at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Golras\"&gt;Lieutenant Golras&lt;/a&gt; and Mordent Evenshade himself helped lead the Alliance effort against the Horde in Darkshore. Kaldorei magi also openly contributed their efforts to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and the war on the Broken Isles, and during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Mage\"&gt;Nar'thalas Magi&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, providing a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Crumbled%20Palace\"&gt;Crumbled Palace&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Illiyana%20Moonblaze\"&gt;Illiyana Moonblaze&lt;/a&gt;, although part of night elf society for years, have long been traditionally mistrusted by some segments of formal night elf society as little more than pirates, and were not officially integrated into the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; or other parts of their military for a long while, although the Cataclysm's upheaval also gave them opportunities to become \"trusted fighters of the Alliance\". A female rogue served as the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Leader\"&gt;Sentinel Leader&lt;/a&gt; for the night elves' &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;spies in Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Illiyana herself was personally responsible for rescuing Commander &lt;a href=\"Su%27ura%20Swiftarrow\"&gt;Su'ura Swiftarrow&lt;/a&gt; during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;, and some night elf rogues have joined &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s , most notably &lt;a href=\"Rell%20Nightwind\"&gt;Rell Nightwind&lt;/a&gt;, who accompanied the small, elite force sent by &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to secure &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and successfully rescue &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Other SI:7 rogues from the night elves include &lt;a href=\"Caelvana%20Duskwalker\"&gt;Caelvana Duskwalker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkblade%20Cyn\"&gt;Darkblade Cyn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Veruca%20Darkstream\"&gt;Veruca Darkstream&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind's newest &lt;a href=\"rogue%20trainer\"&gt;rogue trainer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Commander%20Barus\"&gt;Scout Commander Barus&lt;/a&gt; cooperated with &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Mistress%20Yvonia\"&gt;SI:7 agents in Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to prevent the Horde's &lt;a href=\"The%20Bomb\"&gt;bombing attack against Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lynore%20Windstryke\"&gt;Lynore Windstryke&lt;/a&gt; was a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; who later became a commander in the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Nitrana\"&gt;Nitrana&lt;/a&gt; was a mace-wielding rogue at &lt;a href=\"Stormshield%20Stronghold\"&gt;Stormshield Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Tavar\"&gt;Tavar&lt;/a&gt;, a runner skilled at disguise was slain during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; while attempting to lure Varok Saurfang himself into Malfurion's trap at &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;; and former Darnassian rogue trainer &lt;a href=\"Erion%20Shadewhisper\"&gt;Erion Shadewhisper&lt;/a&gt; helped construct &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nPandaren visitors such as &lt;a href=\"Laoxi\"&gt;Laoxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lanfen%2C%20Brewer%20of%20Fine%20Teas\"&gt;Lanfen, Brewer of Fine Teas&lt;/a&gt; also taught the Darnassian elves the ways of the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; joined the Alliance, and were apparently welcomed openly by the night elves into Teldrassil. Several night elf monks including &lt;a href=\"Orrindis%20Raindrinker\"&gt;Orrindis Raindrinker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwynlan%20Rainglow\"&gt;Gwynlan Rainglow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evanra%20Cloudchant\"&gt;Evanra Cloudchant&lt;/a&gt; joined their brethren in their campaign to alternate Draenor; &lt;a href=\"Sylara%20Steelsong\"&gt;Sylara Steelsong&lt;/a&gt; aided the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; as its Windwalker monk champion; and at least one female kaldorei monk joined the rest of the night elf military in opposing the Horde's invasion of Ashenvale in the War of the Thorns, notably nearly knocking &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; unconscious with a single blow to the temple in their brief struggle.\nDespite the Alliance's reluctant acceptance of both groups, both &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s are apparently quite rare in the formal night elf military, with their backgrounds being largely anathema to night elf culture. However, several night elf death knights joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Skybreaker%20Dreadblade\"&gt;Skybreaker Dreadblade&lt;/a&gt;s, and in at least one other instance, several night elf death knights, including &lt;a href=\"Sylalleas%20Frostwind\"&gt;Sylalleas Frostwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arebia%20Wintercall\"&gt;Arebia Wintercall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lleanya%20Mourningsong\"&gt;Lleanya Mourningsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raevyn%20Sorrowblade\"&gt;Raevyn Sorrowblade&lt;/a&gt;, associated themselves with the Alliance and journeyed with their military forces to alternate Draenor. Tyrande and Malfurion acknowledged &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt;'s presence in Stormwind, with Malfurion expressing unease at his presence and recalling the demon hunters' imprisonment since his brother's fall, but Tyrande more receptive and even regarding them as \"a valuable weapon\" in their coming war. The Illidari night elves have yet to significantly aid their kin in their military operations against the Horde, although several death knights and demon hunters, including &lt;a href=\"Caladon%20Leechblade\"&gt;Caladon Leechblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nylaria%20the%20Haunted\"&gt;Nylaria the Haunted&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Raize%20Shadespear\"&gt;Raize Shadespear&lt;/a&gt;, have recently aided the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nMilitary units.\nMembers of the Sentinel Army can be proficient in a wide variety of skills, from &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; riding to the use of siege weaponry. As such, the army is able to fill many unique roles on the battlefield. Primary examples of these include:\nInteractions with the Alliance.\nIn the past, there appeared to be some culture clashes between the night elves and the other races of the Alliance. Some kaldorei expressed thinly veiled contempt for the other cultures or mortals of the world. Traditionalists within night elven society, notably former Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and Warden &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some of the Highborne such as &lt;a href=\"Var%27dyn%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Var'dyn Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;, showed open antagonism or contempt for what they consider to be \"lesser races\" and \"outlanders\". The shadowy nature and the wild conservative ways of the night elves have also led to awkward or strained interactions between the kaldorei and other races. For example, the night elves seem to be uncomfortable with the Alliance's obnoxious use of technology while the Alliance view the night elves' primal form of warfare and lifestyle as somewhat primitive.\nEven so, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; saw merit in maintaining ties with the younger races within the Alliance, for they have shown resilience in the face of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;terrible adversity&lt;/a&gt;, and have even earned the favor of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the night elves have positioned themselves as a peculiar mixture of observers, teachers and arbiters; watching silently from the sidelines and stepping in without warning to 'correct' any dangerous mistakes or 'naive' courses of action. In addition, the younger cultures do seem to possess one quality the kaldorei have been missing for quite some time: the enthusiasm of youth. Adventure and exotic locales have renewed their appeal to many night elves, and the kaldorei again have more than a few who brave leaving &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and Ashenvale to seek out intrigue in the far-off lands their people have not set foot on for ten thousand years. With the recent loss of their immortality, the mortal races of the Alliance have also shared their experience with the night elves on how to cope with death, frailty, and sickness.\nIn line with Malfurion's stance on the races of the Alliance, druids such as &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Oaktalon\"&gt;Talar Oaktalon&lt;/a&gt; advocate living in harmony with all life and the interconnectivity of all living things. Thus the druids have encouraged the sharing of ideas and the lending of mutual aid. Indeed, the kaldorei have become increasingly involved in many Alliance affairs that focus on the protection and restoration of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s natural world. In the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves have made it their mission to cleanse and restore life to the land, whereas the other races focus primarily on eradicating the lingering &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, kaldorei can be seen empowering the wildlife in the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;very heartland&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s seat of power. In &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, there was an instance of night elf sentinels temporarily joining forces with &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; refugees to rout the marauding &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; tribe. Most notably, after the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; was jolted back into the outside world in the Cataclysm's wake, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;launched an invasion&lt;/a&gt; of its lands. The kaldorei, being well aware of the druidic origins of the curse afflicting the Gilneans, lent their aid to the besieged kingdom and granted the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; asylum within Teldrassil's borders.\nNight elves have a fairly close relation with draenei, having been the first race to meet the draenei after their arrival to Azeroth, with Prophet Velen being held in high regard by Tyrande Whisperwind and Malfurion Stormrage, and a draenei ambassador being close to Tyrande herself in Darnassus. Draenei have assisted the night elves in several areas and conflicts against the Horde, and a portion of Darnassus refugees was welcomed on Azuremyst Isle after the burning of Teldrassil.\nSome night elves would even join other Alliance organizations over the years, with &lt;a href=\"Rell%20Nightwind\"&gt;Rell Nightwind&lt;/a&gt; joining his fellow rogues in , and &lt;a href=\"Elise%20Starseeker\"&gt;Elise Starseeker&lt;/a&gt; participating in the dwarven-majority &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt; served as &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s personal bodyguard for years after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and was adept enough in combat to single-handedly fight &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;battle for Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; themselves would come to offer their services in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lynore%20Windstryke\"&gt;Lynore Windstryke&lt;/a&gt;, a rogue and former leader of the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thaumaturge%20Moonspire\"&gt;Thaumaturge Moonspire&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf mage, also became commanders in the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, fighting in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nRelations with other elven groups.\nHigh elves and other Highborne groups.\nIn the past, a particularly lingering grudge existed between the kaldorei and their &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; descendants, night elves generally viewed the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; with disgust, suspicion, or outright hostility. After some high elves rejoined the Alliance following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves saw it as their duty to warn their new allies about the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s part in bringing about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; figured heavily in the night elves' retelling of high elf history.\nHowever, the high elves and the night elves collaborated on several occasions in the past during the Long Vigil, with &lt;a href=\"Emmarel%20Shadewarden\"&gt;Emmarel Shadewarden&lt;/a&gt; and her forces helping the high elves under &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; fight off an &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; troll incursion, and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; fighting \"side by side\" with &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; two or three thousand years ago.\nThere are also indications that relations have improved at least somewhat in recent years, due to their mutual long-term associations with the Alliance, as well as possibly the return of the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; kin to kaldorei society, which essentially ended the reason which caused the rift between Malfurion and Dath'Remar in the first place. Tyrande herself accepted the Shen'dralar's return, having also acknowledged the high elves' contributions to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; after she and Malfurion encountered &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the last descendant of the Highborne mage who freed her during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; long ago.\nAlthough some of the Shen'dralar were aware that &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; had departed Kalimdor and intended to follow his people to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, there have been limited interactions between the Shen'dralar and the quel'dorei today, with &lt;a href=\"Daros%20Moonlance\"&gt;Daros Moonlance&lt;/a&gt; traveling from &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aranhir%20Starsinger\"&gt;Archmage Aranhir Starsinger&lt;/a&gt; and the high elf &lt;a href=\"Enchanter%20Nalthanis\"&gt;Enchanter Nalthanis&lt;/a&gt; having a cordial relationship, and the &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Lydros\"&gt;Lorekeeper Lydros&lt;/a&gt; not objecting to &lt;a href=\"Telmius%20Dreamseeker\"&gt;Telmius Dreamseeker&lt;/a&gt;'s presence in &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; incinerating the latter. The Highborne's current relationship with the blood elves is more hostile due to the faction war, with &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Amberwind\"&gt;Lorekeeper Amberwind&lt;/a&gt; and her students apparently killed on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Andorel%20Sunsworn\"&gt;Andorel Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Malynea%20Skyreaver\"&gt;Malynea Skyreaver&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged their role in the War of the Ancients and expressed concern regarding their return.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Mate%20Wavesinger\"&gt;First Mate Wavesinger&lt;/a&gt; was second-in-command of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bravery\"&gt;The Bravery&lt;/a&gt;\", a ship which sailed to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Dulial\"&gt;Arcanist Dulial&lt;/a&gt; was also briefly allowed into Darnassus itself. &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; allowed &lt;a href=\"Moonbell\"&gt;Moonbell&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muran%20Fairden\"&gt;Muran Fairden&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf druid, into the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, and she and her half-elven children were invited as guests to Tyrande and Malfurion's wedding in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, her husband &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; having helped them win the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. She and her rangers would later work with Shandris and her Sentinels in an attempt to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; before the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as further working together as fellow leaders and hunters in the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande's night elves and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s high elves shared the same camp in Suramar and were apparently able to cooperate fairly well without significant tension.\n&lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; portaled herself to &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt; while seeking out &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; caused her to openly express regret at not having killed her sister &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; the last time they met. Both she and Umbric cooperated quite well on several occasions with &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; (who previously went as far as travel to &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Cowled%20Ranger\"&gt;Cowled Ranger&lt;/a&gt; seeking news of Alleria's whereabouts) in the subsequent military campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome night elf ghosts, both Highborne and non-Highborne, have aligned themselves with the Darnassian elves, such as &lt;a href=\"Asterion\"&gt;Asterion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Remorseful%20Highborne\"&gt;Remorseful Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Kel%27Theril\"&gt;Kel'Theril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thelar%20Moonstrike\"&gt;Thelar Moonstrike&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mathystra\"&gt;Mathystra&lt;/a&gt; (who fought against Horde adventurers during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;), along with &lt;a href=\"Yalda\"&gt;Yalda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oben%20Rageclaw\"&gt;Oben Rageclaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elves &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Farondis\"&gt;Court of Farondis&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; himself, still reside today in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Mage\"&gt;Nar'thalas magi&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Stormwind to provide portal services to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Crumbled%20Palace\"&gt;Crumbled Palace&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance players, apparently affiliating themselves with their Darnassian kin.\nBlood elves.\nInitially, the night elves and blood elves had joined forces in \"\", and Tyrande, Malfurion, and even Maiev worked cordially with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his troops, who treated their older brethren with respect despite their peoples' past conflict. Tyrande grieved for the deaths of Kael's brethren, encouraging the blood elf prince not to allow vengeance to poison his heart, and to instead focus on leading his people into a brighter future. However, when Kael'thas Sunstrider allied with Illidan Stormrage who was still then regarded as a traitor and the mysterious serpentine naga later fleeing to Outland and believed to be in league with the Legion. Relationships soured and the night elves warned the Alliance about the blood elves' past. The last of the good overtures vanished when the night elves sent an espionage and quasi-military expedition to Quel'thalas, a move that was deemed hostile and answered with force by the blood elves. This was the first recorded killings between the two groups, escalating the negative aspects of their relations to open and violent conflict.\nSince then, the night elves and blood elves have clashed in several confrontations under the banner of the Alliance and Horde, in particular the Horde invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, to aid the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; called on the kaldorei and sin'dorei to assist their long-estranged brethren. Although they now faced a common enemy, some of the elven groups remained bitterly divided over historical, racial, and cultural differences. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; insisted that while her scouting was useful, Tyrande knew little of the type of open warfare which was needed to besiege her former city, deeming only her &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; capable of withstanding Elisande's forces, and later told Thalyssra that the blood elves were \"scorned\" by Tyrande, arguing that her people fought to save their world while the kaldorei \"slept in dens or hid in trees\".\n&lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, despite their initial hostilities, came to form a deep and lasting friendship, saving each others' lives on various occasions.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; were formerly close allies in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, with Illidan accepting his blood elves as the only other race he trained as &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Although Kael'thas became disillusioned by Illidan later, most of his blood elves who trained with Illidan remained loyal to his cause, with &lt;a href=\"Kayn%20Sunfury\"&gt;Kayn Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; becoming one of his closest and most loyal followers even after Kael'thas's death, even openly opposing &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis the Sufferer&lt;/a&gt; when the latter criticized Illidan's decisions.\n&lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was notably surprised by &lt;a href=\"Lorash\"&gt;Lorash&lt;/a&gt;'s willingness to join the other Horde races invading &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, calling him a \"brother\", arguing that their invasion was senseless, that the night elves and their Highborne kin once lived together and died for one another, both in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and during the war in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and pointing out that despite the years of conflict between their factions, the kaldorei had never invaded Quel'Thalas, nor dreamed of doing so (as far as he was aware). Lorash retorted that the kaldorei had not aided their exiled brethren during their long ordeal in the Eastern Kingdoms, nor in their centuries of warfare against the trolls and most recently against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the high elf genocide in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nNightborne.\nThe kaldorei's relationship with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, already tense after Tyrande and her people apparently distanced themselves from &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and her brethren after the liberation of Suramar, has also likely worsened despite Thalyssra's initial hopes to rekindle their ancient bonds of kinship, especially after the nightborne joined the Horde around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and continuing to openly participate in operations against the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; accused her former subject Tyrande (who once lived as a priestess inside her city) and her kaldorei of cloaking themselves in \"false piety\" and becoming as savage as the trolls, abandoning their ancient customs and traditions, and Thalyssra also accused the night elves of harboring unwarranted \"arrogance and mistrust\" towards the nightborne of Suramar, in contrast with the blood elves who showed greater empathy and understanding for their plight.\nThe kaldorei in turn apparently found little reason to sympathize with a group which seemingly abandoned the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and largely aligned themselves once again with the Legion, their ancient enemies, with Tyrande raising the possibility of Thalyssra herself becoming the next &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; cooperated with Thalyssra in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of their ancient capital, where she also expressed displeasure at Suramar having isolated themselves from the rest of the kaldorei during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, to which Thalyssa replied that Suramar sealed itself off to keep the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; free from Azshara's grasp.\nDeceased night elven ghosts can also be raised into &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spectre\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRelations with the Horde races.\nOrc.\nThough many within the kaldorei still felt bitter about the role orcs played in &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;'s death, hostilities were apparently not renewed until the Horde continued their lumbering operations in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. These Warsong incursions into Ashenvale renewed the night elves' animosity towards the orcs and have therefore functioned as the catalyst for their participation in the Alliance's military endeavors. Despite this, diplomatic relations with fellow &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and their respect for Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; tempered the night elves' wrath.\nTo avoid an all-out war, the night elves even allowed open trade with the Horde until the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate incident&lt;/a&gt; strained their trust, consequently leading to a withdrawal of all trade contracts as well as the barring of all Horde members from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. When the orcish territory of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; suffered from a terrible drought, the orcs' new warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, launched a full-scale invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to sustain his people, leading to a devastating back-and-forth conflict over sovereign land and resources in the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict between the orcs and the kaldorei since then escalated so fiercely into open warfare that it even began to involve several of the &lt;a href=\"ancients\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Children of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.\nTauren.\nOf all the Horde races, the night elves share the closest and most friendly relationship with the tauren by far. Although some of the more traditional night elves such as &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt; were initially mistrusting of them (and most other races), some of the tauren including &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, fought alongside them in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and were eagerly welcomed by &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; as reinforcements. They were the first non-kaldorei race to be welcomed into the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; developing a particularly close bond with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, whom he sought out and learned the teachings of Cenarius from, as well as other prominent Archdruids such as &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; was displeased at the idea of the tauren becoming druids, eventually even he slowly developed an outwardly courteous and cooperative relationship with Hamuul, who is given access to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; itself. The tauren would help the kaldorei repel the Legion once again in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; after Medivh convinced the Alliance and Horde to ally with the night elves.\nDespite the faction war, the tauren and night elves have even jointly established &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; outposts in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as well as other worlds such as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and their two races seemed to have very rarely come into direct conflict, at least before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, after which tauren warriors were seen invading &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Disciples%20of%20Naralex\"&gt;Disciples of Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, include tauren druids such as &lt;a href=\"Nalpak\"&gt;Nalpak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muyani\"&gt;Muyani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Muyoh\"&gt;Muyoh&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which risked his life to save his teacher &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; after the night elves and tauren attempted to regrow the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Runethorn\"&gt;Scholar Runethorn&lt;/a&gt; considered &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Korolusk\"&gt;Sage Korolusk&lt;/a&gt; her associate in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, and they simultaneously attempted to uncover knowledge of the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Telmius%20Dreamseeker\"&gt;Telmius Dreamseeker&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;. As an apprentice to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Thal%27darah\"&gt;Master Thal'darah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galena%20Stormspear\"&gt;Galena Stormspear&lt;/a&gt; was seemingly the only tauren permitted at &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Overlook\"&gt;Thal'darah Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, an Alliance settlement. The Sentinels permitted &lt;a href=\"Loh%27atu\"&gt;Loh'atu&lt;/a&gt; to share &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt; with them, and the tauren subsequently aided them in cleansing &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; of Highborne spirits and satyrs. The tauren even revere &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes, with Hamuul heavily influenced by Moonglade's elven teachings, although eventually they would extend their reverence to &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; as well, seeking balance between the Moon and the Sun. \nTheir opinions and viewpoints were not completely without tension or disagreement, however. The tauren shaman &lt;a href=\"Braug%20Dimspirit\"&gt;Braug Dimspirit&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the goblins' negative impact on the environment, but argued that the Forsaken and the orcs were not the only ones to blame for the misfortunes found throughout Kalimdor and Lordaeron, while the tauren druid &lt;a href=\"Gart%20Mistrunner\"&gt;Gart Mistrunner&lt;/a&gt; insisted that the kaldorei's pride limited their sight, despite the common bond the two races shared via druidism.\n&lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, noting he trusted \"that this one chosen by a friend of my people will act will honor toward all\", was able to convince the Horde members of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamform%20army\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; to accept &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership after &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; declared that Varian would lead them. The failed meeting between Hamuul and Elerethe in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to help establish trade links between their peoples shortly before the Cataclysm, which the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; disguised as Horde members killed nearly a dozen total druids from their respective races, also likely strained night elf-tauren relations, and led to an enraged &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; challenging &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, leading to his death at the hands of the latter. However, Malfurion, Hamuul (who helped save him from the Nightmare) and other members are seen cooperating without significant tension at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and this ruse was apparently discovered by Malfurion and others eventually. The druids &lt;a href=\"Anren%20Shadowseeker\"&gt;Anren Shadowseeker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tholo%20Whitehoof\"&gt;Tholo Whitehoof&lt;/a&gt; are apparently extremely devoted best friends who unhesitantly fight with each other at Hyjal. Even despite their tensions elsewhere in Kalimdor, night elves cooperate with the tauren at &lt;a href=\"Freewind%20Post\"&gt;Freewind Post&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; later recalled the &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;'s friendly interactions with &lt;a href=\"Wuul%20Breezerider\"&gt;Wuul Breezerider&lt;/a&gt;, noting how he had said \"very nice things about tauren\", and was confused at why some of the night elves were enemies with the tauren, despite their opposing political affiliations.\nSometimes, such bonds continued to transcend even the faction war, and tauren and night elves alike have openly gone against their commanding officers in the face of unprovoked aggression. For example, &lt;a href=\"High%20Chieftain%20Cliffwalker\"&gt;High Chieftain Cliffwalker&lt;/a&gt; opposed &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt;'s aggression against the kaldorei druids of &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt;, whom Krom'gar accused of harboring a secret Alliance weapon, resulting in the deaths of his wife and son as well as the tauren of &lt;a href=\"Cliffwalker%20Post\"&gt;Cliffwalker Post&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after this incident, the night elf druid &lt;a href=\"Lintharel\"&gt;Lintharel&lt;/a&gt;, who believed the divisions between their factions were false ones, likewise defied her human commander &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Heller\"&gt;Marco Heller&lt;/a&gt; by saving her friend &lt;a href=\"Nita\"&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt;, almost losing her own life in the process. In &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Vaeldrin\"&gt;Lorekeeper Vaeldrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunwalker%20Dezco\"&gt;Sunwalker Dezco&lt;/a&gt; fought together against the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Groundbreaker%20Brojai\"&gt;Groundbreaker Brojai&lt;/a&gt; and afterwards refused to fight each other, and Tyrande and Baine faced off against each other in the Trial of Garrosh Hellscream, with Tyrande notably displaying great reluctance to harm Baine's reputation during the course of the trial.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff%20Shaman\"&gt;Thunder Bluff Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderous%20Brave\"&gt;Thunderous Brave&lt;/a&gt;s were seen fighting against the night elves in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. Even during and after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, not all bonds were discarded, with Anren and Tholo continuing to fight with each other at Hyjal. &lt;a href=\"Tiala%20Whitemane\"&gt;Tiala Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, still guarding the World Tree along with the other druids, was apparently able to negotiate safe passage for Thrall, Baine, and Calia Menethil, when they sought a meeting with Tyrande, Malfurion, and the night elves at &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, implying the kaldorei have not broken all ties with their Cenarion Circle members at least.\nWhile the night elves of Kalimdor apparently distanced themselves from their tauren neighbors following the &lt;a href=\"Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, even refraining from intervening on their behalf against the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, the night elf hunters who later left Mount Hyjal and returned to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; after the War of the Ancients to establish the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; worked extensively once again with the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, even establishing their primary base &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in their territory after the Highmountain offered them their friendship and support. &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;'s descendant &lt;a href=\"Arien%20Highmountain\"&gt;Arien Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; founded the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Namuria%20Gladesong\"&gt;Namuria Gladesong&lt;/a&gt;, and their two races \"learned much from each other\", as they remained ever vigilant and stood constant guard against the Legion's return. Huln himself recently reaffirmed his friendship with &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, telling Shandris Feathermoon that he considered any friend of Jarod a friend of his, and aiding her in her attempt to save Tyrande Whisperwind by seeking out other Night Warriors throughout the Shadowlands, his relentless efforts ultimately resulting in Tyrande being saved from Elune's forbidden power.\nOther Horde races.\nThe night elves' most long-lasting hostile relationship seems to be with the orcs, their primary rivals in Kalimdor, with hostilities between their two peoples beginning even prior to their joining the Alliance, dating back to their first clashes in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; even during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, where the newly arrived Horde races attempted to harvest lumber for their necessities, unaware of the kaldorei's presence and objections. Their continuing disputes over the region's land and abundant resources, culminating in the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, appear to have been one of the primary reasons the night elves opted to formally join the ranks of the Alliance, and worsened further after the kaldorei broke all trade ties with the Horde, and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; became the new Warchief and escalated the hostilities in Ashenvale into open war, as well as into other regions such as the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. A notable exception is Tyrande and Malfurion's very close friendship with &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;, the first orc the night elves would ever encounter, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, with Tyrande personally vouching for his entry into Suramar's Temple of the Moon and healing him with her powers, and still recalling him as \"Brox\" even millennia later after meeting his niece &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande also later acknowledged &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; as his brother, seemingly regarding the latter as an honorable warrior.\nThe materialistic and highly technologically advanced &lt;a href=\"goblins\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, with their blatant disregard for nature and wildlife, both of which the night elves long regarded as sacred, are likely the second-most hostile Horde race with the night elves. Their presence in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of their ancient capital, and their significant contributions to Garrosh's war machine in Ashenvale and other night elf lands in Kalimdor, further contributed to their enmity, although Tyrande has allowed the goblins the use of Azshara's lumber in return for the Horde withdrawing from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; were formerly of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt; which attempted to challenge the ancient kaldorei, but their modern-day interactions, aside from the usual faction conflicts by association, appear to be relatively limited, although Tyrande openly aided &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; likewise have a limited presence in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; even after joining the Horde, and their contacts with the night elves seem to be about as limited as those of the trolls, although their cultures have nearly opposite values, and the night elves were mentioned as having \"little use for the abominations that were the Forsaken\" despite their deep respect for life.\nThey clashed primarily in Ashenvale, where the Forsaken claimed an ancient kaldorei ruin as their outpost at &lt;a href=\"Bathran%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Bathran's Haunt&lt;/a&gt;, with the Forsaken mage &lt;a href=\"Sarilus%20Foulborne\"&gt;Sarilus Foulborne&lt;/a&gt; filling &lt;a href=\"Mystral%20Lake\"&gt;Mystral Lake&lt;/a&gt; with tainted &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Bathran\"&gt;Bathran&lt;/a&gt; being killed by the Forsaken who sought to harvest his resources for their schemes, and the Forsaken managing to murder or drive insane all the druids of &lt;a href=\"Dor%27Danil%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Dor'Danil Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt; after experimenting upon their spirits while they slumbered. The Forsaken apparently sought to spread lethal disease throughout the land of the night elves, creating potent poisons to use against the people of Ashenvale.\nThe &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; destroyed most of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;'s population, and the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, in which the two races fought the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; to control the region, seems to have all but destroyed the Forsaken-night elf relationship, especially given the use of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; in their sacred lands, including their &lt;a href=\"moonwells\"&gt;moonwells&lt;/a&gt;, and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; and many of their settlements in the region at the hands of the Forsaken. Even &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, due to her undead nature, was not spared &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s rage, despite the fact that she was not part of the Horde during the conflict.\nDespite the bulk of their forces being deployed to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves clashed once again with their former &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; neighbors during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Sentinel%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;an entire battalion of kaldorei troops&lt;/a&gt; joining the Alliance to act as a necessary diversion in order to help besiege the ancient troll capital (some openly vowing to punish Zuldazar for aiding Sylvanas and the Horde), and although they would suffer considerable casualties, their efforts helped lead to a major Alliance victory.\nRelationship with other races.\nPandaren.\nMost of the night elves appeared to have all but forgotten about their &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; neighbors, with even &lt;a href=\"Elloric\"&gt;Elloric&lt;/a&gt;'s parents only vaguely recalling \"a strange, furry folk that lived far to the south\" of their ancient homeland before the &lt;a href=\"Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. \nBefore the kaldorei were addicted to arcane magic, the pandaren were a close ally to the night elves, possibly due to their shared enmity with the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires. Some of them even lived with the night elves and witnessed the power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, yet after the night elves became obsessed with the Well, and after &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; had a vision of the Legion invading Azeroth, the pandaren decided to sever their ties and used the Mists to separate their land from the rest of Kalimdor, forming &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore they left, the pandaren decided to offer the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; a gift, a chest of pandaren design, said to contain all the arcane magic they would ever need. The gift was accepted and taken down into a royal vault in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;Temple of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the chest was opened, it was found to contain absolutely nothing. The pandaren's gift was actually a message of advice and wisdom to the Highborne - all the arcane magic they needed was nothing, or, in other words, they did not really need it at all. The chest and the message it represented continued to exist in the vault even 10,000 years later, but as history would record, the pandaren's wisdom fell on deaf ears.\nThe induction of the &lt;a href=\"Tushui%20Pandaren\"&gt;Tushui Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance, and the presence of kaldorei forces in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;, seems to have rekindled a measure of friendship between the two ancient civilizations, with several trainers, &lt;a href=\"Laoxi\"&gt;Laoxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lanfen%2C%20Brewer%20of%20Fine%20Teas\"&gt;Lanfen, Brewer of Fine Teas&lt;/a&gt;, being welcomed into Teldrassil and their capital &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; itself, teaching the kaldorei the harmonious ways of the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;. \nLanguages.\nThe primary language of the night elves is &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. Due to ideological differences between the night elves and their distant kin a linguist must take great care in drawing comparisons between Darnassian and its two cousin languages (&lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;), because the night elves find such comparisons offensive.\nAll night elves have also learned &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; in order to better relationships with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaming.\nLike humans, elves are often addressed by just their first name, or with their rank/position and their last name. However, there are a number of elves that use single names and don't fit this pattern.\nTechnology.\nCompared to their peers in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves are rather limited in their use of technology. Instead, they rely on their magic and the benefits of the natural world. That doesn't mean the night elves are primitives, however. Traditional night elf architecture shows that the elves are quite skilled at building and stonecraft, and traditional night elf weapons include the metal glaives. In battle, the night elves also deploy simple mechanical weaponry, most notably &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20Thrower\"&gt;Glaive Thrower&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe night elves' lifestyle is not necessarily against technology, however, but rather one where technology is not the goal. Apparently, night elf Sentinels have even shown themselves capable of using guns, but still seem to prefer their bows and throwing glaives.\nHighborne used memory crystals created by ancient sorcery to store stories, music, history, and even memories.\nCuisine.\nOne of the night elves' most important basic ingredients is rice flour, with most families keeping at least one basket of rice in their houses. &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Ricecake\"&gt;Wild ricecakes&lt;/a&gt; are made in the north of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; according to a traditional night elf recipe. The most well-known night elf recipe is kimchi, made of fermented vegetables and sold by vendors throughout night elf territory. To ferment these vegetables, night elves bury pots with vegetables. &lt;a href=\"Spice%20Bread\"&gt;Spice bread&lt;/a&gt; is also common, eaten almost every day. Pine nut bread is an ancient kaldorei staple; as the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; revere nature, it is no wonder that their signature bread features ingredients foraged from the forests of Kalimdor: wild hive honey, pine nuts, and mixed herbs. Additionally, it is often formed into the shape of a leaf to honor &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Passed down from the night elves' forebears, this ancient recipe makes for a scrumptious accompaniment to pastas and stews.\nRibs, spider kabobs, sweet potatoes, lunar pears, moonberries, eyes of Elune, (seemingly an apple, grown by the moonwell and harvested by kaldorei), sunfruit &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Bleu\"&gt;Darnassian bleu&lt;/a&gt; cheese, baby octopi (sometimes eaten while still alive), herring, clams, and whitefish are also known to be part of night elf cuisine. &lt;a href=\"Bean%20Soup\"&gt;Bean soup&lt;/a&gt; is a popular dish among the night elves.\nWhile nowhere near the partaking of libations that the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are known for, the night elves are familiar with &lt;a href=\"alcohol\"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. Even in ancient times, the kaldorei made Darnassian wine, distilled from and which was mixed and/or stored in . In the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the vintage continues to be produced by the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Moonberry%20Juice\"&gt;Moonberry juice&lt;/a&gt; is another kaldorei beverage. Starfire espresso is a rather common caffeinated beverage that can help you sober up from an alcoholic beverage. Cenarion spirits is an alcoholic beverage, presumably a spirit liquor from its name, another alcoholic beverage named &lt;a href=\"moonglow\"&gt;moonglow&lt;/a&gt;, though it is traditionally sold around the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nVegetarianism is known to the night elves and apparently practiced by some. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself is a hunter, telling &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that the hunt is an essential part of nature, that the druids did not condemn the wolf or bear for their part in it, and if those who hunted took what they needed and respected where that bounty came from, there is no real contradiction in their beliefs.\n&lt;a href=\"Moonwell\"&gt;Moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s are used by night elves to bless food stores.\nAppearance.\nEver since night elves made first contact with the Alliance races, there's been a long-standing debate as to whether they had any relation to trolls. Responses from either of the two races reside on opposite ends of the spectrum. Night elves will flat-out deny any sort of ancestral ties to their historical mortal enemy. On the other hand, tribes like the Zandalari and the Darkspear may begrudgingly admit that at one time the kaldorei were indeed their kin.\nProof of a common ancestral link was discovered by Brann Bronzebeard, the famous dwarven archaeologist. He confirmed night elves descended from none other than the fabled dark trolls of Kalimdor. Refer back to the early beginnings of the Kaldorei, and you will notice their physical forms resemble very little of the exotic beings seen in modern times.\nAs a tribe, the dark trolls were nomadic in nature. A sect of these nomads settled on the shores of a vast lake known today as the Well of Eternity. The waters of this fount were profoundly magical in nature. As they remained exposed to the Well's energy for long periods of time, the appearance of the dark troll settlers eventually transformed.\nDark trolls were darker in complexion compared to most other trolls. Their skin was a deep violet with complimenting black or dark blue hair. They stood upright with lean, corded muscles; bearing tattoos which covered their faces and bodies. As they changed, their slenderness became accentuated. Hands and feet evolved into more fingers and toes. Ears that were once large and wide became longer, thinner and more tapered. Even in their eyes, a curious silver glow emerged which mirrored the light of their loa goddess, Elune. With the dark trolls' new form came a new name for themselves: kaldorei. This is the form we are familiar with today.\nWhere dark trolls had mainly dark violet skin, the skin tones of night elves fall into a broad range of the purple spectrum. Colors may vary from the darkest orchid to the faintest pink. Some individuals may even appear various hues of cerulean or bear a pale milky, opalescent shade of white. In rare cases, you may come across a night elf with a ruddy, almost rouge-like skin.\nHair color has also extended into more variants over the dual tones attributed to dark trolls earlier in this section. Starting out with sapphire or even obsidian hair, night elf hair has sprouted into a panorama of azures and violet; followed closely by greens and even silver that boarder on white. Autumnal tinctures such as red, amber, blonde and brown were, for a time, common colors; though this striking feature was found primarily among the Highborne ruling class. Hairstyles among night elves are similar to those of the Quel'dorei and Sin'dorei, albeit a bit more wildly and free-flowing. Unlike most of their elven cousins, Kaldorei men often have thick, elaborate beards and bushy eyebrows.\nOver the past fifteen millennia, a tall stature and long, tapered ears have become favored traits in all bloodlines. While the reasoning for this may be a lost tradition to celebrate their identity as night elves, their exotic appearance has had a tendency to be initially greeted with admiration, fear or mockery by other races. Much time has passed since the Third War when night elves first met the Alliance, however. The presence of night elves, especially of the young adventuring variety, has become more commonplace in cities like Stormwind.\nFor the average Kaldorei, peak physical health is one aspect of achieving overall personal harmony. Individuals can spend centuries sculpting their form to perfection for both aesthetic appeal and battle prowess. Through generations of this practice night elves have developed a slender, athletic frame that carries them with each graceful stride.\nNight elves are natural warriors built for deadly combat, and their dense musculature packs a punch with the heft they throw behind it. If weight and height ratios are similar to humans, we can expect an average kaldorei female to weigh about 200\u00a0lbs and a male roughly 250\u00a0lbs. Male Kaldorei are sinewy, with broad chests and shoulders, indicative of the strength within both their minds and bodies. Female night elves are lithe and curvaceous, yet still muscular and strong.\nThe average height for a female night elf is around 6'9\" tall while the average height of a male is approximately 7'3\" tall. A full-grown Kaldorei under 6'5\" is nearly unheard of, and would be considered unnatural, or even an abomination by some.\nFemales will tend to bear facial tattoos that frame their eyes. The style of the tattoos usually have deep meaning to them. Males may have tattoos on their chests, and uncommonly around their eyes like Malfurion Stormrage.\nLike other elves, most night elves are generally slim, athletic and graceful, and have large pointed ears which tend to be greeted with admiration or mockery by other races, and have unusually acute senses, able to see clearly even in low-light conditions.\nTheir perpetually glowing eyes are the result of their race's ancient connections to the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, which \"caused the night elves' eyes to glow with a silver or golden radiance\" not unlike how most &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes are glowing to signify their connection with the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, making their vision \"preternaturally sensitive to light and motion\". Contrary to what a casual observer might believe, night elf eyes still have pupils, just as the eyes of many other humanoid races do. These pupils can be difficult to discern, particularly under certain lighting or from certain angles. When a night elf dies, the glow fades from their eyes.\nAlthough in-game models show female night elves with glowing silver eyes, while the male's eyes have an amber glow to them, the two eye colors are not exclusive to gender, and golden eyes are starting to become more common. While not noticeable while the mouth is closed, when speaking to a night elf one can often spot the long canines they possess.\nWhen a night elf is embarrassed, their cheeks darken to black or a darker shade of purple.\nWhile gathering lumber from Ashenvale for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s war effort, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, unaware of the night elves' identity, remarked that they looked \"like &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, but they're far too tall, and far more savage\".\nGolden eyes.\nBefore the Sundering, golden eyes were extremely rare among the night elves. Golden eyes thus came to be regarded as a sign of future greatness. Night elves born with them were recruited into the Moon Guard. Both Queen Azshara and Illidan had these unusual eyes. Unfortunately, the falsehood of this widespread belief was only to become clear after these two infamous individuals had reached their dark fates.\nIn truth, golden eyes were a sign of strong druidic potential. Little wonder that pre-Sundering night elves, with their emphasis on the arcane, did not understand the significance of these unusual eyes. Simply having this potential did not guarantee that the potential would be sensed or understood, much less wielded with skill and compassion. Despite his golden eyes, Illidan struggled with the druidic arts, though he, like Malfurion, was tutored by Cenarius.\nInnate druidic power does not necessarily lead to becoming a druid, and lacking that innate power does not preclude becoming a druid. Indeed, Malfurion was born with eyes that glowed silver, but he studied druidism, and his wholehearted dedication gave him a power and skill far beyond most druids. As he continued to use druidic magic, his eyes acquired the golden incandescence that had once been so coveted by other night elves.\nGolden eyes quickly became far more common. After the Sundering, night elves abandoned their former obsession with bloodlines, and so the number of night elves born with golden eyes increased significantly. In addition, the night elves resolved to be more respectful of Azeroth, and a number of night elf men followed in Malfurion's footsteps; these new druids eventually also had golden eyes.\nTraditionally night elf women served their people as warriors, hunters, and protectors. Many spellcasting vocations, on the other hand, were generally considered the realm of night elf men. Only since the devastating casualties of the Third War have these conventional gender roles been set aside. Because druids only recently opened their ranks to women, golden eyes remain somewhat more prevalent among night elf men than their female counterparts.\nFacial tattoos.\nThe symmetrical markings worn by many night elf females do have some meaning. They choose their facial markings sometime after adulthood, and they can mark an earlier rite of passage. Though they don't necessarily have to, some night elves feel they should. It is not yet clear what the rite of passage consists of or whether the act of tattooing itself is the rite of passage. Elves who perform notable deeds can be honored by receiving embellishments to their existing tattoos.\nTattooing represents their close ties with nature. Stylized claw marks are a typical shape.\nAntlers.\nSeen as an extremely rare gift of nature and a sign of future greatness, a night elf may be born with antlers. They begin as small stumps on the young one's head, growing larger as the night elf matures into adulthood. \nNight elves such as Malfurion Stormrage and &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt; possess antlers, however &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; is the only night elf shown to have been born with this extraordinary gift so far.\nNotable.\nFormer elves.\nThe following were once kaldorei, but have been transformed into other races through magical means.\nNight elf factions and allies.\nThroughout the extensive history of the night elves, they have garnered support from many different kinds of creatures on Kalimdor, and in addition to the recently allied &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; are:\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nNight elven society has changed since the battle of Mount Hyjal, and the Sentinels now function in an entirely different manner. As the Burning Legion threat has been averted, at least for now, the night elves are no longer considered in a state of war.\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves severed all ties with the Horde in response to Cenarius' death at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish champion &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining a tentative relation with the Alliance alone. Directly afterward, many &lt;a href=\"sentinel\"&gt;sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; of the kaldorei began a great wild hunt of orcs across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; as a retaliation for Cenarius' murder.\nRealizing they needed help to survive in this new world and to oppose the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which chose their continent as its new home, the night elves reluctantly joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Commerce began between &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and the night elves, as the two cultures shared values and ideas. The night elves remained withdrawn, however. There are still many places considered too sacred for dwarves or humans to venture into, and only when they\u2019re drunk do they really loosen up around other Alliance races.\nFaith.\nThe night elves worship the Ancients, who are nature deities attuned to the forest and the hunt. Elune the moon goddess and Malorne the Waywatcher are the most prominent figures of worship. While Cenarius has died, and the night elves will never forgive the orcs for this, his children live on and gain power each passing year. The night elves venerate the children of Cenarius as he was venerated, and perhaps one day these children of the slain demigod will aid the night elves in repaying the orcs for the transgressions of the past.\nSome night elves also worship &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Sect%20of%20the%20Dragons\"&gt;Sect of the Dragons&lt;/a&gt; hosts many kaldorei adherents. It is not currently known how many kaldorei actually worship the dragons.\nLanguage.\nThe night elves once worked with orcs to halt the Burning Legion, and now they retain knowledge of the race's language for tactical reasons.\nNaming.\nNight elf names always have a special meaning. First names derive from an elven word or the name of a famous hero having a totemic or ancestral connection. Surnames are indicative of the family line and often date back millennia.\nArt of war.\nRather than drawing from the chaotic and darker side of magic, theirs is pulled from Azeroth itself. Stone, root, flora and fauna all are avenues through which their magic travels. Druids are able to change into animal forms, snare their foes with roots or harden their skin like tree bark.\nTheir warriors are not to be taken lightly either. The night elves are among the most deadly adversaries to be found anywhere, due to a combination of their proficient skill with a bow, their stunning agility, and the ability to melt away into the shadows of the night. Few use common weapons such as swords, most preferring the mighty glaives (triple-bladed swords) they have grown accustomed to. War panthers, &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and even the mighty &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s have all been known to aid the night elves in battle.\nFor ten thousand years, all night elven war and \"foreign policy\" has been based solely on the safety of Ashenvale Forest and Mount Hyjal from outside incursion. The Sentinels, hidden safely among Ashenvale's leafy trees, effectively sealed off the region from unwanted interference for ten millennia. The Sentinel's method of deterrence was successful until the invasion of the Legion-endorsed Scourge; at which point the night elves were forced to awaken the Druids and accept aid from the Alliance and the Horde.\nAppearance.\nNight elf males are very tall, range between 6'6\" (198\u00a0cm) and 7'6\" (229\u00a0cm), with broad shoulders and a lithely muscular torso whereas females are far more slender. The men are typically of a slim-waisted yet firm, muscular build including long, muscular arms and large hands. The women are quite different, standing between 6'2\" (188\u00a0cm) and 7' 2\" (218\u00a0cm) in height.\nNight elves are imposing in stature, males being on average 7 feet tall. Male kaldorei are very muscular, with broad chests and shoulders, indicative of the strength that lies within both their minds and bodies. Female night elves are lithe and curvaceous, yet still muscular and strong. The race's prominent eyebrows, long pointed ears and natural aspects imply a feral grace. Skin tones range from pale white to blue or even ruddy red, and their hair ranges in color from bright white to woodland green to lustrous black.\nIn the TCG.\nWhile there are examples of elves with golden eyes, certain night elven &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s have been seen with glowing green eyes, usually while casting or under the influence of a druidic spell. Glowing green eyes have also been seen on a night elf &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; however, so the color may be a natural occurrence.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Amongst the oldest races on Azeroth, this ancient people saw the world nearly sundered by their own reckless use of magic. Forsaking the primal magics of their past, the elves then went on to live harmoniously with nature. After thousands of years in isolation, the night elves eventually made contact with the younger races and found common goals alongside them, resulting in their Alliance with the races of men, dwarves, and gnomekind.\nThey start in &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;, an area located inside the great tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The elven capital was Darnassus, where their High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her husband &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; led their people. After the great boughs of their home were &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;burned down by the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, however, night elves canonically have no main base of operations.

They are bound inextricably to the natural forces around them and live a self-sufficient, reclusive lifestyle.\"\nClassic opening cutscene.\n\"For ten thousand years, the immortal night elves cultivated a druidic society within the shadowed recesses of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; Forest. Yet recently, the catastrophic invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; shattered the tranquility of their ancient civilization. Led by the Arch-Druid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, the mighty night elves rose to challenge the demonic onslaught. Though victorious, the night elves were forced to sacrifice their cherished immortality and watch their beloved forests burn. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world. Despite Malfurion's warning that nature would never bless such a selfish act. The druids planted the great tree, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, off the stormy coasts of northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Among the twilight boughs of the colossal tree, the wondrous city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; took root.

Reunited with his love, Tyrande Whisperwind, Malfurion endeavors now to heal the corrupted world tree, Teldrassil, and rejuvenate the spirit of the night elf people. Yet, as the Great Cataclysm shakes the boughs of their colossal tree, the night elves brace themselves against the coming storm. As war and destruction close in from all sides, is falls to night elves like you to stand strong and protect the enduring legacy of your people.\"\nHistory.\nFor ten thousand years, the immortal night elves cultivated a druidic society within the shadowed recesses of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; Forest. Then the catastrophic invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; shattered the tranquility of their ancient civilization.

Aided by the newly arrived &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the night elves succeeded in halting the Legion\u2019s advance and defeating its master, the demonlord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. Though victorious, the night elves were forced to sacrifice their cherished immortality and watch their beloved forests burn.\nIn the aftermath of the horrific conflict, Malfurion and Tyrande helped their people rebuild their shattered villages. Slowly the night elves began to adjust to their mortal existence. Such an adjustment was far from easy, and there were many night elves who could not adjust to the prospects of aging, disease, and frailty. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world. When Malfurion heard about this plan, he warned that nature would never bless such a selfish act. Shortly thereafter, Malfurion\u2019s spirit was somehow lost within the depths of the Emerald Dream. Though his fellow druids attempted to find his wandering spirit, only his body remained sleeping within his Barrow Den.\nWith Malfurion missing, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 the leader of those who wished to plant the new World Tree \u2013 became the new Archdruid. In no time at all, he and his fellow druids had forged ahead and planted the great tree, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, off the stormy coasts of northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Under their care, the tree sprouted up above the clouds. Among the twilight boughs of the colossal tree, the wondrous city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; took root. However, the tree was not consecrated with nature's blessing and soon fell prey to the corruption of the Burning Legion.

{"id": "99661", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=99661", "title": "Nightbane (tactics)", "text": "Nightbane is a summonable raid boss in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. He is a fiery skeletal dragon, transformed by Medivh from &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; and formerly of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. While not the ruler of Karazhan, a position apparently held by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;, many consider Nightbane to be the true final boss of the tower, due to his superior difficulty in the early days of the raid's release. \nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Blackened%20Urn\"&gt;Blackened Urn&lt;/a&gt; is no longer required to summon Nightbane, a raid member must have completed the &lt;a href=\"Medivh%27s%20Journal%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Medivh's Journal (quest)&lt;/a&gt; in order to click the urn on the ground. This means Heroic &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Halls\"&gt;Shattered Halls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt; must be partially completed. \nIt seems likely that he became a &lt;a href=\"fel%20dragon\"&gt;fel dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was opened by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, almost every creature on attuned to magic on Azeroth felt ripples as the gateway flared to life. Arcanagos traveled to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; with Medivh's mother, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, to confront him about it. The tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala, and so Aegwynn entered alone at first, hoping to convince Medivh to give up his power peacefully. After Medivh revealed that said power was that of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, he and Aegwynn began to fight, shaking the tower to its foundations and causing the would-be revelers to flee. When Aegwynn was temporarily incapacitated, Arcanagos joined in.\nHowever, despite being a blue dragon, Arcanagos was severely outmatched. Sargeras struck him down, burning him from the inside out until all that was left was bone. Her friend's death sent Aegwynn further into a rage, and as their duel continued, Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand.\nAttacks and abilities.\nNightbane has two phases that he transitions between several times during the course of the fight. During the Ground Phase, tank the boss on the ground in a style reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. At 75%, 50%, and 25% health, he enters the Flight Phase and takes to the sky, during which time the raid's attention is focused elsewhere. After Nightbane finishes casting Rain of Bones and then Smoking Blast he begins a slow descent back down to the platform (to roughly the same location as the original landing) and Phase One begins anew. He is NOT tauntable.\nStrategy.\nGround Phase.\nThe Ground Phase lasts from when Nightbane lands until his health hits 75%, 50%, or 25%, at which point he then takes to the air for the Flight Phase. All during the Ground Phase Nightbane casts Charred Earth, Fears, and Cleaves.\nTanking Nightbane.\nTanking Nightbane is a fairly straightforward affair, with the exception of fear. Handling fear is paramount to success, as one or two uncontrolled fears will guarantee a wipe. Warrior tanks can minimize the effect of fear by stance dancing. Having a macro to avoid fear really helps. For the Druid or the Paladin tank, however, things are not so easy unless Fear Ward is present. Patch 2.3 changed the cooldown of Fear Ward to 3 minutes, making it difficult to rely on by itself for the encounter. But since Nightbane will chase the tank even if the tank is feared, raid members can run out of range of the fear to avoid getting caught by a cleave or tail sweep. A tremor totem in the tank's group is a huge help for this strategy by reducing the amount of time the tank gets feared.\nEveryone else.\nHealing in this phase is not particularly difficult, with the fight resembling a simple &lt;a href=\"Boss%23Tank%20and%20Spank\"&gt;Tank and Spank&lt;/a&gt;, but be careful not to rip aggro with an early heal on the tank. Nightbane has a lot of burst potential when his melee is combined with his cleave and smoldering breath, so healers need to be somewhat awake, even though they can get outside the &lt;a href=\"five%20second%20rule\"&gt;5 second rule&lt;/a&gt; quite often. \nAnother ability that might be problematic during the Ground Phase is the Charred Earth. Assuming it appears beneath Group 1, Group 1 should briefly shift over to Group 2's position until the area is safe again, and vice-versa. Occasionally, both groups may fall victim to Charred Earth at the same time\u2014if this happens, all healers and ranged must temporarily shift \"forward\" to remain in range of the tank and the boss. Consequently, both groups will be closer to the boss and vulnerable to the fear. The tank must be ready to take preventative measures as required should the raid's healers suddenly find themselves incapacitated. When melee DPS are avoiding Charred Earth, they must be careful not to move into the area vulnerable to Cleave (ahead of his front legs) or Tail Swipe (behind his back legs). Any melee-type wandering into his head area are prone to being one-shot.\nThis is a long, healing-intensive fight that can last upwards of 10 minutes. Timed correctly, many mana-regenerative cooldowns such as &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfiend\"&gt;Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt; may be used twice during this encounter.\nFlight Phase.\nNightbane flies into the air, signaling the start of the Flight Phase. Flight Phase lasts until Nightbane has finished using his two abilities of Rain of Bones and Smoking Blast.\nPreparing for Smoking Blast.\nImmediately after Nightbane summons skeletons while in his Flight Phase, it targets the raid member with the highest threat and repeatedly casts Smoking Blast on this target. This is typically a healer.\nSmoking blast deals physical damage, so the more armor the target has, the better. Paladins would be ideal; however, due to their mechanics, it is very difficult for them to have the highest threat. Even if paladins have improved righteous fury, their healing threat generation is only 0.5*1.9=0.95 compared to the 0.7*0.8=0.56 threat (Priest or Druid with blessing of salvation, 0.595 for a Shaman) that the other healers will have. In general, it is fairly difficult for the paladin to compete with healing aggro for Smoking Blast against priests and shaman who have AoE heals. \nHealers must be prepared to spam heals on whomever the affected primary healer is. This will likely occupy a majority of your healers' time, which complicates dealing with the skeletons. When formulating a strategy for killing the skeletons, remember that your healers are otherwise occupied.\nAlternate Method #1\nThis method requires a Resto Shaman with &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt;. When Nightbane takes off, have the Shaman place an Earth Shield on the tank. Once the Rain of Bones begins and the skeletons start to spawn, have the tank grab aggro on as many of them as possible (Thunderclap [improved talent works wonders here] for Warrior tanks, or Swipe for Feral Druids). The skeletons will proc the Earth Shield on the tank, thus generating the healing aggro on the tank. This will limit healing in multiple ways, 1) only one to three people actually taking damage from Rain of bones, 2) Earth Shield will keep the tank up easily provided the resto shaman's gear is decent, 3) the Smoking Blast will only be hitting the tank with the Earth Shield (which will in turn proc it more). You can drop a Tranquil Air Totem if the tank is not in the healers' group to ensure that healing can still go out, but Smoking Blast will hit the tank.\nDealing with skeletons.\nAll healers and ranged collapse to where the main tank is standing in order to avoid the Fireball Barrage. Once Rain of Bones starts, all players must immediately move away to avoid taking too much AoE damage. Five skeletons will spawn during the Rain of Bones. These hit fairly hard. To mitigate this damage:\nLacking a good Paladin tank, it may be more effective to kill the spawns one at a time rather than AoEing them. Be warned: Due to the Smoking Blast occupying the healers, there isn't much chance for survival if a mage or warlock draws aggro from AoE.\nAlso, If you are still having trouble with this fight being the Skeletons still are not going down fast, people are dying or its killing the healers mana, It might be an idea to have your raid prepared with &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; from the Undead side of Stratholme. Using this when all 5 are up will deal decent damage, and if everyone that can't AoE uses this they should go down much quicker.\nTransition to the Ground Phase.\nTen seconds before Nightbane lands, all members of the raid should fall back to the previous positions, dragging whatever skeletons are still alive with them. Ideally, all adds will be dead at this point, but having one or two still up before Nightbane descends is fine. The tank must remember to keep an eye on the casting bar, and stance dance to avoid an early fear. A recent change has made this fight a bit easier for raids that do not have fear wards/tremor totems/warrior tanks. Nightbane will keep aggro on the tank, regardless of whether the tank is feared or not. This introduces the challenge of the tank being feared into the ranged group, but it does make paladin and druids tanks more of an option.\nThe most dangerous parts of this fight are the transitions between the Flight and Ground Phases, when the main tank must reestablish aggro. Hunters' &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; is especially useful here, to make sure the boss goes directly for the tank.\nGround Phase begins again when Nightbane lands, rinse and repeat at 50% and 25% until victory.\nWarrior Tanks - the stance dance is thus:"}

The Nightbane consists of both former &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and cursed &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Their most prominent presence is in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, but they are said to have come from &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;, a cave to the south. There, &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;a mysterious scythe&lt;/a&gt; jutting from the cave wall. When he pulled it free, the worgen spontaneously began to appear, and have since grown in number.\nOnce led by &lt;a href=\"Gervase\"&gt;Gervase&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightbane pack also served &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;, with Revil Kost referring to them as the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of Gervase at the hand of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, Marus succeeded him as the new leader of the Nightbane pack.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; traveled from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to find the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, having heard he too had summoned worgen into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and hoping he could help her with her troubles concerning the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. During her journey, she passed through Duskwood and was killed in &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Varkas\"&gt;Varkas&lt;/a&gt;. The scythe laid within the abandoned mine for some time until a man known as &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; unearthed it from its resting place inside of the cave. In doing so he unwittingly summoned a large amount of worgen from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe worgen summoned in the cave cut down Jitters' companions (he himself was able to flee and escape) and began to terrorize the woods. Eventually coming to be known as the Nightbane Pack, these worgen slowly but surely began to take over the woods, which had been corrupted steadily by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy unleashed in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; in the years following the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. Various &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farmholds&lt;/a&gt; and areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; were taken over, their occupants either turned or killed, the lucky ones barely escaping with their lives.\nWith the appearance of the Nightbane worgen, the woods of Duskwood were not only corrupted but made extremely dangerous to traverse. Along with the worgen, several other shadowy forces began to root themselves within the forest, such as &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who ended up causing the graveyards of Duskwood to be filled with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. This left the humans of the area restricted to one safe location in the woods, the town of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, where the militia known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; kept a vigil to repel the worgen and other shadowy forces.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the return of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance fold, the Nightbane came under the eyes of the Gilnean worgen. The afflicted Gilneans occupied the once-abandoned town of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to find worgen among the Nightbane who were not too far gone to the &lt;a href=\"mindless%20state\"&gt;mindless state&lt;/a&gt; and could be saved as they were.\n&lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt; became afflicted by the worgen curse and was brought into the Nightbane pack. He was later saved thanks to the efforts of the Gilneans and adventurers, becoming one of the first worgen from Duskwood to be successfully brought back from a feral state, second to &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;. This gave &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Harris\"&gt;Oliver Harris&lt;/a&gt;, the lead apothecary attempting to cure the Nightbane, renewed hope.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Valorn\"&gt;Valorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt; returned the Scythe of Elune to Duskwood with the intention of giving it to a druid adventurer, it was stolen by &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightbane pack, drawn to the Scythe and seeking the power of &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, followed Ariden to his base in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. They attacked the adventurer who was also seeking the Scythe of Elune and were promptly defeated.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt;, they were driven mad by the Scythe.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the residents of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; captured a few members of the Nightbane pack for alchemical testing, and were then plagued by a particularly ferocious member named &lt;a href=\"Bloodeyes\"&gt;Bloodeyes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; asked a &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; to subdue her in order to test cures on the captives as well.\nTerritories.\nNightbane territory also includes the &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Orchard\"&gt;Rotting Orchard&lt;/a&gt;. Each area is lit by torches, campfires, or bonfires, and contains camps, tents, huts, or stolen goods. In Brightwood Grove, &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20Worgen\"&gt;Nightbane worgen&lt;/a&gt; fight over &lt;a href=\"Ravaged%20Dire%20Wolf\"&gt;ravaged dire wolves&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20Dark%20Runner\"&gt;Nightbane Dark Runners&lt;/a&gt; patrol the area, and &lt;a href=\"Fenros\"&gt;Fenros&lt;/a&gt; walks from camp to camp. At Roland's Doom, packs of &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20Vile%20Fang\"&gt;Nightbane Vile Fang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20Tainted%20One\"&gt;Nightbane Tainted Ones&lt;/a&gt; fight outside, while the latter and the den mother &lt;a href=\"Nefaru\"&gt;Nefaru&lt;/a&gt; can be found inside. In the Rotting Orchard, &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20Shadow%20Weaver\"&gt;Nightbane Shadow Weavers&lt;/a&gt; practice magic and occupy the buildings and camps, while &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20Stalker\"&gt;Nightbane Stalkers&lt;/a&gt; keep watch from the shadows, and the pack leader &lt;a href=\"Marus\"&gt;Marus&lt;/a&gt; patrols between its camps and his den. Nightbane worgen have also been seen as far as &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; when captured, as well as &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; when seeking the Scythe of Elune."}

{"id": "441007", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=441007", "title": "Nightborne", "text": "The nightborne (also spelled the Nightborne) or shal'dorei in the &lt;a href=\"Shalassian\"&gt;native tongue&lt;/a&gt; are a powerful and mystical race of &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; who live in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Since the city was first separated from the rest of the world over 10,000 years ago, they are no longer true &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and have evolved by the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; into a unique elven species. For the majority of their secluded existence, virtually the entire group resided in the ancient city of Suramar and were led solely until recent times by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. The nightborne race owes much of its unique physical characteristics to its long dependence on the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient source of power crafted by Suramar's &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; residents during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Over their lengthy isolation, the exposure of the nightborne to the Nightwell's energies gradually transformed them from their original Kaldorei night elven appearance to their present darker, more night-based form.\nAt the climax of the War of the Ancients, as the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; began to crumble, the night elves of Suramar City, led by the Highborne Elisande, erected an immensely powerful shield that protected and isolated the city from the remainder of the Legion that overran &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the erupting sundering. There they would remain in self-imposed isolation for millennia. For the long period of time following the war's conclusion, the nightborne continued excelling and progressing in the arcane arts and culture of the Kaldorei empire, their isolation preserving a strand of the ancient culture of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; pristinely over so many millennia.\nThis period of content isolation, which saw the shal'dorei flourish, would eventually come to an abrupt end with the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Presented with a terrible ultimatum, a majority of the nightborne leaders, following the &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande's&lt;/a&gt; lead, ultimately chose to ally with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in order to preserve their civilization. Despite this, the ensuing Legion invasion saw the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, composed of nightborne dissidents opposed to the Legion and assisted by outlander &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt;, rise into open insurgency against Suramar's ruling powers. With the aid of various forces from outside the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightfallen were successful in not only liberating Suramar City from the Burning Legion's control, but also in freeing the nightborne people from their addiction to the Nightwell. Through consuming the fruit of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Arcan%27dor\"&gt;Arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; tree, the shal'dorei thus finally succeeded in escaping their dependence on the power source that had at once both preserved and enslaved them.\nAt its height, the nightborne civilization is thought to have reached the pinnacle of elven magical prowess and sophistication, continuing the only unbroken line of magical progression of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; it alone of all the existing &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; groups, successfully continued in.\nBackground.\nThe nightborne are the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; who fought the Legion in the great War of the Ancients to defend their home and close a second demonic portal using the Eye of Aman'thul that would have overtaken and outflanked the resistance forces led by &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; blasted some of Suramar to the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, although a good portion of it remained above shore in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; due to the efforts of the resident &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, who crafted a magical shield that kept the center of their city together. This shield would stay up for 10,000 years, as the Highborne led group believed the world outside of Suramar had been destroyed. While the city was shielded, it was next to impossible for normal Nightborne to leave, though some illegally did through skillful navigation or by forced exile. Under their shield in a perpetual shroud of night they would evolve into an even deeper night-based state over millennia through the energies of their arcane font, the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, the great source of power they would come to totally rely on for survival within the impenetrable shield. These night elves would come to call themselves the shal'dorei or nightborne. When the city ran out of food the nightborne started utilizing the substance of their Nightwell as nourishment and thus were spared death. However this soon caused them to become unable to survive without drawing magic from the Nightwell. Crime in the nightborne society was punished by exile. Cut off from their Nightwell, the exiled would first diminish into the starved &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; state. Continuing without nourishment in this state causes further degradation into &lt;a href=\"Mindless%20state\"&gt;mindless&lt;/a&gt; creatures called the &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Nightfallen, the state of Withered is irreversible and death follows not long after.\n10,000 years later, the nightborne would lower their shield and surrender to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of their leader. worked alongside this leader, &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. Not many nightborne agree with Elisande's decision, though they keep their disagreement a secret. With loyalists and demons marching together in the streets of Suramar, fear and distrust grips other elves' hearts and family turns against family. &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt; is the method by which the nightborne imbibe the Nightwell's energies, and the palace rations it to control the populace.\nA resistance group of nightborne and Nightfallen led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; formed in the hidden hallways of the ruins of Shal'aran and is now backed up by &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;. Together they seek to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and inspire the nightborne populace to remember they were once brave and noble thus overcoming their fear of exile in order to rise up against the current &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; occupation and bring to justice those who betrayed their people by allying with them.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Zandalar\"&gt;war in Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, nightborne were present in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; and competed against the Alliance and their &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt; personally joined the Horde in its war campaign against the Alliance, notably helping to rescue &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; from Kul Tiran captivity. &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; later journeyed with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and the remnants of the Horde navy to &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, the underwater remnants of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s former sister city &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. Oculeth helped provide a portal for Horde adventurers, while Thalyssra and Lor'themar eventually faced and managed to narrowly defeat the Highborne's former ruler, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; helped the nightborne &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;Vintner Iltheux&lt;/a&gt; manage &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; production for the Horde, an achievement which helped contribute to their people joining their ranks shortly afterwards.\nCulture.\nIntroduction.\nThe culture of the Shal'dorei is the culture of the Suramar region of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; preserved pristinely in seclusion for over 10,000 years. Isolated in their city refuge under the impenetrable shield, the night elven empire arcane culture of Suramar continued uninterrupted in relative safety and serenity, while their counterparts who survived the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, laid aside the arcane culture for a nature-based one under their self-imposed ban on the use of the Arcane for spells. Similar to the night elven &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; group of House Shen'dralar in &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; continued on in the traditions and customs of that era, but unlike the Shen'dralar of Eldre'Thalas that eventually fell to ruin towards the end of its 10 000 year isolation, their refuge endured under diligent and faithful stewardship. The great terror of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;the Legion&lt;/a&gt; invasion would fade and life as they always knew it would resume in the timeless bubble. With the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; ingeniously employed to solve even shortages of food and armor, the night elves would advance their knowledge and hone their craft in the arcane arts to new heights over the millennia as they transitioned into nightborne.\nThe night elves ruled the world 10,000 years ago, and no one came close when they built elegant cities and sculpted graceful forests, nor was any race a match for their mastery of magic, knowledge, and wisdom. In time they would grow haughty and regard other races with contempt, and one of the reasons &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who saw value in other races often found himself a social pariah in his home &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;city of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe nightborne of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; have an air of superiority that often comes across, especially amongst loyalists and the elite (with exceptions) as pompous. They revel in their unparalleled magical civilization but having no exposure to the current races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; till the rebellion led an invading force to free Suramar, many still regard outside races and the world as it was back then, full of the unworthy, the uncultured, and low born far beneath the standards and levels of the nightborne civilization. These were the less admirable qualities of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; civilization back then, and the shal'dorei continue in them as if nothing has changed and as if they still remain the center of the world.\nAn ancient Kaldorei tradition &lt;a href=\"Tal%27ashar\"&gt;Tal'ashar&lt;/a&gt; is an honor duel to death still used by the nightborne, though in very rare occasions. It can be used to settle disputes and prove oneself worthy over an adversary, usually when key positions or appointments are made that the challenger isn't satisfied with. The challenger or defender may appoint a champion to fight on their behalf. The victor also gets to keep the nobility titles of the defeated participant.\nWhile several nightborne NPCs seem to vaguely acknowledge &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; recalling how the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Fal%27adora\"&gt;Temple of Fal'adora&lt;/a&gt; once \"glowed with with prayers to Elune\"), it is implied that worship of Elune gradually receded after Suramar was sealed off from the rest of the world, without sunlight or &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt;, and its inhabitants turned to the arcane-based Nightwell instead of traditional religion to shape and sustain their culture, with there being no known priestess of Elune remaining within the city.\nStructure.\nThe nightborne present, at first hand, the Highborne society of pre-Sundering Azeroth. Whilst the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; group of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; that recently joined &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;the Alliance&lt;/a&gt; moved on from such occupancy with status and a city-centric civilization after the Sundering and the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; broke away to create a new type of society, the nightborne have continued on this pre-Sundering Highborne path to the present.\nTo the nightborne, reputation and status are of the utmost concern, and morality and principles of right and wrong are viewed too often in that light. At their core, however, the nightborne, like their night elven kin, do not find themselves short of noble souls stepping up to take a stand against the crashing tide of darkness that threatens to sweep their beloved city and the rest of the world in fel fire.\nLike all night elven culture, beauty and perfection are often the end goal, but their vanity has set them apart from their druidic kin. But beneath the pomp and airy rhetoric of the loyalists, the real plight of the city under the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's&lt;/a&gt; occupation is witnessed by visiting heroes ushered in under disguise by the &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; resistance and guided by the &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; and her friend &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;. They expose the true suffering of the nightborne and the noble character of these ancient night elven folk. They diligently and tenaciously encourage the heart of their people in the face of oppression and callous indifference of a not insubstantial number of the nobility often too willing to turn a blind eye. Nightborne society is full of Artisans, Vintners, highly skilled Craftsmen, the military Duskwatch guard, and the elites of society, magic is woven into every aspect and discipline. As it was in the days of the Kaldorei Empire, spell casting is taught from a very early age amongst nightborne children.\nGroups.\nThere are four main groups identifiable among the nightborne:\nLife with the Legion amidst.\nThe full horror of the Legion occupation unfolded as the storyline progressed, as despite allying with these people, the legion use them to fuel their soul engines and devices, some have rightly risen in outrage, but too many are cowed for fear of losing access to their food source and exiled to become withered. Seeing what needs to be done, the resistance aims to help and stir the people up against their occupiers, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; \"I would rather die than be a puppet for the legion.\"\nYet despite &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s decision to accept the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's&lt;/a&gt; ultimatum, and some of the cruelty exhibited by the loyalists, some measure of justice is meted out. A nightborne noble is thrown out for punishing her servants too much. &lt;a href=\"Iadreth\"&gt;Iadreth&lt;/a&gt; is not happy about it. \nMagic.\nWhile the usage of some forms of magic limited to higher-ranked officials, magic is all-encompassing in Suramar and the nightborne culture. Magic constructs are common, some of them for patrol and guard duty while others for cleaning duties. Enchanted magic collars were used in the Suramar Menagerie to keep its exhibition animals tame. Other magic objects such as enchanted books and pens, brooms, and magic-based security modules can be found across Suramar. Some nightborne seem to have great respect for magic, such as Oculeth.\nBesides &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;, the nightborne also favored mana gems as magical \"snacks\".\nLikely in part due to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;'s connection to &lt;a href=\"Aman%27thul\"&gt;Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s mastery over temporal magic was said to rival that of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and she was capable of placing an entire army of three elven groups into a long-term stasis, as well as stopping time and sending her enemies back into the recent past. Some &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Tempomancer\"&gt;nightborne guards&lt;/a&gt; as well as other elves such as &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Vandros\"&gt;Advisor Vandros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tempomancer%20Virinya\"&gt;Tempomancer Virinya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; herself also appear capable of using time magic (the latter casting a time stop spell to suspend &lt;a href=\"Erasmus%20Moonblade\"&gt;Erasmus Moonblade&lt;/a&gt; in midair), notably to reverse damage and heal themselves as well as to increase the haste of their attacks, and it is even used to expedite their manufacturing of arcwine. However, Elisande's level of mastery nevertheless does not appear to be extremely widespread, as Oculeth stated that much of the nightborne's knowledge died with their former leader.\nRelationships with other elven groups.\nThe nightborne are a group of &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; transformed into a new race by the power of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. They represent the ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; culture from when they were the rulers of the world, before they abandoned &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;. Though they use the night elven names, themes, castes, and saber mounts of the original ancient night elven culture along with its traditions, the nightborne speak an offshoot of the ancient elvish language.\nNightborne and night elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; worked alongside the nightborne aiding the nightborne resistance led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. All is not lost with the Nightfallen state, as already the night elves are at work with the rebellion in trying to help them, and at the forefront of the various efforts is Valewalker Farodin standing alongside the First Arcanist herself, stating that: \"In the changing of seasons, the truth will be revealed.\" and sensing potential within the nightborne.\nThe destructive effect of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s allegiance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; continued in the attack on &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard%20Stronghold\"&gt;Moon Guard Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, hours after the shield vanished, as the interaction between the city group and their surrounding country counterparts continues with the arcane &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; group. Although the nightborne loyalists managed to wipe out most of the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; despite considerable resistance, \"\"Commander Domitille represents the very essence of the nightborne's corruption. Abhorrent of power not their own, enamored with their Grand Magistrix to the point of zealotry, and focused utterly on the destruction of the Moon Guard. Take her helm to &lt;a href=\"Lothrius%20Mooncaller\"&gt;Lothrius Mooncaller&lt;/a&gt; as proof of her demise.\"\" Despite the nightborne believing them to wield \"inferior magics\", the Moon Guard remnant in reality seem to be much more effective against the nightborne invaders than they against them, though their superior numbers nevertheless won the day.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Thalrenus%20Rivertree\"&gt;Thalrenus Rivertree&lt;/a&gt;, a Moon Guard survivor, \"The nightborne came to our gates hours after the shield over Suramar fell. We thought them friends, despite our long separation.\u00a0We were wrong. They poured into our stronghold and began the slaughter. We were unprepared. Though we fought, we were beaten. The keep is lost. Our leaders have perished and their corpses lay in the streets. Find them, give them their final rites.\" Later, Lothrius, Thalrenus, and &lt;a href=\"Syrana%20Starweaver\"&gt;Syrana Starweaver&lt;/a&gt; were invited to &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to make amends for Elisande's crimes against their ancient neighbors and friends. The three Moon Guard survivors subsequently openly joined the rebellion, journeying to &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt; and observing the arrival of Tyrande and Liadrin's elves. Apparently, the nightborne initially feigned friendship with some of their old acquaintances, at least long enough for books to be lent by the Moon Guard to some of their elite in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;. The Moon Guard were familiar with the nightborne's magics, but were never allowed access to the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Heart of Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, reserved only for the Queen's favored among the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, but were still able to tap its power with some assistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Nighteyes\"&gt;Nighteyes&lt;/a&gt;, a kaldorei druid, was shocked by the nightborne loyalists using magical devices to trap animals and take them back to the zoo, remarking, \"Have they fallen so far whiles they were under the shield all this time...\" He soon realized that such behavior did not pertain to all the nightborne of Suramar, although most of the nightborne, having been secluded in a major center for millennia, lacked the high standards the night elves hold themselves to the reverence of wildlife and nature. &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah%20Refugee\"&gt;Night elven druidic refugees&lt;/a&gt; from neighboring Val'sharah eventually joined the nightborne rebels, some even traveling to their haven in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and assisting their efforts against the Legion in Suramar.\nWhile the Resistance apparently welcomed the night elves with open arms, the view was seemingly not shared by Elisande and those loyal to her. When the night elves gathered their forces and finally confronted her at the gates of Suramar, Tyrande, one of her former subjects who fled their city millennia ago, was the first to be addressed, with Elisande accusing her people of disgracing their ancient heritage, followed by insulting the quel'dorei of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; for \"diluting their heritage\", and then the blood elves for allying with \"misfits and monsters\". This exchange also indicates that Elisande at least is aware of both the night elves and the high elves, as well as their activities and societies to some extent.\nSome night elves in Suramar such as &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Moonshade\"&gt;Sentinel Moonshade&lt;/a&gt; express dismay at how their nightborne brethren has seemingly forgotten how much their race lost in the War of the Ancients, although most of the nightborne seem to remember the conflict itself, with &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; recalling how Azshara betrayed their people to the ruin of the world, and &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; remembering how the legendary &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; was a \"brilliant tactician\". &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; also acknowledges that the nightborne were once his people's kin, but he can no longer tolerate their transgressors, such as &lt;a href=\"Leodrath\"&gt;Leodrath&lt;/a&gt;, in Azsuna, and asks adventurers to slay the &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;, whom he still regards as his brethren, at the &lt;a href=\"Ley-Ruins%20of%20Zarkhenar\"&gt;Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; further states that the nightborne are foreign to the other elves, despite their common heritage, noting that they have apparently changed immensely in their long separation from the other elven groups. &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt; later expressed his belief that his \"long lost brethren\" in Suramar belonged under a starry sky like their ancestors, not a conjured one.\nSome of the nightborne also apparently believe that the night elves' traditions are somewhat old-fashioned, with &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; remarking that it was difficult to imagine how they were all descended from the same elves, and that none of them were impervious to the passage of time. He also mentions that Suramar has not made bows in centuries when observing the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; practice archery, with &lt;a href=\"Victoire\"&gt;Victoire&lt;/a&gt; believing that &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Missiles\"&gt;Arcane Missiles&lt;/a&gt; served as a far more potent substitute to such \"primitive instruments\". However, despite these differences, &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, one of Suramar's elite arcanists, nevertheless pays respects to the night elves buried at &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt;, noting that her people owed their unmatched grace and intellect to the \"noble heritage\" of their kaldorei ancestors, and &lt;a href=\"Thaedris%20Feathersong\"&gt;Thaedris Feathersong&lt;/a&gt; also remained there, mourning what his people have become as well as the loss of his long-deceased Sentinel wife, &lt;a href=\"Latara\"&gt;Latara&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially, Tyrande says that the regrets she had for the highborne \"vanished when they went under that shield\" ten thousand years ago, as mentioned when she first had to attack the city of Suramar controlled by Magistrix Elisande. When the rebellion started however, she sided with Thalyssra's nightborne.\nThalyssra implied that \"Elune's wisdom\" guided Tyrande away from the nightborne, while the blood elves retained close relations with them. She found the Alliance too walled off and cloistered, and didn't want her people to \"endure such stagnation again\". She ultimately decided to heir ally with the Horde and give her people \"a fresh start\".\nMuch later, attacking Azshara's armies in Zin-Azshari, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; criticized the Highborne for the downfall of night elven civilization and, jointly, the people of Suramar for walling their city off as Kalimdor burned around them. Thalyssra pointed out that they still courageously rebelled against Azshara.\nNightborne and blood elves.\nLike the Highborne of House Shen'dralar introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", there is very little interaction between the blood elves and the new night elven group the nightborne until the final assault against the Nighthold is about to begin. The blood elves found some familiarity in the Highborne-based culture of the pre-Sundering night elves on display in the nightborne of Suramar as theirs, though different, was built off that. The blood elves joined the allied force of the Alliance and Horde under the direction of the Resistance in the final assault on the Nighthold.\nSome blood elves have great sympathy for the nightborne and understand their situation with a genuine desire to help. Grand Magister Rommath said that the battle for the liberation of Suramar is of enormous importance to the elf-kind future.\nA few nightborne respect the blood elves, as &lt;a href=\"Victoire\"&gt;Victoire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; made these comments about the blood elves:\nSilgryn: \"These blood elves are battle-hardened and disciplined. Their strength will be most useful.\"\nVictoire: \"These blood elves have some formidable magic. Let us hope it is enough to counter the might of the Nightwell.\"\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be the case for the nobility as Elisande showed:\nElisande: \"Sin'dorei? Of all the elves, I thought you might understand the choice I made to save my people. Instead, you ally with misfits and monsters. [...] Each of you has debased your proud lineage. Each of you has forgotten the ancient power that is our birthright.\"\nGrand Magister Rommath explained that the blood elven blood knights and magisters will form the core of the assault, striking true into the heart of the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; journeyed abroad the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" to contribute their respective peoples' talents and strengths to the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. During a deep conversation, Silgryn and Liadrin noted their people's similar experiences, and Liadrin mentioned that the Horde provided the necessary allies they required to stand against a world which often turned its back to them, leaving Silgryn with much to ponder.\nOutside world.\nIsolation did somewhat taint the view of the outside world for most nightborne. As exemplified by their &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;menagerie&lt;/a&gt; in Suramar, they now have a naive view of other lands and their inhabitants. Now that they have rejoined the other races of Azeroth, many nightborne started exploring the world again. Those that volunteered for the &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; expedition alongside the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; were surprised to learn that jungles were actually wet, hot and full of insects."}

Shal'dorei ride &lt;a href=\"manasaber\"&gt;manasaber&lt;/a&gt;s as their racial mount. Due to their isolation, the nightborne's language of &lt;a href=\"Shalassian\"&gt;Shalassian&lt;/a&gt; is unique to them.

To protect this font of power, the leaders of the Nightborne struck a bargain with the Burning Legion that plunged their kingdom into civil war. After fighting for freedom from their demonic masters, the Nightborne seek allies in the Horde to help them reclaim their place in the world.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\"The nightborne of Suramar spent millennia isolated behind an arcane barrier, slowly transformed by the magic of the Nightwell. These proud, noble elves now seek to reclaim their place in Azeroth.\"\nOpening cutscene.\nThalyssra: \"For ten-thousand years, Suramar was the only world we knew. As the ages passed, Azeroth changed around us... and fell into the Legion's grasp. To secure our people's future, you must help reclaim our place in Azeroth. Venture forth alongside new allies and show the world that the legacy of the nightborne is one of nobility... and strength.\"\nHistory.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the shal'dorei wished to rejoin the world. Thalyssra believed that it was unlikely they would share any common ground with the Horde, and that it would only be natural to join (or re-join, as it were) with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, which Thalyssra herself was born as. After an exchange between Thalyssra and a skeptically cautious &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra became disillusioned with the night elves' apparent arrogance and mistrust, while &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; of the blood elves expressed a similar relationship with the night elves. Thalyssra also felt that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as an organization was too walled off and too cloistered, an undesirable trait after having been literally walled off for 10,000 years. After an offer of mutual friendship from Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, the shal'dorei leader decided that it would be best to ally with the Horde, who share ideals similar to those of the nightborne.\nAppearance.\nThe nightborne look similar to night elves, but their overall appearance is darker. Their skin does not have the brighter skin tones of purple and pink that night elves do, instead having more pale skin with dark blue-purpleish tones. A shal'dorei's hair is also far less colorful than the kaldorei's, having only white, gray, black, or very pale-blue hair colors. Glowing tattoos seem common among nightborne, though whether these are cosmetic or a result of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;'s energy is unknown. Their eyes glow light-blue. \nUnlocking.\nIn order to unlock the ability to play as nightborne, players must have a level 40 Horde character and complete the following &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race%20recruitment%20quests\"&gt;recruitment questline&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The populace of the city were thus saved and the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; source became a direct source of sustenance. Fate would deal a cruel blow as the energies of the Nightwell were addictive, and elves unable to retrieve Arcwine nourishment would begin to starve and regress. \nWithout this magical sustenance they began regressing into a weakened state known as nightfallen, as is expected of anyone starving. However, instead of dying of starvation after the standard period of time passed, the nightfallen would then enter a fully mindless state, and become creatures completely driven by instinct and their individual self lost \u2014 a fate called &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;, that is considered worse than death. Death follows if the creature cannot find magical sustenance. \nThe descent into withered is not immediate, and can take up to 50 days. When hungering, nightfallen stand with a hunched posture, clutching at themselves at they uncontrollably tremble from withdrawal. They also have a habit of scratching their jawline. Nightfallen are mostly in full control of their faculties and find feeding on others for magical sustenance deplorable. &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;Withered&lt;/a&gt; nightfallen however are attracted to magical sources and will attempt to draw mana from anything, this includes magical shields, &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s, items of power, and other living beings.\nNightfallen that have not entered the withered stage can fully recover back to nightborne if they regain access to &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt;; nightfallen who have eaten an &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; fruit have their dependency on the Nightwell cured, and also eventually recover into healthy nightborne. However, once they cross the withered threshold, there is no known return to sanity. The nightborne are as yet unable to revert withered to what they once were.\nWhile appearing similar at first glance, withered is a very different state to that of &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. The main difference is that becoming withered is due to a failure to feed on the Nightwell's energies, it is due to withdrawal, while blood elves become wretched due to a reckless abuse of arcane magic. Furthermore, withered are mindless, feral creatures, while wretched still have full control of their mental abilities.\nKnown.\n\"For the nightfallen that are a part of &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; faction see the faction.\""}

Led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightfallen waged a successful war of resistance against Elisande's loyalist forces, eventually taking control of Suramar.\nWith their success, they liberated Suramar and its people from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and expelled the demons from the city. They would also continue to aid the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;wider fight&lt;/a&gt; against the Legion. Now sole rulers of their people, Thalyssra and the Nightfallen began to forge a new future for the nightborne race. In this new role, they would be responsible for the subsequent nightborne entry into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor most of the rebellion, the main headquarters of the Nightfallen remained the underground complex of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, though they maintained bases and safehouses throughout Suramar. Having come to power in the city, they are now based in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; itself, the traditional seat of power for Suramar's rulers.\nHistory.\nRebellion.\nThe Nightfallen were founded as a direct result of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s first arrived on the world in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, they made contact with the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Threatened with annihilation, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; reached an accord with the Legion, though many citizens opposed this decision. One of these dissidents, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; personally led a failed coup to prevent Elisande lowering Suramar's defenses to the Legion. Despite her efforts, the attempt was betrayed and crushed, with Thalyssra herself escaping on the brink of death.\nThough her city was now occupied by demonic forces, the First Arcanist refused to give up the struggle. She made her way to the subterranean ruins of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and made contact with outsiders also resisting the Burning Legion based from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; eventually responded to Thalyssra's plea, saving her life and claiming Shal'Aran. Her position stable, Thalyssra began to take the first steps in forming an effective resistance movement.\nFortunately for the fledgling rebellion, many nightborne were still strongly (albeit secretly) opposed to the Legion's arrival. Before long, many key figures had been recruited, such as &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;. Refugees and exiled dissidents from across Suramar joined the faction, which had become known as the \"Nightfallen\" in reference to the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;devolved state&lt;/a&gt; most of the rebels were in, cut off as they were from the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. They also began training &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; to help them fight their opponents.\nWith the help of their foreign allies, the Nightfallen quickly gained ground and support against Elisande and her forces. The war they waged was one of stealth, employing hit-and-run tactics and keeping to &lt;a href=\"Masquerade\"&gt;disguises&lt;/a&gt; and the shadows. The figure of First Arcanist Thalyssra in particular inspired hope and support among the populace, while Elisande's worsening cruelty alienated many of her allies. The &lt;a href=\"dusk%20lily\"&gt;dusk lily&lt;/a&gt;, a flower associated personally with Thalyssra, would become the main symbol of both the rebellion and the Nightfallen themselves.\nAs the conflict reached its climax, the Nightfallen were able to reverse their withering state through the fruit of the powerful &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; tree, which freed them from their magical addiction. Coupled with the arrival of three other elven armies to support them, the Nightfallen were ready to march on Suramar City and topple the Grand Magistrix's regime. After battling through the city and laying siege to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, they and their allies were finally successful; Elisande was slain and the Burning Legion firmly defeated in Suramar.\nIn a closing act of the civil war, and as part of her new role in leading her people, Thalyssra made the decision to let the waning Nightwell die. She reasoned that its death would mark a new beginning awaited the nightborne, with the Nightfallen guiding them in rejoining the world.\nNew beginnings.\nThe Nightfallen would continue to support their allies in the ongoing war in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually proved successful. &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; itself has suffered terribly in the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, and work was done to rebuild their society and their city. First Arcanist Thalyssra assumed the role of leader, while other prominent Nightfallen also took up positions of power from the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, once the rebellion's sworn enemy, was assimilated into the new regime. The deserter-turned-rebel &lt;a href=\"Victoire\"&gt;Victoire&lt;/a&gt; was placed in charge of the security force and made First Blade under Thalyssra.\nDespite the successes they had achieved, Thalyssra was convinced that the nightborne should seek out allies as they took their new place in the world. Though she considered joining the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, in the end she and the other Nightfallen would ally with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In the lead-up to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightfallen would join the Horde in their preparations for war, while many new nightborne &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s ventured out into the world for the first time.\nReputation.\nMany quests in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; award reputation, and completing &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20But%20Not%20Forgotten\"&gt;Nightfallen But Not Forgotten&lt;/a&gt; opens up their world quests. Progressing further into the faction's storyline unlocks more quests for additional reputation. &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Remnant%20of%20Falanaar\"&gt;Arcane Remnant of Falanaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Tablet%20of%20Falanaar\"&gt;Arcane Tablet of Falanaar&lt;/a&gt; both come from chests in &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Army%20Training%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Withered Army Training (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, and after completing the mission.\n&lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Playable Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; begin at exalted reputation by default.\n\"These exiled &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; elves suffer withdrawals after being cut off from the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;.

As part of their quests, they will need to be sated once as an example mechanic. From 100 to 1 takes about one day, thus, they each have a daily feed requirement of 50 Ancient Mana. This will reward a unique one hour buff and 75 reputation.\nTheir state will be listed as \"Stable\" until their Arcane Thirst reaches 1, at which point they will be listed as \"Withering\".

The rebellion was formed in opposition to the Grand Magistrix's decision to allow the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; and the sacred &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for sparing the lives of the city's denizens.\nAlthough small initially, the rebellion began to grow in numbers and power due to both outside assistance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt;, and the callous policies of Elisande. The movement was based from the underground complex of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and was in open conflict with the Grand Magistrix's larger forces based out of Suramar City.\nThe insurgents' ultimate goal was the overthrow of Elisande's regime, and the expulsion of all demonic forces from the city. The rebels largely used covert tactics, working to weaken the regime in Suramar from within while gaining the support of the city's populace.\nHaving secured immense gains, and enlisting the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, the rebels eventually launched an assault on the city itself, and even succeeded in laying siege to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, Elisande's seat of power and location of the Nightwell. With their allies in tow, the Nightfallen staged a final assault on the citadel, seeking to end the Burning Legion's grip on Suramar permanently. Within the Nighthold, they would defeat both Elisande and , gaining full control of Suramar and finally liberating the nightborne people. \nPrelude: the failed coup.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; commenced its &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it emerged on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and quickly made contact with the nearby &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; civilization in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the nightborne, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, had maintained an arcane shield around their city, cutting them off from the remainder of the world for over 10,000 years. The principle source of energy for this shield was the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, a font of immense power that soon drew the attention of the invading &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; , responsible for the Legion's arrival, approached the Grrand Magistrix and her closest advisors with an offer: if they would allow the Burning Legion access to the city and, more importantly, the Nightwell, then the nightborne people would be spared and welcomed as allies by the Legion.\nThe question of what to do remained controversial among Elisande's advisors, with &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; the most outspoken opponent of agreeing to the demons' demands. Reluctantly, the Grand Magistrix finally decided to accept Gul'dan's proposal, believing it to be the only way to save Suramar. In response to this, Thalyssra and &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt;, along with several other nightborne, organized a preemptive coup d'\u00e9tat with the aim of eliminating Elisande to prevent the city's surrender.\nThe plan began to fall apart when the group was ambushed; only Thalyssra and Melandrus succeeded in making it towards the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. Before the plan could progress any farther however, Melandrus betrayed Thalyssra, revealing himself as having been loyal to Elisande and stabbing the First Arcanist through the back before pushing her from a platform. With the plot botched, Suramar's shield was, soon afterwards, lowered without opposition, and the Burning Legion moved to occupy the city.\nDespite sustaining critical injuries, First Arcanist Thalyssra managed to survive Melandrus's betrayal and escaped into the wilds of the surrounding region after witnessing the lowering of the shield. In a bad condition and lamenting her failure to save her people, Thalyssra nevertheless resolved to oppose Elisande and the Legion for as long as she could.\nHistory.\nShal'Aran.\nSoon after fleeing the city, Thalyssra created a spell that sent waves of magical energy out in all directions which contained an encrypted message, a cry for help. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; (a group also opposing the Legion's invasion), successfully intercepted and deciphered the secret message in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Wasting no time, he dispatched &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to investigate.\nKhadgar's adventurer soon picked up Thalyssra's trail and located her near the ruins at &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt;. The two overcame waves of hostile &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; starved of the Nightwell's energies) in the area, eventually taking refuge in a large, ancient, underground ruin known as &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; that the withered avoided. From this base, Thalyssra informed her new ally of all that had transpired, and began taking steps to recruit others who were opposed to &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s regime, and thus form a resistance movement.\nThe fledgling resistance, calling themselves &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, soon secured the support of &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;, a master of teleportation magic; &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on the &lt;a href=\"leyline\"&gt;leyline&lt;/a&gt; feeds around Suramar that could power Shal'Aran; and the noblewoman &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, who possessed powerful connections among the nightborne aristocracy.\nWhile beginning their efforts to oppose the Grand Magistrix, the Nightfallen uncovered the research of &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Kel%27danath\"&gt;Arcanist Kel'danath&lt;/a&gt; who experimented with the &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;. One of Kel'danath's subjects, known only as 'Subject 16', was also discovered and was notable to being unusually passive. By delving into his memories, Thalyssra was able to discover the cause of Subject 16's unusual demeanor\u2014a mysterious &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; seed located in &lt;a href=\"Moonshade%20Sanctum\"&gt;Moonshade Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyssra's agent returned from the Sanctum with the seed, as well as its ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; keeper &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt;. Farodin planted the seed in the central pedestal in Shal'Aran, where in time it would grow into a full arcan'dor tree of great power.\nThe Nightfallen were aided in their movement around the city region by the creation and expansion of a teleportation system, based from Shal'Aran, and overseen by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;. Using this, the rebels were able to enter Suramar directly, without having to get through the perimeter.\nResistance.\nAt this time, &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; also began to carry out their first covert actions in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, primarily aimed at disrupting the work of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s forces while loosening her grip on the city by gaining the support of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; people. Many of Suramar's citizens were uneasy with their city's alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and were further outraged at the sight of demons patrolling their streets. This was mainly restricted to the lower classes in shal'dorei society however, as the vast majority of the nightborne nobility remained staunchly loyal to Elisande. To curb dissent, and in response to rebel operations throughout the city, Grand Magistrix Elisande instituted rationing on the general population, restricting he supply of the &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; which provided the people with the energy from the Nightwell they required.\nThese harsh measures alienated many and gained sympathy for the Nightfallen, when they helped to distribute arcwine to the needy, often utilizing Suramar's numerous canal ways. The &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt; in southern Suramar, operated by the rebel sympathizer &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, became the centre of the arcwine distribution operation of the Nightfallen. As a result, this area also represented a large hot-spot for insurgent activity in the city. In this southern area of the city, guard patrols were frequently assaulted and citizens detained by the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; were forcibly released, although the authorities were unable to effectively catch the rebels.\nThe Nightfallen eventually sought to use the techniques of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; in the city to maintain the health and stability of the growing arcan'dor, and made contact with the vintner &lt;a href=\"Margaux\"&gt;Margaux&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to aid them. Due to the recent rationing, and the importance of the vineyards to the city, the compound had received additional security under the Grand Magistrix's orders. &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; was successful in securing the &lt;a href=\"Shadescale%20Flyeater\"&gt;Shadescale Flyeater&lt;/a&gt;s needed for the arcan'dor, although Margaux herself was confronted by Elisande's representative &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Durant\"&gt;Overseer Durant&lt;/a&gt;, who accused her of treason. Under the overseer's orders, Margaux was executed on the spot, which sparked outrage among the rebels when the news was delivered to them. They quickly set about avenging Margaux's death and assassinated Durant shortly afterwards.\nIn order to gain inside knowledge of Elisande's plans, the Nightfallen jumped at the opportunity when the position of a new advisor to the Grand Magistrix was announced. &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, her involvement with the Nightfallen still a secret, hoped to win this position in order to further the rebels' cause. With the aid of Thalyssra's &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, Ly'leth was able to secure the support of the majority of Suramar's noble families, while eliminating any competition. With Elisande in attendance, Ly'leth prepared to accept the position during a ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt;. Before this could happen, however, &lt;a href=\"Coryn\"&gt;Coryn&lt;/a&gt; of House Stelleris entered and challenged her to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27ashar\"&gt;Tal'ashar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an honor duel, the winner claiming the title. Ly'leth chose to send a champion (a disguised member of the resistance) in her stead to duel Coryn atop the Sanctum of Order. Emerging victorious, the champion secured for Ly'leth the title, which she then claimed unopposed. Ly'leth's new position proved invaluable to the Nightfallen, who now possessed a spy on the inside.\nLy'leth's new position began to immediately pay off as she aided &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a small group of Thalyssra's agents&lt;/a&gt; in infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; during a gala, with the objective of assassinating the Grand Magistrix, who would be in attendance. Making their way through the area, these champions successfully reached the Elisande, conversing with &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt; (and in particular, berating him for his failure to kill Thalyssra). Elisande quickly teleported away, tasking Melandrus with slaying the insurgents. After a battle, however, Melandrus was slain and Thalyssra, though sorry to hear of Elisande's escape, was pleased to learn of the death of her betrayer.\nAround the same time, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt; also tasked a group of champions with assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a series of abandoned tunnels running underneath the city\u2014and securing a map of Suramar's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s located there. Fighting through the tunnels, the party discovered and eliminated &lt;a href=\"General%20Xakal\"&gt;General Xakal&lt;/a&gt;, tasked by the Burning Legion with overseeing an invasion force prepared to seize the city should Elisande prove disloyal. Ultimately, the heroes were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Vandros\"&gt;Advisor Vandros&lt;/a&gt;, one of Elisande's lieutenants. Despite a heated fight, Vandros was defeated and the ley line map returned to Valtrois in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time, Nightfallen operations continued within Suramar City. Thalyssra's rebels also began to prioritize attacks in the city's eastern districts, where many of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; nobles loyal to &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, as well as many of the demonic occupying force, resided. One such attack occurred when the Nightfallen released the &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Su%27esh\"&gt;Su'esh&lt;/a&gt; from the city's &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;menagerie&lt;/a&gt;, leading to a rampage that killed many of Elisande's forces. The rebellion also targeted key individuals who represented obstacles to the city's liberation, assassinating them one by one to weaken the power of the Grand Magistrix within Suramar. The insurgents were aided in their efforts by a host of valuable contacts throughout the city, such as &lt;a href=\"Arluin\"&gt;Arluin&lt;/a&gt;, an informant in the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Bazaar\"&gt;Evermoon Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightfallen managed to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Purified%20Life%20Essence\"&gt;Purified Life Essence&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; itself in order to stabilize the failing arcan'dor, allowing it to continue to thrive. As the conflict progressed, the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt; feeds located around the Suramar region continued to be brought back online in order to divert more power to the base at &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. The resistance also recruited and trained more &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for an assault on the city.\nA Change of Seasons.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; neared maturity, but to transition it required a staggering amount of power. The Nightfallen leaders subsequently formulated a plan to create a manastorm using the Nightflow Conduit in the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting energy would then be channeled towards Shal'Aran and into the arcan'dor, feeding it. &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;her champion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arluin\"&gt;Arluin&lt;/a&gt; then infiltrated the Arcway, fighting their way through increased security to reach the Nightflow Conduit, and activated the Ephemeral Manastorm Projector to create the manastorm. The device, however, malfunctioned and the trio were caught in the eye of the manastorm. Arluin, sacrificing himself, left Thalyssra's protective shield and deactivated the projector.\nOculeth then quickly teleported the group back to Shal'Aran, where Thalyssra comforted Arluin as he succumbed to his wounds. Despite the consequences of the mission, the arcan'dor received the energy it required to mature. Thalyssra, &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, and Oculeth became the first of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; to consume the arcan'dor's fruit, which would free them from their dependence on the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; and restore them from their &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; forms.\nInsurrection.\nAs the conflict in Suramar heightened many refugees began fleeing the city, often to &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; headquarters at &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. After the successful raid on the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; and the maturing of the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt;, the rebels began to distribute the tree's fruit to many of these refugees, curing them of their dependency on the Nightwell. As a result of the rebellion's recent successes, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; began to grow more erratic and ruthless in her efforts to quell the revolt.\nFor many, the breaking point came with the massacre at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;. Elisande, in an act that shocked many (even her supporters), ordered the slaughter of all civilians in the Waning Crescent area of the city, a known rebel support base. Deploying &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s as well as nightborne, Elisande's forces massacred the majority of the district's citizens, with only a handful of civilians escaping with the aid of the Nightfallen. Following the attack, the rebels relocating their base of operations in the area to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Terrace\"&gt;Evermoon Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, where they continued their work.\nThe massacre at the Waning Crescent, as it became known, proved to many that Elisande no longer had her people's best interests at heart. In its wake, even members of the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, in the past the Grand Magistrix's loyal enforcers, began to desert from her side. Those who changed sides inevitably joined with the Nightfallen, chief among them &lt;a href=\"Victoire\"&gt;Victoire&lt;/a&gt;.\nNews reached Thalyssra and the Nightfallen that Elisande's forces, along with demons, were rounding up citizens and keeping them in chains at &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Those who were transported away did not return, which caused the Nightfallen to investigate. A group consisting of &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;her champion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt;, and Victoire succeeded in discovering the nightborne prisoners' destination. They arrived at a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; camp known as &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Advance\"&gt;Felsoul Advance&lt;/a&gt;, where the demons were harvesting the captive citizens' souls for their own use. Wasting no time, the party killed the demon in charge of the camp, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aargoss\"&gt;Aargoss&lt;/a&gt;, while releasing many of the surviving prisoners. Despite the damage inflicted on the operation, Silgryn concluded that it was only temporary, buying time.\nSoon after, Ly'leth contacted Thalyssra with information on the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, who disappeared during the massacre at the Waning Crescent. She had learned that Vanthir had been captured, and that Elisande was planning to make a public example of him as a message to the rebellion. Thalyssra was able to track Vanthir's arcane essence, and thus discern his location: at the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyssra's agent, as well as Silgryn and &lt;a href=\"Arluelle\"&gt;Arluelle&lt;/a&gt;, quickly confronted Vanthir's captor, &lt;a href=\"Thoramir\"&gt;Thoramir&lt;/a&gt;, the Second Blade of Elisande. After defeating him in battle, the group hastened to Vanthir's cage, where they discovered him in a nearly-&lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; state. Upon being fed a fruit from the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt;, however, he began to return from the brink. Before fleeing the scene, the rebels made a demonstration of their own by placing the sign of the Dusk Lily above the empty cage. As a symbol of both First Arcanist Thalyssra and the resistance, this display left the Grand Magistrix and her closest supporters deeply shaken.\nOpen and armed insurrection in Suramar's streets also started to begin in earnest, heightening tensions between the two sides.\nOutside assistance.\nTo aid the growing rebellion within &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; issued a call to any who could spare forces to help. Two groups ultimately responded, the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Ranger-General Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Each faction sent an expeditionary force to siege the main entrance to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; and although they now faced a common enemy, they remained bitterly divided over historical, racial, and cultural differences. Despite this disunity, these new reinforcements were effectively able to establish a base of operations on the outskirts of the city, and prepare for an impending invasion.\nIn response to this new threat, large amounts of the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; and other forces loyal to &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; were dispatched to hold the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; also began amassing troops nearby and attempted to open portals to summon further reinforcements, though this was largely foiled by rebel agents. These agents, with the aid of forces from the newly-arrived elven coalition, also carried out several other operations to disrupt the city's defenses and weaken the defenders.\nIn preparation for the impending assault on the city, the Nightfallen began to arm and train many of the refugees who had fled the city previously. Salvaging weapons from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, they quickly amassed a sizeable force of militia, eager to take back Suramar. Though Duskwatch agents succeeded in infiltrating the elven camps, they were eventually rooted out and neutralized by the Nightfallen. Elisande's forces made numerous attempts to flank or rout the enemy forces, such as reactivating the powerful construct known as the &lt;a href=\"Arm%20of%20the%20Magistrix\"&gt;Arm of the Magistrix&lt;/a&gt;. A force of demons led by the &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rozzeleth\"&gt;Rozzeleth&lt;/a&gt; also attempted to flank the elven army by marching on &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt;, though he was successfully intercepted and destroyed by the Nightfallen.\nMarch on Suramar.\nIn time, the elven army outside &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; readied itself for the final assault on &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s defences. Leading the first wave, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a force of &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; militia, engaged the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; vanguard defending the city's perimeter. The blood elves, aided by their &lt;a href=\"Pyrestar%20Demolisher\"&gt;pyrestar demolishers&lt;/a&gt;, gradually cut a path through the Duskwatch, pushing through the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt; towards the &lt;a href=\"Concourse%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Concourse of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and the city proper. After overcoming waves of &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, and several of their arcane constructs, Liadrin's forces halted to consolidate their position while &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her mounted &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt; rode on ahead towards &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe combined force of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and Nightfallen attacked the new lines of Duskwatch defenders, breaking through and pushing onward across the Concourse of Destiny. Along the way, &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s took up position along the route of advance to hold the ground gained. On approaching Astravar Harbor, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; engineered a mass teleportation spell with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, transporting a large force of defenders over the edge of the bridge and clearing a path to the harbor.\nHaving secured a staging point in the upper sections of Astravar Harbor, Kirin Tor and Nightfallen forces began fortifying the position in preparation for an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. The combined blood elf, night elf, and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; force took a brief period of time to gather their troops and siege equipment. When all was prepared, the elven army began marching on the gates of the Nighthold itself. On approaching the citadel's entrance, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; appeared as a large projection and addressed the gathered force with disdain. Citing their inferiority, Elisande systematically began pointing out the apparent flaws of each of the gathered elven races, treating them with a cold contempt. When finished, the Grand Magistrix immediately cast an immense spell which, within moments, trapped the entire army in a great time lock enchantment. With the entire army frozen in time Khadgar, having barely escaped the blast, hastily investigated the scene. Although he was able to free Tyrande and Liadrin, the spell's power was such that the Archmage was forced to retreat.\nBreaking the Nighthold.\n&lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining rebels were shaken by the event, and resigned themselves to finding a way around the impasse. They attempted to uncover the recent messages sent by &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; from inside the Nighthold, whose communications had ceased as of late, indicating something was amiss. After a raid on a Duskwatch listening post on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Terrace of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, the Nightfallen uncovered the intercepted messages from Ly'leth, who warned of Elisande's plans and revealed the existence of a breach in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt; that presented an alternate\u2014and vulnerable\u2014way into the Nighthold.\nUsing this information, Thalyssra sent &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a champion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt; to examine the supposed breach underneath the Sanctum of Order. Finding the location, heavily guarded, they fought their way to the breach itself, where it was discovered to be sealed by a powerful magical barrier. Valtrois examined the barrier, which was being powered not by the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, but by &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s tapped &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s. Departing to investigate the ley lines, Valtrois quickly began working on a method to bring down the barrier guarding the breach.\nShortly thereafter, a message was delivered to &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; by courier, directed to Thalyssra. The message, from &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s newly-appointed First Arcanist &lt;a href=\"Andaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Andaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt;, mocked the Thalyssra's efforts, and challenged her to meet them at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; in the city. Wasting no time, Thalyssra and her champion traveled to the estate and confronted Andaris, who appeared only as a projection. Thalyssra deployed a group of trained &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt;, though they were easily killed by the nearby &lt;a href=\"felborne\"&gt;felborne&lt;/a&gt;, who also injured the Nightfallen leader. Before retreating, the rebels ensured to save as many of the estate's civilian attendants as possible, who were being terrorized by Andaris's felborne.\nShaken by the ease at which fel magic had defeated the withered, Thalyssra and the Nightfallen began to train them in and around nearby &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to build up a resistance to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; magic. The operation proved a success, coupled with the development of new experimental &lt;a href=\"Telemancy%20Orbs\"&gt;telemancy orbs&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; to be summoned instantly. To test the effectiveness of this progress, the Nightfallen used the withered to attack and slaughter a large force of felborne at an outpost in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Thicket\"&gt;Crimson Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, including their leader &lt;a href=\"Valthis%20Ama%27ran\"&gt;Valthis Ama'ran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rebels soon put in place a plan to bring down the barrier under the Sanctum of Order. By placing energy disruptors at key locations around the Suramar region, the links that drew the power from the ley lines to power the barrier were simultaneously broken, causing the way to the Nighthold to become vulnerable. Immediately after bringing down the barrier, the Nightfallen moved to secure the breach and, after breaching the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt;, were confronted by a zealous Andaris Narassin. Using the new fel-resistance withered to drain the her shield and defences, the rebels succeeded in slaying Elisande's new First Arcanist and thus clearing a path directly to the breach. Joined by Khadgar, Thalyssra and the rebels prepared to gather their forces for the final assault on the Nighthold, to end the threat of Elisande and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in Suramar permanently.\nThe invading force pushed its way through the Nighthold's &lt;a href=\"Arcing%20Depths\"&gt;subterranean underground&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the &lt;a href=\"Chronomatic%20Anomaly\"&gt;Chronomatic Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; and thus freeing their time-trapped forces outside the fortress. Soon, the assault began on the main courtyard itself; there, they defeated &lt;a href=\"Spellblade%20Aluriel\"&gt;Spellblade Aluriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Captain of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s Guard, and her forces before advancing into the other wings. The &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic garrison, including &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; defenders were eventually overwhelmed by the attack. Many of Elisande's top lieutenants and supporters such as &lt;a href=\"Star%20Augur%20Etraeus\"&gt;Star Augur Etraeus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Botanist%20Tel%27arn\"&gt;High Botanist Tel'arn&lt;/a&gt; were slain, as the insurgents converged on the &lt;a href=\"Nightspire\"&gt;Nightspire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the inner reaches of the palace, the Nightfallen &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; finally came face-to-face with Elisande herself, who now marshaled all her powers to annihilate the invaders. Despite her efforts, she was subsequently killed. Following this, an echo of the Grand Magistrix spoke to the rebels, expressing disbelief at their continued success and resolving to aid them in the final battle against . With this, they confronted the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; atop the Nightspire and ultimately thwarted his scheme after a significant battle, which resulted in Gul'dan's demise. In the wake of this fight, the infamous &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was returned to his body, with the Legion's plans broken, and became active once more.\nAftermath.\nThe deaths of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and within the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; would decisively bring an end to the civil war in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, its plans dashed, was driven from the region and turned its attention to &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;other areas&lt;/a&gt; of its unfolding invasion. With this, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; would finally gain their independence and freedom from the demon occupation.\nShortly after the victory in the Nighthold, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; returned to the palace to deal with the urgent question of what to do with the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, the First Arcanist would discover that the font of power was unstable, and dying without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;.\nValtrois would suggest stabilizing the Nightwell, allowing the nightborne to harness its powers once more though they were no longer addicted to them. Ultimately, however, Thalyssra decided to allow the font to die, arguing that the Nightwell belonged in Suramar's troubled past, and that the future and destiny of the nightborne now lay instead with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Witnessing the decision, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; were satisfied by the outcome.\nIn the wake of the devastation wrought by the conflict, Thalyssra and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; established a new government over &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20Lily\"&gt;Dusk Lily&lt;/a&gt; of the rebellion would become the insignia of the now-liberated nightborne race, marking a new chapter in Suramar's history."}

It is a primarily &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; village that is the home to the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe village is located on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt;. It features night elvish architecture, some of it with stone walls. It also has a pair of &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s. Nighthaven's location is considered remote and the village is usually sequestered to outsiders. It caters mostly to druids, who have an ability to . Druids also have access to exclusive flight masters. There are trainers for druidism and &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;herbalism&lt;/a&gt; in the town, as well as a number of unique vendors, such as a specialty dress maker, &lt;a href=\"Geenia%20Sunshadow\"&gt;Geenia Sunshadow&lt;/a&gt;. The village is also home to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven%20Inn\"&gt;Nighthaven Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which can be visited during the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Tavern%20Crawl\"&gt;Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe town is the center of the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and for this holiday it opens up to outsiders. The druids welcome members of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate and shoot fireworks - a symbol of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power. During the event, non-druids can also teleport here with a &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival%20Invitation\"&gt;Lunar Festival Invitation&lt;/a&gt;. For the duration of the festival, a number of special vendors and quests can be accessed here.\nHistory.\nCenturies after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, heroes gathered in the village of Nighthaven to face the maddened demigod, &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to blind and drive the beast into &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was here that the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; faced the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20dragon\"&gt;Nightmare dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. Nighthaven came under heavy attack by &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;nightmare&lt;/a&gt; creatures before &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived and used the light of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the corrupted dragon.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the village was used as a gathering point for both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes entering the campaign at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game.\nNighthaven, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; capital, is located in the sacred &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, on the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. This city once held the largest concentration of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; anywhere on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Massive trees, &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s, and many forest beasts fill the surrounding woods. Nighthaven has survived for centuries despite &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; attacks, and the night elves protect their home fiercely. The only current threat to it are deranged &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and feral &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAncients living in the nearby forests once the had vital task of channeling forces of the land to sustain the night elves' immortality. Now they help train the warriors of Nighthaven and defend the village.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; remained untouched, and after that war, the night elven &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s went into deep mediation in the secure caves of the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining elves built the town of Nighthaven.\nThe night elves are very cautious of whom they let enter the village. &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High elves&lt;/a&gt; are not allowed under any circumstances, and anyone smelling of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; power is likewise turned away. Those allowed entry find Nighthaven hospitable, though a subdued and even eerie place. Night elves run the &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tavern\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shop\"&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt;s, and their way of life is rooted in nature. This spiritual heritage manifests in many small ways that foreigners may find unsettling \u2014 from how the buildings are constructed to mesh with the surrounding woods to a wildness that seems to lurk just beneath a quiet demeanor. While visitors may come and go as they please for the most part, they are never allowed near &lt;a href=\"moon%20well\"&gt;moon well&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, any high elves seen near a moon well are attacked on sight.\nIn Lands of Mystery.\nNighthaven rests on the waters of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt;, in central &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Shrine of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; within a few minutes walk to the west. Several &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s have smaller camps outside the city walls.\nNighthaven is one of the greatest safe havens on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and it is populated almost exclusively by druids, which also makes it one of the most concentrated sources of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; power on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Since the druids here would make sure peace is enforced, it is a good meeting place between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;."}

It stands as a testament to the progress and achievements of the nightborne civilization since its inception over 10,000 years ago. Today, it is the largest structure on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the grandest in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The palace is critically centered around the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, the font of staggering arcane power that has sustained Suramar for millennia.\nFor the vast majority of Suramar's history since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Nighthold has served as the seat of power for &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her regime. Partly occupied by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic forces during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the structure became a major target for the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen insurgents&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;'s closing acts, the Nighthold was assaulted and stormed by the Nightfallen and their allies, who would ultimately succeed in defeating Elisande and driving the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from Suramar.\nThe citizens of Suramar and the Nightfallen reunited, the Nighthold continues to act as the seat of Suramar's rulers and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the civil war. After the end of the Legion's invasion, the nightborne joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the palace became a launching point for many nightborne venturing out into the world for the first time.\nHistory.\nRise of the Nightborne.\n&lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; existed for millennia as one of the greatest cities of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. There, an elite group of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; sorcerers led by &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; in service to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; acted, often in secret, to secure their queen's position and expand her influence throughout &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attempted to open a massive portal within Suramar City in addition to the one in &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; in order to press their invasion. Elisande and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; immediately took action, fearing the total destruction of their city. They stormed the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and used the powerful &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to seal the portal opened by the demons.\nIn the aftermath of this act, the Highborne of Suramar would harness the power of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; to create an immense font of arcane energy, the \"&lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;\". Yet, believing the world doomed, Elisande and her allies fashioned a great magical shield over much of the city with their new source of power, cutting Suramar off from the rest of the world and beginning ten millennia of isolation.\nThe Nightwell would take on a central role in the new society of Suramar's residents. Its energies transformed the Suramari into a new race known as the shal'dorei, or &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;. For the next 10,000 years, Suramar flourished without outside interference.\nOver the centuries the proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; ensured that the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;titanic&lt;/a&gt; power would dwell within the inhabitants of the Nighthold.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; commenced its &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, it emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and quickly made contact with the nearby &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; civilization in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; personally presented &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the nightborne with an ultimatum: allow the Legion access to Suramar and the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, or face annihilation. Elisande, using the Nightwell's power, would scry countless possible futures, but every possibility led to doom. The only way the nightborne would survive was if they accepted the demons' offer. Despite an attempted coup from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, Elisande bent the knee to the Legion in the hope of saving her people.\nThe nightborne lowered Suramar's shield and watched as the demons entered the city. Though her initial efforts to stop Elisande were a failure, almost costing her life, First Arcanist Thalyssra continued in her efforts to save her city. From the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, she would establish the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and start a civil war in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to bring down Elisande's regime. The Nightwell became the ultimate goal of the rebels. The harsh and often cruel response elicited by Elisande in trying to put down the insurrection would transform the Nighthold into a symbol of oppression.\nInsurrection.\nWhile much of Suramar City suffered from the rationing of &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;, a daily shipment was dispatched under heavy guard from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vineyards\"&gt;Twilight Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; directly to the Nighthold for Elisande's personal consumption. On at least one occasion, the convoy was attacked by insurgent forces, who took the valuable arcwine. The Grand Magistrix very rarely left the palace. One opportunity arose in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;, where the Nightfallen attempted to assassinate her and failed.\nThe rebellion would be reinforced by the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. This united army subsequently laid siege to the city itself. Advancing down the &lt;a href=\"Concourse%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Concourse of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;, the mostly-elven army made a path directly for the Nighthold. As they readied for the final assault on the citadel, a large image of Grand Magistrix Elisande appeared before the gathered combatants from the palace gates. She chastised and mocked the gathered elves, before releasing a powerful time-locking spell on the army, freezing them in place, neutralized.\nDespite the setback, Thalyssra and her allies worked to discover another route to penetrate the Nighthold, a breach deep beneath the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt; that could grant access to the tunnels beneath the palace. Elisande, aware of this too, assigned her new First Arcanist &lt;a href=\"Andaris%20Narassin\"&gt;Andaris Narassin&lt;/a&gt; to guard the entrance at all costs. Nevertheless, the Nightfallen were successful in seizing the breach and bringing down its magical barrier, slaying Andaris in the process.\nSiege of the Nighthold.\nWasting little time, the Nightfallen and a small group of heroes began to work their way through the tunnels leading to the Nighthold, confronting and overcoming many foes along the way. They defeated the &lt;a href=\"Chronomatic%20Anomaly\"&gt;Chronomatic Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; that kept the above-ground forces frozen in place via Elisande's time-locking spell. These liberated forces joined the group of heroes, and together they assaulted the main courtyard and the entirety of the palace. Since the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival, many &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s had occupied the Nighthold, including &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;. After fierce battles with each, they were ultimately overcome.\nMany powerful &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; champions also died trying to defend the fortress, among them &lt;a href=\"Star%20Augur%20Etraeus\"&gt;Star Augur Etraeus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Botanist%20Tel%27arn\"&gt;High Botanist Tel'arn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spellblade%20Aluriel\"&gt;Spellblade Aluriel&lt;/a&gt;, Captain of the Magistrix's Guard. Once all wings of the outer palace were secure, the invaders marched on the main tower housing the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. Within the &lt;a href=\"Nightspire\"&gt;Nightspire&lt;/a&gt;, Elisande finally confronted the insurgents in person, harnessing all the power at her disposal to wipe them from existence. In the end, the Grand Magistrix fell to her &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;assailants&lt;/a&gt;. After her death, her echo would appear to confront them, expressing disbelief at their success in spite of her visions to the contrary. Finally, Elisande's echo resigned to throw her lot in with the invaders, promising to aid them in the final battle at the top of the Nighthold.\nOn the very peak of the Nighthold, the rebel champions, along with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, confronted as the warlock began a powerful ritual to finally place a portion of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s soul into the body of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan called on immense &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies, bringing them fully to bear against his foes. Using his great newfound power, Gul'dan opened an immense rift in the physical universe to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to allow his master to pass through, and further empowering himself. As Khadgar used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt; to put Illidan's soul back inside his body, Sargeras himself took control of the body and &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Within\"&gt;The Demon Within&lt;/a&gt; revealed itself.\nIn the end, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; would triumph, as Gul'dan himself fell to the ground bereft of power and the portal flickered into non-existence. Illidan Stormrage, now returned to his body, grabbed Gul'dan, lifting him in the air, and overflowing him with fel energy. The death of Gul'dan atop the Nighthold signaled the end of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, and the Legion's occupation of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the victory over Gul'dan, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; visited the Nightwell along with &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oculeth\"&gt;Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; to decide its future. Without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; to sustain it, the Nightwell had become unstable and was dying. Though Valtrois suggested repairing the damage, Thalyssra believed that it should be allowed to fade. Reasoning that the destiny of the nightborne no longer lays with the well, but with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as a whole, the Nightfallen thus let Suramar's historic source of power go.\nThe new regime.\nFollowing the devastation of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, the nightborne would establish a new government over Suramar City, headed by &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping with tradition, the new leadership based itself from the Nighthold palace. In the period after the eventual &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Approached by the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar would be convinced to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir city repaired, many nightborne chose to venture forth from Suramar and explore &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for the first time. These individuals began their new journey from the Nighthold, where they were briefed by Thalysra herself. Further highlighting Suramar's re-entry into the world, even &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"monk%20trainers\"&gt;monk trainers&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the Nighthold and taught them their ways.

Clear out all the trash in Elisande's room to stop the ritual, wait for the exposition to finish, then defeat her. By virtue of her mechanics she needs to be brought from 100% to zero three times. Loot her, then exit to the northwest and take the Suramar Portal to the Font of Night to reach &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Demon%20Within\"&gt;The Demon Within&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo NPCs provide a shortcut out of the instance.\nLoot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tier%2019\"&gt;tier 19&lt;/a&gt; set pieces drop from bosses in the Nighthold."}
