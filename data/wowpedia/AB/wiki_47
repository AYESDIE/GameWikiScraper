Each set can include a specific item for each slot, or can choose to ignore that slot. Players can also choose titles and icons for their sets. Once created, gear set icons can be added to hotkeys to enable access without opening the Equipment Manager itself.\nExample macros.\nLet's assume Prot is your primary spec and Ret is your secondary \"and\" you want to swap gear at the same time you swap specs, then your macro would be:\nFor Prot:\n /equipset Prot\n /usetalents 1\nFor Ret:\n /equipset Ret\n /usetalents 2\nOne button equipment &amp; talent changer:\n #show [spec:1] Retribution Aura; [spec:2] Devotion Aura \n /equipset [spec:1] Ret; [spec:2] Prot\n /usetalents [spec:1] 2; [spec:2] 1\nIn this situation, the game will equip the Retribution gear then activate the Retribution build when the Protection build is active. It will alternatively equip the Protection gear then activate the Protection build when the Retribution build is active.\nAgain, on the /equipset macro, you have to use the \"exact\" name that you saved your gear as, and it is case-sensitive.\nRelated addons.\nThis feature has similar functionality, and is probably largely based on the popular auto-armor-equipping &lt;a href=\"addon\"&gt;addon&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse.com/addons/wow/itemrack\"&gt;ItemRack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse.com/addons/wow/outfitter\"&gt;Outfitter&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "271951", "revid": "40286752", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=271951", "title": "Equipment Potency EquivalencE Number", "text": "What is best in life? &lt;a href=\"Gear\"&gt;Gear&lt;/a&gt;, plain and simple. As part of the upcoming stat-system revamp, we plan to introduce a new tool that will let &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; players know exactly where they stand in comparison to other players: the Equipment Potency EquivalencE Number.\nWith this new system, you\u2019ll no longer have to wonder about your perceived or actual worth as a player. Your Equipment Potency EquivalencE Number, automatically derived from the quality of the gear you currently possess, will be placed on your &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Armory\"&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt;, and also displayed over your character\u2019s head in-game as an easy-to-read bar-like object that steadily grows as you acquire loot. Thanks to this new system, no one will be able to ignore the fruits of your long, hard journey toward gear perfection.\nHow Your Number Is Determined.\nHere's how it will work: With every new piece of gear you obtain, your number will grow; if you attain a high enough number, you'll graduate to the next tier (more on that below) and gain access to exclusive rewards. If you\u2019re looking to boost your number even more, activities such as earning raid and Arena achievements or realm-first titles will help you get it up, and you'll also begin receiving in-game mail with exciting offers for additional ways to enhance it.\nPlayer Potency Tiers.\nTo complement this system, we plan to use an updated version of the phasing technology introduced in Wrath of the Lich King to automatically place players in segregated tiers based on their number. Each tier will comprise all players within a certain number range, and players will only be able to group with, talk to, or see other players in the same tier as themselves. To ensure players with a smaller number will not be shafted by this new system, we plan to introduce a wide variety of new solo content for less well-equipped players.\nRewards.\nThose with sufficiently large numbers can earn in-game rewards such as a permanent bonus to \"need\" rolls, the ability to cut to the front of the queue in the Dungeon Finder, a larger ignore list, a much shorter dungeon deserter debuff, or -- if your number is exceedingly impressive -- a new non-combat pet, Binky the Mechano-Rooster.\nAs your number grows, the game world will tailor itself to you in other subtle ways: as the pool of players you interact with becomes more and more exclusive, you\u2019ll no longer need to stand still in prominent locations quite so often to allow others to inspect your gear; you\u2019ll have fewer time-wasting calendar invitations to sift through; and your friends list will become increasingly more manageable, reducing needless scrolling time. Any negative repercussions of these changes will be offset by the satisfaction you\u2019ll receive knowing your equipment is significantly more impressive than average.\nWe hope you enjoy the new system!"}

Ysera gave him the task of guarding the Temple of Atal'Hakkar in the Swamp of Sorrows. However, Eranikus went insane not long after he entered the temple, one of the first dragons to succumb to the Nightmare's corruption. Since then the trolls in the temple have dispatched a group to Zul'Gurub, and succeeded in summoning Hakkar into the world. Of all the green dragons, only Ysera herself was stronger than Eranikus.\nThe green wyrm eventually sacrificed himself to help &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, redeeming himself in death. \nBackground.\nHaving been the dragon tied to the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, it is said that the dragon roared loudly during the fight of &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;.\nTemple of Atal'Hakkar.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, had learned of the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai's&lt;/a&gt; plans to summon &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;, she smashed the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; below the marshes, attempting to destroy the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s in order to stop their attempt to awaken the Soulflayer. The great Emerald Wyrm Eranikus was dispatched to deal with the Atal'ai priest, along with his brother &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt;, and four young drakes under his direct command: &lt;a href=\"Dreamscythe\"&gt;Dreamscythe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weaver\"&gt;Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hazzas\"&gt;Hazzas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morphaz\"&gt;Morphaz&lt;/a&gt;. Eranikus and Itharius destroyed Hakkar's physical manifestation and believed they had succeeded. However, they had underestimated Hakkar and Eranikus succumbed to the same &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; which currently plagues the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The Atal'ai survived, and resumed their efforts to awaken Hakkar.\nIn &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, upon defeating the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Shade of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; in the Sunken Temple, a &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; may receive the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Essence of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. Eranikus asks you to cleanse his soul in the essence font but instead becomes trapped within the trinket, the &lt;a href=\"Chained%20Essence%20of%20Eranikus\"&gt;Chained Essence of Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. He begs you to release him by seeking out aid from the green dragonflight, and threatens to kill you if you don't. If you choose to give up the trinket it may be given to &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, who sends the player to &lt;a href=\"Umbranse%20the%20Spiritspeaker\"&gt;Umbranse the Spiritspeaker&lt;/a&gt;, where the questline ends abruptly.\nThe Tyrant of the Dream.\nWhile the Sunken Temple questline has not been continued, Eranikus features prominently in the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nThe mortal races wish to open Ahn'Qiraj and put a rest to the Qiraji threat once and for all. In order to accomplish this the Scepter of the Shifting Sands must be recombined. One shard was entrusted a thousand years ago to Eranikus by the bronze wyrm &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;. The mortal champion is sent to the Sunken Temple to discover Eranikus' fate. Upon visiting a spectral form of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; near Eranikus' shade, the champion is sent to an ally of the Archdruid, and is instructed to gather shards of the nightmare from each portal to the emerald dream. He or she is then sent to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Remulos\"&gt;Keeper Remulos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeeper Remulos opens a portal into the heart of the Dream over Lake Elune'ara, from which Eranikus emerges. Eranikus, still under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, demands the body of Malfurion Stormrage. The champion and allies are asked to defend Keeper Remulos from dozens of &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Phantasm\"&gt;Nightmare Phantasm&lt;/a&gt;s, that have accompanied the fallen green to the mortal plane, until the arrival of High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. As the phantasms are defeated, Eranikus lands himself and attacks the son of Cenarius. Eventually, Tyrande arrives with a half-dozen &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Together they channel the powers of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; in a prayer to redeem the cursed dragon. \nCeasing to fight, Eranikus changes into the form of a night elf \u2014 apologizing for all the harm he had wrought \u2014 and leaves to attempt to begin to make amends for his actions. He returns to Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, and Ysera to continue the battle raging within the Emerald Dream.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nAs a green dragon tied to the Idol of Remulos, Eranikus made an appearance battling against Broll and &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; who were trying to obtain the idol from the &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur\"&gt;Thistlefur&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs. During the battle, Lo'Gosh had to distract Eranikus as Broll entered the Emerald Dream where he regained his druid's powers and cleansed the idol. When Broll returned, Eranikus disappeared.\nStormrage.\nAfter being freed of the corruption of the Emerald Nightmare, Eranikus flew back to the Emerald Dream. However, when he felt the Nightmare calling to him again, he fled back to Azeroth for fear that he would again be corrupted. He hid in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; for many years until he was found by &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, who convinced him to transport them to Bough Shadow. There, they were attacked by Lethon, Emeriss and shadowy satyrs. The two dragons tried to corrupt him once again, but Alexstrasza came and the dragons were forced to leave. Though initially unwilling to help for fear of being corrupted again, he was eventually convinced to return to the Dream when &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; informed him that Ysera knew and understood why he turned back, and reassured him that she had not yet been taken by the Nightmare.\nDuring the course of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; Ysera was captured, but when Eranikus learned she was still fighting against the corruption he went immediately to rescue her. As Malfurion aided in penetrating the barriers of her prison, &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; appeared and attempted to corrupt Eranikus once more. As Eranikus's body was warped and twisted by the energies of the Nightmare, Lethon preached about a future where the walls of the Emerald Dream would break down, and the dragons of Nightmare would fly Azeroth's skies unimpeded. Unwilling to let that happen, Eranikus shifted them both into the unstable boundary between the Emerald Dream and Azeroth. Though Lethon tried desperately to draw upon the Nightmare's power, the chaotic energies between the two worlds tore him apart, unleashing the Nightmare's power in a fiery maelstrom. Eranikus made no attempt to avoid it, and was consumed.\nCataclysm.\nDespite Eranikus's death, his shade still remains within the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; priests have been further corrupting it with &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;'s blood.\nShadowlands.\nWhen Ysera was being reborn inside a &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, she received visions of those close to her. One of those visions was Eranikus, (simply called \"Consort\" in the quest) who apparently found his way back to the Emerald Dream. Eranikus appears to miss her dearly and looks forward to the day they can reunite in the dream.\nIn the RPG.\nEranikus' title was the Green and was classified as a &lt;a href=\"green%20wyrm\"&gt;green wyrm&lt;/a&gt;."}

A global world message will display for all players on the server after his defeat:\n\"Eranikus, Tyrant of the Dream, is wholly consumed by the Light of Elune\"\n\"Tranquility sets over the Moonglade.\"\nStrategy.\nHave the raid split into 3 groups of healers and placed in the long house where Remulos stands. Warriors, melee are to stand near Remulos. During this battle, the objective is keep Remulos alive. He himself can tank a good number of the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Phantasm\"&gt;Nightmare Phantasm&lt;/a&gt;s. Warriors are to taunt and drag the &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s away from the healer group and back to Remulos so they do not get shadowbolted. Druids should heal Remulos, other classes on the raid. Keep deaths to a minimum as the shades will grow in size and power for each death that happens.\nWhen Tyrande appears the entire raid can move out and full DPS on Eranikus, all heals should now go to Remulos. If anyone is taking damage, Tyrande will periodically cast \"Mass Healing\" that can heal the entire raid for about 2000 a tick. Melee should avoid getting breathed on.\nAs of Wrath of the Lich King, this is now soloable with only moderate difficulty. (As the guard NPCs are higher level.)"}

You must sabotage their &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;Refineries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oil%20platform\"&gt;Platforms&lt;/a&gt; to halt this shipment. Once Stratholme's ability to gather and process Oil is destroyed, proceed to crush any and all resistance offered by the Alliance.\"\nBackground.\nFirst the Horde unit's sappers had to blow a path inland for its troops; this provided an impressive display of their talents. Their plan was to take the city by land first, then to build ships to finish the job, so their forces prepared to march further north after slaughtering the Alliance forces to the east. One of the Horde's slaves remained to build a &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; to the north of the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; nearby; the rest headed out to set up closer to the enemy city. Again they gutted any enemies they encountered, but avoided the large clearing at the city entrance, not wishing to draw their attention before they could build. They built a second hall as close to the west as possible to impede enemy forces coming from that direction. With supplementary income from the southern mine and more workers from both halls, resources piled up quickly and they could build as fast as possible.\nThey had to erect several structures before building up for the land assault. First was a &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; to start the training of grunts, for they would need all the forces they could muster to defend the settlement. A &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20mill%23Troll%20lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; went up next, then a second barracks to double their troop production. They were careful not to cut &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; near the hall, instead sending the slaves further north, so that the tree-line remained a good natural barrier. Many &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s were erected behind the &lt;a href=\"pig%20farm\"&gt;pig farm&lt;/a&gt;s to the west; these pounded enemies as they tried to break through. Catapults were placed near these towers to make sure enemy ballistae did not attack the towers unmolested. While the hall was upgraded into a &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt; were their final tasks; the buildup begun in earnest.\nThey assembled a huge group of ogre magi and catapults for the first wave of the attack, armed with the best possible weapons, armor, and spells, then moved northeast to assault the city from the rear. After they had killed the forces outside the city wall, catapults rolled up and smashed a path through to the inside. Enemy units began pouring through, but the Horde's magi with &lt;a href=\"%3Abloodlust\"&gt;:bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; made quick work of them. After briefly entering the walls to draw out defenders, the Horde began producing sappers back in their settlement, which now had a clear path on which to enter and demolish structures at will with ogre escorts. Slowly they worked their way westward, removing towers and ballistae first and defending their catapults with troops. Within a short time, the city laid in ruins. At their leisure, they built a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; to take care of any targets beyond the range of their catapults. The Alliance knew Urok's commander's name now, and Urok believed they would soon know their Maker as well.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

You've passed all the tests of the Hyldsmeet... all but one. You've risen among our sisters' best and fiercest.\nThe final test is at hand. The Drakkensryd - the true test of a Hyldnir's worth and warrior spirit. It'll be you, your riding drake, a chained harpoon and a score of your sisters vying for dominance.\nShow no quarter. None will be expected. \nProgress.\nBegone!\nCompletion.\nSif... is that you?\nNotes.\nAccepting the quest will put players on a &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Hyldsmeet Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt; on a flight to the Temple of Storms. The Proto-Drake is a vehicle that only provides a \"leave vehicle\" button. As most of the flight on the Proto-Drake is exceedingly high in the air, one is advised to have some method of slow-fall available in case you fall off the drake. Climbing on a drake will dismiss your pet, and pets cannot be summoned while on drakes.\nOnce circling the Temple of Storms, use the harpoon to jump from drake to drake, killing hyldnir along the way. The fastest option is to jump to an occupied drake and fight hand-to-hand with its current rider. Another option is to attack hyldnir on other drakes using ranged attacks, which is generally much slower, as drake riders generally only come into range for a few seconds at a time, however it may be your best option if you're doing the quest as a hunter, since the only alternative is fighting them in melee with no pet and no traps.\nIt is possible to use bandages while on the mount, however it is impossible to eat or drink.\nIt is also possible to shapeshift as a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround the Temple of Storms, the columns have ornaments on them. Look up and to the left (at the columns), target a column, and \"use\" the harpoon to get up on the temple. If you run low on health, you can use the harpoon on an ornament to reach the temple, eat there and then use the harpoon again to get on a drake.\nTrivia.\nThe word \"Drakkensryd\" seems to have a Germanic etymology (word origin). It is similar to English \"dragon ride\" and Dutch \"drakenrit\". That is actually what this quest is about. The purpose is to ride on a dragon and attack mobs as explained &lt;a href=\"%23Notes\"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;."}

After a few seconds, Meryl will say:\nMeryl then seals Kathra'natir in a \"Tomb of Ice\", making him immune to all attacks and spells but also making him unable to attack, move or use spells.\nStage 2: The Forge Restrained.\nThe path to the stairs behind the dreadlord is blocked by a barrier that will knock you back if you attempt to run or jump past it, so use &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; to get past. After 90 seconds, if players have not figured out how to get past, the game provides a hint:\nAfter passing the barrier:\nDestroy the four Siphoning Rifts spread around the room. They have a Void Bolt ability and around 162,000 health (at level 100).\nStage 3: The Power of the Guardians.\nUpon activating the forge, the next stage begins.\nStage 4: The Dreadlord's Downfall.\nAn immense orb of arcane energy forms above the Forge and begins channeling energy into you as you are lifted up in the air.\nWhen you land back on the ground, you have been granted the \"Mark of the Guardian\" buff, which increases damage dealt by 1,000% and causes your character to glow with transparent blue light and be surrounded by shifting magical runes.\nMeanwhile, Kathra'natir has broken free from his icy prison and begun strangling Meryl in mid-air with shadow magic.\nUpon attacking the dreadlord, Meryl is freed.\nWith the 1,000% damage increase, it should only take one or a few spells to kill Kathra'natir. As in the first phase, keep spellstealing his Vampiric Aura and counterspelling his Drain Life if needed. Additionally, either use &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt; when Kathra'natir launches players up in the air, or &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; just before hitting the ground.\nUpon killing Kathra'natir, he says:\nStage 5: A Small Victory.\nAfter defeating the nathrezim, you are lifted back into the air as the Mark of the Guardian is channeled back into another arcane orb. Once the channeling has finished, the orb disappears and Alodi appears in its place.\nFinal Stage: Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe.\nAlodi and Meryl run down towards the forge and begins channeling a teleportation spell.\nInteract with the forge to help the two Tirisfalen transport the forge. Upon doing this, you exit the scenario and are transported to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak with Meryl to turn in the quest.\nBeta version.\nKathra'natir escaped from my grasp, but I know where he plans to go.\nThere is an ancient relic, the Forge of the Guardian, which has been used by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; for centuries to imbue the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; with their power.

A guardian was set to watch over each, lest the raven's enemies attempt to free them.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Eagle\"&gt;first of the shrines&lt;/a&gt; is the eagle's, found in the hills to the south of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Jorune\"&gt;Lake Jorune&lt;/a&gt; and west of &lt;a href=\"Stonebreaker%20Hold\"&gt;Stonebreaker Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tablet says that the eagle fought valiantly, but was overcome by a swarm of enemies. The armor and endurance of your bear form is well-suited to this fight.\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\n&lt;The sparrowhawk seems to speak with Arthorn's voice.&gt;\nDid you succeed in freeing the essence of the eagle spirit?\nCompletion.\n&lt;Arthorn seems to feel the power in the recovered essence through the sparrowhawk's senses.&gt;\nEven after thousands of years of captivity, the eagle's power remains strong. If the other essences are as strong as the eagle's, the raven god will be right to fear you.\nNotes.\nThis fight can be tough, but can definitely be soloed. Fly to the Shrine of the Eagle in Terokkar Forest (46,45) and click on the shrine to summon its guardian. The guardian will summon a large number of &lt;a href=\"Anzuli%20Hatchling\"&gt;Anzuli Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;s to protect him. However, they all despawn once the guardian is killed. If you can afford to, ignore them entirely and simply DPS the guardian down.\nThe easiest method (and that recommended by the quest giver) is using &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt;. A Bear-form druid can use &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Roar\"&gt;Demoralizing Roar&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the damage taken from the birds to just a few damage per hit, and can outlast him. Be sure to interrupt his Starfire, which can hit for over 4500 damage.\nA Cat form feral druid can quite easily simply out-DPS him AND his birds. \nIn any form, preparing for the fight by casting &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt;s on yourself (&lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Regrowth\"&gt;Regrowth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lifebloom\"&gt;Lifebloom&lt;/a&gt;) will help extend your survivability. Add &lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; if you intend to out-cast him. &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Mark of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorns\"&gt;Thorns&lt;/a&gt; don't hurt either.\nHow to solo as resto druid: Before the fight starts stack a max rank regrowth and a rejuv. If you get low just barkskin and immediately toss a rejuv and lifebloom, with barkskin + demo shout, the birds will be hitting you for very little even in caster form. If you get extremely low you can also &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Swiftness\"&gt;Nature's Swiftness&lt;/a&gt;+&lt;a href=\"Healing%20Touch\"&gt;Healing Touch&lt;/a&gt; and immediately switch back to bear form (2.3 makes this much easier)\nCaution: this location is only accessible by air. Dying at this location will result in your being unable to get back to your body on your own. Bring a friend, or be prepared to 'Spirit Rez' and eat the extra durability loss."}

Some players have, however, observed Galandria to instead run back up to her hill and just look at the fight during the entire encounter.\nPatch 4.3.0 resulted in the Lured Colossus becoming no longer elite and the quest became a solo quest, rather than a group quest."}

With &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Loyalist\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; exceptions, they are fiercely loyal to whoever is leading the Horde, not any particular individual. They can be considered the Horde's closest counterpart to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s regime, the Kor'kron greatly expanded in power, albeit narrowing its racial composition down to almost universally &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. They served as the Warchief's primary soldiers during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, until Hellscream's forced removal from power. The Kor'kron sustained heavy causalities during the siege, including the death of its leader, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, and several other celebrated generals. With &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension as Warchief of the Horde, the surviving Kor'kron were placed in prisons, save for those who had defected such as &lt;a href=\"Gakkorg\"&gt;Gakkorg&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the Kor'kron seem to have returned, as several members can be spotted in the ranks of the Horde again.\nHistory.\nCycle of Hatred.\nThrall originally traveled alone and free. However, after the demonic betrayal of his closest advisor &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt;, the warchief decided it would be wiser to be alert at all times and to always have someone watch his back. As such, he began surrounding himself with an honor guard.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; had revived the order, the elite band of orcs served as his bodyguards. They were stationed in the Warchief's own fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nA detachment of Kor'kron have also been dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; where they serve as the defenders of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Village\"&gt;Shadowmoon Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the closest Horde outpost to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they wage war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as well as the legions of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nMore recently the Kor'kron have been deployed in Northrend in full force as part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. The fortress at the base of &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; is called &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; and is commanded by &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. In many ways, they seem to be the Horde counterpart of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Both groups consist of their faction's elite forces, and both are heavily involved in their faction's campaign in Northrend.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall sent a legion of Kor'kron under &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to replace the Forsaken forces deployed to the front lines in Northrend; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;events of the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, they were tasked to keep an eye on the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that they discontinued work on the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; was created as a major Horde base in the region, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Agmar\"&gt;Overlord Agmar&lt;/a&gt;. He was later present to lead the warriors of the Kor'kron on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kor'kron under the command of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; fought their way through &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; at the side of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; and engaged the 7th Legion in an aerial battle between the &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt; outside of the citadel.\nCataclysm.\nWith the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; remained in Northrend as commander of a skeleton crew in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;. They also had minor involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. They were involved in many of the recent events of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, serving as counterparts of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nKor'kron warriors also accompanied the newly-appointed Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, just prior to the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;, six Kor'kron guards accompanied Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Briln\"&gt;Briln&lt;/a&gt;. Later, they accompanied him to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to attack the Alliance. At some point during the ferocious battle, one guard warned Garrosh of the danger the Alliance posed. King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; also managed to kill two soldiers. As the Alliance pushed the Horde, Kor'kron guards realized that the battle had been lost, and went to hold and convince the battle-thirsty Garrosh to retreat.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;last battle&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ka%27anu%20Reevs\"&gt;Ka'anu Reevs&lt;/a&gt; of the Kor'kron Air Command jumped on the back of the dragon before being tossed to sea moments later.\nMists of Pandaria.\nMost recently, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; granted the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; amnesty and a formidable amount of them can be found in the Horde. The new leader of the Kor'kron, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, was also a Blackrock orc. They served as some kind of secret police force to Garrosh, punishing anyone who questions the warchief.\nSome Kor'kron had dark gray skin and might have been Blackrocks, like the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Assassin%20%28Northern%20Barrens%29\"&gt;Kor'kron Assassins&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandfall.\nTwo months after the mist collapsed, Garrosh Hellscream, accompanied by his Kor'kron, arrived with the bulk of the Horde fleet and oversaw the construction of &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;. However, Garrosh had another clash of opinions with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh ordered Vol'jin's outright murder, sending him off on a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; with the Kor'kron and one of Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Rak%27gor%20Bloodrazor\"&gt;assassins&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin survived the attempt on his life, and it was revealed that Garrosh put the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; under martial law, sending his Kor'kron forces to round up the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to the Echo Isles and freed them from their control by killing enough Kor'kron so the Darkspear could overwhelm the rest and take them prisoners.\nMalkorok and his Kor'kron accompanied Garrosh through his entire search for the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. After Garrosh learned of the location of the Divine Bell by &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Kien\"&gt;Shan Kien&lt;/a&gt;, he tasked &lt;a href=\"Blademaster\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt; with acquiring it. Ishi led a small force of Kor'kron into the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Korune\"&gt;Ruins of Korune&lt;/a&gt; where the bell is hidden, only to discover that the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; had already found the bell and brought it to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, Garrosh amassed Horde forces at &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Emperor's Reach&lt;/a&gt; with the Divine Bell, Malkorok, and his Kor'kron in tow. Garrosh rang the bell, turning some of the present Kor'kron into &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, as they could not control the power of the Divine Bell. The bell was then shattered during a showdown between Garrosh and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome Kor'kron were also present at &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the fortress.\nThey also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Zan%27vess\"&gt;Assault on Zan'vess&lt;/a&gt;.\nEscalation.\nAt some point, Kor'kron Elite have taken over the job of guarding &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and have an increased presence throughout town. It was also been discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt; working in the &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; were a secret part of the Kor'kron.\nAs the building conflict between Garrosh Hellscream's loyal Kor'kron and the rebelling forces of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; augmented in , Kor'kron troops wearing what looked like a recolored &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; tabard were now operating all over the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that at least some Warsong members were also following Garrosh. Some Kor'kron soldiers dropped &lt;a href=\"Indecipherable%20Plans\"&gt;Indecipherable Plans&lt;/a&gt;, hinting that something darker was going on in Orgrimmar.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nThe Kor'kron composed the Garrosh-loyalists' main army during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, joining forces with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to defend the city from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Many Kor'kron were slain during the ensuing battles, losing ground to the invaders both above and beneath Orgrimmar. Both &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; lost their lives in the conflict, as well as many orcs within the Kor'kron's ranks.\nFollowing Vol'jin's ascension as warchief, there were not many Kor'kron left due to most of them having sided with Garrosh, and the handful of survivors were all in prisons (save for defectors such as &lt;a href=\"Gakkorg\"&gt;Gakkorg&lt;/a&gt;). During Garrosh's trial in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; noted that Vol'jin had not yet selected his own special guards but that they would likely include more than a few trolls.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, all of the Kor'kron guards in the Undercity left, leaving only Bragor with the new title of \"Hand of the Warchief\". Under odd circumstances, the body of &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Kraggosh\"&gt;Overseer Kraggosh&lt;/a&gt; is now found in a cage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warspear%20Mine%20Guard\"&gt;Warspear Mine Guard&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; in wear the Kor'kron tabard.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, one orc with the Kor'kron tabard was present at the funeral ceremony for &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; seen cheering for his successor, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, they became a recruitable option for the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; after the freeing of &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Headhunter\"&gt;Kor'kron Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s could be seen on board \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunstrider\"&gt;The Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;\", escorting &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; on their venture towards &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; to join the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Kor'kron continued to act as elite orc guards of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, several Kor'kron members were present, notably &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Mokor\"&gt;Commander Mokor&lt;/a&gt; who trained Horde soldiers in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Akaro\"&gt;Lieutenant Akaro&lt;/a&gt; who participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, two Kor'kron guards, a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s were seen escorting a shipment through &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; woods to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; encampment.

The encounter is very telegraph heavy, and contains numerous &lt;a href=\"Stay%20out%20of%20the%20fire\"&gt;Stay out of the fire&lt;/a&gt; mechanics that turn the battle field into chaos in a small amount of time. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Haromm and Kardris trained thousands of shaman to whisper reverently to the elements to requisition their aid. The army of Garrosh, however, does not ask - they take what they desire in the name of the True Horde. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20shaman\"&gt;Dark Shamanism&lt;/a&gt; forces the elements into servitude, twisting them into burned-out ash, corrupted waters, and toxic air.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"One of the precepts of Garrosh\u2019s True Horde is a disdain for all demonic magic, so when we wanted a more caster-oriented boss, we instead delved into the question of what shamanism would look like within Garrosh\u2019s army. The attire for these two wolfriders was inspired by the traditional Warcraft III Shaman unit, and we\u2019re excited to be able to give lucky Shaman players a chance to earn that look for themselves by defeating this encounter.\"\nOverview.\nHaromm and Kardris begin the encounter fighting alongside their vicious war wolves. The two powerful Dark Shaman share health, and they drop corrupted totems that grant them each different abilities as they sustain damage.\nStrategy.\nThis fight is relatively straightforward, but can be very challenging, as the chaotic nature of the fight pretty much forces you to \"wing it\", rather than plan carefully. You will need 2 tanks, 3 to 6 healers, depending on group size, and as much ranged DPS as possible.\nFirst, kill both wolves as quickly as possible. Next, and for the rest of the fight, the tanks should keep the bosses together as much as possible so as to allow for cleave damage.\nThe main challenge comes from avoiding standing in bad stuff - and there is a LOT of it. Some particularly notable abilities that require special player actions are as follows:\nFoul Stream: A large green light beam will shine on a player, and a few seconds later, a line of bad stuff will appear between Haromm and that player. That player will need to move so that the line doesn't go through the rest of the raid group.\nAshen Wall: A line of ash elementals will appear perpendicular to the line between Haromm and the tank currently on him. The tank should stand with his back to the boundary of the arena, so that the wall doesn't block the other players. See the External Links section for an interactive web page that helps you learn to position the wall.\nFoul Geyser: Kardris will spawn a large number of slimes from a particular location. All players will need to avoid letting them get within melee range, and the ranged DPS will need to kill the slimes as quickly as possible.\nThe tanks will need to taunt swap regularly doe to Haromm's Froststorm Strike. If there are any warriors, rogues, or monks in the group, you can disarm Haromm with &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dismantle\"&gt;Dismantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Weapon\"&gt;Grapple Weapon&lt;/a&gt;. This will impair Haromm's attack power, reducing stress on the tank and healer. If there are multiple players capable of disarming Haromm, you may want to set up a rotation to keep him disarmed as much as possible.\nThe other attacks, \"Falling Ash\", \"Toxic Storm\", and \"Toxic Tornado\", produce large, easy-to-see telegraphs that the players simply need to avoid.\nAt 25%, the bosses will cast Bloodlust. At this point, you should cast your own Bloodlust, and burn the bosses down as quickly as possible.\nAlternate Strategy.\nThere is an alternate way to defeat the bosses that is generally considered to be easier, and MUCH more melee friendly. It requires 3 tanks.\nAt the very beginning, the fight should be done the same way as above, with the bosses and wolves kept close together for easy cleave and AoE damage, with everyone attacking Darkfang and Bloodclaw, the wolves. However, once the wolves are down, the raid should split into 2 groups, with one group attacking Haromm and the other group attacking Kardris.\nHaromm group.\nThe group attacking Haromm should have 2 tanks, all the melee DPS, and as many healers as you think you will need (They will need to be able to heal through Toxic Mist). This group should go either inside Grommash Hold or up the hill to the northeast, depending on preference, and stay there for the rest of the fight. Players in the Haromm group will have to worry about Foul Stream (Green line) and Ashen Wall (Line of elementals).\nThe active tank should stand inside an alcove with his back to the wall so that Ashen Wall doesn't get in the way, and the tanks should move to a different alcove each time that happens, and whenever a taunt swap is needed.\nWhenever a player gets Foul Stream, he should move so that it does not run through the rest of the group. Proceed like that for the rest of the fight. At 25%, the bosses will cast Bloodlust. At this point, you should cast your own Bloodlust, and burn the bosses down as quickly as possible.\nIf there are any warriors, rogues, or monks in the group, you can disarm Haromm with &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dismantle\"&gt;Dismantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grapple%20Weapon\"&gt;Grapple Weapon&lt;/a&gt;. This will impair Haromm's attack power, reducing stress on the tank and healer. If there are multiple players capable of disarming Haromm, you may want to set up a rotation to keep him disarmed as much as possible.\nKardris group.\nThe group attacking Kardris should have 1 tank, all the ranged DPS, and as many healers as you think you will need. This group should stay outside. Players in the Kardris group will have to worry about Toxic Geyser (Slimes), the toxic storms (Purple AoE), and the Falling Ash (Big red circle).\nWhenever the slimes appear, the ranged DPS will need to kill them as quickly as possible, and players will need to avoid letting them get within melee range. Other than that, pretty much all you have to do is avoid the slimes and the red and purple telegraphs, and you'll be good. Proceed like that for the rest of the fight. At 25%, the bosses will cast Bloodlust. At this point, you should cast your own Bloodlust, and burn the bosses down as quickly as possible.\nAchievement: Rescue Raiders.\nThe achievement criteria for &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Raiders\"&gt;Rescue Raiders&lt;/a&gt; is done on the trash preceeding the Dark Shaman, and not on the boss encounter itself (although achievement credit is only given once the bosses are defeated).\nTo save &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, the trash around him will need to be taken out before he is executed. This requires the tanks to pull his trash as soon as possible once the raid enters Orgrimmar, and for DPS to be quick about killing the Overseer in the trash pack.\nOnce Ji Firepaw has been saved, the raid can then rescue a group of unwilling combat participants. Either the neutral group of orcs outside Grommash Hold or the Theramore prisoners near the auction house will suffice. They can however be killed (a legendary cloak proc will decimate them), so the best idea is to have the neutral mobs CC'd, then have a death knight grip the Overseer controlling the neutral mobs over to the raid and have the raid then nuke the Overseer down. If done correctly, the neutral mobs will turn friendly and run away.\nRescuing a set of caged prisoners is the easiest step to perform. Kill Mokaur (he can be found in the bank), loot his keys, and let the prisoners out of the nearby cages.\nOnce all three groups have been rescued, achievement credit will be given if the Dark Shaman are defeated in the same raid lockout."}

Thus, she decided to join the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; and become a &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; by cutting out her eyes and dedicating herself to the destruction of the Legion.\nKor'vas was present when &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of the Illidari, was preparing his demon hunters to launch an assault on a demonic world ruled by the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azgoth\"&gt;Azgoth&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kor'vas still harbored doubts; bending the knee, she openly asked Lord Illidan what made the Illidari \u2014 who had demonic energies coursing through their veins and gnawing at their every thought \u2014 different from the monsters they fought against. Illidan leapt down on the ground in front of Kor'vas and looked at her silently for a moment before rising to a standing position again. He then proclaimed to the Illidari that they would not sit idly like the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, waiting to become the demons' prey; instead, they would take the fight to the Legion's worlds and prey upon them. The demon hunters charged into the portal to Azgoth's domain, fighting their way through the &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; defenses of the demonic citadel. During the ensuing battle with Azgoth, Illidan was wounded by the pit lord's enormous flail. As the annihilan was about to finish the Betrayer, Kor'vas leaped forward and blocked the blow with her warglaive. In response, the annihilan backhanded her up against a wall and growled that she smelled \"more demon than hunter\" and that she would serve the Burning Legion well. Kor'vas simply replied \"Never\" as Illidan launched himself into the air and stabbed the pit lord in the back with the Twin Blades of Azzinoth, instantly killing him.\nAfter the battle, Illidan retrieved Kor'vas' dropped glaive and approached her again.\nIllidan's lips curved into a slight smile as he gave Kor'vas' glaive back to her, before leaping up on a cliff and proclaiming that the Legion would know of the demon hunters' victory, that they would come to fear the Illidari and that the demon hunters were now prepared.\nLegion.\nOn the prison home world of &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, she fought alongside the demon hunter as much as she could. An &lt;a href=\"imp%20mother\"&gt;imp mother&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Prolifica\"&gt;Prolifica&lt;/a&gt; resides in &lt;a href=\"Foul%20Creche\"&gt;Foul Creche&lt;/a&gt;. She was reported by to the camp cause Kayn properly needed help killing a demon.\nUpon returning to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;heroes of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Kor'vas exclaimed to avenge the master but failed and were put in stasis for a time until the Burning Legion returned for the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon release, Kor'vas was ready for a fight and the prison was out of control because of being released too. Two in particular: the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27golm\"&gt;Ash'golm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glazer\"&gt;Glazer&lt;/a&gt; were running loose and needed to be sealed back up in their chambers. Altruis and Kayn were dealing blow after blow and Kor'vas tried to stop it from continuing but couldn't. The Pool of Judgement can reflect upon memories of the past, and as a result came to choose between Altruis and Kayn.\nSoon after, Kor'vas spotted the traitor &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; amongst the Legion, with powerful weapons in hands. Kor'vas was then sent by Altruis/Kayn to speak with the demon hunter to meet them at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Upon return, she was relieved that the champion was successful in obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;arti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;fact&lt;/a&gt;. They glided to an island in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to complete the ritual to open the portal to the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, she is greeted by the champion and accompanied them to confront demon hunters that were being held captive. Kor'vas questioned them about what happened and who did this to them. They simply responded that they didn't give in, for they did things to them for the demons promised us unimaginable power. A warden tried to convince them to turn traitor and heard screaming for &lt;a href=\"Cyana%20Nightglaive\"&gt;Cyana Nightglaive&lt;/a&gt; was among them. She went southwest with the warden &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;. Kor'vas was looking forward to killing her for what she did to Cyana. They found the &lt;a href=\"blue%20drake\"&gt;blue drake&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt; and the key to free her as well. Upon release, the drake flew to the one responsible for chaining her. Kor'vas wasn't too happy with the result that transpired as she rushed towards the drake and Cyana direction. She told Cyana to not give in, but simply was pursued with words of if she only knew the Legion's power and Cyana told Kor'vas to join the Legion. Kor'vas rejected and said that no one can be allowed to become a &lt;a href=\"Felsworn\"&gt;Felsworn&lt;/a&gt; traitor working for the enemy.\nOn the Fel Hammer, troops were needed if they are to succeed in there part of the war. Kor'vas wanted to know if Gaardoun's new Ashtongue warriors were ready and responded that in the future it will take longer to make more. They come across a demon hunter named &lt;a href=\"Loramus%20Thalipedes\"&gt;Loramus Thalipedes&lt;/a&gt;, and Kor'vas thought if it is so would they save him or kill him. She told the demon hunter to be careful when talking to Loramus because half the time he's down there threatening them in the demonic tongue. Blood is required and wished that she was going with the champion. After bringing back &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; or his &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;, she was recruited alongside him. She told the demon hunter that she should have been the first champion.\nLegionfall.\nKor'vas was one of the order hall champions who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nKor'vas and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; observe the demons steal the heart of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;, who the Illidari had defeated during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, from the vaults of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. After Prophet Velen confirms that Kruul is regenerating within the Nether and his heart is hastening the process, Kor'vas and the adventurer travel to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and work to pry open a doorway to Kruul's realm. Kor'vas decides that the two of them cannot handle Kruul alone and sends the adventurer back to Dalaran to report to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; while she keeps the portal stable.\nLater, the adventurer, Kor'vas, and Velen confronted Kruul inside the Twisting Nether. Kor'vas was initially held captive by &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Variss\"&gt;Inquisitor Variss&lt;/a&gt;, but after his death aids in the fight with Kruul. Before he could die Kruul overloaded himself with power to self-destruct and kill his opponents along with him, but Velen saved Kor'vas and the adventurer.\nWhen the \"Fel Hammer\" comes under attack by &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Vandel\"&gt;Vandel&lt;/a&gt; sends a message asking for aid on the surface of Mardum, Kor'vas travels down with the Slayer to help and to find &lt;a href=\"Lady%20S%27theno\"&gt;Lady S'theno&lt;/a&gt;. Kor'vas, S'theno, and the Slayer lead the defense of the \"Fel Hammer\" against the demons, risking destroying the ship by using its damaged weapons. Afterward, S'theno travels to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; to find replacement parts and Kor'vas directs the Slayer to her.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Kor'vas carried the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a demon hunter, representing the Illidari.\nLocations.\n \nQuotes.\nGossip.\n&lt;Name&gt;, the Burning Legion is sending the most powerful demons in its arsenal against us. They do not intend to lose this third war and they will stop at nothing to see to it that we are all wiped from the face of Azeroth.\nTogether, we will return the favor.\nThank you for saving us over on Faronaar, &lt;name&gt;.\nI can't believe that Cyana turned Traitor. She betrayed us all. There are others who have also become Felsworn. We will hunt them down and kill them along with their new Legion masters.\nThis I swear!\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He became available when Season 7 started, on September 1 (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3Fsid%3D1%26amp%3BtopicId%3D19110027050%26amp%3BST%3DUS-4930506-EcStuJbOxYG2LgjgcpOMWbNTktIsDcBFwku\"&gt;Season 6 ended on August 25th&lt;/a&gt;). Like &lt;a href=\"Archavon%20the%20Stone%20Watcher\"&gt;Archavon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emalon%20the%20Storm%20Watcher\"&gt;Emalon&lt;/a&gt;, Koralon is only available to the faction that controls Wintergrasp Fortress. Also like Archavon and Emalon, he will despawn ten minutes before each fight for Wintergrasp starts. He does not despawn if he is already engaged in combat.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; came to the Vault to find a way to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, the giant brothers who made it their home were less than cordial when he arrived, still furious after their previous encounters with the adventurers from both factions.\nStrategy.\nRight after the pull, Koralon begins to stack Burning Fury, giving the fight a soft enrage. Koralon does not have a hard enrage.\nBecause of his Meteor Fists self-buff (amplified by Burning Fury), you will need to use two tanks standing in one spot. The Meteor Fists damage will be shared between those two tanks. It might be useful when not using 2 tanks to have high health melee classes around Koralon so the tank will not face too much damage from the Meteor Fists.\nEveryone must get out of the fire spots quickly. Tanks should agree on which side to leave by. The Burning Breath ability (amplified by Burning Fury), where Koralon spins around, cannot be avoided and must be healed through.\nDue to the heavy incoming damage on both the tanks and the raid it is recommended to have 3 healers. Make sure you have either &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Resistance%20Totem\"&gt;Elemental Resistance Totem&lt;/a&gt; up since most of Koralon's damage is based on fire.\nIt is also highly recommended that all members of the raid have an Add-On like &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/deadly-boss-mods.aspx\"&gt;Deadly Boss Mods&lt;/a&gt;, which assists greatly in alerting one of the fire spots.\nLoot.\n10 man drops Tier 9 (ilevel 232) gloves and legs and &lt;a href=\"Season%206\"&gt;Season 6&lt;/a&gt; Gladiator gear (back, feet, finger, hands, legs, neck, waist and wrist). 25 man drops &lt;a href=\"Tier%209\"&gt;Tier 9&lt;/a&gt; (ilevel 245) gloves and legs and &lt;a href=\"Season%207\"&gt;Season 7&lt;/a&gt; Gladiator gear (back, feet, finger, hands, legs, neck, waist and wrist).\nAdditionally, he has a chance to drop .\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

When they returned only with his ring, Korfax announced that this did not bode well for Ramaladni, but that his ring might be salvageable, leading to the creation of &lt;a href=\"Ramaladni%27s%20Icy%20Grasp\"&gt;Ramaladni's Icy Grasp&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, he aided warrior adventurers in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadnaught%27s%20Battlegear\"&gt;Dreadnaught's Battlegear&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to bring back to him the desecrated battlements and wartorn plate scraps they would come across in their battles with the Scourge, in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, to forge them an armor worn by heroes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nCrusade Commander Korfax was present during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, defending the chapel alongside &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; and the Argent Dawn against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;. Following the withdrawal of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, he witnessed the merger of the Argent Dawn and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; as the Argent Crusade, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was among the first to plunge into the &lt;a href=\"Northrend%20campaign\"&gt;Northrend campaign&lt;/a&gt;, where he appeared as the Crusade Commander of the Crusade's troops at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Stand\"&gt;Argent Stand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. He participated in the experiments to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, an evil ore used by the Lich King to arm the Scourge, attempting to destroy it with his &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Reaper\"&gt;Arcanite Reaper&lt;/a&gt;, but it was ineffective.\nDespite Inigo Montoy's treachery in the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who became the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thel%27zan%20the%20Duskbringer\"&gt;Thel'zan the Duskbringer&lt;/a&gt; for serving the Lich King, Korfax and the Brotherhood eventually triumphed over the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and returned to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Korfax appeared alongside &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angela%20Dosantos\"&gt;Angela Dosantos&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the town from the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; who infested it with an assault force of one hundred men. Aided by adventurers, Korfax and the Brotherhood were able to capture the city and eliminate the Scarlet leadership including the then undead Valdelmar himself. At the same time, he ordered adventurers to retrieve, within the Scarlet Crusade's barracks, the artifacts that are the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Boar\"&gt;Crimson Boar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lihanna%27s%20Strand\"&gt;Lihanna's Strand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20Uther\"&gt;Shroud of Uther&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%27s%20Sigil\"&gt;Gavinrad's Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, hidden in chests as the objects are too holy for their now-undead hand to touch. Once in his possession, he announces that he intends to deliver them to &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith this, the Scarlet Crusade definitely lost its hold over the city, which came under the control of the Brotherhood of the Light.\nSome time later he appeared alongside several other members of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Service%20Entrance\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to aid &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in retaking the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-infested city, ordering them, in particular, to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Ramstein%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Ramstein the Gorger&lt;/a&gt; for all the atrocities the monster has committed.\nQuotes.\nWhat is the Brotherhood of the Light? Well... We are all members of the Argent Crusade at the core - members of the Argent Crusade that aren't held in check by morals, guilt and useless human emotion.\nThere are no emotions. There are no morals. There are no zealots.\nThere is only the Brotherhood.\nHere, in the very chapel where Uther the Lightbringer joined the Order of the Silver Hand, I, Korfax, Champion of the Light, will inspire fear into the fearless.\nNothing will curb my fury - not the Scarlet Crusade, not the Argent Dawn, not my brothers, not even you.\nThis is a fine mess we've gotten ourselves into.

In the guise of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; Krasus, he was a senior member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling council of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nKorialstrasz was known for his stand-up confidence and self-control, and for being both a fighter and hyper-intelligent. He was involved in many important events of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history, such as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the effort to free Alexstrasza from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the events leading up to and following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. While tending to the new clutch of red dragon eggs within the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz sacrificed himself to halt the nefarious efforts of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAt the beginning of the first war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz became incredibly and inexplicably weak. The cause, which Alexstrasza later determined, was Korialstrasz's future self, Krasus, existing the same time period as a result of being flung back from ten thousand years in the future (See the \"present time\" section below). Neither incarnation was able to shape-shift during this time. After being rescued from Cenarius' glade, Krasus was brought to Life Caverns, home of the Reds, where he was united with his past self. Despite great temptation, Krasus refrained from revealing any future events to anyone, even his queen, from fear of radically altering the future. Aided by a vision from &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; the Timeless One, the younger and older Korialstraszs then teamed up to find the young &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, eventually joining the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; resistance to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion. Often, while Krasus led the night elf spellcasters, Korialstrasz would either aid the host from above, raining fire down on the demons, or rally some sort of surprise ally. Both Krasus and Korialstrasz fought valiantly against the likes of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; the Destructor, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; the Defiler, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer, and their twisted former friend and allies, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and the legion's defeat, Krasus and his companions were returned to their own time by Nozdormu.\nOne hundred years before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz killed the &lt;a href=\"Manta\"&gt;Manta&lt;/a&gt;, a creature ten times the size and strength of a dragon, with an arrow covered in three drops of a black liquid from a vial.\nSecond War and after.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz assumed the identity of a high elf mage named Krasus, and became one of the senior leaders of the Kirin Tor \u2014 the ruling council of the magocratic kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. Hardly anyone knew who he really was: Antonidas's apprentice &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was not one of those privy to the truth.\nHe, along with his colleagues, questioned the young mage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; some years previous \u2014 including the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the apparent presence of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and Khadgar's descriptions of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Second War, Krasus learned from Antonidas that &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s riding on black dragons had stolen several ships from the &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. At that moment, the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Vault\"&gt;Arcane Vault&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran was destroyed and robbed of its artifact - the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; by death knights. Krasus, Kael, and a few others then helped Antonidas in attacking the death knights, however, they escaped with the help of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his black dragons.\nDay of the Dragon.\nKrasus used his position to his advantage when Alexstrasza was captured by the Horde and held prisoner so that her children would serve the orcish war effort. Korialstrasz continued to fight the battle that his kinsmen had given up long ago; the freeing of the Dragonqueen from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. All of that came for nothing though until, at the end of the war, the Kirin Tor sent &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; on an observatory mission to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Korialstrasz gave Rhonin other orders: to free Alexstrasza. Knowing that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; would surely arrive to kill the Dragonqueen, Korialstrasz attempted to seek out the other three Aspects, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, realizing only with their help could the black dragon be defeated. However, their responses held bleak hope for his Queen. Whilst trying to scry into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Lord Prestor&lt;/a&gt;'s hovel, he triggered a magical trap known as the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Hunger\"&gt;Endless Hunger&lt;/a&gt;, and lost the two last fingers on his left hand.\nWhen the final battle at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; began, Korialstrasz assumed dragon form once more and made haste in order to recapture the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros tried to use the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; on him but despite its great power, Korialstrasz was able to break free. Weakened, he dropped to the earth where he summoned Rhonin to him and asked him to do this task. The three &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; arrived and healed Korialstrasz, then battled Deathwing. The battle took a turn for the worse until Rhonin destroyed the Demon Soul and the Aspects could now attack with their full power. Deathwing was no match for their combined might, and fled. Korialstrasz was reunited with his Queen and, after gathering up her unhatched children, they disappeared off into the night.\nSeveral years before the Third War, Krasus was present at a banquet held in honor of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and Kael who at the same time were present in Dalaran.\nWar of the Ancients - present time.\nKorialstrasz was later called upon by Nozdormu to heal a rift in time. While exploring the time anomaly, Krasus and his former apprentice Rhonin were swallowed by the anomaly and thrown ten thousand years into the past. (See \"War of the Ancients\" section above). Upon his return to his own time period, Korialstrasz delivered the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Axe of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and story of &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; to the Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, then flew off to rejoin Alexstrasza.\nThe Sunwell.\nKorialstrasz originally saw the re-accumulation of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s energy right after &lt;a href=\"Kael\"&gt;Kael&lt;/a&gt; returned to the forsaken homeland and destroyed the tainted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and did not want the Lich King's new &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, to discover it. Korialstrasz formed the energy into a humanoid shape \u2014 the form of a peasant girl named &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. Hiding the truth from her until a later time, Korialstrasz gave Anveena the illusion of having lived a normal life. Though not intentionally, she came to life and gained feelings and emotions all on her own through his masterful illusion.\nYears later, Anveena and &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; began searching for a mysterious mage named Borel in order to remove cursed collars. Borel had appeared to &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt; who during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; wanted to escape the mad Arthas. Having no strength, Borel helped Jorad to survive. Borel's true identity is later revealed - the red dragon Korialstrasz. He began telling Anveena the truth \u2014 that she was the avatar of the Sunwell \u2014 when &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, the elf who allowed Arthas into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, intervened and began draining the power from her.\nKorialstrasz never meant to intrude upon the events taking place, until Dar'Khan \u2014 upon gaining some of the power of the Sunwell he drained from Anveena \u2014 took control of the red dragon. Unable to break the mind control, Korialstrasz was forced to do battle with the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, until the spell was broken by &lt;a href=\"Raac\"&gt;Raac&lt;/a&gt;. While the battle against Dar'Khan continued, Korialstrasz had once more stepped to the side to observe all of what transpired. In the end, he said that he would continue to watch over Anveena and Kalec through the eyes of Raac as they stayed in the care of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, the Regent of Quel'Thalas.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, a high elf named &lt;a href=\"Garek\"&gt;Garek&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that he was sent by his master, Krasus of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and later sent the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to battle against &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Kirin%27Var%20Village\"&gt;Kirin'Var Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to recover the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Krasus\"&gt;Sigil of Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and the three parts of the &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27s%20Compendium\"&gt;Krasus's Compendium&lt;/a&gt;, powerful artifacts granted by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to the contingent of Dalaran mages who accompanied &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to Draenor, in order to break the enchantment that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; used to imprison the archmage in his tower.\nNight of the Dragon.\nSeeking something amiss Krasus decides to journey to Grim Batol in order to understand what force was darkening its halls. En route to his destination he is attacked by a band of &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; and after dealing with them, he continues his journey in his mortal disguise. In time he would meet the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; priestess &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt; and re-encounter Kalec. At first, Kalec's attitude towards the consort of Alexstrasza was bitter and antagonistic; he blamed Krasus for his constant interference, and particularly for giving Anveena the illusion of life knowing how it would end. The pair would eventually end up arguing, and Krasus would reveal that he took the time to memorize the lives of everyone he had manipulated. The two dragons would then separate from Iridi as Kalec rushed off and Krasus teleported her away. During the battle that followed the pair would be captured and brought to Grim Batol.\nIn Grim Batol's halls, Kalec and Krasus discovered the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, now known as Sinestra, creating a new flight of dragons. Working together, oftentimes begrudgingly, the pair were able to escape and, working with &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei priestess &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, they overcame Sintharia and her creation, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. Iridi perished in the final battle, and Kalec took it upon himself to return her body to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. When asked by Krasus if Malygos would allow him to go to Outland, Kalec replied that \u2014 permitted or not \u2014 he was going anyway; to see Outland once more was Iridi's dying wish, and she deserved to be buried there. Krasus then departed Grim Batol in order to return to his queen.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz was located at the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, in the guise of Krasus, at the side of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Nalice\"&gt;Nalice&lt;/a&gt;'s comments, it was Korialstrasz who called for the dragonflights to unite as the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, in order to battle &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, he was present at the Wrathgate in his natural dragonform alongside his queen.\nUpon obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Focusing%20Iris%20%28starter%29\"&gt;Key to the Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, Krasus gave the adventurers the mission of defeating Malygos and to recover the &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;Heart of Magic&lt;/a&gt;, the most prized possession of the mad Aspect of Magic.\nIn addition, a platform known as &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; was named in the rebuilt city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where the city's flight masters are located.\nStormrage.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; attacked Azeroth, Korialstrasz was settled down in his mountain sanctum near the place where Dalaran once stood. There, he had nightmares in which he became the source of Deathwing's new Demon Soul. Following the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz was present for the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, as Alexstrasza was performing the ceremony alongside &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nAfter the cataclysm, the dragons convened upon Wyrmrest Temple to have their first meeting with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; since the death of Malygos. Korialstrasz, not particularly liked by many of the blues, specifically &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, chose to stay behind and watch his newest clutch of eggs in the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. As Alexstrasza attended the meeting above, Korialstrasz discovered the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; within the sanctum, casting dark spells on the eggs. Confronting them, he discovered that their spells had mutated the hatchlings, transforming them into deformed &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragons&lt;/a&gt;. When he touched the first mutated hatchling, the infection passed on to him. It was then revealed to him via the gloating by one of the dying cultists that Korialstrasz had crushed that not only was the entire clutch of eggs infected, but \"every\" flight's eggs, in each of their sanctums. Slowly mutating into a Chromatic dragon but thinking of his beloved Queen one last time, Korialstrasz summoned every ounce of his life energy to link the portals of all the sanctums together and imploded, destroying a good chunk of Wyrmrest Temple, and utterly obliterating himself and the sanctums. Along with the sanctums fell the thousands of corrupted, hatching eggs. While his death and seeming betrayal were a shock to the other dragonflights, Alexstrasza suffered the most. In sadness bordering on madness, she shattered the Wyrmrest Accord and fled to the center of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, where she sat waiting for death. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; attempted to rouse her from her depression but could not.\nLater, during a battle above Wyrmrest Temple, Thrall had a near-death experience after falling from extraordinary heights. In his vision, given to him by the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, among other things he saw the truth behind Korialstrasz's actions. When the battle had ended, Thrall brought the news to Alexstrasza, who rejoined the fight with renewed purpose to not let her love's sacrifice be in vain. Before fighting &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;, Alexsrasza revealed the truth behind her mate's actions before the other dragonflights in order to clear his name and boost morale in the face of the danger before them.\nAlternate timeline.\nA version of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; exists in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out completely different and which was entered by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; right after Korialstrasz's death in the main timeline.\nTides of War.\nAt some point before his demise, Krasus made the following prophecy and bequeathed it to Rhonin, describing a future leader of the Kirin Tor:\n&lt;poem&gt;\"After the red comes the silver,\"\n\"She who was golden and bright;\"\n\"The Proud Lady humbled and bitter,\"\n\"Shall now turn her thoughts to the fight.\"\n\"Saphire to diamond she gleams now,\"\n\"The Kirin Tor leader who comes,\"\n\"\"Queen\" of a kingdom now fallen,\"\n\"Marching to war's martial drums.\"\n\"Be ye warned - the tides of war\"\n\"At last shall break upon the shore.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe prophecy was fulfilled with the death of Rhonin and the ascendancy of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, former ruler of the destroyed city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, as leader of the Kirin Tor.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Korialstrasz could be seen in a flashback of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, where he attacked the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from above during a battle in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. He also appeared in a flashback in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; was riding on his back.\nIn the RPG.\nKorialstrasz is an ancient, wise, and powerful dragon of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. He was Alexstrasza's newest consort just prior to the War of the Ancients and continues to be so to this day. As her current prime consort, Korialstrasz acts as Alexstrasza's majordomo in all affairs. He is fiercely loyal to his queen, and was \"first in love\" among her consorts. As an active agent of the red dragonflight he is a protector of all things living, often spending time away from his queen and kin for his duties. He constantly watches over the younger races, often taking mortal guises and hiding amongst them. His most prominent guise in recent times is that of Krasus, a &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; mage of the Kirin Tor, and a member of the Six; the ruling council of Dalaran.\nKrasus appears to be a high elf wizard of extreme confidence, secure in his power and rank among the council. His very presence commands respect, and yet he is not proud or haughty. He remains in his elven form almost exclusively, transforming into a dragon only for special reasons or when in the presence of others of his kind. Those few who know his true nature have agreed to keep it a secret.\nKrasus remains in his elven shape as long as possible during battle, revealing his dragon form only if desperate. He almost never shows his great strength in physical combat, preferring instead to fight with the spells and other arcane powers at his disposal. Should he choose to show his dragon side, he takes to the air swiftly, using his breath weapon and spell-like abilities to speed his escape. For all his strength and power, he is actually quite inexperienced in draconic combat. After all, he\u2019s had little opportunity to practice during his decades of roaming the surface of Azeroth in humanoid form.\nMemorable quotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n&lt;The queen's consort nods in acknowledgement of your presence.&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Red dragons]]\n[[Category:Mage characters]]\n[[Category:Archmages]]\n[[Category:Wyrmrest Accord]]\n[[Category:Kirin Tor]]\n[[Category:Dalaran (kingdom)]]\n[[Category:Quest givers]]\n[[Category:Dragonblight NPCs]]\n[[Category:Azshara NPCs]]\n[[Category:Val'sharah NPCs]]\n[[Category:Day of the Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:The Sunwell Trilogy characters]]\n[[Category:War of the Ancients Trilogy characters]]\n[[Category:Tides of Darkness characters]]\n[[Category:Night of the Dragon characters]]\n[[Category:Arthas: Rise of the Lich King characters]]\n[[Category:Beyond the Dark Portal characters]]\n[[Category:Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased characters]]\n[[Category:Blood of the Highborne characters]]\n[[Category:Before the Storm characters]]\n[[pl:Korialstrasz]]"}

We must quickly make our way atop the Spiral of Thorns and defeat him before the ritual can be completed.\nWe must strike together, only with our combined force can we hope to stop him!\nI too thought Amnennar the Coldbringer had been defeated; a grave mistake indeed. How clouded my judgment must have been to forget the true power of a lich lies in the phylactery.\nA powerful &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; such as Amnennar can store his soul in a physical vessel, allowing himself to be reborn if the proper rituals can be completed.\nI should have searched across Kalimdor for Amnennar's Phylactery, but I was too prideful in our previous victory.\nNow, all of that work may come undone.\nI know Death Speaker Blackthorn's newest creation, &lt;a href=\"Mushlump\"&gt;Mushlump&lt;/a&gt;, spews forth plague from every pore and he has reenlisted &lt;a href=\"Mordresh%20Fire%20Eye\"&gt;Modresh Fire Eye&lt;/a&gt;'s help in rallying the undead.\nEven the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;Death's Head&lt;/a&gt; has been helping Blackthorn. Their Arachnomancers have created a monstrosity of fang and plague, a spider of enormous size named &lt;a href=\"Aarux\"&gt;Aarux&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you could defeat these enemies and clear the plague blocking my path we could climb the Spiral of Thorns to defeat Death Speaker Blackthorn and recapture Amnennar's phylactery before it is too late.\nYou've done it! The plague preventing my access has been disrupted and we can now begin our final push to disrupt Death Speaker Blackthorn's ritual. Lead on if you are ready to begin.\nThank you brave heroes. Without your help Amnennar would have returned to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and brought untold horrors with him.\nI will return this dangerous artifact to my brothers and sisters of the red dragonflight.

He is the spirit of strength. Xuen has two named children, &lt;a href=\"Ban-Lu\"&gt;Ban-Lu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xu-Fu%2C%20Cub%20of%20Xuen\"&gt;Xu-Fu&lt;/a&gt;, and a granddaughter, &lt;a href=\"Ban-Fu\"&gt;Ban-Fu&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Duel of Thunder and Strength.\nThousands of years ago as the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; was growing, the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; fled to the harsh climate of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, seeking the protection of Xuen, the White Tiger. Xuen offered them sanctuary for a time. Slaves were required for the building of the mogu's cities and fortresses, and so the armies of the Thunder King marched onto Kun-Lai. So rather than attack the summit, Lei Shen boomed with his mighty voice: \"Choose the greatest warrior among you and have him face me in one on one combat. Should I win, your people will submit to my rule. Should he win, I shall leave these lands in peace.\" \"Challenge accepted!\" came a voice that boomed across the mountains almost as strong as the thunderous presence of Lei Shen. From the mountains descended Xuen, the White Tiger. The August Celestial had seen the plight of the free peoples and could bear it no more. It is said this duel lasted for thirty days and thirty nights, and the emotions of this duel awoke the sha in great force. But in the end, Xuen fell, crushed by the sheer might of Lei Shen's unearthly power. And so Xuen was bound at the highest peak, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Neverest\"&gt;Mount Neverest&lt;/a&gt;, and made to watch as the pandaren and hozen were made slaves. But the tiger never submitted to Lei Shen's torture. In captivity, he grew stronger. His failure was a lesson, his &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;pride&lt;/a&gt; now in check, and he waited until the pandaren slaves would &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;dare to challenge&lt;/a&gt; the might of the mogu emperors.\nThe pandaren revolution.\nMillennia years later, a pandaren named &lt;a href=\"Kang\"&gt;Kang&lt;/a&gt; began teaching his fellow slaves the ways of the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;. When rumors of the movement reached mogu ears, Kang and his fellow monks relocated to &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where they built a secret monastery to continue their training. Kang also discovered something completely unexpected: the prison of Xuen. The White Tiger's isolation had not made him angry or bitter, but had simply made him eager to help. The pandaren often communed with the White Tiger, and Xuen taught him the secrets of harnessing one's inner strength \u2014 teachings that Kang passed along to his students, and which were eventually used by the pandaren and the other slave races to topple the mogu empire. Xuen taught Kang not only the strength of raw power, but the strength of endurance. He told the pandaren that to know strength, he had to look to the little life he could find in the heights. Kang looked and saw the twisted, gnarled trees growing along the Kun-Lai ridgelines. The trees' trunks were sturdy and strong and their roots were deep, as they needed to be in order to endure the biting winds. The pandaren used these trees to build the walls of their monastery and craft their first weapons \u2014 not blades, like the mogu used, but staves. Kang brought his staff to Xuen, who blessed it, after which the monk named it \"&lt;a href=\"Sheilun%2C%20Staff%20of%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Sheilun&lt;/a&gt;\" after his &lt;a href=\"Sheilun\"&gt;late son&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Kang's death and the revolution's end, the staff was brought back to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; he and his monks had built in the mountains. Xuen warned the monks that, although they were now free, they had inherited the responsibility to protect their homeland from the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, violent insectoid creatures who swarmed the great &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall every one hundred years in an attempt to conquer all of Pandaria. Every century, the pandaren held fast against the waves of mantid, and Xuen always allowed one &lt;a href=\"monk%23Mistweaver\"&gt;mistweaver&lt;/a&gt; to carry Sheilun into the battle.\nThe Burdens of Shaohao.\nOn the day of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;'s coronation, Xuen sent a monk from Kun-Lai with the gift of Sheilun to the new and last pandaren emperor.\nAfter he freed himself of his doubts, despair, and fear, Shaohao, journeyed to the high peaks of Kun-Lai Summit, where Xuen and the greatest warriors of Pandaria resided. As Shaohao announced his need of an army, Xuen, having recognized a great darkness within the brash emperor, asked him why he fought. When Shaohao replied his intention to crush the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and anyone who stood in his way, Xuen refused to hand him his warriors, but issued a challenge to the emperor: If he managed to touch any of the tiger's warriors with his staff, they were his to command. For hours Shaohao fought, but the warriors were too quick and too nimble for the untrained emperor. As Shaohao grew angry, he cursed and broke the staff over his knee, which brought forth his own &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;hatred&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Violence\"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;. Defenseless, Shaohao was attacked by the sha he created, but as the smoke cleared, the emperor was unharmed, as one of the warriors had sacrificed himself for him.

The White Tiger did not, however, intend to keep them forever, for he knew that though the mogu had used them for evil, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; had originally created them for good, and he believed that it was only a matter of time until a worthy mortal arrived to take up the fist and the shield in a righteous cause once again.\nTimeless Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Xuen%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;The trial of Xuen&lt;/a&gt; is simultaneously a test of strength and a test of restraint.

Two tanks are required.\nXuen's Spectral Swipe will apply a stacking armor debuff in a frontal cone, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt;. Tanks should switch at three stacks, keeping Xuen faced away from the raid. He will sometimes use Leap and slash a random player in the same fashion, so the raid should be spread out to avoid more than one person being slashed at once. Crackling Lightning is a strong raid-wide damage attack that must be healed through. When Xuen casts the magic Agility buff on himself, it must be dispelled or the tanks will most likely die. Lastly, Chi Barrage launches several hard to see Chi Bursts into the air which will crash down and do splash damage. These bursts must be dodged to avoid major damage. "}

However one day an unnatural famine found their village and the fish disappeared from the sea, which caused the residents of the village to suffer. Even as families began to abandon the town in droves, the stubborn twelve year old Xun refused to leave and vowed to get get a fish in order to feed not just his family, but the entire village as well.\nAfter many different attempts at getting fish the angry Xun waded out into the ocean and then drove underneath the water. While he did sea a fish he was unable to catch to do seeing it being captured by a monster that was huge and ropy like an eel, but was scrunched up as though it could not fully stretch itself out.. Quickly realizing that this creature was responsible for lack of fish being captured by the people of Za Xiang, Xun swallowed his fear and swam after the creature and stole the fish right out of its mouth and quickly hurried home. As he entered his home he dropped the fish on the table and told his family that they did not have to leave, they just had to find a new way to fish and then could feed everyone.\nWhile the villagers were able to successfully catch fish once more, it was not effort to feed the whole town and Xun decided the only to save his village was to deal with the monster. While he was unable to attract the monster, he did catch the attention of a group of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20turtle\"&gt;Dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and during the battle that followed Xun was eventually swallowed whole. However Xun was able to hold his breath long enough for the dragon turtle to drown and due air within Xun's lungs did not sink. As such when a villager spotted the beast and brought to town Xun was freed when the villagers cut the beast's belly open to the relief of Xun's family. With the meat of the dragon turtle, the villagers of Za Xiang were full for the first time in a long while.\nAs the years went by the people would continue to eat the dragon turtles and other creatures that Xun brought them when he ventured forth. In time the people Za Xiang stopped fished and began relying on Xun and while Xun was happy to take care of everyone, he began to worry as old age came over him that the people of the village (who could not haul up the fauna like he could) would be forced to leave the village when he passed on. He was also increasingly concerned about the lack of fish present within the waters.\nAs such Xun ventured into the ocean in order to combat the monster of legend from the tales he remembers hearing as a boy. When he found such a create the two battled for days without rest but in the end Xun was victorious. However Xun himself was too exhausted from the battle and eventually died in the cave, while seeing the fish (ancestors of the golden carp) escape to freedom."}

In the Nether, the doomlord licked his wounds and awaited the Legion's next campaign.\nHis current whereabouts are unknown.\nSpeculation.\n\"Doomlord\" or \"doom lord\" has been used both to refer to powerful &lt;a href=\"ered%27ruin\"&gt;ered'ruin&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;) and to the &lt;a href=\"Doom%20lord\"&gt;demonic species&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt; is a member of. It is unclear which of these two races Xyburn belonged to."}

Y'Shaarj was the only one of the four Old Gods to be killed by the titans, and its &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned in a vault beneath the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The heart later found and restored by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who then transported it to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;. The heart was used by Garrosh to increase his power during the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. As Garrosh was defeated, the heart and its power dissipated, leaving nothing left of Y'Shaarj's corrupting influence.\nY'Shaarj was also known as \"the seven headed one\" or \"the beast of seven heads\", and is said to have inhaled courage and breathed fear. When it died, its last, terrible breath manifested as the seven prime &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Anger\"&gt;Anger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Hatred&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Violence\"&gt;Violence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Doubt\"&gt;Doubt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Despair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Pride&lt;/a&gt;. Y'Shaarj is fervently worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, a race of violent, expansionistic &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt;s who dwell in the lands west of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall.\nY'Shaarj serves as the posthumous antagonist in \"\".\nBiography.\nBefore the ordering of Azeroth.\nY'Shaarj was the most powerful of the four &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; to plummet into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, and the greatest bastion of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; was built around its gargantuan bulk.\nWhen the godlike &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s arrived to shape and order &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they created the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; to battle the Old Gods and their enslaved &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; servants. Though the titan-forged were successful in defeating and imprisoning the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lords\"&gt;Elemental Lords&lt;/a&gt;, the titans realized that Y'Shaarj would prove too great a challenge for them; as the titan-forged approached the temple city that lay at the heart of the Black Empire, Y'Shaarj twisted their thoughts and drew out their darkest emotions. Thus, &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, the Highfather himself, reached down through Azeroth's skies and heaved the Old God from the surface of the world. At that moment, the massive bulk of the Old One was ripped apart, and its death rattle caused entire mountains to shatter and hundreds of titan-forged to be instantly obliterated where they stood.\nAman'Thul had inadvertently ripped open a wound in Azeroth's surface, and the &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; lifeblood flowed to the surface. It was then that the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; realized that the Old Gods had entrenched themselves too deep to excise without destroying Azeroth itself, and instead they resolved to imprison the remaining three Old Gods rather than killing them outright.\nInfluence after death.\nAs the titan-forged known as &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; made his way to establish the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; in the southwestern reaches of Azeroth, he came upon the remains of Y'Shaarj, the largest intact part of which was its &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;twisted heart&lt;/a&gt;. Ra resolved to seal the heart in a subterranean vault below the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, in the hope that studying it would help the titan-forged gain a better understanding of the Old Gods and the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Ra then charged some of his &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; followers to watch over the vault and the surrounding lands, before continuing west.\nAfter the war between the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, many years after Y'Shaarj's death, a colony of aqir congregated around the southern areas of Azeroth. Though they did not know it, they were drawn to the lingering presence of the Old One and were soon warped into a new race, known as the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;. The mantid continued to worship their Old God masters for millennia to come.\nLater still, Y'Shaarj's lingering presence also began giving rise to the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;: malevolent spirits who fed on negative emotions.\nExcavation.\nAt the command of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, goblin engineers began excavations in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; to find a mysterious artifact, but found &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;more than they bargained for&lt;/a&gt;. With the mining crew terrorized by an ancient power in the depths, adventurers were called in to retrieve whatever remained of the excavation. After clearing the mine full of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Blood of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers blasted their way into an underground room with an &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Echo of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Vault of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; was found a chest, suspended from chains, which contained the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinal breath.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; later fully restored the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; using the pools of Pandaria. Fortunately, the whole God was not resurrected. The heart was taken to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and placed in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh's new seat of power.\nAfter Garrosh's defeat, the Heart has suffered a failure and the &lt;a href=\"Fading%20Breath\"&gt;Fading Breath&lt;/a&gt; briefly remained on the floor of the Underhold, then faded from existence, ending the life, influence, and corruption of Y'Shaarj. With every Sha Prime and its heart dead, nothing remains of its power.\nThe Klaxxi.\nUpon reaching exalted with the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of mantid that have turned against their &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27ruk%20the%20Wind-Reaver\"&gt;Kil'ruk the Wind-Reaver&lt;/a&gt; will tell the player the story of the mantid's origins and Y'Shaarj.\nThis story foreshadows the events that took during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;Paragons of the Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; ultimately sided with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to uncover the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; and even wield its power to some extent.\nQuotes.\nDuring the fight against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, players can periodically hear the whisperings of Y'Shaarj coming from its reanimated heart.\nYou can also hear whispers from &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atoh%2C%20Desecrated%20Image%20of%20Gorehowl\"&gt;Xal'atoh, Desecrated Image of Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nY'Shaarj's seven heads may explain why &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai\"&gt;Aku'mai&lt;/a&gt;, also multi-headed creatures, are associated with the Old Gods.\nPuzzle Box of Yogg-Saron.\n introduced a new item, the &lt;a href=\"Puzzle%20Box%20of%20Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, which whispers to the player on each attempt to open it. While most of these (extremely vague and cryptic) whispers are thought to describe &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, one describes a \"black goat with seven eyes\", which may refer to Y'Shaarj due to the similar theme of seven eyes/heads. As shown in \"Hearthstone\", Y'Shaarj indeed has seven eyes and goat-like horns (though it should be noted that Y'Shaarj is said to have had seven heads, suggesting the card is only showing one of them).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

These spellcasters are charged with maintaining the wisdom, knowledge, and sacred traditions of the order. She is also the current gatekeeper and decides who can join the order.\nHistory.\nYalia was born as Yalia Sageflower to a prosperous fisherman among many siblings in &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt;. As she grew up, she came to understand that her hand in marriage would be given to the son of another fisherman. However, she couldn't help but notice that she had not one but two candidates: &lt;a href=\"Yenki\"&gt;Yenki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chinwa\"&gt;Chinwa&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, both pandaren began to compete for Yalia's affection, and possessing wisdom beyond her years, she realized their rivalry would not end even after her hand in marriage had been won. Realizing that this rivalry could only end with one of the pair dead and the other guilt-ridden, which would destroy both lives, Yalia made the difficult decision to leave the village; she was not yet even six years old. With the support of her grandmother, who wrapped her granddaughter up in her favorite scarf, she traveled from the village towards the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; accepted her into the order and gave her the name \"Yalia Sagewhisper\".\nThe Trial of the Red Blossoms.\nShortly after the Horde and Alliance discovered &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and explored the continent, Yalia was faced with initiating new pandaren initiates into the Shado-pan. To that end she began the Trial of the Red Blossoms, overseeing the first trial, which was the Test of Resolve. After the first trial, she led the four remaining initiates (&lt;a href=\"Ten\"&gt;Ten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pei-Ling\"&gt;Pei-Ling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Chan\"&gt;Heavy Chan&lt;/a&gt;, and another boy) to Master &lt;a href=\"Wan%20Snowdrift\"&gt;Wan Snowdrift&lt;/a&gt; so that they could undergo the second trial, The Test of Strength. However during this test, to the shock of the Shado-pan, a &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; interrupted the test and attacked the initiates, but the three survivors were able to work together to defeat the sha.\nOver the next week, Master Snowdrift would give the initiates acolyte uniforms as he determined that they had proved their worth, only for Yalia to take them back the next day, as \"three\" trials had not yet been given, only two. After arguing briefly over the matter, they agreed it was up to &lt;a href=\"Hawkmaster%20Nurong\"&gt;Hawkmaster Nurong&lt;/a&gt; to decide.\nNurong, after explaining to the initiates the full consequences of having been exposed to the sha at such a young age and how it would affect them for the rest of their lives, simply asked, for their Trial of Spirit, if the three were still willing to take the Shado-pan oath and face the sha again, much to Yalia's shock. Scowling, she protested that the oath itself could not be the test and must only come after the three tests have been passed. However, Nurong warned her to not instruct him on his duties and reminded her that tradition has the Wu Kao master administer the final test. He explained that the initiates had elected to serve their people, knowing full well what terror awaited them in the coming years and that they had shown the courage and strength of spirit that the order needed in the dark days it now found itself in.\nMists of Pandaria.\nYalia can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Longying%20Outpost\"&gt;Longying Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where she directs Horde and Alliance adventurers to help the Shado-pan in the region.\nShadows of the Horde.\nWith both &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt; recovering at the Shado-Pan Monastery, Yalia was concerned that the Shado-pan could be dragged into the Horde-Alliance conflict. She was further concerned that the two might try and kill one another while they were recovering from their injuries. However, both &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and Taran Zhu were able to appease her concerns by promising to inform the warriors of a \"no-kill rule\" and about how the Horde and Alliance had been helping the Pandaren.\nMeanwhile, due to his numerous visits to the monastery, Yalia found herself growing close to Chen. They would eventually end up traveling to Zouchin together, where with Chen's encouragement, Yalia revealed herself to her family, to their great joy. When word came that the Zandalari were going to attack the village, the pair helped evacuate the villagers, while Vol'jin, Khort, and Shado-pan agents fought off the Zandalari. Yalia escorted her family amongst a group of refugees to stay at the &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; before returning to the Shado-Pan Monastery.\nAfter a short period of time, Yalia was reunited with Chen, who had escaped the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; with his companions. It was then that she became part of &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirty-three\"&gt;The Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt; and fought to protect the monastery against the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;. While setting traps against the Zandalari, Yalia and Chen confessed their feelings for one another and kissed, admitting their desire to have cubs together. After successfully repelling the Zandalari offensive, Yalia and Chen parted ways, as Chen decided to help Vol'jin launch the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, but promised to return, and Yalia promised to wait for him while she aided the Shado-pan.\nThe Thunder King.\nYalia can be found among the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-Pan Assault&lt;/a&gt; force, which seeks to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;. She is there to assist the player and Taran Zhu in the final confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;, and witnesses Taran Zhu quelling the fighting between the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nTimeless Isle.\nYalia can be seen on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ling%20of%20the%20Six%20Pools\"&gt;Ling of the Six Pools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sam%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Sam the Wise&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAs some of the best &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s that the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; had to offer, Yalia and &lt;a href=\"Zabra%20Hexx\"&gt;Zabra Hexx&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; on the front lines against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; sent the Conclave's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt; to find the two of them so they could prepare an extract that would grant him a vision of the future. While in Azsuna, Yalia and Zabra were attacked by the local &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, and dropped the supplies they were delivering to the Illidari while they fled. The two were also separated in the conflict. After the High Priest saved Zabra from &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s and helped to rescue Yalia from the murlocs that had imprisoned her, Yalia and Zabra looked for ingredients for Velen's elixir while the High Priest delivered their supplies to the Illidari. Afterward, Yalia expressed admiration of the High Priest's willingness to help, and told them that they did not need to go into battle with the Burning Legion alone, offering to become their follower.\nZabra and Yalia's elixir would later help Velen to see visions of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; joining the Conclave, and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; attacking Netherlight Temple.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWe will not rest until our duties here are done."}

For ages the genesaur have battled their eternal foes - the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, children of stone - to a stalemate across the world of Draenor. But in these emanations, Yalnu sensed a new world, where his kind could flourish and spread unchecked.\"\nOverview.\nYalnu's presence causes an array of living plants to spring up from the earth to attack players. Kirin Tor mages assist the party in defense of Azeroth, using powerful magic to keep both Yalnu and his creations in check, but players must protect them to keep them in the fight.\nAbilities.\nThe Kirin Tor.\nLady Baihu and her Kirin Tor Battle-Mages combat Yalnu in an attempt to stop his invasion.\nStrategy.\nThis is probably the single most intense 5-man boss in WoD, and excellent training for dealing with raid mechanics. It is an add-heavy fight with a lot of stuff happening at once.\nThere are several NPC mages that will be damaging the boss - the party's DPS should primarily concern themselves killing the other bad stuff that appears. Adds include single large trees that should be focused, and groups of small plants that should be AOEd. In addition to the adds, the boss will summon vines to entrap and damage the mages. Kill these as well.\nThe tank should try to face him away from the mages (toward the portal.) This is tricky, because he will also need to grab adds as they appear. The boss has a stomp attack telegraphed by a very long animation that will deal heavy damage and stun in a line in front of him. The tank should simply strafe left or right to avoid this.\nPeriodically, the boss will spread flowers and start channeling. \"Everyone\" (including the tank, since the boss is frozen in place) must run around and stomp on the flowers, or they will grow into an uncontrollable number of adds.\nHealers should be prepared to blow cooldowns - no matter how skillful the tank is, the party will be taking damage. In theory, the NPCs should be healed, too. In practice, if they're being heavily damaged, the fight is already headed to a wipe."}

After years of living in the &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, they have been pushed out of their homeland by the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, and are aggressively trying to make a new home for themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nSometime between 12,200-12,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the burly race known as the yaungol roamed central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, living in peace with nature under the tutelage of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, however, the yaungol grew weary of having to share their hunting grounds with the nearby &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and, against Cenarius' wishes, journeyed south in search of new territory. They soon reached the borders of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; emperor at the time, &lt;a href=\"Qiang%20the%20Merciless\"&gt;Qiang the Merciless&lt;/a&gt;, enslaved the yaungol and ordered his &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaping\"&gt;flesh-shapers&lt;/a&gt; to enhance the bovine race's strength, savagery, and intelligence. For generations, the yaungol suffered under the mogu, until they joined the other slave races in a &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20revolution\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that succeeded in toppling the empire.\nThough they had regained their freedom, much of the yaungol's culture had been lost due to strict mogu laws forbidding them from preserving their oral storytelling traditions. Some of the yaungol clung to incomplete myths of the benevolent Cenarius, while others wished to abandon their past and forge a new destiny by force. The disagreements grew heated, and many yaungol left for the north with the intention of returning to a life of harmony with nature. The more nomadic tribes traveled across the entire continent, settling in the frozen lands near the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, where proximity to &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; machinery gradually transformed them into the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;. Another group returned to the central areas of Kalimdor, where they reunited with Cenarius. Those who studied with Cenarius learned the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic magic of the natural world, while others mastered the art of wielding &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic powers. The energies of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; warped these central yaungol into a new subspecies, known as the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. The last group remained in the areas around the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, but due to repeated conflicts with the other liberated slave races, these yaungol decided to settle in the lands west of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; wall. There, the constant threat of the ruthless &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; combined with widespread infighting caused their culture to grow more warlike and savage than that of their northern cousins.\nThe taunka, tauren, and yaungol retained some contact with one another for many years, but the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; finally shattered the connections between the tribes.\nRecent history.\nRecent &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; attacks have led many yaungol warlords to the realization that the best hope for their people was to breach the wall and seek new homes in the safer environs of the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, outnumbered and already straining to fight off mantid assaults and a &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; uprising, were unable to stop the incursion. The yaungol horde has arrived in Kun-Lai, bringing war with them. Some yaungol fell under the influence of the sha, making them even more violent and brutal than normal.\nEventually, the pandaren fended off the yaungol invasions. However, according to &lt;a href=\"Min\"&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt;, the yaungol are survivors: despite their setbacks, they will learn from the event and their culture will endure.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nOnly the strongest, most courageous, most resilient of yaungol may lead the tribes. These traits are of the highest qualities in yaungol society and are expected of all yaungol leaders. However, with the constant threat from the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; to their south, the yaungol cannot afford to lose a single warrior in an internal struggle for power. A surprisingly civilized solution to this problem has been put into place. When a dispute arises between them, they fight one another with blunted weapons until one yields or passes out. Similarly, new leaders are chosen in ritual combat. A yaungol who appears to take the place of chief must place his family banner and fight any who would challenge his authority.\nYaungol fire-keepers ritualistically set themselves ablaze to emulate the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Ordos\"&gt;Ordos&lt;/a&gt; and cast enchantments and prayers to ease his pain. Ordos was once a shaman of the yaungol who sacrificed himself to the flame, following the promises of the &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Fire Lords&lt;/a&gt;, in order to become a &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;.\nYaungol &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;bury their dead&lt;/a&gt; in sacred burial grounds. &lt;a href=\"Deadtalkers\"&gt;Deadtalkers&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for maintaining them until they betrayed their responsibilities by defiling the corpses of their former clanmates and raising them with dark magic.\nWarfare.\nDwelling in the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and forced to survive in the harsh terrain since the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the hardy yaungol were forced to adapt, weaponizing local supplies of oil and developing their own aggressive culture. Burning oil is the cornerstone of yaungol warfare. In the days of their greatest warriors, this weapon was more deadly than &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. This burning substance would scar foes, scorch lands, burn what the cover provided by trees, and could rout even a terrifying mantid assault. It is also an old tactic of the yaungol to light more campfires each night than people they have. In this way, enemy spying in the darkness would assume larger numbers of yaungol existed, while their true positions and numbers remained masked.\nThe race is constantly on the move, establishing short-lived \"Fire Camps\" in areas of abundant natural resources (specifically &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;, which is collected through mobile &lt;a href=\"Oil%20platform\"&gt;derricks&lt;/a&gt;, and game) before moving on. Where to set up camp, how long to stay, and when to move out remains the sole discretion of the Chieftain.\nIn combat, the yaungol prefer to hit hard and fast, making heavy use of cavalry to flank and harass the enemy while hard-hitting infantry assaults the weakest parts of the enemy line. Fire sorcery and flaming siege weapons back this initial assault. Yaungol are known to retreat as quickly as they charge, always reading the enemy and only fully committing their forces to sure victories.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that the tauren were created by a bovine &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;, and since the yaungol are the ancestors of the tauren it would stand to reason that the Wild God in question actually created the yaungol. It may have been &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt;."}

She was &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s spider, it was her duty to ensure schemes and plots that would harm the kingdom were heard before they hatched. She sided with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and his master, the Blood God &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, in a plot to overthrow Rastakhan and free the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;. She consumed the might of Shadra, transforming her into an arachnidian being, and was tasked with holding the sacred temple of &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt; for Zul.\nBackground.\nHigh Priestess of the spider loa &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, Yazma comes from a long line of priestesses who served the King as the keeper of secrets and spies. Through Yazma's diligence, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; was warned of and survived at least fifteen assassination attempts. It was her spy network that also led to the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; once again practicing &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;s and worshiping the fallen loa: &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Zul's command, she traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and enlisted the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; in spreading the word of Zul. In light of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sandfury%20tribe\"&gt;Sandfury tribe&lt;/a&gt;s shacking down merchants in the Port of Zandalar, Yazma called for the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20of%20Akil%27zon\"&gt;Disciple of Akil'zon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20of%20Nalorakk\"&gt;Disciple of Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20of%20Jan%27alai\"&gt;Disciple of Jan'alai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Disciple%20of%20Halazzi\"&gt;Disciple of Halazzi&lt;/a&gt; and the collection of &lt;a href=\"Tongue%20of%20Gahz%27ragon\"&gt;tongue of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gahz%27ragon\"&gt;Gahz'ragon&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Zolani\"&gt;Zolani&lt;/a&gt;'s orders for the Speaker to report the situation at the docks to Rastakhan, Yazma acknowledged that while they had a problem she didn't feel that they needed to bother the king with it. Instead Yazma declared that she would inform Zul, who would then decide if these issues were worthy enough of Rastakhan's attention. After Rastakhan ordered &lt;a href=\"Loti\"&gt;Loti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raal\"&gt;Raal&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the dark heresies being practiced in the &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt;, Yazma directed the Speaker to aid them.\nWhen Zul began his coup against King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, Yazma sided with Zul and killed &lt;a href=\"Habutu\"&gt;Habutu&lt;/a&gt; before he could inform Rastakhan of their treachery. Seeking to siphon the power of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, Yazma and Vol'kaal pulled their forces to the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20the%20Loa\"&gt;Garden of the Loa&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'kaal engaged the Speaker of the Horde in battle, as Yazma siphoned &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt; of her power. While Yazma would be successful in claiming the loa's power as her own, Vol'kaal would be killed. As Yazma regrouped with Zul at &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, King Rastakhan led Zandalari loyalists and the loa &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt; against them. During the conflict, Yazma and Zul were confronted by Rezan in Atal'Dazar and Yazma bore witness to the death and resurrection of Rezan, in Zul's service.\nAt some point, Yazma used her newfound powers to reanimate Vol'kaal's corpse with the intention of him serving her for all eternity. In time, adventurers invaded Atal'Dazar in order to put an end to Yazma. As the conflict unfolded Yazma thanked them for killing &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Alun%27za\"&gt;Priestess Alun'za&lt;/a&gt; as it would strengthen her hold on the temple, declared them worthy sacrifices upon seeing them slay Rezan, and vowed to revive Vol'kaal when he was slain. Despite using the powers of Shadra, Yazma would ultimately be slain.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nMy spies tell me you can't win your war against de Alliance without our fleet.\nSo... dat means every little dirty task I have to do today I will assign to you and you will do it.

He is bald and originally had yellow-green skin but the hot sun has turned it into forest-emerald hue. He has a robotic parrot named &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBefore the Storm.\nGrizzek was previously married to &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta \"Saffy\" Flivvers&lt;/a&gt; when he was young. They were lab partners that were stupid enough to fall in love with each other. After the first month, their relationship began to fall apart because everything one of them did seemed to irritate the other. After Saffy divorced Grizzek, she joined the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;. Although Saffy claimed that the robotic parrot &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt; was hers, they in fact made it together as a first (and last) anniversary gift to each other and Grizzek had cherished it ever since.\nGrizzek was originally a part of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; living on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. Once the isle exploded, he and the cartel moved to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. He didn't like the land, the idea of reshaping it into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; emblem, the idea of joining the Horde, or the Horde races, or the high position &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; obtained by becoming a leader of a Horde faction. One day, he just decided to leave Azshara. He took his belongings, except his inventions that were left with Jastor, and moved to a deserted beach in Tanaris where he constructed a small domicile and laboratory. Over the next years, he built a defense system using various robots and warning devices. He enjoyed his freedom and daily routines until Jastor Gallywix paid him a visit after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrizzek agreed to invent &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; products for Gallywix but stipulated he be allowed the freedom to dictate how he worked, what he made, how it was used, and also the assistance of his former lab partner Sapphronetta. Gallywix reluctantly agreed to Grizzek's demands but to ensure Grizzek's compliance, he also stationed his &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt; to supervise him while he worked.\nSaffy was kidnapped and taken to Grizzek's lab, although Grizzek reproached her kidnappers for treating her roughly. Although Saffy was disdainful to Grizzek, Grizzek was happy to see her. Saffy was against anything to do with him until Grizzek put a piece of Azerite into her palm and its effects opened her mind to the possibilities the two could do with it.\nAs the weeks went by, Saffy and Grizzek worked on making new Azerite inventions for Gallywix, such as armor and building material. As the two worked together, they began to rekindle their relationship. Eventually, they were notified that they were now ordered to create only weapons.\nThe couple was devastated by this news as they did not want to create things that caused harm unto others. They created a plan where they would set up a bomb in their lab and secretly escape through a tunnel that opened up in a random part of Tanaris. They also programmed Feathers to fly to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; with a warning of what had happened and a plea for rescue, with the duo intending to offer their discoveries to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on the stipulation that they would only create things that could help, not harm. Prior to leaving, Grizzek proposed once more to Sapphronetta, offering her an Azerite ring, and she accepted. While traveling through the tunnel, they talked openly about their feelings for each other. When the duo exited the tunnel, however, they were captured and tied up back-to-back by Druz, &lt;a href=\"Kezzig%20Klackwhistle\"&gt;Kezzig&lt;/a&gt;, and their goons, who had also taken their notes. Druz informed them that they knew of their plan ahead of time and had taken all their inventions, as well as disarmed Grizzek's bomb in the lab and shot Feathers out of the sky. Kezzig then placed a bomb between the gnome and goblin and left with Druz and the goons.\nThe newly engaged couple were able to get the bomb to fall to the ground between them, but when they attempted to flee, their short, tied up legs could only get them so far. As they continued to waddle their way to safety, Grizzek lamented that Gallywix would exploit their work to hurt others after all. Saffy, however, confessed that he wouldn't since she had already destroyed their notes, leaving Gallywix unable to recreate their experiments and with access to only a few prototypes and mixed potions. At that moment, Grizzek slipped on a stone and broke his ankle, forcing him and Saffy to crawl. However, the gnome then realized that she was still wearing the Azerite ring, which would possibly be enough to protect them from the explosion. As Grizzek was in the process of saying \"I love you\" to Sapphronetta, the bomb went off.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe two survived the explosion and made their way to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. During a Horde &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;incursion&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; they could be found in hiding at &lt;a href=\"Greystone%20Keep\"&gt;Greystone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and provided the &lt;a href=\"%3AGrizzek%27s%20Rocket%20Hop\"&gt;:Grizzek's Rocket Hop&lt;/a&gt; to aid an Alliance adventurer in fighting the Horde off.\nAn &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; would later travel to Tanaris to investigate what happened to Sapphronetta and Grizzek. After repairing &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt; and following him, the adventurer found Saffy and Grizzek just north of &lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Valley\"&gt;Thistleshrub Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that if the adventurer found them that meant others could, Saffy and Grizzek promised to give the hero Feathers in exchange for telling everyone that they had died. With that, the pair drove off on Grizzek's bike. While Gallywix was convinced, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; saw through the adventurer's lie and was happy that Grizzek still lived.\nLater, the adventurer enlists Sapphronetta's aid in the mission to Mechagon. She agrees, so long as Grizzek - who is living with her in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; - is allowed to come as well. Later, if Sapphronetta is spoken to in &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of goblin technology, she flashes the Azerite engagement ring that Grizzek gave her in Tanaris. Grizzek covers himself from head to toe to hide his goblin identity from the gnomes on their expedition team, though once they and the goblin team led by Gazlowe are welcomed to &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt;, he was apparently comfortable enough to not wear the disguise."}

He and his brethren had fought the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nRise of the Horde.\nGrizzik was once a guard of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, the high arakkoa capital in the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, knowing the arakkoa were a threat due to their recovered &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; technology, sent &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; to take care of them. Kargath's orc soldiers allied with the cursed and flightless &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the weaponry and kill the high arakkoa. However, not all high arakkoa were killed. Some were taken prisoner and cast into the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, where their wings shriveled and their bodies contorted due to the dying curse of the wicked god &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;. Grizzik was among the survivors and took his fellow now wingless arakkoa to hide in &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, for the Horde feared the haunted ruins. There, he nursed a bitter hatred of the Horde and awaited the day when he might exact vengeance. Dark forces had claimed Auchindoun years ago, and the arakkoa spent their time studying them, worshiping them, and eventually falling under their sway.\nThe Second War.\nGrizzik allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; against the Horde for what they did to his race. After the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; arrived on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Grizzik noticed them and followed the expedition in secret. On the night &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;'s foundation was built, Grizzik was caught spying on them. When he was tied up by the high elves, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talthressar\"&gt;Talthressar&lt;/a&gt; questioned him and he claimed he was not there to attack. Danath was surprised that he could speak their language and Grizzik told them that he learns fast. After releasing him because Danath didn't believe he was of any harm, Grizzik agreed to lead the Alliance troops to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, where the orcs took refuge, and introduced them to the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; priest &lt;a href=\"Nemuraan\"&gt;Nemuraan&lt;/a&gt;. While he looked frightened by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; he was dangerous in battle. Grizzik showed his true abilities when he fought the orcs alongside the Alliance races. He slit the throat of an orc and blinded a second one with its beak. \nAfter discovering where &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; had gone to, Grizzik was more than willing to lead them to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; because he and his brethren fought when Karabor fell. When Danath's forces were camped at the start of Shadowmoon Valley, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; took Grizzik on &lt;a href=\"Sky%27ree\"&gt;Sky'ree&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; where he led them to Danath. \nIt's unknown if he survived the destruction of Draenor."}

Killing furbolgs from one side can make you temporarily neutral with the other for five minutes (unless you kill more of the opposition, in which case you may remain so as long as you're nearby).\nHistory.\nAndrassil.\n4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took branches from the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and planted them over &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; that had begun to appear across the world. The largest tree grew over a particularly large saronite deposit in the Grizzly Hills; Fandral and his druids named it &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Without the blessings of the &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; however, it was vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' corruption and after finding out the roots of the tree had reached the prison of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient druids were forced to destroy the tree, which they renamed &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Vordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stump that was left behind was eventually taken over by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, who built the settlement that became Grizzlemaw. The tree's roots which had pierced the prison of an Old God, which led to the eventual corruption of the furbolgs.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the corruptive darkness in the depths of the tree spread to the furbolgs in Grizzlemaw itself, and it is here that the Alliance and the Horde began their investigation into what went wrong. &lt;a href=\"Hierophant%20Thayreen\"&gt;Hierophant Thayreen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windseer%20Grayhorn\"&gt;Windseer Grayhorn&lt;/a&gt; sent Alliance and Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, respectively, to collect samples of the oozes growing in the three segments of the tree, as well as determining the source of the darkness within them. It was then discovered that the furbolg tribes had managed to resurrect the great &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, killed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ten thousand years earlier; however, Ursoc's children, &lt;a href=\"Orsonn\"&gt;Orsonn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kodian\"&gt;Kodian&lt;/a&gt;, recognized that their father had been corrupted in the same manner as the furbolgs who restored him, as their blood was tainted with the same darkness found in the oozes around Vordrassil's shattered remnants.\nThe trail thus led into Grizzlemaw itself, where the furbolg were using seeds left over from Vordrassil's destruction to regrow the tree within the great stump. The adventurers were tasked with burning the sapling growing within its depths and collecting the ashes, as well as collecting Vordrassil's seeds to prevent the furbolgs from regrowing it again. Once the ashes were purified, they journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Ursoc%27s%20Den\"&gt;Ursoc's Den&lt;/a&gt; to confront the corrupted Ancient. After defeating him and sprinkling Vordrassil's ashes on his corpse, the freed spirit of Ursoc appeared and revealed the influence of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, warning that his influence stretched &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;beyond Vordrassil's roots&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; adventurer seeking to receive the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; called Ursoc's brother, &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;, to Grizzlemaw to face a gauntlet and prove themselves.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; homeland and they outnumber every other race here combined. They have a city here, Grizzlemaw, but it holds less than half their number. The rest are gathered in clans and scattered throughout the region. By some accounts, Grizzlemaw is the center of furbolg civilization and the seat of their culture. The city is ruled by &lt;a href=\"Baergar%20Blackpaw\"&gt;Baergar Blackpaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe furbolgs of Grizzlemaw have fought the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; for many years, and they can tell you some interesting things of their culture. &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Rurson\"&gt;Rurson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Gorroc\"&gt;Gorroc&lt;/a&gt; are two furbolgs living in this city who know a bit of Drakkari history.\nDescription.\nIt is a big, rough-hewn place, with a tall wooden palisade surrounding massive stone and wood houses. Guard towers mark the four corners, and smaller ones flank the double doors in front. Furbolgs are simple and uncomplicated, and so is their home. Furs cover the floors and furniture, which is large and comfortable, and woven tapestries lend some color to the walls. Weapons and other trophies are mounted above doors and windows, which have thin sheets of skin to keep out the cold. Large fire pits stand at the center of every house, and some large rooms have their own smaller pits down the middle.\nHistory.\nFurbolgs are nomadic, following caribou and other prey through established territories; so they don't have many fixed structures, just central lodges in the centers of their hunting grounds. Grizzlemaw is the exception. A few stories claim the city was built on the site of the &lt;a href=\"Frostpaw%20tribe\"&gt;Frost Paw tribe&lt;/a&gt;'s lodge and made large enough to accommodate several tribes at once. The Frost Paw then invited other friendly tribes to shelter the winter with them. The resulting ties changed the furbolgs from scattered hunters to a stronger, more unified race, and the Grizzly Hills from ancestral hunting grounds to a loosely defined nation.\nSome stories say that the Drakkari built &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; before the furbolgs built Grizzlemaw. Supposedly, the Frost Paws gathered the tribes together in part to fend off the new Drakkari threat. Both races were in the Grizzly Hills and hated each other \u2014 the furbolgs had the numbers but with their new keep the Drakkari were more organized, and the trolls were always more unified than the furbolgs. The existence of Grizzlemaw affected the balance, and the furbolgs' victory over the Drakkari in a series of skirmishes may have led to the keep's eventual loss of Drak'Tharon to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is the homeland of the Grizzlemaw &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. Many furbolgs live in this &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, most in the large settlement of &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt;. Both the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; settlement of &lt;a href=\"Thor%20Modan\"&gt;Thor Modan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Ice troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fortress\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;, now occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in the north. The hills are home to an independent population of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s simply called the \"&lt;a href=\"trappers\"&gt;trappers&lt;/a&gt;\", whose signature trading posts can be found throughout the region. The main faction bases are &lt;a href=\"Amberpine%20Lodge\"&gt;Amberpine Lodge&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.\"&gt;Venture Co.&lt;/a&gt; is also found here, deforesting the land as part of a large-scale operation throughout the region. Many of the local trappers have become part of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt;, an army of &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; led by the resurrected &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmoon Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Some furbolgs have also been affected by the corruption of an &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;, being driven to insanity.\nMagical nuts called &lt;a href=\"amberseed\"&gt;amberseed&lt;/a&gt;s can be harvested here.\nHistory.\nCountless millennia ago, the Grizzly Hills were home to twin bear cubs named &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;. They had more curiosity than good sense, and they frequently found themselves trespassing in the domains of bigger predators. Danger did not discourage them, and each one never left the other behind, even when circumstances seemed dire. In time, the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; made them into &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Gods\"&gt;Wild Gods&lt;/a&gt;, animal deities with powers of nature, for their dedication to each other.\n4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took branches from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, and planted them over &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; that had begun to appear across the world. The largest tree grew over a particularly large saronite deposit in the Grizzly Hills; Fandral and his druids named it Andrassil, or \"Crown of the Snow\". &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; became furious upon learning that these branches had been planted without their approval. They did, however, agree that the plan seemed to have worked. For several decades, Andrassil towered over Northrend, and all seemed well. Yet in time, circumstances changed. Bloody battles erupted between the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"forest%20nymph\"&gt;forest nymph&lt;/a&gt;s of Northrend, two races not known for their warring ways. The fighting was sudden and shockingly vicious, filled with barbarism and unspeakably vile acts. Word slowly reached the druids, and the Cenarion Circle launched an expedition to investigate the source of the violence.\nWhat the druids found chilled them to their marrow. Andrassil's roots had reached so deep into the earth that they had touched &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s subterranean prison. The Old God had infused the tree with its foul energies, and thus all living creatures in the area were slowly being driven to madness. The Cenarion Circle knew that, without the blessing of the Aspects, Andrassil was vulnerable to corruption. They were also aware that there was no way to spare the World Tree or ease its suffering, so they decided that the only recourse was to destroy Andrassil. Afterwards, it was renamed Vordrassil, or \"Broken Crown.\"\nAlthough killing Andrassil had been a heartbreaking task, the Cenarion Circle was pleased it had stopped the growth of saronite. Yet unbeknownst to the druids, something dark had taken root in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Yogg-Saron had used the trees planted by Fandral as a doorway into the Dream - a doorway through which the other Old Gods could grasp the ethereal domain and well. Small seeds of corruption were spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s realm. In time, these seeds polluted the dreamways. This marked the beginning of what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe stump that was left behind was eventually taken over by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribes, who built the settlement that became &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt;. For generations, the tribal furbolgs have worshiped a colossal prehistoric bear that roams the surrounding wilderness. A human population has lived in the woods here separate from the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, making their living as trappers.\nGeography.\nThe Grizzly Hills are located in the eastern reaches of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. To the north is the ice troll region of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. South lies the peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; and west is the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region has low, green foothills laced with pine trees, craggy mountains, and picturesque rivers.\nNotable characters.\nThe Grizzly Hills is home to several characters of note. At the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade%20Encampment\"&gt;Westfall Brigade Encampment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding enemies. The Horde is led by &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%20Krenna\"&gt;Conqueror Krenna&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tormak%20the%20Scarred\"&gt;Tormak the Scarred&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the local &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; tribe, at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Oneqwah\"&gt;Camp Oneqwah&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable characters include the captive ice troll &lt;a href=\"Drakuru\"&gt;Drakuru&lt;/a&gt;, the famous adventurer &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt;, the hunter of worgen &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt; and her mysterious archenemy &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;Shade of Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, and the furbolg &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, horribly twisted by his &lt;a href=\"tainted\"&gt;tainted&lt;/a&gt; rebirth.\nPvP.\nThere are a number of &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s in the Grizzly Hills that focus on &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat and a general conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Horde to control &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Bay\"&gt;Venture Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackriver%20Logging%20Camp\"&gt;Blackriver Logging Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sky%20Logging%20Grounds\"&gt;Blue Sky Logging Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Daily quests include tasks to recover parts and assist &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as killing opposition NPCs and &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s. Players from both &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s can speak to NPCs at Blue Sky Logging Grounds to ride a log downstream to the bay where additional quests can be found.\nVenture Bay can be captured by either faction, which spawns defenders and permits access to the bay's &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuests.\nThere are several &lt;a href=\"quest%20chain\"&gt;quest chain&lt;/a&gt;s in the Grizzly Hills. The Alliance starts out at &lt;a href=\"Amberpine%20Lodge\"&gt;Amberpine Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and are first tasked with taking care of the wildlife and restocking supplies. Players are then ordered to strike up an alliance with the local hunters and trappers based out of &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook\"&gt;Silverbrook&lt;/a&gt;, who have a dark secret. Having figured out the situation, players are then sent to figure out what went wrong with &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Vordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the failed &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, and other problems at &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade%20Encampment\"&gt;Westfall Brigade Encampment&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth sides find their way to &lt;a href=\"Granite%20Springs\"&gt;Granite Springs&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-infested trolls in the area in quest chains that send players to &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; and to the far eastern side of the Grizzly Hills at &lt;a href=\"Drakil%27jin%20Ruins\"&gt;Drakil'jin Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Squatter%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Squatter's Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nWild creatures.\nRare elite NPCs associated with the achievement:\nOther notable creatures:\nIn the RPG.\nGrizzly Hills can remind you of other forests during wintertime, except that winter here is year-round. The trees are tall and thick, the pine needles and crisp, clean air produce a pleasant scent, the snow leaves the ground clean and fresh, and the hills themselves are high enough for decent elevation but low enough and gradual enough to be easily climbed. It's one of the nicest regions in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Thor%20Modan\"&gt;Thor Modan&lt;/a&gt; aren't the only residents. &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s dominate the region, and they make fine neighbors when they're not attacking. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; has a presence here as well, but not strong enough to do much more than block the northwest corner. Wild animals roam the hills, providing plenty of meat and fur and entertainment. It's not an easy land by any stretch, but it's handsome and fierce and full of life.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; grew in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; to the south, its residents forced the Drakkari and the furbolgs back into the Grizzly Hills and beyond, making the region safe enough for farmers to till the land.\nHistory.\nThe furbolgs claim they were the first people in these hills. So do the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;, though they're concentrated to the north in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. But actually, they're both wrong. Dwarves were here first. At least that's what &lt;a href=\"Hardigan%20Ironjaw\"&gt;Hardigan Ironjaw&lt;/a&gt;, of the Thor Modan expedition, tells. He says the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s placed dwarves here, after they'd created them. It was an experiment to see if they could survive on their own. They not only survived but flourished, spreading southward and into what would later become &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the other continents.\nHardigan thinks he can find evidence of their ancestors here in the hills, and uncover truths about their race's early culture. The &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; thought it likely enough to send him here, at any rate. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes dwarves did start in the north, since the Titans were there, but he's not sure they ever settled up there. Regardless, all this was well before any surviving history. Furbolgs don't keep careful records beyond births, deaths, marriages, blood feuds and hunting tallies. The Drakkari wouldn't have cared about dwarves even if they'd seen them, unless it was how they tasted on a spit. So no one really knows what went on here back then.\nOther stories say that the Drakkari built &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; before the furbolgs built &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly, the &lt;a href=\"Frostpaw%20tribe\"&gt;Frost Paws&lt;/a&gt; gathered the tribes together in part to fend off the new Drakkari threat. Both races were here and hated each other \u2014 the furbolgs had the numbers but with their new keep, the Drakkari were more organized, and the trolls were always more unified than the furbolgs. The existence of Grizzlemaw affected the balance, and the furbolgs' victory over the Drakkari in a series of skirmishes may have led to the keep's eventual loss of Drak'Tharon to the Scourge. You definitely want to stay alert in the Grizzly Hills. Furbolgs don't attack unless you trespass on their lands, or threaten their kin, or steal their prey, or look like you could pose a threat later. Drakkari attack on sight, and so do Scourge forces. The dwarves just want to know what you've seen.\nA dwarven prospector finally uncovered what the Thor Modan expedition was seeking \u2014 an ancient relic clearly made by dwarves. The relic is an enormous and heavy statue of iron. The problem is, he found the statue in a cave between Grizzlemaw and Drak'Tharon Keep. The heroes will have to find and retrieve the relic without getting caught by the Scourge or the furbolgs, all the while avoiding the wild beasts in the area.\nPeople and culture.\nThis region is the furbolg homeland, and they outnumber every other race here combined. If you've never seen these massive bear-men, that's exactly what they are: enormous creatures with a bear's build and fur and basic features, but a man's hands and, to a limited extent, mind. That's a dangerous combination, and they're powerful in a fight. Fortunately, they're not aggressive beyond their own territory. The dwarves at Thor Modan have run-ins with furbolgs on a regular basis, since furbolgs feel dwarf kinsmen are trespassers and grave-robbers. Furbolgs are surprisingly friendly to travelers, though, and can greet you warmly once you assure them you lay no claim to anything in the hills. Although rumors say they're less approving of large groups, and particularly wary of strange races, but no one can't blame them for their caution.\nThe furbolgs have a city here, Grizzlemaw, but it holds less than half their number. The rest are gathered in clans and scattered throughout the region. Each clan has its own totem, and when you see one you know you've entered &lt;a href=\"Snowspring%20clan\"&gt;Snowspring&lt;/a&gt; territory or &lt;a href=\"Winterpaw%20clan\"&gt;Winterpaw&lt;/a&gt; land or &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Flurry%20clan\"&gt;Snow Flurry&lt;/a&gt; hunting grounds or any of the others. It's best to declare yourself openly once you see the totem, since a furbolg may be watching and won't appreciate your trying to sneak past.\nThe dwarves in Thor Modan were thrilled to see Brann Bronzebeard, and were eager for news of their home. It seems they don't get that many travelers up there, particularly other dwarves. They're not there for socializing, though, and remain focused on their excavations. They have not yet discovered anything of note, but they're still hopeful.\nThe Scourge forces at Drak'Tharon Keep are typical: nasty, violent and focused. They hold the passes between &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of the Grizzly Hills, so that more Scourge forces can reach the east or return to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Grizzly Hills are as hilly as the name suggests. Along the northern edges the land gains height and depth, approaching the level of small mountain ranges, while it flattens out a little in the south. Thick forest covers the land from end to end, broken only by small clearings or the space alongside one of the many streams and small rivers. Snow is everywhere but the region has little ice \u2014 the wind whistles overhead but the trees block it from entering down below, and the hills seem almost warm after the Dragonblight and the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. It's still dangerous, with treacherous slopes and hidden caves and partially frozen rivers, but better than most of the other regions.\nAll manner of wild animals live here because the hills are full of life. &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;s and some small &lt;a href=\"deer\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; are the most common, though there are others as well. &lt;a href=\"Mice\"&gt;Mice&lt;/a&gt; and other rodents hide from the snowy &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;s and other raptors in the trees, but mercifully &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s aren't present here, as they wouldn't be happy with the temperature. &lt;a href=\"Wendigo\"&gt;Wendigo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sasquatch\"&gt;sasquatch&lt;/a&gt; prowl the hills, so it's best not to go out alone. The Drakkari live just north in Zul'Drak and sometimes their hunters drift down to the hills as well, in search of prey.\nThe Grizzly Hills have three major settlements, each controlled by a different race. It's strange that all three can coexist here, and even stranger that they're all along the north edge. The southern hills have other furbolg tribes and the random trapper or traveler, but nothing larger than a small village.\nThe Grizzly Hills surround Zul'Drak on both sides and reach all the way up to &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, making it possible to travel between the northern and southern regions of Northrend without crossing the dangerous Drakkari territory.\nVideos.\nA log ride is available for players of both factions at the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Sky%20Logging%20Grounds\"&gt;Blue Sky Logging Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Works in the same manner as a flight point.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The recipient of this foul injection would usually flee to his allies, bringing them down with him.\n25-man abilities.\nGrobbulus has approximately 9,596,000 hit points.\n10-man abilities.\nGrobbulus has approximately 2,928,000 hit points.\n25-man strategy.\nGrobbulus is not a terribly difficult encounter if you are able to kill Patchwerk. You will want two tanks.\nGrobbulus should be picked up and taken to a wall. He should NEVER be facing the raid or the resulting fallout slimes will spell a wipe. The main tank should slowly kite Grobbulus around the edge of the room, moving as Grobbulus places poison clouds. The offtank should pick up fallout slimes that spawn from the main tank being hit and DPS should take them down quickly. Do not dispel/cleanse the Mutating Injection; affected players should get away from the raid to near an existing poison cloud and will need healing after 10 seconds. Space should be conserved by keeping poison clouds near each other. You have nine minutes.\n10-man strategy.\nYour main tank should start the encounter by pulling Grobbulus to one of the outside walls of the room. The tank should move Grobbulus around the outside edge of the room each time Grobbulus drops a poison clouds (you will likely complete at least one full circuit of the room during the fight). Raid members hit by Grobbulus' Mutating Injection should move next to the last cloud he dropped so the new cloud they create will merge with Grobbulus' cloud. This conserves space within the room for the ranged and healers. However, with this positioning strategy the tank must move Grobbulus a fair distance every time a cloud is dropped or else the melee will be clipped by the mutating injection going off, though Grobbulus should not be moved so far that ranged DPS are out of range of Grobbulus while waiting for an Injection to go off.\nRanged and healers should stand on the inside of the room, moving toward the outside temporarily when they are hit with the Mutating Injection. Melee may want to try to hit Grobbulus from the side (it will look as though they are attacking his boot) so they do not run through his poison clouds when the tank moves him. However, melee should absolutely not stand in front of Grobbulus at any point for risk of spawning an additional fallout slime.\nDesignate an off-tank to pick up the fallout slimes as they spawn. At least a couple ranged DPS should switch to them when they spawn so the off-tank doesn't get overwhelmed. Like the rest of the raid (with the exception of the main tank), the off-tank will occasionally be hit by Mutating Injections, and in these cases it may be helpful to have a Hunter misdirect slimes onto him.\nTowards the end of the fight, Grobbulus will be using his Injection very frequently. Burst effects on long cooldowns (particularly Bloodlust) should be saved until late to help finish Grobbulus off. This part of the fight depends almost entirely on your ranged DPS, as melee will have great difficulty dealing any significant damage to Grobbulus due to the frequency with which they are injected.\n10- &amp; 25-man alternate easy strategy.\nRanged and healers stand in the middle of the room and move only to reposition themselves closer to the MT and Melee DPS as they go around the room.\nAn OT needs to pickup Fallout Slimes as they spawn. These should only spawn from the MT - they are from Grobbulus' spray. Melee DPS needs to be sure they are on his side; if they get hit with his spray, more slimes will spawn.\nTo begin the pull, have the tank stand on the grating by the ramp. The boss will body pull from here. Everyone else needs to stand back from the ramp.\nThe tank will then begin to kite the boss counter-clockwise keeping him on the grating. The best pace is for the tank to toggle their walk/run key to make them move at a walk speed. Once on the other side of the grate from the ramp pulling position, go just a bit further out to be even with ramp, then turn in and head straight for the ramp. Once to the ramp get back onto the grate and continue as before.\nWhen someone gets injected they will run behind the tank, where no clouds from Grobbulous are, and to the wall. This ensures that everyone knows where to go, that there is not a buildup of clouds, and that the group is not closed in on by clouds.\nBy the time you get to the ramp again after kiting the boss around the grate and across the top of the room to the ramp, the first clouds emitted by Grobbulus will have dissipated allowing you to continue kiting him on the grate.\nThe difference with this strategy is placement. \nThe strategies above are successful if you have enough DPS. Those above have you against the wall with a string of clouds emitted by Grobbulus along the wall and a second string of clouds next to the ones along the wall placed by players that get injected. That is a total of 2 wide for clouds. As the fight continues, the back wall, where you begin the pull above, becomes clear, but you have a string of player placed clouds strung across the mid room so you are not able to get to the back wall to place player clouds. The result is they build up coming closer and closer to the group eventually giving players nowhere to run to place their clouds if DPS is not downing Grobbulus fast enough.\nSolo strategy.\nAfter Patchwerk, Grobbulus will not put out enough damage to be remotely threatening. Stand there and nuke him. The poison cloud does a trivial amount of damage to level-85 or -90 players, but even so, consider backpedaling to get out of the expanding area of effect.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The MT hugs the outside wall all the way around the room. Grobbulus should be moved as slowly as possible for the best use of space, as his cloud will limit the room's safe zone.\nDPS on Grobbulus is ranged, so as to avoid spawning multiple fallout slimes. Only one slime should be spawned at a time(the MT's) which will presumably aggro onto a healer, and should otherwise be pulled to melee classes. They dispatch this slime, away from the ranged/healers, then return to adding ranged dps.\nInjected people should run to the edge of existing clouds, as far away from the the raid as possible to best use the space.

However, when he found the crown, Mug'thol tried it on instead of returning it, allowing him to break free of Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; possession. In response, Sylvanas decided to make an example of the ogre. Her lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Melisara\"&gt;Melisara&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Mug'thol's &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; minions and then behead the ogre himself, crown and all.

Fashioned entirely from rare, polished gemstones, the crown of will was created centuries ago by a &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer who was worried about the possibility of losing his mind to a magical mishap. The crown's purpose is to fortify its wearer's mind, shielding it from any form of controlling spell or enchantment. Any ongoing, mind-affecting effects afflicting the wearer are immediately ended when the crown is donned. The crown is now in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "733858", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=733858", "title": "Crown of Wills", "text": "The Crown of Wills is an immensely powerful crown created by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; from\u2014and as a replacement for\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to its precursor, it embodies the power of free will and can make the wielder resistant to &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic. After being used to allow for the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, it is now worn by &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn order to defeat the Jailer, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, before he used the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; to remake reality, the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies needed to find a way of resisting his Domination magic. To that end, they freed the Dominated &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; from the Jailer's control, but Anduin did not know how to counteract the magic. The Primus, the original creator of Domination, noted that the &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be resistant (though not immune) to the magic and that experimenting with the shattered &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; could allow the heroes to discover the source of their resistance. The &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Eru\"&gt;Elder Eru&lt;/a&gt; explained to a Maw Walker that the automa's resistance stemmed from the fact that they speak the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;complex and ever-changing language&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, especially complex phrases of which were stored in vaults in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Primus knew this would not be enough on its own.\n&lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, his daughter &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker headed to the Endless Sands, fought their way through the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; in the area, and infused the three &lt;a href=\"Inscrutable%20Phrase\"&gt;Inscrutable Phrase&lt;/a&gt;s into the intact half of the helm. Next, the heroes' allies went to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; for the other piece of the puzzle: assembling those who had suffered from Domination in the past and survived thanks to their indomitable will, and infusing their memories of that resistance into the broken &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Domination\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt;s of the helm's other half. One by one, they went through the memory ritual: Bolvar, the former &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;; Darion, a &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knight of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who'd been Dominated by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;; and finally Anduin, who'd been the Jailer's own vessel.\nWith the broken half augmented with the language of the First Ones and the shards carrying the heroes' memories and will, the Maw Walker and their allies met up with the Primus in the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; so he could reforge the helm and allow the heroes to draw upon the combined power for themselves. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; asked what was to stop this new helm from being used to enslave others like its predecessor, to which the Primus replied that it was to become \"something greater\": an instrument of free will. Combining the First One phrases and memories, the Primus transformed the Helm of Domination into a new object, the Crown of Wills, which the Maw Walker then used to make themselves and their allies resistant to Domination. Bolvar reflected that the Crown's power was something new, unlike anything he'd sensed before, and that it would be the key to Zovaal's defeat. The Primus stored the Crown away in an orb for safekeeping until it would be needed.\nAs planned, the resistance they'd been given by the Crown allowed the Maw Walkers to defeat Zovaal within the Sepulcher of the First Ones. The Crown subsequently ended up with Bolvar, who delivered it to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to give it to the newly risen &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, in time for Pelagos' judgment of Sylvanas Windrunner."}

The Crown is composed of three gems - Kil'jaeden's &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; (fuchsia), Archimonde's &lt;a href=\"%3ASigil%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;:Sigil of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; (purple), and Velen's &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Prophecy%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Eye of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; (light pink).\nBackground.\nThe Crown was unmade long ago, and on their own the individual pieces provide little power. Archimonde kept his Sigil of Awakening at the &lt;a href=\"Conservatory%20of%20the%20Arcane\"&gt;Conservatory of the Arcane&lt;/a&gt;, caring little for the power it provided on its own and using it as a reward for several trials he developed. After Archimonde and Kil'jaeden joined &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and Velen fled Argus with the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;exiles&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden had the Crest of Knowledge locked away in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; as it was powerless alone. Velen kept the Eye of Prophecy with him for millennia, keeping it close as part of &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Life-Staff\"&gt;his staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; sought to reform the Crown of the Triumvirate in order to penetrate the fortified walls of &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;. The Sigil of Awakening was obtained by completing the ancient trials of the &lt;a href=\"Augari\"&gt;Augari&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving the Crest of Knowledge from &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;, Velen removed the Eye of Prophecy from his &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Life-Staff\"&gt;Exodar Life-Staff&lt;/a&gt; and rejoined it with the others, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" changed from purple to holy gold. The Crown reformed, it granted &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Judgment%20%28item%29\"&gt;Light's Judgment&lt;/a&gt; the power to blast a way into Antorus, allowing the Army of the Light to begin its assault."}

Surrounding this sacred place are gateways to the infinite realms of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. When each soul is judged by the Arbiter, a gateway is opened to that soul's appropriate afterlife. It is the traditional gathering place for the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; that rule the Shadowlands.\nInitially, players do not have normal access to this area and only visit it during specific quests. After completion of &lt;a href=\"Penance%20and%20Renewal\"&gt;Penance and Renewal&lt;/a&gt; at the tail end of the &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis%20campaign\"&gt;Zereth Mortis campaign&lt;/a&gt;, they unlock permanent access to the Crucible and can teleport to it whenever they like by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Enclave\"&gt;Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. They can teleport back down to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fates\"&gt;Ring of Fates&lt;/a&gt; by talking to Tal-Inara in the Crucible or by using the exit portal at the western edge of the main platform.\nAppearances.\nThe first time players visit the Crucible is at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20campaign\"&gt;Shadowlands campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Audience%20with%20the%20Arbiter\"&gt;Audience with the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, in which Tal-Inara brings them to the area to see the dormant &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. It is seen again in &lt;a href=\"The%20Looming%20Dark\"&gt;The Looming Dark&lt;/a&gt;, but only in a cutscene as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; convene to discuss the growing &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Players visit it again for another meeting with the Eternal Ones to discuss &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"A%20Gathering%20of%20Covenants\"&gt;A Gathering of Covenants&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final phase of the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt; raid takes place in the Crucible. After players and their allies fight Sylvanas at the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Pinnacle of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer creates chains connecting the Sanctum to Oribos. The group pursues him across the &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20the%20Abyss\"&gt;Edge of the Abyss&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; is able to teleport them to the Crucible, where the Jailer tries to break through the Arbiter's defenses. While Jaina, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; fight the &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;dominated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; on the central platform, the players battle Sylvanas on four of the surrounding covenant pillars, which expand in size to give the combatants more room. The Crucible also engages an Invigorating Field, a \"defensive configuration\" that allows players to jump from pillar to pillar by running up to the edges, which becomes a necessity as Sylvanas gradually desecrates each one and makes it impossible to stay on them. The encounter ends with the Jailer absorbing the Arbiter's &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; and escaping with Anduin, with the unconscious Sylvanas (and &lt;a href=\"Domination-etched%20Treasure%20Cache\"&gt;her loot&lt;/a&gt;) being left behind with the players and their allies.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Call of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis%20campaign\"&gt;Zereth Mortis campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; summons players to the Crucible to witness the creation of a portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The area is subsequently attacked by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"A%20Hasty%20Voyage\"&gt;A Hasty Voyage&lt;/a&gt; before players manage to fly through the portal.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; becomes the new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, he moves to the Crucible. &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt; and the players briefly visit him during &lt;a href=\"Souls%20Entwined\"&gt;Souls Entwined&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"A%20Long%20Walk\"&gt;A Long Walk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fate%20of%20Sylvanas\"&gt;The Fate of Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis%20campaign\"&gt;Zereth Mortis campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas is brought before the Arbiter to be judged by him, and a number of covenant members and Azerothians are allowed to enter it to witness the event.\nAfter Sylvanas' departure to the Maw in &lt;a href=\"Penance%20and%20Renewal\"&gt;Penance and Renewal&lt;/a&gt;, Pelagos invites players to visit him whenever they like, unlocking permanent access to the Crucible via talking to Tal-Inara in the Enclave."}
