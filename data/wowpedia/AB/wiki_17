Can it possibly remain their home? Has &lt;a href=\"%23Spell%20Immunity%20%28Passive%29\"&gt;Spell Immunity&lt;/a&gt;. Attacks land units.\nInformation.\nThe Spell Breaker is a fairly uncommon unit among human players, mainly because of their niche use in a battle. Spell Breakers are short-ranged units dealing fairly negligible damage, but they have a hefty health pool and starting armor. Against mana using units, they are frightening enemies in battle.\nSpell Breakers naturally come with Feedback, much like the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Arcane Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Each successful hit by a Spell Breaker drains 20 mana against normal units or 4 against Heroes, and the combusted mana also damages the enemy for the same amount from non-spell immune units. Spell Breakers are good against Heroes because they can quickly drain the mana of a fairly low Intelligence hero, such as a &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt; quickly. \nSpell Breakers also come with Spell Steal, allowing them to steal positive buffs from enemies and remove negative buffs from allied units and place them onto a friendly/enemy unit respectively. This allows them to steal various effects such as Frost Armor, Bloodlust and Unholy Frenzy. Control Magic is seldom used due to a lack of summoned units, and high level summons have too much health to be stolen from. \nAlong with this, Spell Breakers also have natural magic immunity, protecting them from any unit with magic damage and spells. They can still be healed from by a friendly &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s Holy Light though.\nSpells and abilities.\nSpell Steal (Autocast).\nSome spells such as Anti-magic Shell, Unholy Frenzy, and Cyclone, are only affected if Spell Steal is cast on them manually. Spell Steal only affects unit-cast spells, and doesn't work on Hero spells. "}

To see your chance to critically strike with spells, open your character pane and view your spell stats. Mobs are unable to get critical strikes with spells. Since healing potions count as a spell, they can also sometimes critically heal for double the usual amount.\nSpell critical strike chance is gained from both &lt;a href=\"critical%20strike%20rating\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt;, as well as various talents and abilities.\nSpell crit damage.\nThe size of spell crits depends on the character's class and spec, as well as the spell cast:\nWith &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"area%20of%20effect\"&gt;area of effect&lt;/a&gt; spells, spell critical strike chance applies independently to each &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt; and each target.\nCertain &lt;a href=\"metagem\"&gt;metagem&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Shadowspirit%20Diamond\"&gt;Chaotic Shadowspirit Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, increase spell critical strike damage beyond 200%.\nBase spell crit chance.\nThe base chance to critically strike with spells is based on the &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt; attribute and a class specific constant.\nIncreasing spell crit chance.\nSpell critical strikes have a generally low chance of occurring, however, you can increase your crit chance in certain ways:\nCritical strike rating.\nThe easiest method to increase the chance of a critical strike is to equip gear with the attribute \"Increases your critical strike rating by 'x'.\" For some classes, critical strike rating is of less value. Unlike Intellect, critical strike rating increases the chance to get a critical strike equally for all classes.\nFormula.\nFor a level 85 character:\n crit chance % = (intellect / 648.91) + class constant + (crit rating / 179.28)\nNote: \nUsing spell crit effectively.\nWhen evaluating the tradeoff between critical strike rating and other secondary stats, there are some things to consider:\nSpell hit or spell crit?\nWithout considering factors such as talents, a 1% increase in spell crit chance will result in a gain of 0.5% or 1% of a spell's base damage (depending on class/spec, see above), whereas a 1% increase in spell hit chance will always give a 1% increase of a spell's base damage. When dealing with 150% crits, this may make reaching the &lt;a href=\"hit%20cap\"&gt;hit cap&lt;/a&gt; for your chosen area of play more valuable than increasing crit chance. \nNumerous talents proc from crits (&lt;a href=\"Ignite\"&gt;Ignite&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Aegis\"&gt;Divine Aegis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Elements\"&gt;Master of Elements&lt;/a&gt;), while many more proc from certain spell hits regardless of crits. These talents can significantly increase the desirability of increasing your crit chance. It should also be remembered that hit affects other types of spell such as &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;ccs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt;), which can often be even more critical than damage.\nIn general, increasing crit chance without reaching your hit cap will lead to more unpredictable effectiveness, in terms of damage, talent procs and even ccs. This can be handy for PvP, where sudden burst damage can surprise and overwhelm opponents, but can also cause crucial spells to miss at critical moments.\nThere is still debate whether spell casting is based on a one-roll system (like \"normal\" melee) or not, although there is currently overwhelming evidence that it is a \"two-roll\" system - &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit\"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; rolled for first, followed by a roll for crit."}

Spells that \"fail\" to hit are shown as a \"miss\", and have no effect on their target. \nWith the removal of hit and expertise from gear, players automatically have a 100% chance to hit creatures up to and including 3 levels above the attacking character. However, if players attempt to attack targets 4 or more levels above their character level, their spells may still miss, as shown in the table to the right.\nFor example, if a level 90 character attacks a level 93 target, the spell will hit. However, if the same level 90 character attacks a level 94 target, spells have an 11% chance to miss.\nPrevious calculations.\nChance to hit with a spell depends on the level difference between the caster and the target, as well as whether the target is a player or not. For example, a spell cast by a level 80 player (with no gear or spell hit-modifying effects) will have an 85% chance to hit a level 83 monster, and a 94% chance to hit a level 82 player. Players many levels below their target will always have at least a 1% chance of landing a spell.\nStats increasing spell hit chance (&lt;a href=\"hit%20rating\"&gt;hit rating&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"expertise%20rating\"&gt;expertise rating&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;) are commonly found on high-level gear, &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"enchant\"&gt;enchant&lt;/a&gt;s, and can be gained temporarily from &lt;a href=\"Well%20Fed\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt; buffs. Additionally, the following racial abilities can increase the player's spell hit chance by 1%:\nWith a high enough total of hit rating, expertise rating and spirit (where applicable as mentioned above), a player's chance to hit with spells can reach 100%. Players receive no additional benefit from having more than 100% chance to hit a target.\nFor the purposes of spell hit chance, &lt;a href=\"expertise%20rating\"&gt;expertise rating&lt;/a&gt; is equivalent to &lt;a href=\"hit%20rating\"&gt;hit rating&lt;/a&gt;, and for &lt;a href=\"balance\"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt; druids, &lt;a href=\"mistweaver\"&gt;mistweaver&lt;/a&gt; monks, &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; shaman, and &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; priests, so is &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;. A total of 340 of those three attributes, in any combination, will increase spell hit chance by 1% at level 90. \nPvE spell hit cap.\nIn end-game PvE content, monsters and bosses are at most 3 levels above the player, so having more than 15% spell hit is unnecessary; in &lt;a href=\"heroic\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; dungeons, monsters and bosses are at most 2 levels above the player, so having more than 12% spell hit is unnecessary. If you're affected by one of the &lt;a href=\"%23racial_bonuses\"&gt;racial abilities&lt;/a&gt; described above, you can reduce these requirements by 1% to find out how much spell hit chance you need from the hit rating, expertise rating, and Spirit stats to ensure that your spells never miss.\nSpell hit rating increases spell hit linearly. For example, at level 90, you need 340 hit rating to increase spell hit by 1%, and 680 hit rating to increase spell hit by 2%. For the amount of hit/expertise rating or Spirit required to increase spell hit chance by 1% at lower levels, consult the table below:\nYou can only again an integral amount of spell hit from gear, so if you'd like to ensure that your spells never miss, round the required amount of hit rating up to the nearest integer. For example, to get 15% spell hit chance required at to avoid missing &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; raid bosses at level 70, you'd need codice_1 hit rating, so having 394 ensures that your spells won't miss, while having 393 hit rating makes codice_2 of your spells miss."}

The Horde of Draenor needed these artifacts because they matched with &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt;s from their world known as the Staff, the Tome, and the Seer. Ner'zhul awaited a special celestial event involving all three constellations alongside Draenor's &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; to cast his spell. The event actually did give Ner'zhul the power to open portals to other worlds.\nDuring the process of the spell's conjuration, huge dimensional rifts crackling with the cosmic energies of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; appeared over the skies of Draenor. The energies emitted from these newly formed rifts tore apart the fabric of reality in Draenor and caused massive tidal waves, earthquakes, and volcanoes to erupt.\nThe effects of this spell were so powerful that it ultimately led to the catastrophic destruction of the orcish homeworld, the shattered remnants of which came to be known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "92581", "revid": "49848256", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=92581", "title": "Spell penetration", "text": "Spell penetration reduces the target's resistance to your spells; it is a different mechanic from &lt;a href=\"spell%20hit%20rating\"&gt;spell hit rating&lt;/a&gt;. Spell penetration only works against targets with &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistances&lt;/a&gt;, and will not reduce resistances below zero. \nSpell penetration typically is a PvP stat, intended to help casters against players who wear resistance gear or are buffed with extra resistance, such as &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Mark of the Wild&lt;/a&gt;. In PvE, targets of a higher level than the caster have a base resistance (2% of mitigation per level difference) which cannot be overcome by spell penetration nor by any other stat. Otherwise, very few mobs and raid-level bosses have a substantial amount of resistance to overcome.\nFormulas.\nThe formula for spell penetration is quite simple. Each point of spell penetration negates one point of a target's &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Spell penetration cannot reduce a target's resistance below zero. The following equation gives effect of spell penetration on resistance, where P is the caster's spell penetration, and Rb is the target's base resistance. Here, the min() function means the minimum of two values - in this case, it shows that spell penetration greater than a target's base resistance has no effect.\n R = Rb - min(P, Rb)\nFor example, a level 70 player with 30 spell penetration casts a fire spell at another level 70 player buffed with 40 fire resistance. The spell resist check will be done as if the target only had 10 fire resistance. A level 70 player with 100 spell penetration casting at the same target will have his fire spell's resist check done as if the target had zero fire resistance (not -60).\nFor additional resistance due to level difference, spell penetration has no effect. In this equation, Lt is the target's level and Lc is the caster's level. For more details on this equation, see the &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; article.\n R = Rb + max((Lt - Lc) * 5, 0) - min(P, Rb)\nFor example, A level 70 player casts a fire spell at a level 73 raid boss with no innate resistance. The level difference is 3, so the raid boss has effectively 15 resistance to all schools against the level 70 caster. No matter how much spell penetration the caster has, his spell's resist check will always be done as if the target had 15 resistance.\nIncrease.\nThe following increase spell penetration:\nUse.\nEspecially in PvP, it is difficult to find a well-balanced amount of spell penetration. Against targets with no resistance, it has no effect (and as such is wasted). However, against targets with resistances, spell penetration is a powerful and, in terms of &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item values&lt;/a&gt;, cheap stat. Ideally, a caster should have exactly as much spell penetration as necessary to lower the target's resistance to zero.\nIn PvP, good spell penetration values are 85, to counter the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Resistance%20%28racial%29\"&gt;Shadow Resistance (racial)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s, 97, to counter general buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Mark of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Blessing of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and 195, to counter full resistance buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt;. Since resistance largely does not stack, 195 spell penetration should be enough to entirely counter any opponent's resistances.\nIn PvE, where only few mobs have resistances, especially with &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Elements\"&gt;Curse of Elements&lt;/a&gt; active, spell penetration's value is situational at best. The Hungarfen in Heroic Underbog, for example, have some Nature Resistance that Spell Penetration is useful against, and the Greater Lava Spiders in Searing Gorge have some Fire Resistance. It has been estimated that &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt; has approximately 200 Frost Resistance and that &lt;a href=\"Supremus\"&gt;Supremus&lt;/a&gt; has approximately 200 Fire Resistance. Since neither of these fights have a challenging time requirement, stacking enough spell penetration to compliment the curses certainly isn't mandatory but will noticeably improve individual performance.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s actually need no spell penetration since the Holy school of magic has no resistance at all, in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise. For &lt;a href=\"Discipline\"&gt;Discipline&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, spell penetration is not nearly as useful as it is for other casters, but since some critical PvP spells belong to the Shadow school (e.g. , &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt;) it isn't completely useless."}

Healing spells were only increased by the healing attribute. As of patch 3.0.2, spell power now affects both types of spells. Nevertheless, there are items which would increase your bonus healing independently of damage spells.

Only a lone squad remained in existence, as they refrained from training any new recruits following Kael'thas' betrayal. Eventually, Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; ordered a revitalization of spellbreaker training, leading to a resurgence of spellbreakers among the blood elves' ranks.\nSpellbreakers were fielded during the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.

It is not known what, if any, relation there is between the nightborne and blood elf variants.\nIn the RPG.\nSpellbreaker blades.\nThe deadly, two-bladed swords of the spellbreakers strike fear in the hearts of wizards and sorcerers. The blood elves' elite warriors employ these frighteningly effective weapons to execute outlawed spellcasters, necromancers and other evil practitioners of magic. This blood-elven two-bladed sword is the bane of any evil spellcaster. The blades can cast \"globe of invulnerability\" when spun, and can make casters forget spells.\nSpellbreaker feat.\nThe powers of the spellbreaker are terrifying to those with knowledge of magic, for their blows shatter the mana from a spellcaster's body. Their abilities focus on destroying spells.\nFurther inclusion.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Monster%20Guide\"&gt;Monster Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" makes reference to spellbreakers as a class blood elves become, along with already existing classes in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;.

This specialzation is geared towards fire/arcane mages.\nBecoming a Spellfire Tailor.\nTo specialize in Spellfire tailoring, a character must complete &lt;a href=\"Becoming%20a%20Spellfire%20Tailor\"&gt;Becoming a Spellfire Tailor&lt;/a&gt;, given by in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain this quest you need to have 350 proficency in Tailoring, and be ready to travel to &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo complete the quest, travel to &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; and defeat the level 70 Nether-Wraith elemental that spawns when you use the quest item. You can summon the elemental anywhere in the map, but it is advisable to summon in Area 52 as the guards will attack the elemental. The elemental channels Arcane Missiles and it will cast a powerful Shadowbolt at low health. Although not elite, killing it solo is difficult for characters not yet 70, or those unprepared to fight it. Before engaging equip any arcane-resistance gear, if available. Mages should have up the Mana Shield, and save the Counterspell for the dangerous Shadowbolt, towards 20%-30% of the mob's hp.\nThe elemental will drop the quest item and you can then travel back to Shattrath City to complete the quest.\nYou don't need any mats to complete the quest, and it won't start the cooldown on Spellcloth crafting. Immediately after completing the quest you may travel back to Netherstorm to craft your first two pieces of Spellcloth.\nChanging Specialization.\nSince patch 2.1.0, you may now re-specialize. It will cost to unlearn the current specialization.\nCrafting Spellcloth.\nCrafting Spellcloth is not exclusive to Spellfire Tailors, but the specialization will always produce 2 pieces of Spellcloth with the materials for a single one.\nThe materials are:\nA character must be somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; area to craft Spellcloth. The Nether-Wraith will spawn immediately after you end the crafting cast; you don't need to defeat it to keep the cloth, but since it always drops 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Mote%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Motes of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and 1-3 &lt;a href=\"Mote%20of%20Mana\"&gt;Motes of Mana&lt;/a&gt;, it is advisable to be prepared to defeat it.\nThe cooldown on the crafting is 92 hours (3 days, 20 hours), but it's not shared with the cooldowns on the other types of specialized cloth, namely &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Mooncloth\"&gt;Primal Mooncloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowcloth\"&gt;Shadowcloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.8\"&gt;Patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt; there is no longer a cooldown. \nPatch Change.\nIn patch 2.1.1, crafting Spellcloth would erroneously spawn two Angered Nether Wraiths instead of one. This was corrected in patch 2.1.2\nExclusive Patterns.\nSpellfire Tailoring gives exclusive access to the following patterns:\nThese patterns require the specialization to be obtained, and the items are Bind on Pickup, meaning only Spellfire Tailors could ever have the crafted items.\nMaterial cost to construct set.\nTo make the complete set you'll need:\nThe Spellfire Set is arguably the best Fire/Arcane &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;/Destruction &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; equipment attainable before the 25-man raid instances (though it has been known to take players through to Tier 6 content, albeit with drawbacks to loot attainable before then; it is not recommended to try this). It nicely complements with either, the Spellstrike Infusion (+), or the Battlecast Garb (+), because they use different equipment slots."}

Unlike man or woman, the word sha\u2022man is not derived from the base word \"man\", so the plural form of \"man\" cannot be used. The word \"shaman\" is actually an incorporated foreign word to the English language (like the French word bureau), and not a word (or derived from a word) from the Middle or Old English like \"man\". Like any incorporated word, it has to follow the same standard English rule for plural forms on nouns (e.g. paper/papers, prima donna/prima donnas) unless it already has a plural form from its original language (like the Latin syllabus/syllabi).\nFurther, the female form is not shamaness, but rather shamanka.\nFor more information about the word, please check:\nThe official Blizzard line on \"shaman\" vs \"shamans\", despite the English forms of the word, is that \"Both Shaman and Shamans are deemed acceptible \"(sic)\" as the plural though we use Shaman.\" Blizzard is not always consistent in their usage of it \u2014 their use of \"shamans\" as a plural can be found in various locations.\nEtymology.\nThe etymology of the word \"shaman\" is closely related to the Evenki language (from the Tungusic family language); this language is widely used (and officially recognized) around the areas that we currently know as Mongolia, China, and Siberia (possibly in some nomad tribes). It is unrelated to the Persian word 'Shemen' (meaning idol, idol temple). Evidence is wanting for the plausible suggestion that the Mongolian word is an adoption of Chinese \"sha m\u00ean\", an ordained member of a Buddhist fraternity.\nPronounced either: Sha-man or Shah-man\nSh- (as in she)\n-a- (as in take) OR -ah- (as in father)\n-m- (as in ham)\n-a- (as in about)\n-n (as in no)\nFor a brief introduction to the language, please check:\nShammys/Shammies.\n\"Shammy\" is a derogatory, affectionate, or substitute term of the word shaman (obviously not abbreviated, as it has the same amount of letters). The genesis of the alternate form of the word predates WoW by many years and has been utilized throughout many games. However, with WoW, the term quickly became derogatory or taunting (depending on who was using it: shamans or non-shamans) due to issues with class balance at the game's inception. For many WoW players, the emotions behind the slang form have trailed off as class balances have been worked on. Others have used the alternate form simply for a more playful cast to the class title or to show affection for their character or the class in general.\nTrivia.\nThe correct typing of \"shaman\" in Spanish is \"cham\u00e1n\", pronnounced chaMAN (\"cha\" as in \"choke\"). Some Spanish players that use English servers mistake saying \"chaman\" instead of \"shaman\" because they think that the correct word in English is just \"cham\u00e1n\", but without the Spanish character of \"a\". No official female form of \"cham\u00e1n\" exists."}

There is at least anecdotal evidence to suggest that the internal cooldown was raised to 50 seconds in &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1\"&gt;patch 2.1&lt;/a&gt;\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Major%20Healing%20%28weapon%20enchant%29\"&gt;Major Healing (weapon enchant)&lt;/a&gt;, Spellsurge is generally considered to be the best weapon enchant for classes in a healing role, particularly in a raid environment.\nThis enchant is, in the extreme case, an average of 13.56 mana/5s for the caster's group. This assumes chain casting instant spells as soon as the hidden cooldown is over (13 m/5 if chain casting 1.5s cast time spells, since it triggers 1.5s later). In practice, you can expect to get less than that, possibly much less depending on your casting rhythm. Also, for shorter fights the proc timing will be much more variable."}

The Forsaken tend to them in the fields of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to latch their eggs onto a suitable carrier - usually some variation of &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, until the little spiders are of age to be collected from their host. The spiders are used as sentries, pets and companions among the Forsaken empire. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20ranger\"&gt;Dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen alongside domesticated spiders around the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nModels.\nThere are eight models for spiders in World of Warcraft:\nWithin those different models, several skins are used to show different species, which include, but not limited to the list of species below.\nKnown species.\nIn Warcraft III.\nSpiders in Warcraft III were a type of hostile creep, who could be found in a number of different &lt;a href=\"tileset\"&gt;tileset&lt;/a&gt;s. \nNamed uncategorized.\nFor named spiders of specific types, see the &lt;a href=\"Spider%23Known%20species\"&gt;individual articles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\nWild battle pets.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"moth\"&gt;moth&lt;/a&gt;s, spiders are one of the more common types of wild battle pets found around the world."}

He enlisted with the &lt;a href=\"marine\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; at the age of sixteen. Reethe had distinguished service and was promoted to lieutenant, but currently is listed as missing in official records. In fact he deserted the Theramore Guard and joined deserters at &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Point\"&gt;Lost Point&lt;/a&gt;. There he insisted on raiding the supplies of the ogres up at &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt;, though deserters were not so many in number to stand up to the ogres. Reethe crossed the line one too many times, so eventually they threw him out of camp.\nReethe went into hiding in the woods and started stealing supplies from Brackenwall Village and the &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Rest%20Inn\"&gt;Shady Rest Inn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Krog\"&gt;Krog&lt;/a&gt; in Brackenwall Village sent ogre &lt;a href=\"Ogron%20%28ogre%29\"&gt;Ogron&lt;/a&gt; out to track the thief down.\nPaval Reethe was also implicated in the burning of the &lt;a href=\"Shady%20Rest%20Inn\"&gt;Shady Rest Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which left its owner homeless and insane after he watched his wife and child die in the inferno. Paval's badge was discovered along with a black shield and a set of hoofprints among the charred ruins of the inn. The burning of the inn prompted &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to launch an investigation into the incident, as the hoofprints implicated the Horde and thus implied that Thrall's order to leave the humans of Theramore Isle alone was violated. When Paval's involvement in the burning of the inn was discovered, Ogron was also ordered to extract any information regarding it that Paval may have had.\nWith the help of an unknown &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, Ogron tracked Paval Reethe down, demanding that he return the supplies he stole as well as release the information he had regarding the burning of the Shady Rest Inn. Unfortunately, at that time, Lieutenant Reethe was also discovered by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Caldwell\"&gt;Lieutenant Caldwell&lt;/a&gt; and his men, who were looking for him determined to punish him for his desertion. In the skirmish that ensued, &lt;a href=\"Private%20Hallan\"&gt;Private Hallan&lt;/a&gt; killed Paval before the latter could reveal the name of the culprit responsible for the destruction of the Shady Rest Inn. Although Caldwell acted suspiciously hasty in ordering Paval Reethe killed (and thus possibly implying that Paval knew something that Caldwell wanted to remain secret forever), he, along with Private Hallan and the rest of his men, were slain in the skirmish before they could reveal any useful information."}

Though he is still thought to reside in Southern California, there are whispers that he looks northward, to the grey and misty climes of Seattle, for a career in the culinary field. His passion for literature and language remains unabated, but, professionally, the kitchen's cramped, sweltering heat and wafting aromas call to him. No fried Moonkin will appear on his menu.\nLegend has it that Pavonum, for some time after leaving his official capacity on the Customer Service Forum, posted sporadically on his play account as Umbrae of Trollbane.

They also cut down his apple tree orchard, upon which Paw'don depended heavily for its harvest, food and livelihood. However, some Alliance adventurers managed to save some of the village's trees and children, earning Khang's gratitude and causing him to ally Paw'don with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nWayward Landing.\nEarly in the beta of ', this town was a forested area called Wayward Landing where players would have to complete quests related to the Alliance establishing a foothold in the area.

Inside the hive network should be a crystal of some sort. We think the silithid use the crystal as some sort of hive-wide attunement device. As for where this crystal might be, I'd say try the hatcheries inside the hive.\nUsing the lure on the crystal should roust out the queen, but be warned - she will probably be protected by several guards. Take out the queen and remove her brain. As icky as that sounds, we desperately need to study it. Good luck, &lt;name&gt;!\nProgress.\nAcquiring the queen's brain for our research is absolutely imperative. From what we have learned, we believe that these silithid are quite possibly being controlled by a malign intelligence. I shudder to think what could control something as insidious as the silithid, &lt;name&gt;.\nCompletion.\nFantastic, &lt;name&gt;! We've won quite the victory here today. It will take some time for us to fully understand what we have here; we'll put it to good use though, don't you worry about that.\nAs for the silithid, I genuinely doubt that this was the full extent of their presence. This is much too clean of a resolution, I'm sorry to say.\nNotes.\nThe Gorishi Hive Queen appears in a large chamber \nin the &lt;a href=\"Slithering%20Scar\"&gt;Gorishi Hive&lt;/a&gt; of\nsouthern &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. Turn to the right\nat each intersection to get to the chamber.\nThere are 3 waves:\nIt has been reported that the guards can be pulled separately from the queen.\nA tactic that has been reported successful is to pull the guards into the\ntunnel, to avoid the room mobs that are likely to spawn with unfortunate rapidity.\nDo bring friends for this. While it has been reported that you can solo this,\nit is not easy, and failing means you have to go back to Gadgetzan to get the\nquest again."}

It served primarily as a training ground and place of refuge for &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, and was easily accessible to them through &lt;a href=\"Zen%20Pilgrimage\"&gt;Zen Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt;. In this way, it served a very similar function for monks as &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; did for &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and did for &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Currently, the location is still accessible to characters below level 100 for game-play purposes but gets destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nA reportedly true story tells of how the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Lao-Fe\"&gt;last emperor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; once climbed with a &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; servant to the Peak of Serenity and surveyed Pandaria. He told his servant that he wished to do something to make everyone in Pandaria smile, to which the pandaren replied \"You'll jump, then?\". The story does not tell what became of the servant, but it is said that the emperor thereafter announced that he considered that part of the mountain to be tainted, and no mogu would visit the place again.\nShortly after &lt;a href=\"Kang\"&gt;Kang&lt;/a&gt; began teaching his fellow pandaren slaves the ways of the monk, he and his followers relocated to Kun-Lai Summit and secretly built a monastery among the wind-lashed peaks to continue their training, and it was at the Peak of Serenity where the first monks trained in secret and planned the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Revolution\"&gt;overthrow of the mogu&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the monastery was destroyed by an army of demons led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Keletress\"&gt;Lady Keletress&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who has made her personal mission to wipe out the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, seeing their quest for balance and order as an affront to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The surviving monks moved to their new &lt;a href=\"Order%20Halls\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, several NPCs are still there. Some of them are stuck in the Legion structure, and &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; can make you travel back to before the Legion attack.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nWhile anyone is welcome to visit the monastery, it is only accessible through flying, or by a long and winding journey by ground mount. Portals to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; can be found within the main hall atop the Peak to facilitate outbound traffic.\nThe Peak itself features several areas, including a large training ground, a hot spring, a small pavilion with several vendors and profession trainers, and shrines to each of the four &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s. Each shrine hosts a group of monks studying the discipline or style of its respective Celestial, three of which (&lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Ox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Serpent&lt;/a&gt;) are the inspirations of a playable monk &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Brewmaster\"&gt;Brewmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windwalker\"&gt;Windwalker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mistweaver\"&gt;Mistweaver&lt;/a&gt;, respectively). Students of the &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Crane&lt;/a&gt; focus on academic learning over martial prowess, and as such can be found poring over ancient scrolls and texts rather than sparring.\nNotably, there are vendors at the Peak of Serenity that will allow monks to purchase class-specific consumables, armor and weapons, many of which have unique and distinct models. Monks may purchase tiger and serpent brews from &lt;a href=\"Master%20Chang\"&gt;Master Chang&lt;/a&gt;, class quest reward &lt;a href=\"belt\"&gt;belt&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Master%20Cannon\"&gt;Master Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, class quest reward &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; (as well as ) from &lt;a href=\"Master%20Hwang\"&gt;Master Hwang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Master%20Tan\"&gt;Master Tan&lt;/a&gt;.

At the time, there were no plans for an expansion featuring &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, so the book was planned to simply be a way to explore Pandaria, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, and the pandaren culture, as well as to serve as a kind of travel guide to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe character of &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li&lt;/a&gt; was created in brainstorming sessions between Neilson, &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;, who together came up with the idea of an optimistic young pandaren who would serve as the channel that the book's readers see the world through. These brainstorming sessions also saw the creation of the story's villains: &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rumblefitz\"&gt;Rumblefitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt;. Neilson, Didier, and Metzen knew they wanted to have unique villains for Li Li go to up against and specifically thought that it'd be interesting to include unusual characters like a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"goblin%20alchemist\"&gt;goblin alchemist&lt;/a&gt;, which originated in \"\" but are very rarely seen in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". (Zhahara is somewhat an exception since &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt;es are fairly commonplace in WoW, but according to Neilson, her character arose from being \"more a part of the plot\"). Another aspect of the brainstorming process was to pick out areas of the world where the team had the opportunity to add more history and lore, such as revealing the origins of &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe story of \"Pearl\" was largely written before the events of \"\". As development of the book progressed and the team found out that there would in fact be an expansion including Pandaria, they went back and made some changes to the script. Luckily, the majority of the story takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who was being developed for the game\u2014only being featured in the first and last parts of the book. According to Neilson, artist Sean Galloway and his team were also really great about making artwork changes, which became necessary at a few points as the game evolved."}

They were also skilled craftsmen, able to construct any type of building one could desire. They were unskilled in the ways of war, however, and would flee when engaged by the enemy, often ignoring a safer route for a faster one.\nSecond War.\nPeasants were trained from the hard-working and stout-hearted citizens that lived in the numerous &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.

Most of them have a unique model, more reminiscent of their equivalent in Warcraft III than of other humans in World of Warcraft, but this tend to not be true anymore as since the &lt;a href=\"Player%20character%20revamp\"&gt;Player character revamp&lt;/a&gt; new peasants are now using a normal human model. Most peasants still have the same soundset and quotes as in Warcraft III though, and that is usually true even for new peasants with a normal human model.\nPeasants can also be classified as &lt;a href=\"lumberjack\"&gt;lumberjack&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, workers or laborers.\nIn the RPG.\n\"The man standing before you is clearly a peasant, dressed in nothing more than dirty, torn shirt and ragged pants. He wears black boots and his head is bare, though he does have a threadbare cloak to ward off the night chill. He carries a mining pick over one shoulder and a burlap sack over the other.\"\nNo matter how loudly a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; might boast of his deeds, the truth is that no army could survive, much less win, without peasants. These lowly men, armed with little more than staves and clubs or picks and axes, and often completely unarmored, are the force that allows an army to function. Peasants have no desire to fight, and only attack when forced or when terrified. In battle they forget all discipline and simply charge, waving their picks and shouting incoherently."}

Always make sure that the Peasants have a safe pathway between the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Mine%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Gold Mine&lt;/a&gt;/forest and the Town Hall. Also, make sure that the &lt;a href=\"Road\"&gt;Road&lt;/a&gt;s to the Town Hall are wide enough for multiple Peasants to pass through, otherwise an incoming Peasant will bump into an outgoing Peasant and both of them will get stuck while also blocking the Road."}

There are several benefits and disadvantages for this style of construction. On the good side, peasants can 'speed' build - by ordering more peasants onto a building in progress, the building is constructed faster. However, this costs additional resources for speeding up its construction, and is only useful in building Town Halls at an expansion, as speed building anything else will be costly and unfeasible. The main drawback of this style of construction is that it can be halted by incapacitating or killing the peasant. \nPeasants are also capable of gathering much more wood with lumber upgrades from the &lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Lumber Mill&lt;/a&gt; - they start off with 10, like &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peon&lt;/a&gt;s, but can be upgraded twice to carry up to 30 wood each run; on par with &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s with one lumber research, and more than them with the second research, albeit much slower since they aren't combatants.\nPeasants have some of the best defensive buildings out of all the races, as the weak &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Scout Tower&lt;/a&gt; can be upgraded into one &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt;, all of which have powerful usage in the hands of an experienced player.\nIn addition to this, peasants can defend themselves by turning into &lt;a href=\"Militia%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Militia&lt;/a&gt; if the town hall bell is rung. Refer to the link for more information.\nSpells and abilities.\nBuild Structure.\nPeasants build from the outside - not inside or automatic like the other races.

She is the daughter of late God-King &lt;a href=\"Skovald\"&gt;Skovald&lt;/a&gt; and the sister of &lt;a href=\"Torvald\"&gt;Torvald&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20the%20Faldrottin\"&gt;Scrolls of the Faldrottin&lt;/a&gt; described a &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; prophecy about a new vrykul ruler, one who could unite the clans once more and turn the Tideskorn against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nChildhood.\nSigryn used to live in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, but her last moments there were spent escaping the clutches of assassins sent to murder her family. She would never forget the night they came. Her mother fell before her eyes, and they descended on her brother before she managed to escape. After that night, she was alone, and believed to be the last of her bloodline.\nLegion.\nSince the fall of &lt;a href=\"Skovald\"&gt;Skovald&lt;/a&gt;, the outcast vrykul town of &lt;a href=\"Jandvik\"&gt;Jandvik&lt;/a&gt; saw many new faces arrive. In their midst was a wandering shieldmaiden who had come through recently, and who set up camp outside of town, to the northeast. She stayed only long enough to purchase supplies and avoided all eye contact while she was here. She was in fact secretly the heir of the late God-King, Sigryn. Found by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, she was convinced to follow through this prophecy. While she did not believe in it, she felt compelled to undo the damage her father wrought on the Tideskorn. The two met in &lt;a href=\"Valdisdall\"&gt;Valdisdall&lt;/a&gt;, from where they would make their way to &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt; and request an audience with the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes that she could shed some light on this prophecy.\nThe journey was not an easy one however. Being the daughter of Skovald had won Sigryn many enemies. As she expected, the two were repeatedly attacked by assassins on their way to Skold-Ashil. Escaping her past was too much to hope for. Entering the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt; city, Sigryn recalled stories her mother told her as a girl about this place and its mighty shieldmaidens. It was as grand as she described it. Oddly, the armor these women wore also reminded her of her mother's. They arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Eyir\"&gt;Vault of Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Halla\"&gt;Priestess Halla&lt;/a&gt; recognized Sigryn's face and identified her as the child of prophecy, bringing her inside to Eyir. At last the blood of Skovald had returned to the Valkyra. Eyir explained. Long ago, she foresaw the Valkyra uniting the Tideskorn against a terrible foe. At its head would stand a descendant of God-King and Shieldmaiden. As a child of Skovald, Sigryn held a claim to his throne. Any who disputed her right to rule had to be made to bend the knee. Were she to fail, the Tideskorn would splinter, leaving nothing to stop the Legion from overtaking Stormheim. Sigryn, feeling the great burden being put on her shoulders, replied that she could not turn her back on the Tideskorn. She would become Eyir's instrument.\nEyir told her that her claim to the throne would be disputed by two rivals, &lt;a href=\"Runeseer%20Faljar\"&gt;Runeseer Faljar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Velbrand\"&gt;Jarl Velbrand&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Drekirjar\"&gt;Drekirjar&lt;/a&gt;. Eyir suggested she began in &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt; with the Runeseer. Indeed, he was a close ally of Skovald and a powerful mystic. With the Bonespeakers at his charge, he would prove a staunch opponent if he couldn't be made to yield. Sigryn and her companion thus rode to Haustvald and challenged Faljar for the rule of the Tideskorn. After losing the fight, the Bonespeakers yielded, their clan would not interfere with Sigryn's claim to the throne. Before leaving, Faljar told Sigryn that he sensed the same darkness that consumed Skovald dwelling in the girl's heart. How she had resisted it this far, he did not know.\nThe Runeseer's words troubled her. She wondered if the darkness he spoke of, Skovald's &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; curse, could have passed onto her somehow. Still, they travelled to &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt; where she proved her strength to &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Velbrand\"&gt;Jarl Velbrand&lt;/a&gt; by defeating him. The Drekirjar would back her claim to the throne, but there was another rival who would cause greater concern, one who lived in secret. The Jarl revealed to Sigryn that the God-King's son, her brother, still lived. His riders had spotted him among the outcasts of &lt;a href=\"Vrekt\"&gt;Vrekt&lt;/a&gt;. He would be the true heir to Skovald's throne, the vrykul would never follow Sigryn were he to contend her claim.\nSigryn was in shock. Her brother lived. The last time she saw him, the assassins were closing in on him. She couldn't imagine how he defeated them. Wasting no time, they travelled to Vrekt. There, they found &lt;a href=\"Torvald\"&gt;Torvald&lt;/a&gt;. He welcomed her coldly, telling her that it had been a long time since she left him for dead. Sigryn replied that she did not want to leave him, she just was not strong enough. Torvald then explained the way he had survived the assassins. He had embraced the \"gift\" their father had left them, the one Sigryn and their mother had so vehemently denied. He had succumbed to the fel, but Sigryn did not understand how. She did not remember their father feeding them the fel. The sickness it caused in her must have clouded her mind. Something in their blood made them resist its influence, but it remained within. All Sigryn needed to do was to give in, he said. But she would never be a tool for the Legion. Standing up, Torvald ignited his blade with felfire. Sigryn could not allow the Legion to corrupt the vrykul. The two clashed. Torvald's last words were few, but troubling. He suggested that she should ask her masters who had sent the assassins for them that night, so long ago. Fate was cruel with Sigryn, she had found her brother alive, only to see him fall by her own blade.\nWhat was done, was done. There were none left to challenge the throne of the Tideskorn. Her brother's words still haunted Sigryn, however. If Eyir knew who ordered her family killed, then she would hear it from her before accepting the crown. Eyir knew no good could come out of this, but Sigryn insisted. The &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; thus revealed that it was &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; himself who had ordered Skovald's family killed. He feared that the God-King's heirs would offer the Tideskorn into the hands of the Legion, and decreed that the lineage of Skovald be ended, in blood. Sigryn was shocked. Overwhelmed with anger, fel energies started to radiate from her. She declared that the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan watchers&lt;/a&gt; had no more honor than the Legion. Succumbing to her fel powers, wings sprouted from her back. As she left, she claimed that she would tear down the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; herself and show Odyn what true fear is.\nSigryn had taken the path of Skovald before her. Only, Eyir feared she was more powerful than her father ever was. But Sigryn's thirst for revenge would lead to her undoing, for though she was truly powerful, she would be no match for Odyn. She had to be stopped before she could confront Odyn, before it was too late. Eyir said that Odyn would close the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Gates of Valor&lt;/a&gt; as soon as he became aware of Sigryn's assault, and that the champion would have to find another way in. The val'kyr had no talent with portals, but the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was very adept. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; thus worked on a way to get the hero into the Halls of Valor and pursue Sigryn.\nAs the hero arrived, corpses of &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; lay on the group. In the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Mead%20Hall\"&gt;Great Mead Hall&lt;/a&gt;, Sigryn, Jarl Velbrand and Runeseer Faljar were barging down the great door. Refusing Sigryn's offer to leave the halls alive in honor of their friendship, a long battle ensued. Sigryn eventually came to her senses however, and expelled the fel corruption from her body. She went to the Vault of Eyir, asking for the val'kyr's forgiveness, and a fitting punishment. Despite her misgivings, Sigryn was the only vrykul to possess the strength and will to overcome the fel, something no vrykul had ever done before. As such, Eyir decided that, instead, she was to assume the burden of the crown, and rule the Tideskorn as their God-Queen."}

This mainly affects casters, although some other abilities (such as warriors' &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt;) are also considered spells and so are prevented by silence effects. In PvP, silence effects are usually subject to &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt;, while in PvE many bosses and specific mobs are immune to silence effects.\nAbilities.\nThe following silence abilities are available to players. Note that many of these abilities are either talents or require additional passives to improve the basic ability to give it a silence effect.\nAlthough not silence effects, it should be noted that &lt;a href=\"Counterspell%20effect\"&gt;interrupts&lt;/a&gt; and many forms of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Fear%20effect\"&gt;Fear effect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Horrify%20effect\"&gt;Horrify effect&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Incapacitate\"&gt;Incapacitate&lt;/a&gt; effects and &lt;a href=\"Polymorph\"&gt;Polymorph&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hex\"&gt;Hex&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to prevent a target from casting. Proper use of these abilities can be very effective for preventing spellcasting, but often have downsides or other uses that make silence effects preferable.\n&lt;a href=\"Counterspell%20effect\"&gt;Interrupts&lt;/a&gt; are closely related to silence effects. They work to interrupt any current cast, and prevent the target from casting any spell in that school for a number of seconds. This can be considered a reduced form of silence, however while silence effects can be used pre-emptively, interrupts must be used during a cast in order to have an effect. This makes interrupts ineffective for preventing instant casts. \nSome abilities incorporate both silence effects and interrupts. This allows for interrupt functionality against PvE targets such as bosses that are immune to silence effects."}

Interestingly, when blessing a Footman, &lt;a href=\"shadow%20magic\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt; is seen around his hands followed by &lt;a href=\"holy%20magic\"&gt;holy magic&lt;/a&gt; around the target of his blessing."}

A frightened herd of bison flees as a group in a random direction (but always away from the perceived source of danger).

A sauroken culture of superiority and hatred for weakness developed, fueled by the ego of their mogu masters. Soon, saurok guards began to plunder the very people they were supposed to police. They grew disobedient, turning on their own mogu commanders whenever they were displeased with the spoils of war. &lt;a href=\"Dojan%20Firecrown\"&gt;Emperor Dojan&lt;/a&gt; responded in the traditional mogu way: the souls were ripped from every living saurok in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, and he demanded the same fate for the legions still in the field. So began the great Purge.\nDefiant to the last, the saurok stood their ground against the mogu in the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang&lt;/a&gt;. It was here they had a fighting chance, drawing the imperial forces deeper in to unfamiliar territory. The mogu death toll began to climb as the rebels poisoned water supplies and sabotaged structures. In his fury, the Emperor Dojan continued to send troops, slaves, and weapons to Krasarang in an effort to eradicate what remained of the saurok. They were never successful.\nEven by mogu standards, the reign of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dojan%20II\"&gt;Emperor Dojan II&lt;/a&gt; was short and brutish. His maniacal drive to finish his father's work and complete the Great Purge against the rebellious saurok legions drove him to leave his court in disarray while he set out on a doomed military campaign. From his perch high on the cliffs overlooking the Krasarang Wilds he oversaw the slow clear-cutting of the jungle, the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Dojanni%20Dungeons\"&gt;Dojanni Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, and the gradual genocide of the saurok race. What he didn't expect was for the remains of the saurok fifth and seventh legions to scale the enormity of the cliffs in the dead of night, ambushing his imperial pavilion from the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; and forcing him over the edge. His body was never found, and the resulting disarray in the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;capitol&lt;/a&gt; left the empire in chaos for over two years while the saurok melted back into the wilds and disappeared..."}

The conflict began when it was discovered that Kirin Tor resources had been used to aid the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s theft of the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; artifact. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Kirin Tor, accused &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and his faction of having orchestrated the treason, and promptly declared the expulsion of all Sunreaver forces from Dalaran. It transpired that, while not having been directly involved in the theft himself, Aethas had been aware of it and chose to remain silent.\nIn a confrontation in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Aethas refused to leave Dalaran, citing that the city belonged to the Sunreavers' as much as it did any other. In response, Jaina imprisoned him within the Citadel and began mobilizing the Silver Covenant, under the command of Vereesa Windrunner, to begin forcibly dealing with any Sunreavers who refused to surrender.\nThe purge proved to be a bloody affair. Though compliant Sunreavers were imprisoned, many proved defiant in the face of exile from Dalaran and took up arms against Jaina, the Alliance forces, and the Silver Covenant, while some Silver Covenant opportunists took the chance to rob, attack, and otherwise harass the civilians of their political rivals. In the midst of the chaos, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; led a strike team into the city in order to rescue the Sunreavers, with moderate success: some of the Sunreavers and Aethas himself were able to escape the city and reach &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, though many more remain imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the wake of the successful purge, Jaina pledged the Kirin Tor to the Alliance once more, while the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; added the remaining Sunreavers to their own ranks. The purge notably put an end to negotiations between &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to bring the blood elves, who were dissatisfied with the callous leadership of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, back into the Alliance. The mobilized &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; would eventually meet the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, supplemented by the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; military, on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, as both factions attempt to claim &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Emperor Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s island stronghold and the artifacts contained within.\nPrelude.\nAs the new leader of the Kirin Tor, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had resolved to keep Dalaran a beacon of cross-faction cooperation and out of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, a goal which she struggled to maintain daily. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde's voice in the Kirin Tor, was tested as the Horde began attacking the Alliance and the war increased in ferocity, a conflict in which his brethren in Silvermoon were a part of. Aethas began to push for Silvermoon and the blood elves' withdrawal from the Horde, viewing the path &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was leading it on to be similar to that of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s descent into madness years before. He believed that Silvermoon's two-thousand-year friendship with Dalaran should be preserved and prioritized above that with the Horde.\nAethas also continued to clash with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; about the Kirin Tor itself. Rommath held little faith in the Kirin Tor's current neutrality, and believed that under Jaina's rule the citadel was squarely in the hands of the Alliance, posing a threat to the blood elves similar to what had almost occurred in Dalaran during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; considered the presence of Horde in the Kirin Tor a threat to the Alliance's war effort, and sent his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate the withdrawal of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina refused to evict the Sunreavers, holding faith in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; being above the war, and Dalaran being a place where Horde and Alliance magi alike can live in peace, reminding those present that some of these very Sunreavers were among those who had taught humanity magic to begin with. Anduin came to agree with Jaina's assessment, and left to inform his father of her decision.\nWith this in mind, Varian approached the regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; (who, coincidentally, was reconsidering \"old Alliances\" himself after multiple occasions of the Horde disregarding the welfare of his people), and began talks to bring the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; back into the Alliance.\nTheft of the Divine Bell.\nUnder orders from Warchief Garrosh, a Sunreaver agent conjured a Sunreaver portal at &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fanlyr%20Silverthorn\"&gt;Fanlyr Silverthorn&lt;/a&gt;, along with Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, entered the night elven city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; in order to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; artifact that had evaded them on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina herself had set wards around the city, and had slain any Horde intruders who had attempted to claim it. With the aid of Sunreaver agents, however, the Horde was able to circumvent Jaina's defenses, and succeeded in infiltrating the city, claiming the bell, and escaping again.\nAghast, Jaina discovered that her wards had been breached, and followed a trail of arcane residue that led her to a portal leading to Dalaran at the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged at what she believed was yet another betrayal, Jaina returned to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to confront the leader of the Sunreavers, &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Purge.\nArriving in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina slew Aethas's &lt;a href=\"High%20Sunreaver%20Mage\"&gt;High Sunreaver Magi&lt;/a&gt; and called him out directly. Accusing him of treachery (an accusation Aethas claimed was false), Jaina ordered him to take his people and leave the city. Unwilling to accept her ultimatum, Aethas proclaimed that Dalaran was the home of his people, too; as Jaina herself had said, many of the Sunreavers had called Dalaran home for over two thousand years. Resolved, Jaina simply stated that she would have to remove them by force. She took Aethas captive and teleported out of the fray.\nThe early stages of the purge were left in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who instructed &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance agents&lt;/a&gt; to pacify the Sunreavers in the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Sewers\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt; and eliminate the uprising inside the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver's Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, to stop and kill a &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Brasael\"&gt;Magister&lt;/a&gt; attempting to withdraw assets from the bank and flee the city, to kill the shopkeepers who had refused to side with the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and to either subdue or kill the &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, thus disallowing the Sunreavers a method of escape from the city. When the deeds are done, the Silver Covenant is mobilized to join in the purge, and Jaina calls in Alliance forces waiting at the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20Memorial\"&gt;Antonidas Memorial&lt;/a&gt; to battle the Sunreavers as well.\nAfter imprisoning Aethas within the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina and her water elementals took to patrolling the city streets, teleporting some &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Citizen\"&gt;Sunreaver citizens&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; and attacking others - both &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Mage\"&gt;with&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Aegis\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; that attempted to fight her and some civilians attempting to flee. \n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; soon led a strike team into Dalaran to evacuate the remaining Sunreavers. Beginning with the sewers \u2014 the farthest tunnels of which had, as of then, been unaffected by the purge \u2014 Rommath and Horde agents warn the Sunreaver civilians of their impending arrest and order them to flee the city. Here, Silver Covenant agents had taken to holding several Sunreaver civilians captive, while others were attacking unarmed Sunreavers without explaining anything to them. After thinning the Silver Covenant's ranks, Rommath left the sewers and entered Dalaran proper, temporarily taking over the center of the city as a makeshift base to strike against Jaina's forces, as the Sunreaver resistance group holding it continued their search for Aethas.\nRommath, incensed at the events unfolding in the city, sent Horde agents to break out the Sunreaver VIPs remaining in the sanctuary, to free the captured dragonhawks at Krasus' Landing (thus giving them a method of escape), to stage a raid on the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Enclave\"&gt;Silver Enclave&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to locate Aethas, and to neutralize the Alliance forces Jaina had called upon for support.\nUltimately, Rommath located Aethas in the Citadel, and, after rescuing him, the two escaped back to the sewers following the demise of &lt;a href=\"Mage-Commander%20Zuros\"&gt;Aethas's jailer&lt;/a&gt;. There, they leaped out of the city to land atop the dragonhawks rescued earlier. Rommath, content with having evacuated as many as he could, returned with Aethas to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. While, thanks to Rommath and the Horde champions, many Sunreavers were rescued, many others were still imprisoned in Dalaran's &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; or killed.\nConsequences.\nIn Silvermoon City.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; moved to oversee the return of the escaped Sunreavers being funneled back to Silvermoon via portals. Aethas and Rommath arrived and informed an incredulous Lor'themar of the situation within Dalaran.\nLor'themar was infuriated with how far Jaina had gone and was just as vexed at Garrosh, hoping dearly that the Warchief's new \"treasure\"\u2014the Divine Bell\u2014destroys him. Lor'themar concluded that the time had come for the blood elves to take matters into their own hands, and ordered Halduron to summon the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and Rommath to assemble the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, subsequently adding the Sunreavers' strength to his own.\nAs the blood elves were blamed for the theft, the negotiations between the blood elves and the Alliance were thus sabotaged by Garrosh's actions.\nMost of the surviving Sunreavers are now held in the Violet Hold. The ones that successfully escaped have come to hold Garrosh (whose agents, actively supporting the Horde war effort, had sparked the purge in the first place) just as responsible for their removal from Dalaran as Jaina herself. The purge put an end to ongoing talks between Lor'themar and King Varian Wrynn, who had approached the regent under the impression that the Sunreavers' right to live in the city was defended by Jaina herself and so would not be leaving Dalaran. Many Sunreavers felt seriously betrayed by the purge, having called Dalaran home \"before Jaina's grandparents were born\". \nIn Lion's Landing.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina met with Varian to declare the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s allegiance to the Alliance. Varian was confused at this turn of events, having been told of Jaina's high opinion of the Sunreavers by Anduin &lt;a href=\"The%20Fate%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;prior to the purge&lt;/a&gt;, and more so for acting without consulting him. Varian chided Jaina for acting so rashly, revealing that he had been entering discussions to bring the blood elves back into the Alliance, and that by attacking their people Jaina had forced their hand. Jaina was unapologetic, however, stating her newfound belief that \"once Horde, always Horde\". Varian stated that the Alliance must act as one if they are to win this war; unfazed, Jaina departed to mobilize the Kirin Tor.\nFor Garrosh.\nThough Garrosh had essentially solved two problems with one clever manoeuvre\u2014forcing the blood elves away from the Alliance and plucking the bell from Darnassus with few losses of his own\u2014this victory was not without its costs in the long-term. Jaina had resolved to see Garrosh removed from power as far back as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Theramore\"&gt;Battle of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, but now the Kirin Tor was firmly and actively working against him. Rather than beaten into obedience, Lor'themar simply took a different approach to the problem Garrosh presented, and began preparing his people for the likelihood of rebellion.\nThe Divine Bell proved to be a short-lived conquest. Garrosh used it to infuse some of his own &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; power, which cost them their lives, and the bell was soon after destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, though it nearly cost him his life.\nAftermath.\nThe Kirin Tor spent the remainder of the as members of the Alliance. They organized the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; to lay claim to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, coming into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, the escaped Sunreavers backed by forces from Silvermoon. The Kirin Tor was planned to assist in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with Dalaran itself raining fire down upon Orgrimmar, but technical constraints interfered; Jaina, Vereesa, and Aethas still appear. Lor'themar and Jaina interact several times following the purge, their meetings ranging from &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Shan%20Bu%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;mutually belligerent&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;fairly civil&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunreavers held in the Violet Hold were kept as prisoners of war; if or when they were released remains unknown.\nAlthough purging the Sunreavers was not a change Jaina wanted to make, she maintained the belief that it was necessary. Jaina struggled with another political intrigue around this time as well, with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; worrying that Jaina's attitude, including shirking her duties and disregarding the opinions of her council, could jeopardize her position. The purge itself was not a topic covered during &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s trial, but the theft that sparked it was relevant to the court. During an argument with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina reflected that the Kirin Tor's previous rulers might have had the right idea regarding neutrality, and threatened to leave the Alliance should her autonomy not be respected; however, she did not go through with this.\nUnder &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, agents of the Kirin Tor, including &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Krelas\"&gt;at least one blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, appear in the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The mages are friendly to the Alliance and neutral to the Horde, although Jaina makes it clear that she does not want non-Kirin Tor personnel, especially Horde, in Kirin Tor territory. Khadgar's decision to enlist Horde support is a contentious issue back in Dalaran, as Jaina and some of the council do not approve of working with the Horde again, while Khadgar and &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt; accept aid from both factions on Draenor.\nAt the outset of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, in a historic occasion, Dalaran and the Kirin Tor have decided to readmit the Sunreavers (and by extension the Horde). Khadgar subsequently beseeches the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to reconsider the Horde's exile from the Kirin Tor. Jaina is incredulous and flatly refuses to support any such decision.\nWhen the Council vote on the matter, Jaina's desires are defeated 4-2. Feeling betrayed by her own, Jaina promptly teleported out of the city, leaving the Order in Khadgar's hands. The fallout from the purge and the figures involved in the Horde's return, however, remains unclear.\nLater, Aethas Sunreaver would assist &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; in locating the legendary &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; voted to allow him and the Sunreavers back into the city, albeit no longer part of the Council.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; came to rescue &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; from execution at &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s command the group is halted by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt;. He had done so to get revenge upon &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; for the purge of Dalaran, and was unwilling to leave his vendetta with her alone - he would have Jaina watch her friends die, as he had done. Hathorel empowered Baine's chains but was fought and defeated. He immersed himself in an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; before falling, surviving the encounter while the freed Baine and the others were teleported to safety by Jaina.\nCasualties.\nThe casualties of the purge appear to have been almost entirely elven. Kirin Tor members of other races are seen cowering at their posts or shops, or else not present, but are not involved in the purge itself. \nThe named characters confirmed to have been slain are as follows:\nIn addition, (who was guarding the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;) can be fought by Horde players, though this is entirely optional if they avoid being teleported there. As he is present as a Kirin Tor questgiver on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, he apparently survived this encounter. \n (the only named human casualty) was also killed during the purge."}

{"id": "686752", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=686752", "title": "Purpose", "text": "The Purpose is the guiding principle of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the reason the &lt;a href=\"Attendant\"&gt;Attendant&lt;/a&gt;s exist in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. It is the belief that the infinite realms of the Shadowlands follow a grand pattern laid out by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in her infinite wisdom and her creators. Although the Attendants record where all souls are sent, only the Purpose may \"reveal whether the threads of a soul will rejoin the tapestry of an individual existence.\" According to &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Tahl\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Tahl&lt;/a&gt;, just as Oribos is the heart of the Shadowlands, so the Purpose keeps the realms of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; in balance. Everything happens through the Purpose, as it guides them and shows them the path. All beings in the endless cycle serve the Purpose, even those who do so unknowingly or unwillingly.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt; that caused the Arbiter to cease her judgments, it was &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; who insisted that the Purpose was the reason for the unprecedented arrival of living beings within the realms of Death. With the death of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and the ascension of a &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; as the new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, the Shadowlands returned to its great Purpose.\nAttendants.\nEvery decision that guides the Attendants of Oribos follows the Purpose, and they trust it implicitly. It also decides what path each Attendant follows in Oribos: Caretaker, Scholar, or Protector. In fact, each attendant was designed to fulfill their part of the Purpose within their intended path and station, each mirroring a facet of the Arbiter's ancient form. From her hands and mind, to her visions, and even to her Honored Voice.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, they had to adapt their perspective in order to serve the Purpose in a new way. Some claimed that all souls flowing to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; must have been a part of the Purpose. However, some Attendants began to question their faith in the Purpose as they could not understand why the souls were flowing there. Some thought it was just a confusing change in its nature, or that it might actually be &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;interference&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Attendants preserve the visions that the twisting strands of fate reveal to them in service of the Purpose. As the Arbiter's fatescribe, it is &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Tahl\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Tahl&lt;/a&gt;'s duty to observe the strands of destiny that the Purpose lays before them. During their journey, Roh-Tahl offered the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s his help to understand &lt;a href=\"The%20Threads%20of%20Fate\"&gt;the choice&lt;/a&gt; that the Purpose has set before them. &lt;a href=\"Restorer%20Kah-Soon\"&gt;Restorer Kah-Soon&lt;/a&gt; serve the Purpose by repairing and bringing order to that which is broken.\nCovenants.\nEach &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; is vital to the Shadowlands, and though they often seem at odds with one another, this too is part of the Purpose, as it depends on the success of their efforts.\nThe sacred purpose of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; is to ferry mortal &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s across the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, they served the Purpose by ensuring a steady supply of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; for all the &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;realms&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%23Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; are able to weigh that soul by peering into its existence and judge whether it is their time. They see and know things that weigh heavy in their mind; and this role is only for the strong of heart who can endure with the Purpose in mind at all times. The &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%23Bearers\"&gt;Bearers&lt;/a&gt; perform the vital task of bearing souls across the Veil to Oribos. They see countless worlds beyond the Shadowlands and encounter beings of all shapes and sizes that will be carried to Oribos to serve the Purpose.\nBrokers.\nIt seems that the brokers are not in agreement with the Purpose. According to &lt;a href=\"Ba%27vol\"&gt;Ba'vol&lt;/a&gt;, the Purpose is utter nonsense, and the attendants are so blinded by devotion that you could drop &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s on their heads and say the Purpose told you to do so, and they'd ramble on about it being a mysterious portent of some grand destiny. During his quest to find &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Firim&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in his journal that the attendants were muddle-minded and myopic with their Purpose.\nSpeculation.\nThe Purpose may have been created by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; captured &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, the brood mother of the &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-drakes&lt;/a&gt;. The drakes don't seem even a little bit happy about the situation... they've gotten very aggressive.\nThey've pushed into stormcrest territory and the eagles have taken to an all out fight with them. It's time to return the favor. We're riding to the &lt;a href=\"Foot%20Steppes\"&gt;Foot Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and slaughtering them there.\n&lt;a href=\"Yorg%20Stormheart\"&gt;King Stormheart&lt;/a&gt; left this hammer to me - make good use and see to it that I get it back.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: (At level 80)\nProgress.\nThis is completely out of control.\nCompletion.\nI don't see the drakes being dissuaded so easily. Stop back by tomorrow if you think you can spare more time to help.\nNotes.\nIf you are dismounted, you can return to the quest giver for a new eagle:\nControls while on the eagle: #1 is Swoop, doing 3.5-4000 damage, 10 yard range, #2 is Eye Gouge, doing 3.5-4000 damage a second every second while channeling (for 10 seconds), on a 30 second cooldown, #3 is Storm Bolt (hammer icon), doing 5500-6500 damage and stunning for 4 seconds, 1 second cast, 6 second cooldown.\nGet in range of a drake and use #3 (Storm Bolt) to stun it and close to 10 yards, then spam 1 until it dies. The storm bolt can be cast while moving.\nIf you start attacking only with melee, by right-clicking on a wyrm, even if you finish it with the controls it will become lootable, which is great for &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;skinners&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you happen to be level 85, it will be faster for you to travel on your own mount and kill the wyrms on the cliffs and perched on the pillars on the ground, like any other mob. The quest only requires that you kill the wyrms and return the hammer when you're done.\nProgression.\nIn addition to the progression below, this quest requires first completing (at least part of) a very long quest chain started by &lt;a href=\"Gretchen%20Fizzlespark\"&gt;Gretchen Fizzlespark&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"K3\"&gt;K3&lt;/a&gt; that ultimately leads to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; instance."}

The dragons ultimately won and imprisoned Raszageth within the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and the three others within the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;. This ancient, titanic prison is a raid in \"\".\nHistory.\nAncient past.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s uplifted the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, a group of ancient &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s refused their gift, believing that dragonkind should remain unchanged by &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; magic and should instead choose to return to their roots and embrace their inherent elemental energies. Despite all the work that the Aspects and their dragonflights had accomplished since their creation, these \"Primalist\" proto-dragons joined together and demanded that &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; be exiled from the dragons' new home. When the Aspects refused, it sowed the seeds of rebellion for the Primalists. The Primalists' leaders became known as the Primal Incarnates, infused with the power of the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; was concerned about the festering schism between Primalists and dragons, but Alexstrasza dismissed his concerns, hoping to resolve the tensions through communication. Fearing conflict was coming, Neltharion created the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; and prepared for war.\nNeltharion didn't have enough time to perfect his creation. About 20,000 years ago Raszageth, the Storm-Eater, struck first at dragonkind by attacking the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt; broken, Neltharion lost control of the dracthyr, and resorted to submitting to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time, using his newfound powers to banish Raszageth to the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;. He then discarded the dracthyr and stashed them away in their creches where they were put in stasis indefinitely.\nA cataclysmic conflict ensued between Primalists and dragonflights known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Scaleborn\"&gt;War of the Scaleborn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; were ever loyal to the Incarnate's ideals, but Iridikron truly embraced the war. At the end, he struck terrible bargains to keep their cause alive. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes the other incarnates never knew the true depths of his depravity. Despite the Primalists' alliance with the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; to end the dragons' reign, the remaining Primal Incarnates were ultimately defeated, but Alexstrasza, having failed to restore peace between the two groups, still couldn't bear to kill them given they had once been as close as clutch-mates, and decided to imprison them instead, within the titanic &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\n20,000 years later, a group of Primalists, now visibly also consisting of mortal races having joined their cause, resurfaced and were led by &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; where they freed &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth the Storm-Eater&lt;/a&gt;. She unleashed storms across the world's oceans, preventing travel to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and indefinitely making the Reach inaccessible, and sent the Primalists to invade various points across the globe. She then set out to free her kin from the Vault of the Incarnates. The Aspects, realizing they would not be able to stop them after having given up their titan-gifted powers to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, began searching for a way to get their powers back. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; also asked &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to rally the mortal races against the oncoming threat.\nAfter attacking the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Life%20Pools\"&gt;Ruby Life Pools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;, she succeeded in releasing her brethren from the Vault, but died in the process. Seeing how Raszageth's haste led to her downfall, Alexstrasza speculated that the Incarnates would retreat and gather their strengths first, and that Iridikron's mastery of the earth would harbor them in the meantime.\nFyrakk was eager to take revenge for their sister, but Iridikron did not want to rush in and believed they needed to even the scales with the Aspects first. The Incarnates adventured to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; as the last echoes of Raszageth's storm faded, where they breached an ancient vault belonging to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and found a device that would give them the location of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, the Earth-Warder's secret underground. They had no interest in the laboratory of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt; itself, but in the molten fire that could be found below. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; followed behind them secretly to claim Neltharion's legacy.\nThey found one of the hidden entry points to Zaralek right below &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, where they broke through the ground and sent Fyrakk down, blazing through the earth, to claim the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; power below and wake the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;'s Elders at the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Caldera\"&gt;Zaqali Caldera&lt;/a&gt;. Fyrakk was ultimately successful in gaining control over the Shadowflame found within Aberrus, empowering himself, and awakening the Incarnates old djaradin allies. Iridikron himself would make a bargain with the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, using their access to the timeways to travel back to the point of Galakrond's fall and acquire his essence. Though the adventurers and Chromie succeeded in defeating &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, Iridikron succeeded in his intent in gaining a fragment of Galakrond's essence before departing through a Void Gate, leaving the Primal Incarnates affairs to Fyrakk and Vyranoth. However, Vyranoth noticed a dark change within Fyrakk, as he had become more unhinged and cruel, leading the two incarnates to briefly class over their methods, especially after the Frozenheart learned of Fyrakk's intent to corrupt the newly emerging World Tree &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt; with his darkened flames, remaking the world in fire. Disgusted with this plan and of how Fyrakk had willingly abandoned their ideals, Vyranoth defected from the Primal Incarnates and warned Alexstrasza of Fyrakk's intent before ultimately joining her in the World Tree's defense.\nNow alone in his conquest, Fyrakk gathered his forces, including Fire Lord &lt;a href=\"Smolderon\"&gt;Smolderon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and launched his assault upon the Emerald Dream before the World Tree could properly bloom into the real world. However, Fyrakk's efforts would be in vain, as not only were his forces routed but he would fall to the Dream's defenders right at the foot of the World Tree's core before he could corrupt it, allowing the World Tree to fully bloom. As it did so, a powerful surge of Azeroth's magic burst from the core, re-empowering the Dragon Aspects and Vyranoth herself."}

Samples of the oozes are very pure. They seem to be elemental in nature, but something more, reminding him of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. When a pure ooze is mixed with one from Felwood, they form a &lt;a href=\"Gargantuan%20Ooze\"&gt;Gargantuan Ooze&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nPrimal oozes are primitive creatures that may date back to the creation of life. They exude acidic digestive juices on their surface and into the air, feeding on any animal matter they encounter. Primal oozes are equally at home on land or in water, and have been known to climb trees or stone formations to drop on unsuspecting passersby. Primal oozes take the form of a 6-foot wide, 2-foot high lump of noxious goo. They weigh approximately 200 pounds. These clumps of disgusting slime are brownish-green. Pieces of bone and metal glint inside the creatures, barely visible through the semi-transparent surface. A primal ooze attacks any animal matter it encounters, using its acid attacks to partially digest a meal before it has even been subdued. Creatures that resist are pummeled to death with acid-covered pseudopods. Primal oozes pursue food relentlessly for as long as they can sense it. \nA primal ooze can release an acidic cloud that extends in a five-foot sphere around the creature. The cloud deals acid damage to any creatures caught within it. Primal oozes secrete acid constantly. A primal ooze that takes enough damage, reacts by creating a clone of itself. Cloning cannot be interrupted, but if the ooze dies while taking this action, the clone is not formed. While it creates the clone, the ooze's acidic cloud increases in radius to ten feet. However, once cloning is complete, neither the original nor the clone can use the acidic cloud ability for a day. A primal ooze's clone is identical to the undamaged original, with full health. Magical effects in place on the original are not present on the clone. Once a primal ooze has cloned itself, neither the original nor the clone can use the cloning ability again until they have fed on animal matter equal to twice their own body weight."}
