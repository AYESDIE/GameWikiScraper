The various &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes have their own take on the matter, with &lt;a href=\"Axethrower\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Headhunter\"&gt;spear-throwing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s becoming known as &lt;a href=\"troll%20berserker\"&gt;troll berserker&lt;/a&gt;s through a combination of learning how to channel their rage and alchemical means. Sometimes, alchemical or magical alteration can lead those berserkers to become &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The was also known to create &lt;a href=\"dire%20orc\"&gt;dire orc&lt;/a&gt; berserkers in blood &lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;rituals&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis article will only list the &lt;a href=\"Rage\"&gt;enraged&lt;/a&gt; melee warriors deployed by the various races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and . For lists about the other kinds of berserkers, read their respective pages.\nIn the RPG.\nRage rests within the heart of the orc and troll races, like some barely contained beast ready to tear its way out. For many, this rage allows them to face even the most dangerous of foes and survive. Their innate ability to hold on to this energy and ride it through the waves of battle has made the Horde a feared and respected force. Yet some orcs and trolls descend even deeper in this rage, harassing it as often as they can, fighting on without care for themselves and showing no mercy to those in their paths. These are the berserkers. \nWith \"Rage\", a berserker can fly into a rage as a &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt; does. With \"Berserk\", berserkers learn to harness their rage to become unstoppable killing machines. With \"Rancor\" a berserker is in a constant state of readiness, able to burst into a bloody rage at a moment's notice. With \"Ferocity\" a berserker is such a tenacious combatant that he continues to fight without difficulty even while disabled or dying. With \"Ogre's Grip\", the berserker has learned how to wield larger weapons in a single hand. He can wield two-handed melee weapons as if they were one-handed melee weapons, and wield one-handed melee weapons as if they were light weapons. Once he learns \"Fury\", he is the embodiment of unfettered rage, the berserker can lay to waste anything around him. When in a fury, the berserker cannot discern between friend and foe; he attacks every target within reach, regardless of whether or not it is a friend or an opponent. With \"Burst of Speed, when charging a berserker travel faster and farther. With \"Surge\", the berserker's ability to wade headfirst into combat reaches new levels of destruction and mayhem. As gains \"Superior Rage\" his strength and stamina increases, as does his morale. A fully trained berserker has \"Undying Rage\". The berserker no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage."}

Most HoTs are target specific, though there are also &lt;a href=\"Area%20of%20Effect\"&gt;Area of Effect&lt;/a&gt; (AoE) HoT's such as the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt;.\nA HoT is in principle a &lt;a href=\"Buff\"&gt;Buff&lt;/a&gt;, but usually with a much shorter duration than \"normal\" buffs. HoTs can usually be removed or dispelled, just like Buffs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; is the most well-known class for using HoT spells, probably followed by the &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s have spells which heal over time but the methods are different from the simple buffs of priests and druids. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s also have HoTs, although they are not often seen since they are limited to themselves or their pets."}

Regardless of the source of their magic, they do not deal with the tainted energies of the arcane. Instead, healers find their power in the world around them or in the spirits or &lt;a href=\"Eternals\"&gt;Eternals&lt;/a&gt; they venerate. Healers are the heart of a community \u2014 and of an adventuring party. They use their powers to heal the wounded and bolster the spirits of those around them. \nHealers form the core of all divine spellcasting organizations in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, from priests of the Holy Light to druids of the wild to shamans. Druids are present in the Alliance and the Horde, as it is a prevalent path among both night elves and tauren. Humans, dwarves, and high elves become priests of the Holy Light, while night elf priests honor Elune, the Moon Goddess. Rumors also tell of priests among jungle trolls and the Forsaken, but what powers they venerate are unknown. Shamans are common among orcs and tauren, and jungle trolls are now taking this path under the tutelage of their horde allies.\nDruids are usually neutral in alignment, primarily concerned with keeping balance in nature and monitoring the wild for intrusions or disruptions in the natural order. Priests follow many faiths, but they tend toward good alignments throughout Azeroth; evil priests are rarely encountered, though the Scourge and Burning Legion certainly have their worshippers. Shamans take a pragmatic view of life and death, so they may be of varying alignments.\nDruids are present in both the Alliance and the Horde, priests are most common in the Alliance, and shamans are encountered almost exclusively in the Horde.\nNot all healers use divine magic. Some are known for using mundane materials such as potions, ointments, and bandages through alchemy, first aid or other means. These represent a healer profession, rather than a class.\nEpic healer.\nThe epic healer is a paragon of restoration and protection. They hold their party together with strength and determination, and others can count on her to pull them out of the fire when adventuring gets rough. They burn with an unshakable inner faith that scours their enemies. They concentrate on improving their spellcasting ability, with a few nods toward defense as well. Metamagic feats make even their lowliest spell impressive \u2014 they consider the &lt;a href=\"Transcendent%20Spell\"&gt;Transcendent Spell&lt;/a&gt; especially. Most of their ability increases go to wisdom, though occasional boosts to &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; and constitution improve their combat prowess.\nHorde healer.\nHealers replaced the shamans of the Horde after many shamans became warlocks. The orcs of Draenor were known for their shamanistic culture. When they attacked the draenei, the elemental spirits began to leave them due to the imbalance in nature. The shamans became warlocks and many orcs were trained as healers to replace the healing abilities of the shamans. These healers used their knowledge of potions, ointments, and bandages to heal the wounds of the original Horde.\nDivine domains.\nVarious domains are accessible to healers depending on their path. Divine domains describe healer spells and help define divine spells."}

{"id": "14520", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14520", "title": "Healer (role)", "text": "A healer is a &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; whose primary purpose or &lt;a href=\"class%20role\"&gt;class role&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=\"Healing\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; and protect their allies. &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s can all serve as healers. Healers are perhaps the most wanted for a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile all party members must work together to succeed, healers have the direct responsibility of keeping every other member of the party alive. Healers must anticipate incoming damage, prioritise the healing of multiple targets, and make split-second decisions using an array of healing options.\nBeing a healer.\nBeing a healer means keeping a close eye on the health of multiple targets. Often, losing focus for even a moment can lead to the death of a player. In PvE, the healer's attentions are mostly focused on the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, who should be taking the majority of all incoming damage. However, careless DPS and numerous fight mechanics can cause the tables to quickly turn, requiring the healer to keep focused at all times, ready to switch targets at a moment's notice.\nUnlike other roles, the prime challenge of a healer is usually not that of simple capability, but one of efficiency and longevity. Most well-geared healers are capable of healing targets through the heaviest of onslaughts, but doing so without rapidly depleting their limited mana reserves requires forethought, anticipation and a thorough knowledge of their skills and cooldowns. Healers who simply use their fastest and most powerful heals will quickly find themselves out of mana, powerless to aid themselves or their allies. Healers must therefore strike a fine balance between speed and efficiency, often risking the lives of their charges in order to ensure their mana will last the fight. \nIn the heat of battle, healers also have the unenviable responsibility of triage, making split-second decisions as to who will live, and who must die. It is often not possible to save every target, and there are times when even the best healer must allow one of their charges to perish, in order to save the others. In this sense, healers are those that stand between each player and their imminent death; and while they can bend the forces of fate a little to their favor, when there is nothing more that can be done, it is they who must decide who is to live, and who is to die.\nFor this reason and many others, the role of healer can be the most stressful, unpopular and unappreciated of all. If the healer is doing their job right, no-one will even notice they are doing it. This means that healers are rarely thanked for their efforts, with the only visible proof of their labours the fact that their allies are still standing. Because the healer serves as the last line of defence between players and their untimely deaths, healers can also be the subject of anger and abuse from players, even when those players are entirely to blame for their own demise. When everything goes wrong, the healer may be held responsible for not miraculously saving the group. However, experienced players know the difference between their own mistakes and those of the healer, and anyone who has served in the role knows the challenges of healing a tough encounter.\nHealing is perhaps the most critical and responsible role of all. In the course of a tough fight, it is possible for several DPS to perish, and the party still to triumph; it is possible even for the tank to die, and for others to step up to take the brunt of the enemy's attacks. But without a healer to keep them alive, any group is likely to meet a swift and ignominious demise.\nBeing a healer takes guts, quick wits and nerves of steel. It means taking responsibility for the survival of the entire group, and knowing that if things go wrong, you may be blamed. Being a healer requires maintaining a constant awareness of multiple targets, numerous cooldowns and a plethora of debuffs. It means anticipating incoming damage and predicting the behaviour of your teammates, playing a constant game of chicken between urgency and efficiency, gambling the lives of your teammates against the speed of your reactions. It means living on the fine line between life and death, constantly weighing the value of speed over longevity, the value of one life over that of another. \nBeing a healer is quite possibly the most stressful and most under-appreciated role of all. Nonetheless, it offers a unique challenge, and the opportunity to earn the praise and respect of your teammates. A good healer is capable of turning around any encounter, creating an indomitable team of adventurers who can take on anything. As the person most directly responsible for their team's survival, a skilled healer can single-handedly save their party, their quick-thinking and mastery of their abilities sweeping their group from humiliating defeat to jubilant triumph. A good healer may stand in the shadows, but they alone are capable of raising their team into the glorious light of victory.\nHealing in PvP.\nWhile much of the above applies to both PvE and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, there are many differences between the two types of play, and healing is no exception. Many PvE concepts do not apply in PvP, such as &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;, pulling and in most cases the role of the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, while others are still present but in quite different forms. Additionally, the many different forms of PvP, such as arena, rated battlegrounds, non-rated battlegrounds and world PvP, each require a different approach from the healer. Players should remember to consider the many talent and glyph choices available, with some options that seem useless in PvE proving invaluable in PvP.\nBoth in PvE and PvP, the healer's job is the same: to keep their team alive. However, while in PvE there is usually a single target for the enemies' attacks - the tank - in PvP this is rarely the case. \nPerhaps the biggest difference between PvE and PvP healing is that in PvP, the healer themselves is very often the prime target of the enemy's attacks. While a boss is easily taunted by a skilled tank, in PvP players will often seek to defeat the healer first, making it easier to then down the rest of their team. This can shift the healer from standing safely on the sidelines to suddenly finding themselves pulled into the thick of battle, expending every defensive cooldown at their disposal simply in order to stay alive. Alternatively, healers may find themselves being sidelined entirely, with a skilfully arranged sequence of &lt;a href=\"interrupt%20effect\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities locking them out of combat, preventing them from healing their allies when they need it most. \nIn combat with any experienced opponents, it is rare that a healer will be left to freely assist their allies. In practiced combat, healers tend to either be singled out by every enemy on the field, or effectively shut down with crowd control, negating the value of their presence. PvP healing therefore tends to require a far greater degree of self-preservation and evasive manoeuvres, and a fine balance between helping one's allies and helping oneself. This alone makes healing in PvP a very different experience to healing in PvE, and can prove extremely frustrating and even distressing to healers accustomed to the relative safety of a dragon's lair. \nThe degree of assistance a healer can expect also depends on the type of PvP. In more organised forms, the healer can expect a fair amount of help from their teammates, who should be well aware of their vital importance to the team and should be more than willing to help the healer whenever their survival is at risk. In more casual PvP such as non-rated battlegrounds, healers will often be left to fend for themselves, which can make surviving the attentions of a group of opponents a daunting if not impossible task. While players should, for their own benefit, always take care of their healers regardless of the form of play, in practice healers will have to develop some survival skills of their own if they are to make it in casual PvP.\nAs well as attacks on the healer themselves, PvP presents a far more challenging and unpredictable challenge regarding the behaviour of opponents. Healers must still do their best to anticipate incoming damage, but are faced with a formidable array of possible behaviours, tactics and coordinated set-pieces from opponents who are often playing through pre-arranged manoeuvres and are capable of changing tactics on the fly to counteract the opposing team.\nThe targets of attacks are also far harder to predict in PvP. Attacks can come simultaneously on several different targets, and shift at a moment's notice to focus on a single target. Less organised forms of PvP usually present a more chaotic experience, with attacks being more evenly dispersed. In organised forms of PvP such as arena, a high level of coordination is often displayed, with coordinated attacks, synchronised use of powerful cooldowns, and chain &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; effects to lock certain players out of combat entirely for extended periods of time.\nSome types of PvP present a more PvE-like experience, such as the flag-carrying elements of &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s such &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. In these battlegrounds, healers should do their best to keep their flag carriers alive, in a similar fashion to PvE tank-healing. However, even in these situations, the opposing team will often seek to single out the healer for attack or incapacitation. Healers should try to keep within range of prime targets like flag-carriers while evading the attentions of the attacking team.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; presents relatively fixed variables - an equal number of players on each side, a relatively small area, the opportunity for a balanced team composition and some arranged tactics - other forms of PvP can be far more unpredictable. Healing in battlegrounds can frequently present varying numbers on each side, with additional members entering and leaving the fray. Healers can at times find themselves massively outnumbered, with little hope of escape, never mind victory; at others they may find themselves with little work to do, their enemies easily defeated. Random composition also means healers may sometimes be at a premium, making them a highly valuable member of the team, and at others only one of a number of healers, with little work to do. Healers should do their best to seek out allies in need of assistance, and to make their way to where they are needed most.\nOne advantage of most PvP is that death is a far less critical factor. With the exception of arena, PvP generally involves a large number of deaths on both sides, with players frequently resurrecting and rejoining the fray, and healers are not expected to keep everyone alive. However, part of the reason for this is the extremely challenging nature of healing in PvP.\nStrength of classes.\nAs a tank healer.\nA raid has, depending on the encounter, one, two or sometime three tanks, who will take damage almost constantly during a fight. Therefore, a raid will assign at least one dedicated tank healer. A primary tank healer will only focus on the tank(s), raids might also assign (a) secondary tank healer(s), who focusses on the tank(s) when they take a lot of damage. A tank healer will mainly use his core healing spells and his instant healing spell. However, the slow, mana-efficient spell (&lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) will in most circumstances be too slow, and can only be used safely when the encounter is well-know and the healer can be sure that there will be only little damage coming; the fast healing spell (&lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) on the other hand costs so much mana that some raid healers abstain from using it altogether, although they would have to admit that it is better to spent a lot of mana than to have the tank die. The usefulness of the fast healing spell depends on the healer class, too. \nSo ideally, a tank healer will alternate between his instant heal spell and his large heal spell (&lt;a href=\"Greater%20Heal%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Greater Heal (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, etc), when the first one is on cooldown. A paladin will in addition alternate between his two instant direct heals, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt;. (With the first one, a paladin acquires up to 3 charges of holy power, the second one uses them up.) The other healing classes have an effect that they will try to keep active on the tank(s) all the time; One the one hands, these are a priest's &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; and a shaman's &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, these are the heal over time spells, a druid's &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; and a holy priest's &lt;a href=\"Renew\"&gt;Renew&lt;/a&gt;. Shamans will try to have the hot effect of &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; active on the tanks. A discipline priest is somehow different; he can use Renew, too, but will, more importantly try, to recast on the tanks again as soon possible. \nTank healing is something any healing class can do, although druids are probably the least suited for it. Their instant heal, &lt;a href=\"Swiftmend\"&gt;Swiftmend&lt;/a&gt;, has a rather high mana cost and requires a &lt;a href=\"Regrowth\"&gt;Regrowth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; effect on the target (a healing druid will however have the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Swiftmend\"&gt;Glyph of Swiftmend&lt;/a&gt;), but a druid as tank healer will have &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; active on the tank(s) anyway. On the other hand, druids have an additional heal-over-time spell, &lt;a href=\"Lifebloom\"&gt;Lifebloom&lt;/a&gt;, which they can keep active on one tank. \nAs a group healer.\nAs apparent from the comparison of healing spells, different classes have a different way of group healing. There are two 'styles' of group healing. Druids keep recasting &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Growth\"&gt;Wild Growth&lt;/a&gt; (as soon as it is ready) and use their hot spells, while shamans keep recasting &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; (which has no cooldown!). \nA Holy priest's group healing is a combination of both styles: &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt; is cast whenever it is ready, else &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Renew\"&gt;Renew&lt;/a&gt; are used. &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; is also cast when ready, since it jumps 5 times, so that it also works as a group heal spell. The reason it is usually cast the tank is, that it only works if the target takes damage, and the tank is usually guaranteed to take damage. &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Glyph of Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; increases the heal on the first target by 60%. A Discipline priest's Renew is often slightly weaker (without &lt;a href=\"Chakra\"&gt;Chakra: Serenity&lt;/a&gt; to refresh its duration), and a Discipline priest doesn't have an instant group heal, so that his group healing appears to be more of the second style, relying on &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; (which is substantially improved via &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Aegis\"&gt;Divine Aegis&lt;/a&gt;). However and a much improved (with only a 1 second cooldown) are very useful, with the nature of Power Word: Shield's absorb effect allowing more time to attend to each target.\nPaladins have the most difficult time as a group healer. They neither have a useful hot spell (like a druid's &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;), nor a group heal ability that can be cast constantly (like a shaman's &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt;). A paladin's &lt;a href=\"Light%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;Light of Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beacon%20of%20Light\"&gt;Beacon of Light&lt;/a&gt; can't compensate for this. For these reasons raids will generally avoid assigning a holy paladin as a group healer.\nClasses, races and professions that have limited ability to heal others.\nClass.\nThese classes may heal in one way or another.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt; can also use for self healing and &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20Weapon%20-%20Battlemaster\"&gt;Battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;-enchanted weapons to heal their party."}

It has a two second casting time, after which point the rain will remain for ten seconds. The spell has a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; that matches the duration, meaning that only one area of rain per shaman can be maintained.\nNotes.\nHealing Rain is an area-effect &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; (HoT) spell that calls down rain in a selected area, healing all players within it. There is no limit to the number of players who can potentially be affected, but the effect per target is reduced slightly if there are more than six players in the rain. This will keep the total healing done by the rain fairly constant, and prevents the rain from becoming excessively powerful in 25 man &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s. It is currently the single most expensive healing spell in the game, making it very inefficient unless three or more players are in the rain. However, under ideal circumstances, Healing Rain is one of the best healing spells available to any class.\nAny area within 40 yards of the shaman that is in &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt; can be selected. The Healing Rain is clearly visible as a blue circle on the ground, allowing players to move into it to receive healing. If there is more than one shaman in a group, multiple rains can be cast on top of each other, causing anyone within that area to be healed by both rains. Once the spell has been cast, the rain heals players within it regardless of line of sight or distance to the casting shaman.\nMechanically, Healing Rain is considered a heal over time for most purposes. Each tick has a separate chance of &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; effect on each target, it cannot benefit from &lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Life\"&gt;Unleash Life&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; can give it additional ticks just like other healing over time spells.\nTrivia.\nThis ability was first used by the &lt;a href=\"Severed%20Essence\"&gt;Severed Essence&lt;/a&gt; when it copied a shaman player, although it was named Replenishing Rains instead of Healing Rain. The mirror image is summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20Herald\"&gt;Val'kyr Herald&lt;/a&gt;s located at &lt;a href=\"Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;."}

The three spheres restriction only applies to the spheres actively summoned by this ability, not to the two types of passively generated spheres, whose number at any given moment is unlimited.\nIt is possible to cast a sphere directly under oneself or an injured ally, in which case it will be consumed shortly afterwards and act as an instant direct heal."}

It is used mainly in group play and should be used more or less on cooldown. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Tide%20Totem\"&gt;Healing Tide Totem&lt;/a&gt;, however, it should not be reserved only for when the group is taking heavy damage, as its short cooldown allows it to be used fairly often. Whenever possible, it should be aligned with major group damage effects when Healing Tide Totem is on cooldown or (if raid cooldowns are being coordinated) whenever it is not the shaman's turn.\nNotes.\nIn previous expansions the totem would use the spell power that the caster had at the time of casting for the full duration, but now \"updates\" with every tick rather than just at the time of casting. This means that it no longer matters what buffs you have active when you place the totem, and that there is no point in refreshing the totem unless you need to move it or it is about to expire."}

It is used mainly in group play and should be used whenever the shaman's party is sustaining heavy, continuous amounts of damage. In five-player parties, it is up to the shaman's discretion when to use it, but in a raid setting it is best to coordinate with the party's other healers on when it (and the other healing cooldowns available) will be used.\nThe healing provided by Healing Tide Totem is strong, but still much weaker than restoration druids' &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt;. Healing Tide Totem does, however, have a tremendous advantage in that it does not need to be channelled. In raid situations where Tranquility-like throughput is needed for survival, the shaman is still free to place their totem and then cast &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt;, etc. to counter the damage that exceeds what the totem is capable of on its own. Also, Healing Tide Totem can efficiently counter effects that do heavy damage but also requirement movement, as it can be placed just before movement is needed and heal the shaman and her allies as they move."}

Each time the bag is used, one of the eight \"Heart Candy\" items is created. In addition to the saying, it also says &lt;Made by Name-of-Character&gt;, the character who opened the \"Bag of Candies\" creating the item. \nAchievements.\nThe World Event achievement for the &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; event requires you to eat all eight of these items . The odds are good that it will take more than one \"Bag of Candies\" to complete the achievement. This is in turn part of the &lt;a href=\"Fool%20For%20Love\"&gt;Fool For Love&lt;/a&gt; meta-achievement.\nAs these candy hearts can be traded and auctioned off, it is not truly necessary to open bags of candies to complete this achievement.\nProbability.\nThe odds of creating any one of the eight on any use of the bag appears to be equal, one in eight of any of them, and after considerable digging, one comment on WoWHead (for the spell, Create Heart Candy, #26678) backs this up, but there does not seem to be a reliable source to verify this with.\nFiguring out how long it takes (how many bags, 10 sample each) is intractable if you view it as a and attempt to follow each branching probability tree. However, the achievement can be viewed as a series of eight s; each characterized by a between outcomes \"new candy\" and \"no new candy\". Each binomial distribution has an expected time to success of 1/p, p being 8/8, 7/8, 6/8, 5/8, 4/8, 3/8, 2/8, and 1/8, and the expected times are additive, 8/8 + 8/7 + 8/6 + 8/5 + 8/4 + 8/3 + 8/2 + 8/1 . The results is that it on the average takes just over two bags (about 21\u00be samples) to complete this achievement. \nThis can be misleading; there is no cap on how long this can take; the distribution of samples to complete is weighted toward the low end with a shrinking number requiring more and more samples. Think of a long crane arm with a heavy counterweight. The bulk of the people attempting this achievement will complete it with only two bags and a few people will take much longer."}

After silencing the zealot, the adventurers face off against &lt;a href=\"Blade%20Lord%20Ta%27yak\"&gt;Blade Lord Ta'yak&lt;/a&gt;, the mantid blademaster who wields great skill with both steel and wind magic. Progressing upward onto a great terrace, the mantid mages of wind summon &lt;a href=\"Garalon\"&gt;Garalon&lt;/a&gt;, mightiest of the mantid's &lt;a href=\"Kunchong\"&gt;Kunchong&lt;/a&gt;.

When Y'Shaarj was torn apart by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, parts of the Old God's enormous body scattered across the landscape, and its monstrous heart was the largest part of it that remained intact. When &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; was on his way to &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; to install the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, he came across the Heart of Y'Shaarj and decided to seal it in a &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;vault&lt;/a&gt; below the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. Ra's hope was that studying the heart would help the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; gain a better understanding of the Old Gods and the Void. After creating the vault, Ra charged his &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; followers with watching over the chamber and the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;surrounding lands&lt;/a&gt; before continuing west.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Invasion of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; excavation unearthed the ancient vault, and the Heart was claimed for the Horde by &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;. The Heart was then revived by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, using the power of the magic pools of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, unleashing the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting most of the Vale in the process. It was later taken to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, where it was mounted within Garrosh Hellscream's &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; allied themselves with Garrosh and his True Horde as a result of the Heart's presence, and it granted Garrosh visions of conquest. The mad Warchief also gained the ability to wield and manipulate its Void energies, infusing his forces with them. Among those infused were the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Reaper\"&gt;Kor'kron Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Harbingers of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Skullsplitter\"&gt;Corrupted Skullsplitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malkorok%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; himself. Garrosh also abandoned Gorehowl in favor of a replica forged with the power of the Heart itself, &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atoh%2C%20Desecrated%20Image%20of%20Gorehowl\"&gt;Xal'atoh, Desecrated Image of Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the adventurers spear-heading the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; reached the Inner Sanctum, Garrosh and the Heart of Y'Shaarj engaged them in what could be described as a tag team; alternating between Garrosh fighting them within his command chamber, and the Heart tormenting them in one of its &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;twisted pocket dimensions&lt;/a&gt;. As the adventurers neared victory, Garrosh absorbed all of the Heart's power in a last-ditch move that transformed him into an avatar of Y'Shaarj. When even this monstrous form was defeated, the last power of Y'Shaarj drained away and left behind nothing but a &lt;a href=\"Fading%20Breath\"&gt;Fading Breath&lt;/a&gt; that soon vanished as well."}

The homeland of the barbarous &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, Desolace was once nothing but a massive grey desert, filled with dead trees and skulls of dead &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;, along with warring centaur tribes and the malevolent, &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;-worshipping &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the area has become far more fertile, with grass, trees, and increased settlement by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, conflict continues to rage between various factions, including the Horde and Alliance. The &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20clan\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; tribes of centaur continue to fight, whilst the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; gathers in &lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt;. With the Burning Blade to the north in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Axe%20Fortress\"&gt;Thunder Axe Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s in the northeastern ruins, and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; on the northwest coast, Desolace remains a harsh environment even with the Cenarion Circle's best efforts. The sacred Centaur grounds of &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; are the only instance in the area. \nHistory.\n1,100 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Desolace, then known as \"Mashan'she\" (\"Loom of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;) was a fertile grassland frequented by the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the nomadic &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes. Drawn by faint &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; whisperings, the tauren became convinced that somewhere beneath the meadows, the Earth Mother herself dwelled. After decades of attempting to rouse her from her slumber, the shaman eventually succeeded, but to their horror they realized that what they had awakened was not the benevolent Earth Mother, but the enormous &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt;. The newly awakened Theradras reached out to the verdant surroundings for sustenance and consumed their energies in order to regenerate her weakened form. The tauren would later name this now barren land \"Desolace\".\nThe sudden monumental loss of life sent ripples throughout all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, son of the forestlord &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to Desolace to investigate, but though he had decided to imprison Theradras, he instead fell in love with her. Theradras requited Zaetar's affection, and the two became mates. From this forbidden and unnatural union, the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; were born. After having brutally murdered their father, the half-horse creatures quickly proliferated and spread out across Kalimdor, driving the tauren of Desolace from their homes and igniting a long and dark period of war between the two races that would come to last for many centuries.\nThe remote plains of Desolace were once home to a unique breed of &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; too proud and wild to countenance riders. Yet it is precisely this willful conceit that enticed the elders of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to bind these majestic steeds to their service with dark rituals too horrific to perform by any but the most depraved of warlocks. Although they retain their imposing forms, these newly-christened &lt;a href=\"felsteed\"&gt;felsteed&lt;/a&gt;s have become twisted with infernal energies, treading flames and breathing fire.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn recent times Horde, Alliance, the Burning Blade, the Cenarion Circle, Satyr and Naga have set up outposts in the desolate land, and only four of the five tribes control Desolace. With the centaur kept in check, more species of animals occupy the land than before. Adventures are directed to beat back the Satyr, Burning Blade, and Naga forces at the behest of their respective factions and the Cenarion Circle. At the same time the Horde and Alliance seek to take advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Magram\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Gelkis\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; feud by picking a side in order to gain an ally in the region.\nTheradras loved the centaur, and she was worried that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power might eventually drive them to extinction. After years of hostilities with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their allies, she acted to save her progeny. She infused the centaur with her power, driving them to make war and claim new territories outside Desolace. The centaur warbands stormed out of Desolace and laid waste to the surrounding regions. Horde forces sent by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; quickly discovered that the centaur were slaughtering their other tribes just as much as they were attacking outsiders. When they investigated further they met &lt;a href=\"Warug\"&gt;Warug&lt;/a&gt;, who told them of the origins of the centaur and Theradras's recent actions. The Horde united with Warug and his &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt;, who held no loyalty to Theradras unlike the other clans, to suppress the other tribes. They then entered Maraudon and slew Theradras. Their victory halted the spreading corruption in Desolace and stopped the violent bloodlust in the centaur. With the Horde's blessing, the Magram became the leaders of the united centaur and led them to an age of tranquility. Yet none knew how long they would stay on the path of peace.\nCataclysm.\nAreas affected by the Cataclysm:\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the death of &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; ventured to Desolace in order to end her life because of the loss of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; and how evidence seemed to indicate he was a traitor working with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. However Thrall, thanks to receiving a vision of Korialstrasz's final moments, realized the truth and was able to share it with Alexstrasza. Thus by this act Alexstrasza gained new hope and the will to live once more.\nAftermath.\nAt some point, the centaur clans united under High Khan &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt; who served a &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;new elemental&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; came here to deal with the new leader as well as to free orc slaves near Maraudon.\nThe ship \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\" came to Desolate to trade with the &lt;a href=\"Grimtail%20clan\"&gt;Grimtail clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s as well as to visit the hidden &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Desolace in order to speak with the centaur about Azeroth.\nGeography.\nDesolace is a gray, rocky wasteland littered with bones. It seems almost under a supernatural curse, its skies always black and stormy, with lightning and high winds a constant within the interior. Pools of yellow, polluted water cover the landscape.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grimtail%20clan\"&gt;Grimtail clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Cackle\"&gt;Cackle&lt;/a&gt; live in Desolace It contains a forest area known as the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Forest\"&gt;Last Forest&lt;/a&gt; where the Grimtail gnolls, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; of Old Ironhoof and some scattered &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and nomadic &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; tribes make their home. There is also a busy but isolated trading post and port named &lt;a href=\"Flayers%27%20Point\"&gt;Flayers' Point&lt;/a&gt; that used to be a skinning camp. The destination isn't on any map.\nThe mountainous barriers of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; lie to the north and &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to the south and southeast, isolating Desolace from much of the rest of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The grasslands and mesas of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; stand directly east, and the land runs rugged and open to the storm-tossed coast to the west. The winds create waterspouts against the lowland hills along the shore. The western coastline of Desolace is lush in sad contrast to the wasteland of its interior, with the airy inn of &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; allowing travelers to wake up to a beautiful view of the waterline.\nCentral to any study of the geography of Desolace are the four centaur tribes. The smallest and least influential of these is the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt; whose ancestral grounds lie along the eastern mountains. Not far south of the Kolkar are the &lt;a href=\"Magram\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt; tribe whose yurts and pavilions are haphazardly scattered among acrid pools of brackish water near the juncture of the eastern and southern ranges. Just west of the road leading from Feralas, not far from the coast are the &lt;a href=\"Gelkis\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt;. The Gelkis centaur inhabit a large ravine and surrounding environs. A cave entrance in the rocky cliff face can only be accessed by crossing a treacherous rope bridge and houses the Gelkis leadership. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Maraudine\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt; tribe inhabit the canyons and cliffs pinched between the coast of the Veiled Sea to the west and the &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Graveyard\"&gt;Kodo Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The entrance to dreaded &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; lies in the heart of Maraudine territory.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.\"&gt;Venture Co.&lt;/a&gt; know, it is often the most dire situations and environments which present the richest opportunities, and so there are a few neutral quests they offer for those willing to do some legwork for them. Hunting in Desolace is both challenging and profitable, with potential prey including &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s and powerful &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"vulture\"&gt;vulture&lt;/a&gt;s. Those brave or foolhardy enough who seek an even greater challenge can also hunt giants and the various otherworldly monsters which inhabit the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;-infested &lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe surrounding mountains form a significant barrier to travel, a key reason why the centaur have never established more than a sporadic presence elsewhere on Kalimdor.\nThe centaur-inhabited &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; is a 5-man instance located in this zone. No other dungeons, micro dungeons, or battlegrounds can be found here.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D34\"&gt;Topographic map of Desolace&lt;/a&gt;\nTravel hubs.\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point\"&gt;Nijel's Point&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Thargad%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Thargad's Camp&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Furien%27s%20Post\"&gt;Furien's Post&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Karnum%27s%20Glade\"&gt;Karnum's Glade&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nDesolace is home to several characters of note. At Ghost Walker Post, &lt;a href=\"Maurin%20Bonesplitter\"&gt;Maurin Bonesplitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Takata%20Steelblade\"&gt;Takata Steelblade&lt;/a&gt; seek aid in the battle against the Burning Blade. In Shadowprey Village, &lt;a href=\"Taiga%20Wisemane\"&gt;Taiga Wisemane&lt;/a&gt; attempts to cleanse the demonic taint that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; has brought with it. And at Nijel's Point, &lt;a href=\"Kreldig%20Ungor\"&gt;Kreldig Ungor&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers to the wide corners of the land in search of mystical items and treasure. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; used to wander these lands with his bear companion &lt;a href=\"Misha\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened.\nOther inhabitants.\nIn addition to the centaur, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cultists maintain an extensive presence in Desolace, with their outposts of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Axe%20Fortress\"&gt;Thunder Axe Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowbreak%20Ravine\"&gt;Shadowbreak Ravine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an extensive demonic infestation, particularly in the areas of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sargeron\"&gt;Sargeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth the Alliance and the Horde have started occupying Desolace, with the Horde constructing two notable settlements: the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s established &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; on the western coast and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; have established &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Walker%20Post\"&gt;Ghost Walker Post&lt;/a&gt; on the hills above the &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Graveyard\"&gt;Kodo Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. An Alliance town has been built at &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point\"&gt;Nijel's Point&lt;/a&gt; among the night elven ruins, deep within the mountain ridge to the north that separates Desolace from the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; region.\nThe relative success of the Horde's expansion into Desolace has raised a number of concerns throughout the political elites of both Kalimdor and Azeroth, but particularly among the Alliance. These concerns stem mainly from the fact that the Horde's colonization appears to be proceeding seemingly unhindered by the extensive presence of the Burning Blade cult. Allegations have emerged that the Horde has forged an agreement of sorts with the cultists. Determined to dispel these allegations and demonstrate to the Alliance that the Horde no longer consorts with demons, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has commanded &lt;a href=\"Keldran\"&gt;Keldran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to take any steps necessary to remove the Burning Blade from the region.\nQuests.\n\"See also &lt;a href=\"Desolace%20storyline\"&gt;Desolace storyline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Desolace%20storyline%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Desolace storyline (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; for a summary of the quests in this zone.\" \nQuesting in Desolace usually takes place between levels 30-35. Some notable quests in the area include a series of quests to befriend one of the centaur clans, accomplished first by killing their enemies and then by performing quests for them.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nLegends claim that the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; are descendants of a dark union between one of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;'s sons and a princess of the chaotic &lt;a href=\"Elemental%23Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. When the first &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s were born of their union, it is said that they murdered their father, for shame of their misshapen appearance. They were born filled with rage and savagery and have not calmed in the centuries that followed. The first of their kind, the first khans, gave rise to the five tribes of the centaur. The race swept across Desolace and soon became legendary for its brutality. The diligent &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; held them in check for ages until the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; rained its destruction upon the world. The night elves left the centaur out of necessity for their own survival during the wars, allowing the twisted race to assume control of Desolace. Though fortunate enough not to be scorched into oblivion in the demon wars, Desolace was savaged nonetheless due to the centaur's ceaseless aggression. No longer threatened by night elves, the tribes plagued other plains races - chiefly, the peaceful tauren. This struggle endured for generations until recently, when the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; were at last driven from Desolace. The centaur were never content with controlling just Desolace and have followed their tribal khans in a series of clashes with other races throughout southern and central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mountainous barriers of the Stonetalons lie to the north and Thousand Needles to the southeast, isolating Desolace from much of the rest of Kalimdor.

Five barbarous centaur tribes dominate the entire region with the strength of overwhelming numbers and unequaled ferocity. Each tribe is led by one of the dreaded khans and is known by a distinctive tribal color - Black, Brown, Green, Red, and Yellow. Members use the color to mark their weapons and their faces. The khans who lead each tribe rarely have contact with each other except in times of war. There are no other cultures of any note in all of Desolace, for the centaur have run them all down in their unceasing lust for conquest. The only animals that can sustain themselves in the arid and violent land were beasts such as lions, raptors, sand serpents, and harpies.\nThere's a &lt;a href=\"demon%20cult\"&gt;demon cult&lt;/a&gt; here called the &lt;a href=\"Marapor\"&gt;Marapor&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

An Alliance town has been built at &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point\"&gt;Nijel's Point&lt;/a&gt; among the night elven ruins, deep within the mountain ridge to the north that separates Desolace from the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; region.\nThe relative success of the Horde's expansion into Desolace has raised a number of concerns throughout the political elites of both Kalimdor and Azeroth, but particularly among the Alliance. These concerns stem mainly from the fact that the Horde's colonization appears to be proceeding seemingly unhindered by the extensive presence of the Burning Blade cult. Allegations have emerged that the Horde has forged an agreement of sorts with the cultists. Determined to dispel these allegations and demonstrate to the Alliance that the Horde no longer consorts with demons, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has commanded &lt;a href=\"Keldran\"&gt;Keldran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to take any steps necessary to remove the Burning Blade from the region.\nQuests.\nQuesting in Desolace usually takes place between levels 30-40. Some notable quests in the area include a series of quests to befriend one of the centaur clans, accomplished first by killing their enemies and then by performing quests for them."}

This time, you're to bring back yet more demon parts. And nothing neat and clean like claws and horns, either. Leftwitch wants brains, wings, and blood. \nHaving done everything else to collect items for Leftwitch's order, Kreldig asks the adventurer to take the package back to &lt;a href=\"Roetten%20Stonehammer\"&gt;Roetten Stonehammer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Karnitol Shipwreck.\nOne of Kreldig's tasks is to recover a chest for a Stormwind mage named Karnitol. Apparently, his ship was attacked by sea giants, and his belongings were lost.\nAfter finding the empty chest at Ethel Rethor's coast, the adventurer returns to Kreldig for further instructions.\nKreldig suspects that Karnitol's satchel's might be in the ocean with a naga tribe, and he sends the adventurer to look for it there. \nVahlarriel's Search.\nVahlarriel is a night elf who is investigating the disappearrence of two missing nobles of a Darnassian merchant family: &lt;a href=\"Tyranis%20Malem\"&gt;Tyranis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalinda%20Malem\"&gt;Dalinda&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"House%20Malem\"&gt;House Malem&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn his first quest, Vahlarriel asks the adventurer to investigate the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Tyranis%20Malem\"&gt;Tyranis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalinda%20Malem\"&gt;Dalinda&lt;/a&gt;'s wagon, that was last seen near the road to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter finding the destroyed wagon without any corpses, the adventurer returns to Vahlarriel to report his findings.

She them asks the adventurer to find her brother, who, according to her, had recently begun craving for arcane knowledge.

In the end of the quest, the adventurer hands &lt;a href=\"Tyranis%20Malem\"&gt;Tyranis&lt;/a&gt;' necklace to his sister and explains about his corruption.\nFinally, the adventurer escorts &lt;a href=\"Dalinda%20Malem\"&gt;Dalinda&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Axe%20Fortress\"&gt;Thunder Axe Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and them returns to Vahlarriel to conclude his mission.\nOther quests.\nThis quest is part of a chain that starts in &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stormwind's Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Crowley\"&gt;Brother Crowley&lt;/a&gt;. Crowley sends the adventurer to meet &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Anton\"&gt;Brother Anton&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Scarlet Crusade situated in &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point\"&gt;Nijel's Point&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the undead presence in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Valley of Bones&lt;/a&gt;. After killing some skeletons for Anton, the adventurer receives a recommendation letter and is sent to Southshore to continue his efforts against the undead.\nHorde storyline.\nGhost Walker Post.\nAlliance relations.\nThis quest chain starts in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, but is mainly done in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe corrupter.\nThis chain can be started by acquiring a &lt;a href=\"Flayed%20Demon%20Skin\"&gt;Flayed Demon Skin&lt;/a&gt;, dropped in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Axe%20Fortress\"&gt;Thunder Axe Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe adventurer can retrieve the demon skin to &lt;a href=\"Maurin%20Bonesplitter\"&gt;Maurin Bonesplitter&lt;/a&gt; in Ghost Walker Post to uncover the nature of some mysterious red markings in it. &lt;a href=\"Maurin%20Bonesplitter\"&gt;Maurin&lt;/a&gt; explains that it is a demonic language similar to the Eredun language, and he recognizes a demon signature from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Azrethoc\"&gt;Lord Azrethoc&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, this is the main demon guiding the Burning Blade's activity in the area.\nMaurin requests a scalp from a specific type of satyr in Desolace: the &lt;a href=\"Hatefury%20Shadowstalker\"&gt;hatefury shadowstalker&lt;/a&gt;. He explains that it will work as a reagent to find &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Azrethoc\"&gt;Lord Azrethoc&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, Maurin requests the next reagent: a &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Crystal\"&gt;Oracle Crystal&lt;/a&gt; from the local &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; naga. At the end of the quest, Maurin is able to summon a vision of a Burning Blade warlock (Jugkar Grim'rod) and his master: &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Azrethoc\"&gt;Lord Azrethoc&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaurin instructs the adventurer to talk to Takata Steelblade, an orc blademaster in Ghost Walker Post, in order to prepare for the confrontation against the demon.\nIn the final part of this chain, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Azrethoc\"&gt;Lord Azrethoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jugkar%20Grim%27rod\"&gt;Jugkar Grim'rod&lt;/a&gt; are defeated in &lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeutral.\nGoblin quests.\nThe goblin Smeed is interested in taming some kodos with his kodo kombulator: a device that rejuvenates and tames aged kodo.\nThe Gizelton brothers are goblins caravan travelers that roam through Desolace. In two distinct spots, they offer a quest for adventurer's willing to aid the protection of their kodo caravan.\nThe goblin &lt;a href=\"Hornizz%20Brimbuzzle\"&gt;Hornizz Brimbuzzle&lt;/a&gt; is looking for adventures willing to collect some ghost energy with his ghost-o-plasm magnet. For this purpose, he directs the adventurer to the Valley of Bones, where Magram ghosts reside.\nApparently kodo bones are valuable trade items, and Bibbly F'utzbuckle needs some help collecting them. She wants to sell them to a caravan that often resell them at &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Melizza%20Brimbuzzle\"&gt;Melizza Brimbuzzle&lt;/a&gt; can be found trapped by the Maraudine centaur in the Valley of Spears. She came to do business with them, but they were more interested in cooking her. The adventurer can free her and grab a reward with her brother, &lt;a href=\"Hornizz%20Brimbuzzle\"&gt;Hornizz Brimbuzzle&lt;/a&gt;.\nEthel Rethor.\nAzore Aldamort.\n&lt;a href=\"Azore%20Aldamort\"&gt;Azore Aldamort&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; archmage interested in recovering artifacts in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. In his first quest, he asks the adventurer to venture the Burning Blade's Thunder Axe Fortress to recover a naga magical weapon: the Sceptre of Light.\nOn his second quest, Aldamort trusts the adventurer the posession of the &lt;a href=\"Gem%20of%20the%20Serpent\"&gt;Gem of the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;] to summon the naga who is protecting the Book of the Ancients, a tome that he wants to pass over to the Argent Dawn's council protection.\nUlysses Rackmore.\nThe adventurer can find Ulysses Rackmore's &lt;a href=\"Rackmore%27s%20Log\"&gt;logbook&lt;/a&gt; along the coast of Ethel Rethor, in which we will describe how to open his chest in &lt;a href=\"Ranazjar%20Isle\"&gt;Ranazjar Isle&lt;/a&gt;. In order to do so, it is required a golden and a silver key, which can be dropped from local makrura and naga.\nCentaur quests.\nThe adventurer can decide which centaur clan he will be alligned to in Desolace: the Gelkis (&lt;a href=\"Strange%20Alliance\"&gt;Strange Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20Alliance\"&gt;Gelkis Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) or the Magram (&lt;a href=\"Brutal%20Politics\"&gt;Brutal Politics&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Magram%20Alliance\"&gt;Magram Alliance&lt;/a&gt;). Starting those quests, in either Nijel's Point or Ghost Walker Post, adventurer's will unlock more quests to gain more reputation with their preffered clan.\nGelkis.\nAfter hearing whispers of the adventurer's name, the Uthek requests ten &lt;a href=\"Crude%20Charm\"&gt;crude charm&lt;/a&gt; from the Kolkar Clan.\nIn his next mission, Uthek wants to steal some supplies from the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, &lt;a href=\"Uthek%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Uthek&lt;/a&gt; requests the adventurer to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; in order to retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Draenethyst%20Crystal\"&gt;draenethyst crystal&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Draenei\"&gt;broken draenei&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Ongeku\"&gt;Ongeku&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was established by its leader &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Vellcinda&lt;/a&gt;. It was also a response to the strict culture of the Forsaken that stated there was no need to remember their previous life, as well as a response to Sylvanas' coercion to force the undead to continue their lives in undeath.\nIt consisted of its leader the Prime Governor who along with four other governing councilors made up the Governors. Below them were the seven Ministers who implemented the policies handed down to them. Finally, there were ten Listeners who went out every day to poll &lt;a href=\"Commoner\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt; of the Undercity on needs, opinions, and concerns that needed attention. They governed from the same room as Sylvanas, the throne room of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; some councilors were killed by &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s on orders of Sylvanas after some tried to defect after &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; revealed herself, though others who were in the process of returning to Sylvanas's side were also killed to the point that even &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was surprised by Sylvanas's actions. There were members who were spared from the slaughter as they had returned before the Gathering began as their living family and friends refused at the last minute to see them. Sylvanas remarked that they are now truly desolate and that she trusts them. Following the event, the Alliance buried the deceased in a &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Highlands%20Mill\"&gt;Highlands Mill&lt;/a&gt; within the Arathi Highlands. The deaths of the majority of their members including their Prime Governor, Vellcinda, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;political shift&lt;/a&gt; of the Forsaken and overall &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; left the fate of the council uncertain.\nIn light of how poorly Sylvanas dealt with something that wasn\u2019t complete and utter obeisance, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; opined that the council had unintentionally signed their own death warrants simply by existing as a governing body. If Sylvanas hadn't had the Gathering to use as an excuse, \"she\u2019d have done something to them sooner or later.\"\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the Forsaken reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a new Desolate Council consisting of &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; was created to lead the Forsaken.\nOne of the first topics that Calia plans on proposing to her fellow council members is the withdrawal of Forsaken troops from the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nVoss and Calia, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, served as the Forsaken delegation to the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Forsythe\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Forsythe&lt;/a&gt; seized control of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, they used it as a staging ground to strike against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Desolate Council were successfully able to launch a counterattack, where they claimed Fenris Isle and killed Forsythe. In the aftermath of the battle, the council declared that the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; represented what it means to be Forsaken.\nMeanwhile from within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt; to deliver a message to her &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, in which she declared that the Desolate Council were the Forsaken's rightful leaders and future."}

The hooded figure then instructs a henchman named Gakca to kill the masked man and contact the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Assassins%27%20Guild\"&gt;Stormwind Assassins' Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nArriving at Thunder Bluff, Broll tells Lo'Gosh there is friction between &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Magatha meets them personally as Rehgar wants a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; to replace Valeera. She disdainfully calls Cairne a pacifist and an old fool, and appears eager to provide Rehgar with &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; warriors. They would not be slaves but indentured gladiators for the orc, and she wants her warriors to be well-trained and battle-hardened (I sense trouble for Cairne in the future...).\nMagatha tells the party that a cave &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; has been loosed inside the Pools of Vision and chased all the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; out. Cairne is not in town.\nIn Dire Maul, Helka sends her team off to Thunder Bluff on &lt;a href=\"wyverns\"&gt;wyverns&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera rides one named Bristlefur, and her escort Tarm Grimtotem. The blood elf launches off with a kick, pretending to not know how to navigate the wyvern, and Tarm barely manages to hold on.\nValeera distracts Tarm with talk of forests and plains, then yanks Bristlefur around. The tauren is flung off, and lands on a wyvern below. Valeera steers the beast below the canopy and hides.\nAgainst Magatha's warnings, Broll and Lo'Gosh enters the Pools of Vision. Their chains are removed by the slavers who guard the entrance to the caves. The two sit down into the pools and study its waters. \nLo'Gosh sees the shadow of a fair-haired female. She reaches out to him and touches him. His vision-self seems only a few years younger. She calls him her husband and tells him his people needs him... that his son needs him. In her arms, she holds an infant boy who yells \"papa!\"\nBroll sees raging fires. His daughter yells \"An'da!\" which also means papa, in &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. There is fire everywhere, and his daughter screams for him to save her. Then she turns into Valeera, who also yells for him to help her. She reaches for him, but her hand turns to stone. In fact, it is the hand of the cave elemental, who picks Broll up one-handed. It is a huge creature, similar to the crystal &lt;a href=\"colossi\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cave elemental tries to drown Broll but he cracks its skull and blinds one of its eyes. It roars, breaking Lo'Gosh from his trance. The elemental drops Broll and is distracted by Lo'Gosh when he breaks a rock over its foot. Lo'Gosh gets picked up, and smashes another rock into a stalagmite, causing a cave-in. The giant beast gets crushed, while the humanoids get away. Lo'Gosh finally plans to escape from Rehgar in order to find his son and his people.\n&lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; is having dinner with Rehgar. Neither of them like Magatha, and Hamuul suspects the shaman of being behind the elemental. Lo'Gosh and Broll are taken to the arch druid's tent. Hamuul tells the legend of the original Lo'Gosh - a massive, white wolf-beast renowned for its ferocity in battle, 10 000 years old when the first invasion came to Azeroth. (As a creature demi-god, he can be compared to &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;). The wolf god slaughtered hundreds of demons before he fell in the invasion. But not even death could destroy his will.\nBroll continues the tale, describing the great ghostly wolf the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; call Goldrinn. He aided the night elves in Eldre'Thalas in holding their city against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, only to vanish after battle and never be seen again. Hamuul says the wolf's legend extends through Azeroth, to trolls, goblins and dwarves who all have their own version of the story. In each tale, Lo'Gosh's unyielding will and sheer ferocity enable him to push through the boundaries of the afterlife to aid his people.\nHamuul gives Lo'Gosh a feather. The warrior is sceptical of the gift, but Broll recognizes it as a magical &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; feather. The night elf uses it to call &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, and runs off with Lo'Gosh and the screaming guards in tow. Lo'Gosh cuts off the slavers by slashing the rope bridge behind him.\nMeanwhile, Valeera arrives wyvernback under the cover of night. She sees the hippogryph land and take off again with Broll and Lo'Gosh on its back. Rehgar is close by, but seems quite unperturbed that his finest warriors are escaping. While Valeera spies on him, Rehgar tells Hamuul that in a way, they were always as free as their hearts let them be. He knows Hamuul let them escape on purpose, but nevertheless sends slavers on wyverns after them.\nIn Stormwind, the cloaked blonde scryes on Lo'Gosh's flight though a glowing golden disc. Nearby stands a tall stately man with a very long golden braid, dressed in black leathers. He is the assassin sent to kill Lo'Gosh, and his work is guaranteed by the Assassins' Guild. The cloaked figure wants Lo'Gosh killed subtly so as to not draw any unwarranted attention. It's vital that his death appear natural. As they watch, a slaver knocks Lo'Gosh off Sharptalon's back to tumble through open air high above the plains of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;..."}

They are good against &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s and weak against &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nElven destroyer.\nSecond War.\nElven destroyers were powerful warships from the fleets of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Crewed with highly-skilled &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; seafarers, these swift-sailing vessels were prepared to engage the enemy wherever they might be found. Elven destroyers constituted a critical part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; naval defense force as they could unleash their firepower upon dreaded aerial forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; later reclaimed a few destroyers, the ones that were reclaimed receiving new red sails instead of the classical blue with a &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; image.\nElven destroyers of the trireme hull type employ \"junk sails\" in a \"schooner rig\". This sail configuration is characterized by good windward handling and generally good speed across all sailing points (but less from running with the wind). This is consistent with the idea that the elven destroyer is a fast, highly maneuverable warship.\nMany ruined older elven destroyers could be found in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". With \"\", an intact blood elven destroyer could be found anchored in &lt;a href=\"Sunsail%20Anchorage\"&gt;Sunsail Anchorage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, amidst the wreckage of the high elven destroyers of old. More and more ships were then added later.\nNotable elven destroyers.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;:\nTroll destroyer.\nSecond War.\nThe troll destroyers (also known as wave riders) were swift, ill-visaged longboats designed to cut through enemy armadas and deal damage to enemy vessels and their flying support. The savage &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; crewmen were eager to enter into combat against &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ships of war and hungrily awaited any chance to stand mast to mast against the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Destroyer%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;elven destroyers&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSmall canoe-like troll ships appear in ' and ', seemingly inspired by them, but much smaller and unarmed. Large ships belonging to &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;'s war fleet seen at &lt;a href=\"Stormsea%20Landing\"&gt;Stormsea Landing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Isle of Giants&lt;/a&gt; seem to be based on a similar design, though mainly built for transport. The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt; has both troll destroyers and troll &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHuman destroyer.\nHuman destroyers (also known as icebreakers) are massive paddlewheel-driven behemoths functioning on steam power and originally built to get through the icy waters of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. To accomplish this they have a ram similar to a &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can be seen at &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Bay\"&gt;Venture Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Strand%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Strand of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Isle of Conquest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Highbank\"&gt;Highbank&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible that the steam powerplant and paddlewheel system for these ships had, at the very least, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; technical expertise in their design, as both races have considerable experience with steam power.\nEarly in development, they were previously reported to be called \"steamships\".\nNotable human destroyers.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;:\n, Alliance:\nOrc destroyer.\nOrc destroyers are small spiked craft. These ships have also been called \"gunships\", though that name normally refers to the &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;flying crafts&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wayward%20Landing\"&gt;Wayward Landing&lt;/a&gt; was an area, removed from the beta stage of \"Mists of Pandaria\", that was under attack by Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Grothok%20Blackcrag\"&gt;Grothok Blackcrag&lt;/a&gt;, who had the title \"Destroyer Captain\".\nNotable orc destroyers.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;:\n, Horde:\n, Iron Horde:\n, pirates:\nArakkoa destroyer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; were known to have at least a destroyer, \"\". It was a powerful ship with large &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, able to counter both &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s. Both Alliance and Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;commanders&lt;/a&gt; could buy its allegiance.\nIn the RPG.\nElven destroyers are heavy, iron-clad &lt;a href=\"warship\"&gt;warship&lt;/a&gt;s that can quickly carry a half-dozen heavy &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; to any point on a coastline and bombard a target into submission. The destroyer moves at 20 miles per hour and has a crew of 7 (1 pilot and 6 gunners)."}

Breaking free of the obsidian stone that holds them, these monstrous creatures roar into battle, swallowing magic to feed their insatiable hunger as they move between battles and rain destruction down upon their foes. Has Spell Immunity. Attacks land and air units.\nInformation.\nDestroyers are aerial units who specialize in destroying enemy spellcasters by denying the enemy buffs or summoned units in battle.\nIn order to create Destroyers, Undead players must first research the \"Destroyer Form\" technology. This allows &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Statue%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Obsidian Statues&lt;/a&gt; to morph into Destroyers, costing an additional 100 gold, 50 wood, and 2 food. Essentially, every Destroyer costs 300 gold, 85 wood, and 5 food.\nDue to their thirst for mana, Destroyers rapidly lose mana, making the Obsidian Statue's Spirit Touch and natural regeneration from Fountains of Mana useless. In order to obtain mana, the Destroyer needs to consume enemy buffs or allied debuffs. Players may alternatively have the Destroyer siphon mana from a friendly unit, but this is seldom used because the of the Destroyer's high mana pool, which would result in draining &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Banshees&lt;/a&gt; and your Heroes of a considerable amount of mana.\nThe mana is vital for their Orb of Annihilation spell, as it allows the Destroyer's attacks to have AoE properties and also inflicts more damage. However, it's high mana cost combined with the Destroyer's negative mana regeneration means they require a high amount of enemy spellcasters to truly shine in battle. When consuming magic, allow for one or two Destroyers to focus on a targeted area to prevent competition and allow your Destroyers to reel in the full benefits of Devour Magic, while keeping enemy buffs and summoned units at a minimum (it takes two Devour Magic casts to kill summoned skeletons).\nGenerally, one or two Destroyers are needed when playing alone, but in team matches three or four of them may prove useful depending if the enemy team is running spellcasters. Destroyers have a fairly fast attack rate and have high armor as an aerial unit. However, they are not fairly strong otherwise, being similar to &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dragonhawk Riders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Dragon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Faerie Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, and thus it's generally not recommended to have Destroyers as the core of your army.\nSpells and abilities.\nevour Magic.\nDevour Magic does not give health or mana when a player devours friendly buffs. Devour Magic dispels the owl summoned by a &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Huntress&lt;/a&gt; but will not restore the Destroyer's health and mana. It will not dispel an anti-magic shell created by a &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Banshee&lt;/a&gt; but will still restore health and mana."}

The vast majority of these made haste for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the south, slipping away through the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. A pursuit was immediately organized by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, who had now assumed command of the united &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army after &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s demise. Their goal, however, was not necessarily to catch these stragglers. The exact location of the portal to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; (from which the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had launched its invasion seven years ago) still remained unknown to the Alliance's leadership. Thus, Turalyon hoped to follow the fleeing remnants of Doomhammer's army right to the unholy gateway itself.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; largely took command of the shattered Horde remnants following the defeat at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He and his forces eventually reached the Dark Portal, where the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; was already waiting, the protection and preservation of the gateway having been given to them before the war started. But with Doomhammer's defeat, the orcs were milling about before the portal, separated in their own small warbands and clans instead of acting like an organized army.\nThe pursuing Alliance eventually fell upon them. It was a bloody battle. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; was routed and ultimately destroyed by troops under the command of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, while Turalyon led the charge to the stairs leading to the Dark Portal, dueling &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; there.\nThe Alliance finally succeeded in destroying the dark gateway, with the remaining &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and death knights fleeing into the wilds of Azeroth or slipping back to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The destruction of the Dark Portal would mark the end of the Second War in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Draenor.\nBack on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Portal was watched over by orc guards among which &lt;a href=\"Brodog\"&gt;Brodog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gratar\"&gt;Gratar&lt;/a&gt;. Since nothing ever happened besides couriers and messengers sometimes passing news back to their homeworld, such as about &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s victory against &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, the post was considered boring and the guards spent their days playing &lt;a href=\"dice\"&gt;dice&lt;/a&gt;s. But as the Alliance launched its assault against the Azerothian portal, it shimmered and became more translucent, allowing the Draenic orcs to witness the battle. They rushed to call their leaders, and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt; themselves arrived to witness the last moments of the human assault.\nAs orc &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; began retreating through the portal, Ner'zhul interrogated one of them, who revealed himself as &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;. The Elder Shaman was baffled to learn of everything that had happened during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and cried out when he realized &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; was about to destroy the Dark Portal. Ner'zhul rushed toward the gateway, before getting caught in its destruction. He was wounded, but Dentarg saved him and brought him back for healing.\nOne of the retreating orcs, presumably a member of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; returning from the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, carried the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; with him, after having taken it from a &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; who had himself escaped from the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The warrior was later in turn killed by &lt;a href=\"Hurkan%20Skullsplinter\"&gt;Hurkan Skullsplinter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer&lt;/a&gt; chieftain."}

To open one, simply log onto your Battle.net account and add a trial. Then log into WoW as normal - you will be asked which account (your paid or trial) you want to play under. \nYou do not need to download a new copy of WoW to play on trial if you already have a game client installed. \nLimitation.\nWith the Mists of Panderia 10-day trial, you \"cannot level to 86\". You can gain XP at level 85, but the XP bar will stop one XP shy of 86. You may want to consider stopping questing when you get to that point until you get around to buying the expansion, because when you turn in quests you will be credited with finishing and get the rewards but you will \"not\" get the XP."}

In time an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Emissary\"&gt;Emissary&lt;/a&gt; arrived from &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; who ordered the expedition to return to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Lord Uther&lt;/a&gt; had persuaded him to do so. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Luc%20Valonforth\"&gt;Captain Luc Valonforth&lt;/a&gt;, in order to avoid the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, ordered the expedition forces to cut their way through the woods in order to reach their ships. As the men began chopping their way through the words Captain Valonforth enlightened the Prince to their new orders. Knowing that he needed his men in order to slay Mal'Ganis, Arthas and a reluctant Muradin ventured forth to burn the ships in order to keep the men by his side. By the time the expeditionary forces finished cutting through the forest, the last of their ships were burning and with Prince Arthas before them. Arthas quickly blamed the mercenaries (who he had hired) for burning the ships and led the expeditionary forces against them himself.\nAfter that, the First Legion accompanied Arthas to defeat Mal'Ganis. Arthas and Muradin went with a group to obtain the runesword &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas returned with the bad news that Muradin died, but that they were able to obtain the sword.\nAfter Arthas finally destroyed the dreadlord, the prince along with Froustmourne disappeared into the frozen wastes, leaving the First Legion stranded in Northrend; during that wait, food was scarce and the cold was fierce; In the midst of that, the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun Flamebeard&lt;/a&gt; took command of the original expedition of Muradin's dwarves and they parted ways with the 1st Legion and subsequently venturing into the broken kingdom of Azjol-Nerub.\nCaptain Falric went to find Arthas but did not return. Arthas slaughtered him and turned him into a death knight. Afterward, &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; slaughtered &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently Arthas wiped out the majority of the First Legion. Apparently continuing without their leader, the 1st Legion forces made it to Icecrown after their prince became a death knight, and it was there that they met their end. Two soldiers, &lt;a href=\"Orik%20Trueheart\"&gt;Orik Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"William%20Allerton\"&gt;William Allerton&lt;/a&gt;, managed to escape.\nAfterward, &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; became the first home of the lucky few who survived Arthas' betrayal.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Orik and William joined different forces and traveled once more to Northrend. Orik returned to the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shore%20%28Dragonblight%29\"&gt;Forgotten Shore&lt;/a&gt;, which had been the base of the First Legion during the Third War. Several souls of soldiers from the First Legion who accompanied Arthas in the past were found on the coast, these souls did not seem to know of Arthas' betrayal. Orik enlisted the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s help to free the souls from their torment.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes had to face the &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s of members of the 1st Legion.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Oni%27jus\"&gt;Oni'jus&lt;/a&gt; was one of Prince Arthas' infiltrators before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This composition's weakness largely lies in the lack of crowd control abilities (only the Mage has a silence and a spammable crowd control) and lasting power, primarily due to a Mage's more limited mana pool and inability to drain or regenerate mana as quickly.\nA popular variant of this composition called &lt;a href=\"2346\"&gt;2346&lt;/a&gt; is run with a Siphon Life/Soul Link or Felguard &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; instead of a Mage.\nLater of in Wrath of the Lich King the composition of &lt;a href=\"2346\"&gt;2346&lt;/a&gt; was run with a Destruction Warlock instead of a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;."}

Humans are a blight upon this world, and must be destroyed or driven out of Draenor.\nDwarf\nDwarves are integral to the Alliance, as they are the builders of war machines. For this reason alone they must all be slain.

After the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, he was instructed to secure the land and ultimately succeeded when he united the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBesides being served by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ilifar\"&gt;Ilifar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felcular\"&gt;Felcular&lt;/a&gt;, Razelikh was protected by a triad composed by &lt;a href=\"Grol%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Grol the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sevine\"&gt;Lady Sevine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Allistarj\"&gt;Archmage Allistarj&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowsworn\"&gt;Shadowsworn&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange for their servitude, Razelikh granted each of them nearly unlimited power within the Blasted Lands. Each of Razelikh's underlings wore a third of an amulet of Razelikh's creation around their neck. The very same amulet was needed to summon the archdemon. The amulet pieces were each attuned to the lifeforce of their owner, granting them immortality. As long as they remained within the Blasted Lands, they couldn't be slain, their life spans extended until the end of days.\nThere was only one way to harm the demon lord and his minions. A weapon of power had to be forged bearing his true name: Rakh'likh. When such a weapon is forged, the demon and all under his command are vulnerable.\nRazelikh's lair was atop the highest mountain in the Blasted Lands: the &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Rise of the Defiler&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to reach his lair is through the use of the teleport runes near the base of the mountain. Only by holding the amulet can one be transported to the peak.\nThe perilous journey took adventurers from the Blasted Lands to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; before returning them to the Blasted Lands for the final battle.\nCataclysm.\nThough his servants were slain, Razelikh remained at large. The demon hunter &lt;a href=\"Loramus\"&gt;Loramus&lt;/a&gt; sought to put an end to Razelikh but was slain by &lt;a href=\"Grol%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Grol the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, one of Razelikh's fallen servants. Adventures later revived and empowered Loramus, and the two united to battle against Razelikh. During the fight, Loramus sacrificed his own life in order to help trap Razelikh's soul, claiming he would battle Razelikh in the next world.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Knife%20of%20Sealing\"&gt;Stone Knife of Sealing&lt;/a&gt; that Loramus and Razelikh were trapped in was eventually destroyed. Razelikh's body reformed within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, but with both his and Loramus's souls trapped inside it, entwined in eternal conflict until they were summoned to Azeroth by the Burning Legion. Taking control of Razelikh's body, Loramus joined the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; on the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\". Knowing how tenuous his hold on the dreadlord's body is, Loramus remains bound in a magical prison so that when Razelikh periodically wrests control, he can do little more than threaten the Illidari.\nAt one point, the Illidari forces battled Razelikh's soul to temper their weapons.\nAttacks and abilities.\nRemoved from the game:\nTactics.\nThe battle is done single at the level quest without particular tactics.\nHe was previously level 57 elite.\nHe was immune to all &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s, to all &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; judgements, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s (all &lt;a href=\"curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"corruption\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, and also &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s from the Enchanted Azsharite Felbane weapons didn't appear to affect him, just his minions.\nDuring combat, Rakh'likh summons one of his minions, a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;, then later his champion, a &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;. Between the two, he will do a powerful knockback which have the nasty habit of knocking the &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; off the mountain. It has a five-second cast, so run away while he's charging up. If not, a quick charge can save your life. Pets are immune to the knockback, but a tank must prepare. Either the full length of the plateau (so the tank lands still on the plateau), or where there is a solid wall behind him to stop the \nflight.\nThere are two common strategies to avoid him knocking the tank off the mountain which occurs at 50% health. (In addition to potentially wiping the group, can cause the tank to miss being able to loot the &lt;a href=\"Severed%20Horn%20of%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Severed Horn of the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; if he gets knocked far enough away).\nFirst, there is a ledge below the top with the \"Rune of Return\" on it(It teleports you to . If you can pull Razelikh to that ledge, the tank can place his back against the wall, negating the knockback.\nSecondly, when Razelikh is about to perform his knockback, he shout \"Let the flames of chaos engulf you!\". At this point, all melee can simply run out of range of the channeled knockback and avoid it completely.\nIn the RPG.\nRaze\u2019likh the Defiler. Raze\u2019likh is a powerful dreadlord who has claimed the Blasted Lands as his seat, and he steadily expands his influence, corrupting some of the Horde and Alliance\u2019s best or turning them into monsters under his control. His enforcers are Allistarj, Sevine, and Grol.\nRaze\u2019likh\u2019s most dangerous power is his ability to bind the souls of the fallen to a crystal, through some wicked spell of unknown origins. This grants the person \u2014 or rather, the body \u2014 bound to the crystal near immortality, but a complete lack of free will. Raze\u2019likh has used this to begin creating an army of nigh-invulnerable guardians for his areas of interest, including the Dark Portal."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; captured the town from the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; and was using it to plan his &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt;.\nRazor Hill is the major quest hub for those continuing from &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;; after that players go to the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; arranged a summit with Thrall at Razor Hill, which was just a hill. It was, in fact, a planned ambush. However, having speculated this, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; insisted that he should go in Thrall's place. In turn, Rexxar defeated the assassins.\nFar north of the hill, an outpost containing &lt;a href=\"Gar%27Thok\"&gt;Gar'Thok&lt;/a&gt; and a barracks existed. It is speculated that the two locations were merged in lore and is the current Razor Hill. Alternatively, a new outpost could have been built on the hill.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s reign as Warchief, he had his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; soldiers stationed at this town to protect the roads between &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrimmar. When it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; survived Garrosh's assassination attempt, through attacks on his supplies in the Barrens, Garrosh sent the Kor'kron to attack and destroy &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; and all of their troll inhabitants. When the Kor'kron failed in their attack and were driven away, they began regrouping at Razor Hill where they caged up anyone not willing to work with them, orcs included. But before the Kor'kron could fortify the town Vol'jin led his own army to take control of the town and push the Kor'kron out.\nAfter this successful assault Vol'jin placed his base of operations at the &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill%20Watchtower\"&gt;Razor Hill Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; joined him and advised the troll leader to accept help from &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; the Horde, due to the blood elves and Forsaken across the seas attending to other situations.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance knowing that supplies passing between &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; had to pass through Razor set fire to the storehouses within the town. Over the course of the war, the Horde split between &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; loyalists and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries. As the Fourth War neared its end, the citizens of Razor Hill joined Saurfang in his revolution against Sylvanas. Thus with their cooperation, the Horde revolutionaries and the Alliance set up Razor Hill as their base camp from which they planned to strike at Orgrimmar. Though initially halted by Sylvanas's forces collapsing part of the canyon between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; worked together and were able to breach the canyon. With the pass free the combined armies marched out of Razor Hill towards Orgrimmar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, the undead attacked Razor Hill.\nRazor Hill was where the orcs held their first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival since their arrival to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nRazor Hill is a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-controlled town and one of the two major Horde outposts in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Its leader, &lt;a href=\"Orgnil%20Soulscar\"&gt;Orgnil Soulscar&lt;/a&gt;, is occupied with investigating the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;."}

The entry to the outside dome is an arched gap, nearly invisible to any who didn't know where to look.\nHistory.\nOriginally crafted from the same mighty vines as &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;, Razorfen Downs is the traditional capital city of the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; race. The sprawling, thorn-ridden labyrinth houses a veritable army of loyal quilboar as well as their high priests - the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Head%20tribe\"&gt;Death's Head tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; shaped most of the thorn dome, but later taught &lt;a href=\"Chugara%20Razorflank\"&gt;Chugara Razorflank&lt;/a&gt; to maintain the dome.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, agents of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;\u2014led by the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014have taken control over the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; race and turned the maze of thorns into a bastion of undead might. The &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; fought a desperate battle to reclaim their beloved city before Amnennar could spread his control across the Barrens.\nThe quilboar there were &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plagued&lt;/a&gt; and took prisoners and imprisoned them here, including &lt;a href=\"Belnistrasz\"&gt;Belnistrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Koristrasza\"&gt;Koristrasza&lt;/a&gt; arrived here to deal with the quilboars, undead, and Amnennar. Once the lich was defeated, Koristrasza stated that the Downs need to be purged, but nothing of sort was seen.\nEven after &lt;a href=\"Amnennar\"&gt;Amnennar&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at the hands of mortal heroes employed by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, the lich was not truly killed, as his phylactery remained intact. &lt;a href=\"Death%20Speaker%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Death Speaker Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt; intended to bring back his master to the realm of the living, and it was again up to mortal heroes to eliminate the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; problem within, this time once and for all.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shagtusk\"&gt;Shagtusk&lt;/a&gt; brought the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt; here in order to cleanse the cave, but they were caught by Chugara and Blackthorn who wanted to sacrifice the dryad to Amnennar. Aramar Thorne and his friends entered the Downs as well. When they encountered Blackthorn and his undead army, &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; joined the fray. While his objective was Aram's compass, he instead targeted Blackthorn. While Aram's group escaped, Reigol successfully stopped Amnennar's return.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Koristrasza and the heroes of the Alliance and Horde returned here and once again fought against the enemies. This time, Koristrasza took his phylactery away.\nAdventure Guide.\nLegends state that where the demigod Agamaggan fell, his blood gave rise to great masses of thorny vines. Many quilboar have taken up residence in the largest cluster of giant thorns, the Razorfen, which they revere as Agamaggan's resting place. Recently, scouts have reported seeing undead milling about the region, engendering fears that the dreaded Scourge may be moving to conquer Kalimdor. \nIn the RPG.\nIt was described as a quilboar fortress located in the northwestern Barrens."}
{"id": "13959", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13959", "title": "Razorfen Downs (Classic)", "text": "Razorfen Downs are the ancestral burial grounds of the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;, nestled amid huge brambles in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, on the east side of the far southern edge. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; have taken over much of the downs, and infest the burial grounds with the reawakened dead. It is also known as RFD, not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"RFK\"&gt;RFK&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"BFD\"&gt;BFD&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuest guide.\nThe Extinguishing the Idol quest must be started with care to get all party members on it. All party members must accept and turn in the first quest before the second quest is started. In a random LFD group this is often difficult to coordinate.\nGeneral notes.\nRazorfen Downs has a more menacing atmosphere than many lower level instances before it due to the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Loot here is valuable and useful but you can expect a workout in order to get it. If you are between levels 42-45, have a group of people you trust, a couple hours or so to spare and are looking for a more intense fight than what you will normally experience below level 45, chances are you will enjoy this instance.\nAs a result of being taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the mobs populating Razorfen Downs are predominantly &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; ability &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt; shines here as a staple form of &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;. The earlier &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; mob groups usually consist of one &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; caster (Geomancer or Necromancer) and several &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; tanks (Withered Warriors and Reavers). Another strategy is to have the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; the Death's Head Necromancer and use the mob's version of &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt; against the nearby &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; tanks just before the caster dies. The group only needs to worry about interrupting the &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; battle.\nAlso of note are the various patrols of weak skeletons and non-elite mobs in the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Spiral of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. These can easily be taken care of with AoE. Be sure to communicate your intent with the group when pulling mobs and your AoEers appropriately. In &lt;a href=\"Tuten%27kash\"&gt;Tuten'kash&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber, or \"the gong room,\" there are mobs straight ahead to the right and left. The sharp angle of the left wall may obscure your vision of these mobs, so either scout ahead or remember to tackle this left mob group first. Pulling the right mob group without handling the left may result in &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s and eventually a wipe.\nDeeper into the dungeon (the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Spiral of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;), the mobs change to a banshee and skeleton type. The banshees are casters with silence, so plan your anti-caster attack accordingly. Further in still are skeletal summoners who, if allowed to cast, will summon non-elite shadowcasters to attack you. Close to the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20of%20Thorns\"&gt;Spiral of Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, you may come across what looks like a passable shortcut, but is not. It is possible to take the right fork (toward the banshee/skeleton types) and deal with that side first before heading for the left fork and the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; types. This means you will fight &lt;a href=\"Glutton\"&gt;Glutton&lt;/a&gt; first followed by &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt;, which may be desirable if time is a significant factor."}

{"id": "20226", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20226", "title": "Razorgore the Untamed", "text": "Razorgore the Untamed is a &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the first boss of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;. He has been tasked by the lord of Blackwing Lair, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, with guarding the numerous and precious &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; eggs located in the first room of the instance. To this end, Razergore has been given command of a cohort of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and other forces, and will stop at nothing to ensure that no harm comes to his grave charges.\nOverview.\nThe very first room of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Garrison\"&gt;Dragonmaw Garrison&lt;/a&gt; (also called the Egg Chamber). To progress beyond this room, the raid must first defeat Razorgore.\nThe raid should be well equipped with &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; gear at least. The main damage from Razorgore is fire damage, thus the tanks should balance their gear well - they do need some fire resistance gear (but not all-out FR gear, because this impairs their ability to kite). Other raid members can also benefit from FR gear (esp. those dealing with the mages), but nobody should gimp himself too much just for fire resistance.\nThis encounter consists of three phases:\nDuring Phase 1 the orcish orb controller, &lt;a href=\"Grethok%20the%20Controller\"&gt;Grethok the Controller&lt;/a&gt;, and his two &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Guardsman\"&gt;Blackwing Guardsmen&lt;/a&gt; are dealt with. On the pull a timer starts, at the end of which adds will start to spawn (phase 2). If the controller and his guards are dead before the timer expires, the raid will have a short phase out of combat at the end of phase 1. The &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Orb of Domination&lt;/a&gt; should be used right away to control Razorgore, else he will attack the raid. The controlled Razorgore is used to destroy all the eggs in the room.\nIn Phase 2, adds spawn in the rooms corners until 40 orcs (&lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Legionnaire\"&gt;Blackwing Legionnaire&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Mage\"&gt;Blackwing Mage&lt;/a&gt;s combined) and 12 &lt;a href=\"Death%20Talon%20Dragonspawn\"&gt;Death Talon Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; are present. If some adds are killed, new ones will spawn to replace them. This phase ends when all the eggs in the room are destroyed, at which point all adds flee and Razorgore heals himself to full health. If Razorgore runs out of health before all of the eggs are destroyed, he will unleash a massive attack that instantly kills all units in the room (players and creatures), and resets the room.\nThe objective of Phase 3 is to kill Razorgore. Hopefully enough of the raid survived phase 2 to bring him down...\nAbilities.\nWhile mind-controlled, Razorgore exposes these abilities to the controlling player, listed using their default hotkey:\nWhile not mind-controlled, Razorgore can also cast:\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, a large dragon egg is present in the center of the room that will hatch into an &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Chromatic%20Drake\"&gt;Unstable Chromatic Drake&lt;/a&gt; after ten eggs are destroyed. The drake must be off-tanked, and will spit various elemental effects around the room.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nThis is a quick and dirty fight. Aggroing this mob also aggroes Razorgore, so this phase needs to be completed as quickly as possible. The controller has a mind control ability, so kill him first. CCing his guards is not a good idea because it takes too much time; better tank them, some raids even use AoE. The faster these three are dead the better. When this is done, have someone take control of the controlling orb.\nPhase 2.\nThe following general strategy works best for raids while learning this encounter. There are variations possible (like using fear, or Razorgore's firebolt cluster), but the general idea mostly remains the same.\nThree types of adds.\nIn the room corners are two spawn points each (the little \"rooms\" which are lower than the normal floor). From these points, up to 52 adds spawn rather quickly, but randomly. The types of adds and how they should be dealt with are:\nAll adds have initial aggro on the Razorgore controller. The mage types will run to the center of the room and start to attack the controller with their ranged fireballs - this must not happen.\nSince the number of adds is limited (12 dragonkin and 40 orcs), killing only the mages will eventually lead to a room full of melee orcs and dragonkin.\nCorner groups.\nIt's a good idea to set up at least one 5 players group (consisting of rogues, mages and warlocks) to watch each corner and kill the mages spawning there. Have an assist target set up in each corner group.\nControlling Razorgore.\nWhen controlled, Razorgore has the following abilities:\nPet controlling classes must dismiss their pets if they are to control Razorgore!\nIt is a good idea to have the MT or at least some \"hard\" class (warrior, paladin or feral druid) control him, because Razorgore will have an infinite amount of aggro on his former controller in Phase 3. Controlling Razorgore is a channeled effect which regularly wears off after 90 seconds. The \"destroy egg\" ability has a cooldown of 1.5 sec, so it is possible to destroy twenty of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon%20Egg\"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; in a single control period. Beyond this, Razorgore has a fire ball volley, and the ability to sleep dragonkin.\nIt can help to position Razorgore away from the orb near the end of the control periods, so he cannot immediately attack the controller. Do not double-click the orb. If you do that you will get the mind exhaustion debuff which means that you can't control him and someone else will need to take over. The boss will be loose while this happens and that's bad. If you want to end a control period early, the /dance emote (or repeatedly hitting ) is an appropriate method.\nIf the sleep dragonkin ability is to be used, a dedicated assist for this purpose should be set up. This person keeps a lookout for loose dragonkin, and targets them. The Razorgore controller can then assist and sleep while waiting for the destroy egg cooldown. There appears to be no cap on the number of dragons he can sleep, so a skilled controller can take as many as four dragonkin out of the fight.\nIf Razorgore dies before this phase is complete, he will produce a large death explosion which will kill everything in the room. Well-timed &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;s will save a death and enable wipe recovery, though the run back is short.\nHealing.\nAll healing classes should be used to heal because healing aggro is the reason for most wipes here. Since it is impossible to establish solid aggro on 52 mobs, healers must be extremely cautious. In order to distribute healing aggro as much as possible, use shield all the time, and ranked-down heals (and healing stream totems if available), and take care to heal as many different targets as possible. Wipes usually happen because some healer draws healing aggro and gets killed, then the other healers have to heal more, and get aggro in turn. Alternatively, the wipe happens when a kiter dies (because he didn't get healed enough), and his train then turns on the healers.\nAvoid the use of HoTs; their frequent ticks are more likely to cause the caster to the threat-lead as adds join the fight. Conveniently, however, Power Word: Shield has a reduced threat per hp shielded, in addition to a threat gain on application. This spell applied to kiters before they enter combat is very threat-efficient.\nKiting.\nWhen kiting the adds, it is important to gain a speed advantage over them. Hunters have their speed increase buff, while warriors have an AoE slowdown debuff. Dragonkin are immune to the latter, they also ignore the effect of stoneclaw totem. Thus if warriors kite dragonkin, they should use the platforms and stairs to gain a speed advantage. The trick is to jump off the platforms, because the mobs will not jump, but instead run down the nearest ramp. The kiter should then run across the room up the opposite ramp, wait on the platform, and jump off when the chase is within 5-10 yards. The pause is important because if they run too fast, the mobs will not run up the platform but instead take the shortcut. Next run back to first ramp, run up, and repeat - this leads to a \"figure 8\" pattern. During this whole time the kiter should be spamming demoralizing shout (or use scatter shot) to hold aggro. If done properly, the kiters take only little damage during this. Boots enchanted with the +speed enchant help a lot.\nIf one kiter has both mob types (dragonkin and legionnaires) in his train, slowdown effects are not a good idea, because the Dragonkin are immune, while the orcs are not, resulting in a splitting train.\nKiting with Razorgore.\nIt is possible to kite Razorgore. With his fireball volley, he can easily hold aggro on the whole room. The problem is to keep him alive, esp. the melee orcs do quadruple damage on dragons. The raid must concentrate on freezing, fearing and sleeping most of the mobs, while the healers keep Razorgore up.\nIf Razor takes too much damage, release control. In that case, the aggro is transferred from Razor to his former controller, who now can start to kite the whole room (while somebody else takes control and continues to destroy the eggs). Pay attention not to break the train in this case (avoid using fear, and don't heal).\nPhase 3.\nRazorgore alone isn't very strong and it is possible to win with two surviving tanks, 4 healers, and a few DPS, though it is obviously preferable to have more. The only difficulty is to manage his aggro, like all dragons he's immune to taunt. Fortunately his former controller is fixed on the top of his aggro list (until the former controller dies).\nRazorgore has a Conflagration spell which he sometimes uses against his current target, which disorients the target for some time. While that confusion lasts, Razorgore attacks the next highest target on his threat table. After the effect wears off, he returns to his normal threat mechanics, so if the confused person was the former controller, Razorgore will always return to him.\nThe usual method to deal with this is to have at least two tanks, positioned far enough apart not to be hit by the conflagration at the same time.\nSince the conflagration is an AoE effect, the main damage should be ranged (similarly to the &lt;a href=\"Onyxian%20Warder\"&gt;Onyxian Warder&lt;/a&gt; encounters). Rogues should bandage the range DPSers at this time, as well as help with their bows.\nSolo strategy.\nThe most challenging part of this fight is keeping Razorgore alive during the egg-destroying phase long enough to destroy all thirty eggs in the room. As the adds appear, they not only aggro on the controlling character, some of them will also aggro on Razorgore. The damage from these adds is sufficient, given enough time, to kill Razorgore -- at which point he will explode and instantly kill everyone in the room, including the controller. The dragonkin adds do the most damage, so if one is attacking Razorgore, use his Calm Dragon ability (key 5) to put it to sleep while waiting for the Destroy Egg cooldown to finish.\nPet controlling classes must dismiss their pet, or they will not be able to control Razorgore!\nGet behind &lt;a href=\"Grethok%20the%20Controller\"&gt;Grethok the Controller&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Guardsman\"&gt;Blackwing Guardsmen&lt;/a&gt; who are guarding the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Orb of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, then blow them up to start the encounter. Quickly interact with the orb (just click it once!), in order to keep Razorgore close to his starting platform. Razorgore does not have to be on top of the egg that is targeted for destruction, but he does need to be facing it and within a few yards of it. It helps to target Razorgore ( should work while he is mind controlled) to see his cast bar. The mind control channel will not break if the controller takes damage.\nBegin clearing eggs near his starting position on the platform and then work across the room to the controller platform. Destroy egg has a 3.0 second cast time, and there is a 1.5 second cooldown after the cast has finished. Use the cooldown time to move to the next egg. While the destroy egg cast is in progress, look for the next egg to destroy, then move to it the instant the cast completes. The Dominate Mind channel has a 90 second duration, so with optimal play, 20 eggs can be destroyed in one channel.\nWith at least 4 seconds left in the first channel, cast Fireball Volley to aggro all the adds. When the channel breaks, they will turn to the player and get off Razorgore. Don't even bother cleaning them up, but quickly resume the mind control. Another Fireball Volley may be necessary around the 45-second mark of the second channel. Quickly cast escape after the volley goes off, then resume the mind control channel again.\nWork quickly, as there is a roughly 45-second pause before adds start streaming in. Plan a route so Razor is not near the orb of domination when the channel wears off. Use the forced break in the control channel to quickly mop up the adds whaling on the controlling character, then interact with the orb again to regain control of Razorgore. Don't mess with the adds close to Razor, as splash damage from the character's attacks probably will do more damage to him than the trash mobs.\nAs soon as the last egg is destroyed, all of the trash will turn and flee. Razorgore hits for a trivial amount of damage against a character attempting to solo him, but the 8-second disorient and 5-second stun will still be an annoyance.\nAlternative strategy.\nSummary: An alternative strategy to soloing Razorgore is to park him behind the player, wait until the number of adds in the room has reached their cap and are focused on the controlling player, and then destroy the eggs without any distractions.\nIMPORTANT: Before attempting this, dismiss any active pets and be sure you have no abilities or spells active that could potentially cause damage to attackers (such as the shaman's &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Shield\"&gt;Lightning Shield&lt;/a&gt;).\nKill Grethok and his adds and let Razorgore cross most the room before using the orb. You will have some time to destroy a few eggs, so deal with the ones directly in front of the orb platform and the couple on the orb platform itself. Once done with that, \"stay on the orb platform and move Razorgore to the back of it\". The adds will begin spawning from the side entrances of the room and head towards your platform. The key to this strategy is that by moving Razorgore to that spot, the adds will immediately focus on the controlling player due to proximity aggro rather than attempting to kill the boss.\nOccasionally an add will either attack or at least appear to focus on Razorgore \u2014 don't panic. It can take a second or two for the add to re-focus on the controlling player (as intended), so don't make any moves. On the very rare exception that an add doesn't re-focus, you can use Calm Dragonkin (if it's &lt;a href=\"Death%20Talon%20Dragonspawn\"&gt;Death Talon Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;) or carefully \"single-target melee\" the orc to death. This will cause a new add to spawn, but better that than risking a wipe later on.\nThe mind-control channeling will expire while the adds are busy capping out, so quickly and \"carefully\" click the orb again to regain control of Razorgore. It helps ahead of time to pick a \"good\" spot by the orb for when you're encircled by the adds, as well as turning off nameplates. Following these tips should make it easier to view the orb and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 interact with it.\nAfter immediately moving Razorgore back to his parking spot, keep an eye the side entrances. If you think no more adds are coming out, wait several seconds to be certain of it. You can then freely move Razorgore about the room, destroying the eggs in whichever pattern you prefer. Most prefer to start at the opposite platform, however, in order to give themselves more time to regain control over the boss. When the channeling runs out, you can quickly move your character away from the orb to force the melee adds to re-position themselves if you're finding it too cluttered to easily interact again with the orb.\nAt this point, it is simply a matter of rinse and repeat with the orb while destroying all the eggs."}

The northern group became &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s separated from their leadership, until they rallied under &lt;a href=\"Tortusk\"&gt;Tortusk&lt;/a&gt;, who turned them into brigands and had them attack &lt;a href=\"Grol%27dom%20Farm\"&gt;Grol'dom Farm&lt;/a&gt;.

They know that their bones need to be strong when entering a battle, with the Razormane's greatest warriors being infused with Agamaggan's strength. The Razormane's greatest scouts are said to be unrivaled in their accuracy, and no rogue could measure up to their quickness in battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Tortusk\"&gt;Tortusk&lt;/a&gt;'s mount is a &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Fez\"&gt;Fez&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III you must help the tauren defeat the Razormane quilboar who are invading their home.\nIn the RPG.\nRazormanes are one of the two most prominent quilboar tribes. Native to the Barrens, they frequently raid and pillage nearby settlements.\nSpeculation.\nIt's possible Mangletooth has been the leader of the tribe since the beginning, leading heroes of the Horde to believe that Lok Orcbane was the leader. This way Mangletooth could have his vengeance on them for leaving him captured at &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;. Even when Mangletooth has the adventurer bring the skull of Lok as proof of the leader's death, &lt;a href=\"Thork\"&gt;Thork&lt;/a&gt; thought the leader was a different quilboar.\nIt's also possible, given how the quilboar take over new leadership, that Mangletooth was the chieftain and challenged by Lok who won, leaving Mangletooth for dead. Lok then would have taken over the tribe, leaving Mangletooth wanting revenge.\nThis could explain how quickly and easily Mangletooth was able to become the chieftain of the tribe after having either escape or released from Camp Taurajo."}

Many thousands of years before the present time, the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Silvergale%20Isle\"&gt;Silvergale Isle&lt;/a&gt; made a pact with the Aspect &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s brood. The elves were gifted with Ysera's blessing and were allowed to ride the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s into battle against their enemies. They were known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. This unfortunately attracted &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s ire, and he sent his flight, including his lieutenant Razormaw, to launch an attack on the night elves while they were sleeping. The &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragons&lt;/a&gt; rose up to protect their elven allies but eventually they were all defeated by Deathwing's brood. Razormaw however, also perished in the final battle.\nMany thousands of years later the remains of battle can still be seen. Gigantic draconic skeletons litter the isle and the spirits of green whelps wander aimlessly, attacking all that approach. Razormaw's hatred was so great that even in death he still remains, as a spectral dragon circling overhead. Prince Toreth, a ghost of one of the riders that remains to keep the world from forgetting the Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran, asks passing adventurers to summon down the ghostly black dragon, and defeat it to end the haunting of the isle."}

The encounter consists of waves of adds until harpoons become available to bring Razorscale to the ground for a short time.\nBackground.\nBosstiary.\n\"Previously known as &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, this creature was captured by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and twisted into a vicious weapon.

Under his master's orders, Ignis the Furnace Master fused iron plates onto Razorscale's hide to enhance her deadly strikes.\"\nOverview.\nIn Stage One defend the Expedition Engineers from the invading forces until they can repair Harpoon Turrets. In Stage Two Razorscale will become permanently grounded and must be defeated.\nAbilities.\nStage One: Winged Terror.\nRazorscale must be brought to the ground with the Harpoon Guns.\nStage Two: Grounded.\nUpon reaching 50% health Razorscale will become grounded permanently.\nStrategy.\n\"On normal mode, the fight proceeds exactly like the heroic variant, except that only two &lt;a href=\"Harpoon%20Gun\"&gt;turrets&lt;/a&gt; need to be repaired and fired instead of four.\"\nThis boss fight consists of three phases, alternating air and ground phases until 50% damage taken, and then a pure ground phase from 50% to 0%. \nRecommended Setup: 3 Tanks, 3 Tank Healers, 3 Raid Healers, 0-2 Floating Healers, 14-16 DPS (composition irrelevant).\nTalking to the Expedition Commander will begin the event with Razorscale in her air phase.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.1\"&gt;patch 3.1.1&lt;/a&gt;, Razorscale has a ten minute berserk timer across all phases. \nAir phase.\nThe air phase consists of defending the Expedition dwarves while they repair the harpoon turrets. During this phase, the focus should be on defeating adds (Sentinels are priority, Watchers must be CC'd and killed second, Guardians last), and staying out of Devouring Flame. As the turrets get repaired one at a time, they can be clicked to fire a harpoon at Razorscale. \nThe raid should be split into three groups, one near the far side of the circle opposite the harpoons, and two groups positioned slightly round the circle back towards the harpoons. Each group should engage the spawns from a single pod and destroy them, there is no need for crowd control and AoE can be used. If a sentinel spawns all 3 DPS groups should focus fire this target as it presents the greatest and only tank threat amongst the spawned adds.\nRaid healers should be assigned behind the three groups to support heal and heal the players assigned to trigger the harpoons.\nThe raid should be split into two groups in a sort of 'V' shape at the start, with the vertex in the center of the large circle. Tanks will pick up adds and attempt to kite them back towards everyone else to be AOE'd. Healers and ranged DPS should be back slightly to avoid whirlwinds and chain lightning. Shaman are very useful in interrupting Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt, which should help kite them together with the rest of the adds (of course, rogues and warriors will be helpful with that as well). In most cases, watchers will automatically begin melee-ing after a single cast; if you can take the damage, then don't waste time dealing with them separately.\nIn normal mode, there are only 2 Harpoons that become active to bring Razorscale down.There are two main ways of handling the Harpoons. The first way to do this is to activate the first harpoon when its ready, then when the second one is ready, wait until your DPS/Tanks call that most adds are down and to fire the harpoon. This way everyone, tanks and healers (mana permitting) can concentrate on Razorscale and max DPS without having to worry about adds and keeping tanks alive. The easiest way to do this is to assign a ranged DPS to \"Harpoon duty\" and call out in vent when they are ready, then have a Tank or DPS call out on vent when to fire the second Harpoon. The second way to handle this part is to activate the second harpoon immediately when ready and the adds can be brought in front of Razorscale while the DPS switches to Razorscale when she lands, that way when she does her breath attack to free herself it hits all the adds and mostly kills them. The downside to this method is you have adds up which means healers and Tanks must focus on them and not on Razorscale. It is very important to DPS as much as possible when she is Harpooned to the ground to get her into the second \"ground\" phase (50% health) before she enrages in the air. \nDuring this phase it is important to ensure that the raid healers keep members of their party above 12,000 health as this prevents losing targets to a single fireball or devouring flame; a double or even triple breath is possible (and common) so healing must be fast and effective (Paladins are ideal in this role due to Holy Shock). Healers' first priority must be to keep themselves alive, however any losses in this fight can be detrimental to the raid's ability to beat the enrage timer.\nRazorscale's fireballs and devouring flames will annihilate a group that isn't paying attention. There are no addons that currently track either projectile, so it must be watched closely. To do this, have one or two healers, prior to the fight, look up and target Razorscale and then use /focus. Make sure cast bars and target of target can be seen on the focus (test on a player in the group). During the fight, have the healers, between healing, watch the focus for Razorscale's targets. Each target can only be seen briefly, for less than half a second so they have to be on their toes. If no cast bar is shown, but someone is targeted, it means a fireball will hit them (it can miss). Priests can shield these targets, and others can just pre-heal to get them up immediately after being struck. It's important to keep them healed in case they get targeted multiple times in a row. When Razorscale uses Devouring Flame, a 1 second cast bar will appear, and the target will appear right as it finishes. The person who is targeted should be notified immediately, and that person needs to begin moving (preferably away from others in the raid) or be ready to move immediately. The devouring flame will track the target briefly (if you move, it will move) before striking the ground (you can see a blue ball fall into the location before spreading into flame). If you move early, it's hard to know where it will hit. If you stand in one place, you can position yourself safely and then run when the flames are about to appear.\nDevouring Flame always targets the closest ally to Razorscale (i.e. a player or a pet). This makes it possible to have a healer or ranged DPS \"tank\" the Devouring Flame patches, as the projectile doesn't follow a moving player\u2014it will only go to the spot the player was when fired. This can reduce unpredictable damage considerably. In the first air phase, Razorscale hovers over the central circle. For subsequent air phases, Razorscale's initial position is on the northeast side of the fighting area (look for pets that have yet to come off of Razorscale: they will stand still directly below the boss and also be the first targets for Devouring Flame). Using a harpoon will bring Razorscale back to center, as in the first air phase. Keeping Razorscale targeted or focused can make the use of Devouring Flame obvious (through the cast bar) and the Devouring Flame tank can walk a simple path around the point closest to Razorscale, keeping the flames off other raid members and avoiding most of the damage himself.\nGround phase.\nOnce all four turrets have been repaired and fired, Razorscale will be forced to the ground where she will remain stunned for several seconds. Everyone should immediately move behind her, and DPS should focus on bringing her HP down as much as possible while the tanks hold any remaining adds. After the stun wears off, Razorscale will breath then return to the air and begin the air phase again.\nFor this phase tanks should converge onto the rear of Razorscale allowing their DPS to be added to that available in this phase, with 5s remaining until the stun wears off the tanks should move with any remaining adds towards the furthest point on the circle and allow full raid AoE damage to be applied to the adds. As new pods appear tanks should move their adds back to their regular tanking positions.\nPhase 2.\nOnce Razorscale is brought to 50% health, she will land permanently, at which point she will need to be tanked facing away from the group to avoid breaths. The fight from this point is very simple, she will continue using Devouring Flame, she will do a knock back to everyone within 35 yards, and inflict the Flame Buffet debuff. During this ground phase, the DPS should go all out in order to defeat Razorscale before the Flame Buffet debuffs cause the tank to be one-shotted.\nThere is another debuff that happens during this fight. In phase 2, when tanking Razorscale, your tanks will get a debuff called \"Fused Armor\" which adds a slowing effect to the tank. When this debuff hits 5 stacks the tank can't move or use any abilities, including taunt. You need to change tanks when the debuff gets to 2 stacks in order to finish the fight.\nNote as of 4-15-09 on live you can no longer dps boss while it is in the air.\nRelated achievements.\nRazorscale does not have a hard mode, but or the 25 player version are part of the meta achievement.\nQuotes.\nSound Files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Ulduar%23.C2.A0Razorscale\"&gt;Sound Files of Ulduar: Razorscale&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Among them was the sunken &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, named the \"&lt;a href=\"Flying%20Osprey\"&gt;Flying Osprey&lt;/a&gt;\", with a load of Lightforge ingots on board.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to get the ingots back, in order to create a weapon to face the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grimand%20Elmore\"&gt;Grimand Elmore&lt;/a&gt;, a weaponsmith experienced with this metal, the Lightforge ingots were forged to create &lt;a href=\"Morbent%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Morbent's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. The artifact was then used to destroy Morbent Fel's magical shield, and allowed the heroes to kill him. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Morbent Fel returned as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; and was once again defeated, after adventurers found the pieces of Morbent's Bane and repaired it as the &lt;a href=\"Torch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Since this time, the holy artifact made in Lightforge iron was put in front of the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;necromancer's home&lt;/a&gt;, in order to dispel his dark enchantments and to keep the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; docile in the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lightforge%20Armor\"&gt;Lightforge Armor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20Blade\"&gt;Lightforged Blade&lt;/a&gt; are also made of Lightforge iron.\nIn the RPG.\nLightforge Iron is an exceptionally light and flexible metal highly sought after by paladins and templars of all types. According to legend, the ore is formed when touched by the Holy Light. Logically, then, the material is divinely intended for use against the forces of darkness. Although the truth of this is not known, lightforge iron definitely seems to be blessed by some higher power, though it is not inherently good or evil. Even demons have been known to use the material, often out of spite.\nLightforge iron is almost never found deep within the earth. Instead, it appears in clusters of ordinary iron that find their way to the surface during earthquakes or eruptions. Sometimes the ore bubbles up from underground streams or gas pockets that erupt in swamps or moors. This tendency only lends credence to the myriad lightforge iron legends. Deposits have been seen all over the face of Azeroth, but most commonly appear in Dustwallow Marsh, Desolace, and the Searing Gorge.\nItems crafted of lightforge iron are unnaturally shiny. They gleam brightly in ordinary light, and seem to take on an unnatural radiance when exposed to the full glare of the sun. Even when dirty or dusty they still somehow seem regal in nature. Crafting lightforge iron requires an exceptionally clean environment, almost as though the material expects to be handled in a manner befitting its divine status. The ore must also be precisely purified, or the resulting item will quickly fracture wherever any impurities lie. Most smiths simply do not have the patience to work with such a temperamental material.\nWeapons crafted of lightforge iron gather up ambient light and throw it back in an unnatural shine, producing light equal to that of a torch at all times, except in total darkness."}

Foreseeing the upcoming war between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightforged decided to stand alongside their new allies after millennia separated.\nHigh Exarch &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; believes upholding the Alliance's ideals would be a worthy cause for the Lightforged and offers the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;'s services to High King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;.

Turalyon invites the class order leader to witness how draenei are turned into Lightforged: The &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Aeons\"&gt;Forge of Aeons&lt;/a&gt;, which reinforces a draenei's mind, body, and soul with the power of the &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; after facing their inner demons. &lt;a href=\"T%27paartos\"&gt;T'paartos&lt;/a&gt; is one of the Lightforged initiates and cannot undergo the trials without a second. The adventurer volunteers to take part in T'paartos' initiation ritual as his second and undergoes the trials with him. Having successfully completed the trials, T'paartos is officially inducted into the order of the Lightforged. Turalyon claims the Lightforged are impressed by their strength and are more than willing to ally themselves with the Alliance, the heroes who helped them stop the Burning Crusade, and continue bringing peace and justice to Azeroth. Turalyon leaves Captain Fareeya to organize their troops while he returns to King Wrynn to give the Army of the Light's official pledge of loyalty.\nCaptain Fareeya will task new Lightforged draenei to go forth into Azeroth and fulfill their new mandate: spread the Light's justice and uphold the ideals of the Alliance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Faction Assault on Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, the Lightforged aided the Alliance in defending &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;the region&lt;/a&gt; from the Horde as members of the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt;, an Alliance contingent of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, and Lightforged draenei soldiers empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.

During this time, more &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Draenor and, without &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to fight, the draenei became fixated upon the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Draenor began to deteriorate for unknown reasons. The Lightbound and the blamed each other. Having received visions from the Light Mother, the &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;High Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt; knew that the Army of the Light would bring order to countless worlds in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; reforged the draenei in the Light, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt;, then compelled them to spread their influence among the orcs in a more antagonistic organization, seeking to spread the Light's influence across the planet; by force if necessary. A few orcs converted to the Light willingly, but others had the Light forced upon them. Some orcs even sided with the draenei against their own kin. War followed, until the two sides found themselves in a stalemate in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, where the Lightbound refused to attack &lt;a href=\"Hellsreach%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellsreach Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the Mag'har were dealing with &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%2C%20Greatson%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%20clan\"&gt;his followers&lt;/a&gt;, Lightbound forces led by captured &lt;a href=\"Evermorn%20Hold\"&gt;Evermorn Hold&lt;/a&gt; and used it as a staging ground for an attack against &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt;. As the Mag'har celebrated their victory after repelled the assault and retaliated, High Exarch Yrel and her entire armies arrived on the field. With her vastly superior numbers, the High Exarch offered Hellscream and the Mag'har one last chance to embrace the Light by joining the Lightbound. However, Grommash refused her offer, and stayed behind with to push back the Lightbound while the Mag'har fled to Azeroth.\nAppearance.\nLightforged draenei possess an alabaster-marble colored skin and white hair. In contrast with other draenei, the Lightforged have bright, golden eyes, and their bodies are marked with glowing and golden tattoos. Their hooves are also ornamented with gold, and their Mark of the Naaru is a different, golden sigil."}

Humanoids are normally seen as a threat, as are large predators. Smaller and less threatening animals may be stomped, charged, or simply swallowed.

The lightslayer embraces the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and develops her personal power by slaying enemies who stand in the light. Some consider lightslayers the dark mirror of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, but in truth the two organizations have little in common. The Scarlet Crusade possesses a firm hierarchy; their fanaticism is orderly and focused. Lightslayers, on the other hand, usually work alone. They make use of stealth, hit-and-run tactics, and the element of surprise. The only strong similarity between the two groups is the dedicated zeal with which both orders pursue their goals.\nA branch of the Cult of the Forgotten Shadow, led by a former soldier, trained the first lightslayers to combat Scarlet Crusade raids. Originally, the cult envisioned lightslayers as &lt;a href=\"dark%20knight\"&gt;dark knight&lt;/a&gt;s who would ride into battle against the agents of the Holy Light. To the cult's dismay, the Crusade's organized tactics ran roughshod over the newly trained &lt;a href=\"dark%20knight\"&gt;dark knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAnother branch of the cult, this one led by a charismatic and pragmatic &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ilius\"&gt;Ilius&lt;/a&gt;, liked the concept of lightslayers, yet disagreed with their implementation. Ilius had been a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; in life, but before that he had made a living as a sneak thief and burglar. He recalled those skills now to train a few faithful cultists and sent them on solitary missions against the Scarlet Crusade. These lightslayers proved much more effective, and their use has spread to many branches of the Forgotten Shadow.\nThe disorganized cult naturally has many different theories on how best to train and utilize lightslayers, but all agents possess basic similarities. The disorganized structure of the cult means that sometimes two or more lightslayers from different branches might embark on identical missions. More than once an assassination has failed when two lightslayers targeted the same mark on the same night and disrupted each other's plans. Ilius has made efforts to consolidate the lightslayers and their superiors into an organized network, but the different branches of the cult remain suspicious of each other. Each branch insists that it alone knows the true doctrine of the Forgotten Shadow and should therefore take control of a united lightslayer organization. It seems unlikely that Ilius will succeed in his unification attempt.\nTo be a lightslayer requires devotion to the cult, a measure of grace and skill, a willingness to learn and a fierce hatred for the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. Training emphasizes stealth and melee combat, and trainees also receive religious instruction. A potential lightslayer trains for a month with the cult, alternating classroom lesses on the history of the cult and the Church of the Holy Light with battlefield practice. The cult constructs special training facilities where trainees practice climbing, sneaking and lockpicking. The cult places little emphasis on finding and disarming traps; lightslayers are not common burglars. Trainees only learn how to open locks for those assassination missions that require them to enter bedchambers at night.\nOnce indoctrinated, a lightslayer receives missions to combat the Holy Light, particularly the Scarlet Crusade (though &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and ordinary priests and parishioners are also fair game). These missions range from ambush to outright assassination. A lightslayer is as likely to lead a troop of knights into a forest trap as she is to sneak into a lone knight's bedchamber and behead him. Lightslayers also accept missions to thwart the Church of the Holy Light in other ways. These missions often require the aid of others; sometimes the cult recruits help, other times the lightslayer calls in favors. These missions include sabotaging caravans destined for Holy Light churches, disrupting important ceremonies, desecrating locations sacred to the Holy Light and seeking out lost relics to destroy.\nA lightslayer spends months learning the teachings of the Forgotten Shadow and studying the beliefs of her enemies. The lightslayer\u2019s devotion to the Forgotten Shadow protects her against the destructive power of the Holy Light. A skilled lightslayer\u2019s experience in the field grants a lightslayer firsthand knowledge of how best to hurt her enemies. The highly skilled lightslayer\u2019s faith grows strong enough to protect her against the spellcasting abilities of her enemies. She gains spell resistance against divine spells cast by paladins and priests of the Holy Light.\nLightslayers in the world.\nLightslayers work alone and in the dark, and are loners by nature. They gravitate to the blackest places of the world, such as underground lairs and ruined towns overrun by the greedy and heartless. Despite - or perhaps because of - their bitter and cruel natures, lightslayers seem drawn to people with upbeat outlooks. Lightslayers remain aloof and withdrawn for the most part, but seem to crave the company of enthusiastic, happy individuals. Perhaps companions who have found peace with their lives inspire a lightslayer to make peace with her own rage and bitterness.\nEach lightslayer has a home base, the town or city where the Cult of Forgotten Shadow trained her. The cult branch she associates with sends her on missions and provides her with training and sometimes with financing, so a lightslayer usually stays close to home. Most lightslayers have a single regular contact from the cult who acts as a liaison between the branch and the lightslayer. Such contacts try to remain aloof and emotionally distant from the lightslayer; they may guide several agents, and have undoubtedly lost many friends to dangerous missions. The Cult of Forgotten Shadow keeps a close eye on the lightslayers and so far has been careful to destroy any evidence of their activities. Lightslayers are often dispatched to clean up botched missions.\nDue to the delicacy of lightslayer operations and the amount of coordination necessary to undertake one, lightslayers receive weeks or months of downtime between missions. During this time they sometimes research the movements of the Scarlet Crusade, but usually a lightslayer pursues her own agenda instead. She may travel with companions, track down powerful items she wishes to own or simply rest from her exertions.\nLightslayers often possessed a bent toward larceny and stealth in life. Many lightslayers once worked as thieves, brigands or assassins. Other lightslayers were penitents or even &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of the Holy Light in their old lives. They serve the Forgotten Shadow with a caustic zeal, loathing all reminders of the Light they once cared so much for. Such individuals train as &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s solely to enter the lightslayer ranks. Their predilection for stealth means that lightslayers favor light, quiet weapons, such as daggers, rapiers, short swords and hand crossbows. Even when not on a mission, lightslayers dress in dark colors and move with deliberate stealth.\nOther &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s distrust lightslayers on principle. No one with any sense trusts the Forsaken, and lightslayers are Forsaken who devote their lives to stealth, deception and murder. They are the least trustworthy of an untrustworthy lot. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who follow &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamanistic traditions&lt;/a&gt; sometimes feel a deep sadness for the lightslayer's lot. They see the lightslayers as individuals so consumed with hatred and despair that their only path is one of darkness and death. A kindhearted orc or tauren might attempt to befriend a lightslayer; should that prove impossible, he might try to at least be a calming influence and a compassionate ear for his companion. Many lightslayers secretly crave such understanding, though outwardly they rail at any sign of pity. The Alliance and the Church of the Holy Light suspects the existence of the lightslayers, but have not gathered solid proof yet. The Scarlet Crusade is convinced that the Forsaken muster organized resistance against them, but their claims remain unsupported (and in fact are mere supposition at this point; while the Forsaken certainly resist the Crusade, their organization leaves much to be desired)."}

After aiding heroes in gaining the &lt;a href=\"Masquerade\"&gt;Masquerade&lt;/a&gt; mask, he worked with &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; to spread discord among the nightborne and aiding &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;. He was an acquaintance of &lt;a href=\"Spellblade%20Aluriel\"&gt;Spellblade Aluriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thoramir\"&gt;Thoramir&lt;/a&gt;, Second Blade of Elisande, and was skilled enough to have held the latter's position had he remained loyal to the magistrix. Silgryn's conscience could not allow him to do so.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;insurrection&lt;/a&gt;, he joins the Nightfallen, along with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, in invading Suramar City. He also works with &lt;a href=\"Arluelle\"&gt;Arluelle&lt;/a&gt;, instructing her in swordplay. He then leads the rebels against &lt;a href=\"Rozzeleth\"&gt;Rozzeleth&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus.\nSilgryn later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; to join the sail on \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sunstrider\"&gt;The Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;\" to the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" and from there to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\". Once there, he notes how the fate of the planet once again reaffirmed for him that rejecting the Legion's offer was the right path, and speaks to Liadrin about how seeing Argus makes him realize the fate that almost befell his people. He asks how Liadrin's &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; found their own path forward, to which she responds that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has become allies with which together the blood elves have struggled through dark times and find strength. Silgryn thanks her and says that she has given him much to ponder.\nSilgryn can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Ridge\"&gt;Darkfall Ridge&lt;/a&gt; where he fights demons seeking to reach the Vindicaar.\nThe Horde.\nAfter Elisande's demise, he and The Nightfallen relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, where they would see to the restoration of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic occupation, under the rule of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra chose to seek new allies for the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; as they reentered the world after thousands of years of isolation.\nThe First Arcanist would meet with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in order to discuss her people's potential entry into the faction. At the &lt;a href=\"Estate%20of%20the%20First%20Arcanist\"&gt;Estate of the First Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;, the two discussed the details of this, with Silgryn and several others also present. Thalyssra subsequently accepted Liadrin's invitation to visit &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, and traveled there accompanied by Silgryn and &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;. After meeting with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; Regent Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the nightborne trio would take part in a visit to the mythical &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere, prompted by Alleria Windrunner's connection to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, those gathered and the Sunwell itself were attacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Nether-Prince%20Durzaan\"&gt;Nether-Prince Durzaan&lt;/a&gt;. Thalyssra, Valtrois, and Silgryn aided the others in defending against the assailants, and eventually managed to close the rift through which they arrived. In the wake of the incident, Thalyssra would pledge the loyalty of Suramar and the nightborne to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s cause.\nSilgryn would afterward remain in the Nighthold with the other Nightfallen leadership, and can be met by new nightborne &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Silgryn and his pet owl were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. After the shaman &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; was discovered to have crashed the wedding and caused a scene with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, he was ordered to leave with Silgryn, ensuring that he didn't get lost on the way out.\nQuotes.\nI cannot condone &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s violence against our people. We must endure.\nElisande will pay for this treachery.\n&lt;Silgryn seems to be deep in thought, as he is even more stoic and silent than usual.&gt;\nIt is a pity the lightforged draenei did not join the Horde, they are quite formidable opponents."}

{"id": "15458", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15458", "title": "Silithid", "text": "The silithid are an &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; race created by &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and found primarily in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, the silithid are non-sentient, though they remain dangerous foes.\nBackground.\nThe silithid were created from the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;. The qiraji, in turn, were an evolution of the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; race that had been spawned by the Old Gods in the days of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; and then forced to hide in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilithid can range in size from a normal insect to gigantic. Size seems to depend on how long the silithid are allowed to develop in their egg stage. It appears that size is also directly correlated with colony size.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, a submerged colony of silithid can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Dig%20Site\"&gt;Sunken Dig Site&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting they are capable of living underwater for long periods or indefinitely. In addition, a silithid with a protruding brain-type feature, &lt;a href=\"Hive%20Controller\"&gt;Hive Controller&lt;/a&gt; can be found here.\nAlthough many varieties of &lt;a href=\"Qiraji%20battle%20tank%20mounts\"&gt;Qiraji Battle Tank&lt;/a&gt; can still be found in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; today, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;darkest of the species&lt;/a&gt; were only seen on the day the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;Scarab Gong&lt;/a&gt; was rung.\nSilithid hatchlings entertain themselves by clacking their mandibles together in increasingly complex rhythms.\nNo creature yet encountered can adapt to changes in the environment as quickly as the silithid. The larvae, or broodlings as they are often called, can evolve into a variety of silithid creature types based on the needs of the hive.\nResearch conducted by &lt;a href=\"Tammy%20Tinkspinner\"&gt;Tammy Tinkspinner&lt;/a&gt; revealed that after &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; impaled Silithus with his sword, the silithid became riled up and stronger than ever due to feeding on &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;Azeroth's blood&lt;/a&gt;.\nCastes.\nTheir society is divided into several castes, and each caste has a unique physical type, ranging in size from fairly small wasps to huge silithid colossi. Every caste has its function within their massive underground hives which consist primarily of circuitous tunnels providing living space, as well as protection for their vulnerable eggs and larvae. Though not all silithid are innately hostile, all fiercely defend their hives when threatened.\nThere are a few silithid (&lt;a href=\"Hive%27Zara%20Tail%20Lasher\"&gt;Hive'Zara Tail Lasher&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Vekniss%20Hive%20Crawler\"&gt;Vekniss Hive Crawler&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Qiraji%20Scorpion\"&gt;Qiraji Scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s) that use the &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpid&lt;/a&gt; model; it's unclear if these are another caste of silithid, such as the &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Swarmer\"&gt;Silithid Swarmer&lt;/a&gt;, or something else.\nLocations.\nThe silithid burrow their underground hives all over southern Kalimdor. All of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; is under their control, and they have hives in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt;. They've even been sighted in small numbers in &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these locations are deprived of water, and silithid have been spotted at water posts in Tanaris. Perhaps their survival or nutrition relies heavily on water.\nHives.\nEach of the three &lt;a href=\"hives\"&gt;hives&lt;/a&gt; in Silithus has a crystalline prism in it. They are apparently a means for the qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid.\nAs a mount.\n&lt;a href=\"Qiraji%20battle%20tank%20mounts\"&gt;Qiraji battle tank mounts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; drops in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. They come in several colors: &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;Blue Qiraji Resonating Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;Red Qiraji Resonating Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;Green Qiraji Resonating Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;Yellow Qiraji Resonating Crystal&lt;/a&gt; and can only be used inside the instance.\nThere is also a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Qiraji%20Battle%20Tank\"&gt;Black Qiraji Battle Tank&lt;/a&gt;, but it was possible to obtain one only during the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; event. It is usable outside the instances, thus rare sightings of these mounts outside Ahn'Qiraj are possible.\nAs a hunter pet.\nSilithid are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of several different families, differing based on caste.\nIn the RPG.\nSilithid are an intelligent insectoid &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; that have grown in strength and power in recent years. They first appeared in the region called &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, but have since founded colonies in neighboring areas, usually far from native settlements. They sometimes prove impartial to travelers, but defend their territory ferociously from invaders.\nScholars disagree on the origins of the silithid. Some believe they are an offshoot of the arachnoid &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, an insect race that mostly dwells in the northern regions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Others believe they are a new race heretofore unknown on Azeroth, possibly having arrived from another world elsewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, much as the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s once did. Still others posit that they are servants of the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, and that their presence in Southern Kalimdor is a harbinger of the qiraji invasion.\nTo a humanoid's eyes, silithid are enormous bugs, most of man-size or larger, with powerful natural weapons at their disposal. The silithid build structures out of natural materials using their bodily secretions. Silithid hives are immense, alien affairs with towering antenna-like spires jutting out of the earth. In the maze of tunnels below, the creatures raise their young, tend to their wounded, manage food storage, and fend off invaders.\nSilithid are capable of communicating by touching antennae to one another. They can also send simple messages to larger groups by sending out chemical signals in the air. Individual silithid possess a certain level of animal cunning, but are unintelligent. They exist to serve the hive and are specialized in their roles. Wasps attack, tunnelers dig, reavers defend, swarmers train, queens lay eggs, and so on. A silithid instinctively gives its life for the colony.\nMost scholars agree that a silithid begins life by hatching from an egg. At this point, the young silithid is a broodling \u2014 a larval state as yet unspecialized for any role in the hive. Eventually, the broodling encases itself in a cocoon and changes into its new form \u2014 a wasp, reaver, swarmer, or possibly some other as-yet unknown type of silithid. While silithid haven\u2019t been a visible part of the world long enough for anyone to accurately gauge their lifespans, some researchers think that after achieving adulthood, a common silithid can live for up to 5 years, although queens can survive for decades.\nInspiration.\nSome believe the silithid's insect-like appearance is derived from the movie \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/\"&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/a&gt;\" (1997), where a group of insectoids does battle with humans in space. Similar suggestions have been put forth about the &lt;a href=\"Zerg\"&gt;Zerg&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard's \"&lt;a href=\"Starcraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" series. Blizzard has also claimed that they derived some inspiration from \"Starship Troopers\" for \"StarCraft\", most evident in the Brood War expansion pack. \"Warhammer 40k\"'s , another insect-like race, are another potential source for inspiration.\nThe silithid hives show similarities to the works of surrealist artist , possibly being inspired by his work."}

It is composed of , and , which must be fought all at the same time.\nElite mode.\nThe loot gained by this encounter is determined by the order you kill this bug family. This encounter was the first instance of what's now called &lt;a href=\"elite%20mode\"&gt;elite mode&lt;/a&gt;. Each bug has some unique items in its loot table, while others are shared. The easiest way to complete this encounter is to kill Lord Kri first, then Princess Yauj and finally Vem. The hardest way is to kill Lord Kri last.\nGroup strategy.\nUntil Lord Kri dies, have hunters keep Nature Resist up, Shamans doing poison cleansing totems, druids curing poison, Paladins cleanse as much as possible whilst priests and druids keep up the heals. Take Princess Yauj far away from the main raid, and start working on Kri. When he dies, a very damaging &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; cloud will appear, so make sure everyone gets far. After him, kill Princess Yauj and make sure casters are ready to kill all the little bugs that will spawn, the Princess also heals so ensure that you have a number of rogues to kick her when she casts or mages to counterspell (she is immune to the silence effect and can resist easily). The AoE fear can make this rather tricky, and time consuming, so good tactics are needed. Shamans can also use Tremor totems to great effect in this fight somewhat simplifying it. After she dies, group up and just finish off Vem.\nPreventing Yauj from Healing.\nThere have been many theories as to what causes Yauj to start healing. The theory that appears to be the most correct is to make sure the distance between Vem and Kri is much shorter than the distance between Yauj and Kri, when Kri dies. This will allow Vem time to devour Kri, increasing Vem's damage slightly, but most importantly, preventing Yauj from devouring Kri - and therefore stopping Yauj's ability to heal entirely. Note that this realistically only applies to the order Kri-&gt;Yauj-&gt;Vem.\nThere is a fifteen minute hard enrage timer. After this time has elapsed, any surviving members of the family will enrage to wipe-causing difficulty.\nStrategy.\nLord Kri.\nKri has a standard melee attack, as well as a frontal cleave. The most dangerous ability is an area wide &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/%3Fsp%3D25812\"&gt;Toxic Volley&lt;/a&gt; that hits for ~500 nature damage and &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s for 125 damage per tick. It is a &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; attack that deals &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; damage, and the DoT is dispellable by normal means, and can stack any number of times.\nPrincess Yauj.\nBesides a standard melee attack, ~1000 on tanks, Yauj has a ranged &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; that wipes &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; even if mitigated with &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Will of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. This fear can make you go out the door and can have the 3 of them reset. Therefore, the strategy to beat Yauj is to tank her as far as you can from the main raid. Also, when you have started to kill her, she will cast a self-heal that needs to be interrupted. Since the last patch, Yauj seems to heal the other 2 bugs as well, regardless of which one you kill first, significantly increasing the difficulty of the encounter.\nThe universal strategy to tank Princess Yauj is to use two tanks on her. AoE fear is casted every 20 seconds. So the tank who is not currently tanking Yauj before fear uses berserk rage and taunts Yauj when she tries to flee after AoE fear. Then this tank becomes main tank, and the tank who was previously tanking Yauj steps back and waits for the next fear. This way Yauj may be tanked on one position for the whole fight without much trouble.\nThe taunt may resist when the berserker raged tank tries to pick her up, and due to her high movement speed he will usually be unable to pick her up for quite a long time. For this reason it may be beneficial to have an extra tank standing ready in the middle of the room, outside the range of the AoE fear and close to the majority of the raid (to maximize the likelihood that Yauj will run somewhere close to this tanks position).\nVem.\nVem has a &lt;a href=\"charge\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; ability, a &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; ability, and a basic melee attack. Does negligible damage to a tank but will hit for upwards of 2-3k on cloth. If he is the last one being killed, grouping up on him will speed up the killing process. If you take an extremely long amount of time to kill Vem (upwards of twenty minutes) he will hard enrage and wipe the raid.\nSolo strategy.\nSingle-target the silithid. Wait until one of the silithid is devoured by the others before attacking the second, then again for the third.\nLoot.\nUnfortunately, in order to obtain some the best loot possible, you must beat Lord Kri last. It is certainly not impossible, but exponentially more difficult than the standard Kri-&gt;Yauj-&gt;Vem kill. Lord Kri has some unique items of item level 78, but unique items of Princess Yauj and Vem have item levels all below 78, and their shared loot table items has an item level of 75. No matter what kill order you only get one &lt;a href=\"Qiraji%20Lord%27s%20Insignia\"&gt;Qiraji Lord's Insignia&lt;/a&gt; from this encounter.\nCataclysm.\nThe Silithid Royalty are now tameable, making them the third bosses to be tamable after the monstrous giant &lt;a href=\"Buru%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Buru the Gorger&lt;/a&gt; and the drakeadon &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt;. Hunters looking to tame them must be careful."}

As a result of the damage, &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; - crystallizations of her blood - began to emerge across the planet. At the &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore\"&gt;Seething Shore&lt;/a&gt; off of Silithus's coast, Alliance and Horde began to fight over it.\nSoon after, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; took control of the .\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSilithus became the base of operations for &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in his attempts to heal Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; both traveled to the wound to help heal it.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Cenarion Circle started rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Staghelm%20Point\"&gt;Staghelm Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThis huge desert lies in the southwestern tip of Kalimdor. The rock and sand terrain is broken up only by the massive hives of the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;. Following Sargeras's failed attempt to destroy Azeroth, most of the zone has been obliterated. There is now simply a large wound with a pool of Azeroth's blood in the center.\nSilithus is the location of two raid dungeons, the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.

The river that passes through Un'Goro looks like a snake. It is at the snakes head. You will see two pillars. .\nNotable characters.\nSilithus is home to several characters of note. At Cenarion Hold, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Mar%27alith\"&gt;Commander Mar'alith&lt;/a&gt; seeks information about his missing &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Natalia%20Mar%27alith\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;, who was last seen in the company of the silithid. At Bronzebeard Encampment, &lt;a href=\"Rutgar%20Glyphshaper\"&gt;Rutgar Glyphshaper&lt;/a&gt; helps him unravel the mystery and inquires as to the whereabouts of the famous explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. And at the Ravaged Twilight Camp, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Demitrian\"&gt;Highlord Demitrian&lt;/a&gt; has a mission of great importance to the most experienced heroes - face off against &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; and defeat him.\nResources.\nSilithus is a desert stretch of land, arid and hostile. Miners will find various spots of &lt;a href=\"Thorium\"&gt;Thorium&lt;/a&gt; ore all over the area, both small, rich and ooze-covered, above ground and in tunnels wherever the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; have dug their hives.\nDig sites.\nSilithus only has one &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the RPG.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro&lt;/a&gt; there is a barely noticeable path leading up the northwestern edge of the crater into the forsaken area known as Silithus. The night elves in &lt;a href=\"Valor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Valor's Rest&lt;/a&gt; cut this path, which picked its way through rocks and the immense boles of trees. Once you climb out of Un'Goro the air becomes drier, but no less warm, and in front of you there is another bleak, desolate, windswept desert.\nApparently, Silithus was once occupied by night elves, in the days before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, a band of druids concerned with keeping the land in balance, is watching over the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; which, in their words, present a major threat to all &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps the entire world. Unlike other silithid &lt;a href=\"hive\"&gt;hive&lt;/a&gt;s found in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; or Un'Goro, in the ones in Silithus there is evidence of intelligent movement by the bugs.\nAs with any desert, it is recommended to bring along a supply of water if you expect to survive, and you better not count on a lot of hospitality from the natives. The elves keep to themselves, and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; won't give up supplies cheaply. You're on your own in this place.\nHistory.\nLong ago, before the Sundering, there were two &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires: the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in their history, the trolls found themselves threatened by an insect race called the &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the trolls beat back the creatures and split them into two factions, the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s in the north and the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The nerubians eventually faced the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and the qiraji fought the night elves in Silithus after the Sundering. The elves won, but the land was blasted by the war, and the elven towns were left in ruins. Thus you have the smashed remnants of &lt;a href=\"Southwind\"&gt;Southwind&lt;/a&gt;, and several other smaller elf villages scattered throughout the region.\nThe silithid are not the same as the qiraji, which, as tales say, walk upright like men. The &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; was built either by the elves to keep the surviving qiraji out, or by the qiraji to keep themselves safe from the elves. Nobody knows or remembers. The elves of the Cenarion Circle think the silithid aren't just intelligent, they are part of some sort of grand plan by the qiraji, or some other as yet unknown force.\nWord has traveled about the mysterious crystals the Twilight's Hammer collects, and a group of mages from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; want a sample or two to find out what's so important about the huge things. They have decided to dispatch heroes to acquire a few chunks of Silithus crystal. Certainly the Twilight's Hammer won't give up such a sample without a fight.\nPeople and culture.\nThere are only two non-insect groups in Silithus: the Cenarion elves, and the Twilight's Hammer. These last people, mostly Horde but with a few humans, far outnumber the druids. Fortunately they keep to themselves, performing strange rituals and digging through ruins. They spend most of their time fighting insects for access to ancient Kaldorei cities, caring little for the fate of travelers.\nApparently, the Twilight's Hammer members' main purpose here is to locate and recover massive ancient crystals located deep under the desert sands. Why they're doing this, is not known. These crystals, spread in the desert, resemble the rune-covered black spires that float in mid-air near Un'Goro.\nGeography.\nSilithus is a wasteland similar to Tanaris but without friendly goblins providing water. Still, rain falls frequently enough to maintain\na greater diversity of life. The plant life soaks up and stores water, so travelers can find what they need by harvesting the hardy cacti that dot the landscape.\nThe worst threats in Silithus are the frequent windstorms and towering dust funnels, which form as gusts snake their way through the broken rocks and sheer cliffs that dot the landscape. Rogue air and earth &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s lurk in the corners, striking at living creatures. Fortunately these creatures stay mostly in the deep desert, away from settlements and cautious travelers.\nThere are really only two settlements in Silithus, Valor's Rest and the Twilight Base Camp. The Twilight's Hammer has other outposts scattered here and there, including one in &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Vale\"&gt;Crystal Vale&lt;/a&gt;, but they are nothing more than watchtowers and a couple of tents."}

It can only be reached by traveling to the north-western corner of the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, where a wide path extends out of the crater and into Silithus.\nSilithus is one of the insect-infested sections of southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. This area houses a section of the once great &lt;a href=\"Aqiri\"&gt;Aqiri&lt;/a&gt; empire, known as &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. It is currently uninhabited, but the central temple is sealed off by the night elves, who attempted to prevent an infestation from breaking out. Judging by the ruins in the area, as well as the massive Silithid colonies, they were unsuccessful in their attempt. The &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; maintains a constant presence in Silithus, at &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt;. From here, they monitor the Silithids, whom some believe to be a force so powerful and threatening that the Alliance and Horde must ally to combat. In addition to the Cenarion Druids, a second, more ominous presence has recently made itself known in Silithus. The &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s brood, has returned to the desert for the first time in ten thousand years.\nSilithus has been fleshed out as a major quest hub with episodic storylines that extend into its depths and past its borders. The redesign of this zone includes a high-end outdoor quest area for the solo players, 5-man groups and includes &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle%23Greater%20Windstones\"&gt;outdoor raid bosses&lt;/a&gt;. The repeatable quests can lead to epic items as a casual alternative to raid dungeons.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.12\"&gt;Patch 1.12&lt;/a&gt;, objective based &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt; was introduced into Silithus. A new crystalline substance, called \"&lt;a href=\"Silithyst\"&gt;Silithyst&lt;/a&gt;\", has been discovered, and both the Horde and the Alliance have taken an interest in it. Players collect the dust where they can, but must be careful they are not ambushed by opposing faction members before they can make their drop off. See &lt;a href=\"The%20Silithyst%20Must%20Flow\"&gt;The Silithyst Must Flow&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nHistory.\nSilithus has for thousands of years held the prison of the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt;, trapped behind the Scarab Wall in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The Qiraji's servants, the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;s, have since multiplied and spread across southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and in the end, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; decided that it was time to reopen the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and put an end to the Qiraji threat once and for all.\nGeography.\nThis huge desert lies in the southwestern tip of Kalimdor. The rock and sand terrain is broken up only by the massive hives of the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilithus is the location of two raid dungeons, the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. There are also several &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. Though there are no battlegrounds in this area, there is some outdoor PvP available.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D40\"&gt;Topographic map of Silithus&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//warcraft.net.ua/content/images/map/Silithus.jpg\"&gt;Map of Silithus pre 1.8&lt;/a&gt;\nTravel Hubs.\n&lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo get there on foot, travel to the NW corner of Un'Goro Crater. The river that passes through Un'Goro looks like a snake. It is at the snakes head. You will see two pillars. .\nNotable Characters.\nSilithus is home to several characters of note. At Cenarion Hold, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Mar%27alith\"&gt;Commander Mar'alith&lt;/a&gt; seeks information about his missing &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Natalia%20Mar%27alith\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;, who was last seen in the company of the silithid. At Bronzebeard Encampment, &lt;a href=\"Rutgar%20Glyphshaper\"&gt;Rutgar Glyphshaper&lt;/a&gt; helps him unravel the mystery and inquires about the whereabout of the famous explorer &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. And at the Ravaged Twilight Camp, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Demitrian\"&gt;Highlord Demitrian&lt;/a&gt; has a mission of great importance to the most experienced heroes - face off against &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; and defeat him.\nResources.\nSilithus is a desert stretch of land, arid and hostile. Miners will find various spots of &lt;a href=\"Thorium\"&gt;Thorium&lt;/a&gt; ore all over the area, both small, rich and ooze-covered, above ground and in tunnels wherever the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; have dug their hives."}

{"id": "25920", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25920", "title": "Silithus Field Duty", "text": "The Silithus Field Duty quest collection was added in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.9\"&gt;patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; area. They were designed to provide casual players with the ability to achieve raid-level rewards, and require the character be a minimum of level 60.\nThe basic format of the Silithus Field Duty quests involves completing a boss encounter with the help of several NPCs. After this boss is defeated, you are offered a choice of combat, tactical, or logistic assignments. When you complete your assignments, you are rewarded with a relevant badge. You can save these badges and turn them in for various items or given to &lt;a href=\"Windcaller%20Kaldon\"&gt;Windcaller Kaldon&lt;/a&gt; in Cenarion Hold for a reputation bonus.\nThe Silithus Field Duty quest chain is only available after your realm completes the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; opening event and the outdoor war across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; officially ends (there is a server-wide announcement saying the qiraji armies are retreating). \nWhen completing these quests, players must also complete various other quests in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to achieve &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; reputation,and the ability to summon the various &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Council\"&gt;Abyssal Council&lt;/a&gt; members required from certain Silithus Field Duty quests.\nDetails.\nThe quest line begins at &lt;a href=\"Windcaller%20Kaldon\"&gt;Windcaller Kaldon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt;. He gives you &lt;a href=\"Unsigned%20Field%20Duty%20Papers\"&gt;Unsigned Field Duty Papers&lt;/a&gt;, which you use (right-click) to create &lt;a href=\"Prepared%20Field%20Duty%20Papers\"&gt;Prepared Field Duty Papers&lt;/a&gt; (3-min cooldown). You must then take the papers to be signed by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Blackanvil\"&gt;Captain Blackanvil&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"Krug%20Skullsplit\"&gt;Krug Skullsplit&lt;/a&gt; (Horde). They will sign your papers after helping the NPCs defeat a boss mob (detailed below). Turning in &lt;a href=\"Signed%20Field%20Duty%20Papers\"&gt;Signed Field Duty Papers&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Windcaller%20Kaldon\"&gt;Windcaller Kaldon&lt;/a&gt; will give &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; reputation and your choice of a Logistics, Combat, or Tactical assignment (detailed further below).\nThe Alliance Ironforge Brigade is camped just northeast of &lt;a href=\"Hive%27Zora\"&gt;Hive'Zora&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde Orgrimmar Legion is camped northwest of &lt;a href=\"Hive%27Regal\"&gt;Hive'Regal&lt;/a&gt;. Begin the event by talking to &lt;a href=\"Janela%20Stouthammer\"&gt;Janela Stouthammer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Krug%20Skullsplit\"&gt;Krug Skullsplit&lt;/a&gt;. A large Silithid enemy will attack the camp, and you must aid the NPCs to defeat it.\nHorde Field Duty.\nFor the Horde, the NPC is an elite 60 Hive'Regal Hunter-Killer.\nHive'Regal Hunter-Killer's abilities\n&lt;a href=\"Krug%20Skullsplit\"&gt;Krug Skullsplit&lt;/a&gt; must survive the fight, or the quest can't be completed.\nThere are several ways to do this: Help DPS or fear the &lt;a href=\"Hive%27Regal%20Hunter-Killer\"&gt;Hive'Regal Hunter-Killer&lt;/a&gt;, or help to heal &lt;a href=\"Krug%20Skullsplit\"&gt;Krug Skullsplit&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance Field Duty.\nFor the Alliance, the NPC is an elite 60 Hive'Zora Abomination.\nElite Hive'Zora Abomination's abilities\nIf there is no player interaction, NPCs defeat the Abomination, but there is a high chance &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Blackanvil\"&gt;Captain Blackanvil&lt;/a&gt; will be slain, thus preventing players from completing their quest.\nLogistics, Combat, and Tactical Assignments.\nAfter completing the field duty, return to the quest giver in &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; and choose one of the following: Logistics Assignment, Combat Assignment, or Tactical Assignment. These assignments award you a badge of the same type as the quest and a follow-up assignment. There are 2 \"special\" quests: Tactical Quest V and Logistics Quest XI; these do not award a badge or a follow-up quest, but instead offer a &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Mark of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Mark of Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, which are required for the epic rewards. These quests are obtained randomly when selecting Tactical or Logistics quests.\nAfter receiving your assignment, you can retake the Field Duty quest and return to camp and fight the elite again to retrieve another assignment. You might get duplicates since you get a random quest. You cannot have more than 1 copy of a particular assignment in your possession at any time, but can have as many different assignments in your possession as your bags, bank, and quest log can hold. Also, you may have any number and variety of unopened letters which contain assignments in your bag. Some are less tedious then others and as it is more efficient to buy the materials for multiple assigments of the same type once you are near an auction house and as the field duty quest to get these assigments has been greatly nerfed it makes sense to defeat the elite bug many times and get a number of copies of assignments of the same type (technically \"unopened letters\" because of the restriction that there can only be one type of assignment in a bag - the letters can still be opened to see what assignment it contains). Half the quests can be attained directly from doing the Field Duty quest. However, the other half can only be attained by initially completing a quest received from Field Duty. These are follow-up quests, and are denoted as such below. \nYou receive:\nLogistics quests.\nCollect these items. Some assignments differ for Alliance and Horde (noted).\nCombat quests.\nCombat quests require killing 30 of some variant of Silithid bug. As of patch 2.3, all the hive bugs for the combat quests are no longer elite, making the quests much easier to solo. Out of the three types of quests, they take by far the longest time to complete, as all the bugs are typically strewn amidst other bugs. All bugs can also be found above ground, although some are more rare than others; it is worth your time to venture into the cave.\nThere are quests available for 4 out of the 5 bugs located at each hive. You will receive a dossier containing all four combat assignments for a single hive. You do not receive a follow-up for combat quests because you receive 4 quests in one Field Duty run.\nThe difficulty of each bug varies considerably; check the links below for more information regarding strategies for each species. Hive'Ashi and Hive'Regal have stealthed bugs that can make these quests much more difficult.\nHive'Ashi Dossier\nHive'Zora Dossier\nHive'Regal Dossier\nTactical quests.\nTactical quests involve aboveground operations against the Twilight's Hammer and their elemental masters, or retrieving a report from a scout deep inside a hive. &lt;a href=\"Object%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Object of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt; can greatly speed up completion of quests 1-5 by allow the player to select which element type he summons; however these are expensive and are usually a waste of valuable &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Twilight%20Text\"&gt;Encrypted Twilight Text&lt;/a&gt;s. \nRewards.\nThe various badges can be saved up and turned in for various items. The quests require several of each badge type and a certain level of &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;. All four quests are immediately available, can be completed in any order and are repeatable.\nIf you do not want any of these item rewards, but instead are trying to gain Cenarion Circle reputation, you may also turn in the badges to Windcaller Kaldon for the &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Allegiance to Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; quest. This requires one of each type of badge and results in 1000 reputation.\nSilithus Field Duty questline hints.\nAs of Patch 2.3, Morna has only 2 Twilight Marauders."}

They are domesticated by the &lt;a href=\"night%20fae\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt;, who use their silk to craft music instruments, weapons, and tools. Despite its gossamer appearance, silkstrider thread possesses great tensile strength, allowing it to be used as a bowstring for war and merriment alike. For this reason, the animals are vital to Ardenweald; more important than almost anyone knows.\nSilkstriders are very delicate creatures and will not spin silk if they become stressed or frightened, so the night fae play music for them to keep them calm and happy. When content, they dance gracefully and make humming or chirping noises. The animals begin life as small larvae that hatch from cocoons. &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s have been known to capture and eat silkstrider larvae.\nThe main silkstrider hub in Ardenweald is the &lt;a href=\"Gossamer%20Cliffs\"&gt;Gossamer Cliffs&lt;/a&gt;, which came under attack from &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn%20%28Ardenweald%29\"&gt;Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt; spriggans and &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"boggart\"&gt;boggart&lt;/a&gt; minions, putting a halt to production. The silkstriders' broodmother, &lt;a href=\"Ol%27%20Gertie\"&gt;Ol' Gertie&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by the boggart &lt;a href=\"Noisul%20of%20Many%20Faces\"&gt;Noisul of Many Faces&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s helped clear out the attackers and rescue the night fae caretakers to get the production up and running again. They also saved Gertie's larva, &lt;a href=\"Gertie%20Jr.\"&gt;Gertie Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, and brought her to the safety of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; for the sake of Ardenweald's future."}
